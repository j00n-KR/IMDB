0,Leofwine_draca,Soulless,4,16 May 2018,"Having endured no less than four of the interminable PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN movies, I had no stomach for sitting through yet another film based on a theme park attraction, yet when I saw TOMORROWLAND on TV I decided to give it a go. After all, the presence of the ever-charming George Clooney had to be a good thing, right? Actually, the answer is no. This is a cheap, superficial kind of film, an adventure fronted by kids in which the narrative seems to be made up of the stringing together of various genre tropes, all melded together with a big dollop of CGI. It looks nice, but I found it hollow in the extreme, lacking decent characterisation and any kind of depth whatsoever. Soulless, in other words.",Tomorrowland
1,SnoopyStyle,fundamental problem,6,9 February 2016,"Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) sabotages his father Eddie (Tim McGraw)'s work site. He's dismantling the NASA launch site and losing his job. She gets arrested and given a pin which transports to another world. Athena (Raffey Cassidy) is a robot who guides her to Frank Walker (George Clooney). Back in 1964 at the New York World Fair, Frank eagerly shows Nix (Hugh Laurie) his backpack and Athena picks him to join them in the other world.This is visually beautiful. The switch between worlds is amazingly done. I love that section of discovery. There is some fun chemistry between Clooney, Robertson and Cassidy. The action is exciting. The movie would work great if it doesn't some fundamental problems.Damon Lindelof and Brad Bird have created a world where the dreamers are being held back by everybody else. It reminds me of the rhetoric of makers and takers. It reminds me of Atlas Shrugged. It's a very badly simplify vision of reality. The movie could have fixed it by making it a dystopia alternate world. It should be a much darker world of war, famine, and destruction. Lindelof and Bird are trying to make a point about our modern world but the point is off. Damon Lindelof himself partakes in the dystopian fixation and humankind has always been fascinated with the concept. The apocalypse is not a recent invention.There is an opening ten minutes section where Clooney and Robertson are doing some kind of blog. It reveals Clooney's backstory and introduces the other world. That should be eliminated and Clooney can tell her about his story after she meets him at his house. Robertson's discovery of the pin and the other world would be even more wonderous.",Tomorrowland
2,Prismark10,No triumph over hope here,3,9 February 2016,"Tomorrowland never really takes off and is jarring from the beginning. Director Brad Bird displayed a sure footing in his live action debut, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol which is missing in Tomorrowland.The film begin with a clumsy introduction by George Clooney (Frank) where we flashback to the 1964 World's Fair when as a wide eyed optimistic boy genius he entered a jetpac into competition and first encountered Athena a girl who he fell for only to discover later that she was a robot.In the present Frank is is resentful and disillusioned. He was kicked out of Tomorrowland as he realised the world was destined to end with no way to change it. In the meantime Athena is still plucking out people who can make a difference by form of a small pin which takes them to another dimension. One of them is Britt Robertson (Casey) a clever optimistic teenager who gets up to haphazard stuff in her spare time.Frank, Casey and Athena get together and go to Tomorrowland via the Eiffel Tower and realise that Casey could change the future for better.The film is clumsy and disjointed. Clooney is too glum which does not help. Casey also jars, she does not listen, she screeches, bickers and you never really root for her. We also have to believe that she is clever because she can break into NASA by way of a drone controlled by a smart-phone. I know toddlers who can control toys by smart-phones!The worse thing is despite the splash of great special effects here and there, the film is boring and just plods along. Hugh Laurie is just a one dimensional villain with cartoon henchmen, in once case Star Wars obsessed ones. The film lacks the sense of wonder, spectacle, dazzlement and fun.",Tomorrowland
3,claudio_carvalho,Beautiful Cinematography but Missing Explanation,7,28 February 2016,"""Tomorrowland"" is a sci-fi adventure film with a beautiful cinematography and good cast, highlighting the gorgeous and talented girl Raffey Cassidy. There is good action scenes and special effects. Unfortunately the story fails since does not provide explanation about Tomorrowland. Is it an alternate dimension or a distant planet? How is exactly the connection between Earth and Tomorrowland and how does it affect Earth? Unless the viewer researches Internet, he or she will not find the answer in the film. Maybe the intention is to make a prequel with the missing explanation. But anyway it is worthwhile watching. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Tomorrowland: Um Lugar Onde Nada é Impossível"" (""Tomorrowland: A Place Where Nothing Is Impossible"")",Tomorrowland
4,nogodnomasters,LET'S GO FIND OUT,8,23 May 2019,"This is one of those kid (s) save the world film where a girl is the hero/role model. There was an outcry for more positive female role models, and Hollywood appears to have responded, if not over responded.Most reviews of this film avoid talking about the plot, as most adults don't know exactly what is going on as the story is a bit confused, especially when tachyon time travel viewing is involved. Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) a bright teen girl who likes science (no talking ""math is hard"" Barbies allowed). She gets it and cares. She is inundated with the doom and gloom messages of global disaster and wants to ""fix it"" unlike most of the apathetic planet who want to market the concept. She meets Athena (Raffey Cassidy) a time and dimension traveling android who has her team with inventor Frank Walker (George Clooney) to save the world.The film could be said to have a liberal bias, but blames humanity as a whole for not acting, without specifically mentioning climate deniers. It was apparent who they were talking about without mentioning their name. Warning: The film might be inspiration and a call to action for your youngster who might believe they can make a difference.The film had great special effects, but has heavy parts when it gets bogged down with the message.",Tomorrowland
5,kosmasp,It's a new Tomorrow,8,11 July 2015,"I have to admit I am a bit surprised this didn't do well at the Box Office. It is a weird little movie, but it does have the star power and it is accessible to children. But while George Clooney has a lot of fun and can bring out his inner kid, the real stars are the two young kids in the main roles. I don't know how long the casting process went, but they did a great job selecting the actors for this.The movie and the flow of it might seem a bit weird, but apart from the general story there is a message here too. Maybe you don't like it, but the movie does more than a decent job portraying and giving us that message. It's fun and light, but has a couple of dark moments too. It's a great fantasy adventure set in the future (Science Fiction mixed in there) for the whole family. Hopefully this will find an audience on Home media/medium, it deserves it",Tomorrowland
6,jboothmillard,Tomorrowland: A World Beyond,6,7 November 2021,"Tomorrowland is one of the many themed lands featured in Magic Kingdom is Disney World, Florida, they turned it into a movie, which failed to make an impression at the box office, but is rated well by critics, so I watched it, directed by Brad Bird (The Iron Giant, The Incredibles, Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol). Basically, at the 1964 New York World's Fair, young Frank Walker (Thomas Robinson) attends to sell his prototype jet pack but is rejected as it does not work. Frank is approached by a young girl, Athena (Raffey Cassidy), who hands him an orange lapel pin with a blue ""T"" embossed on it, telling him to follow her onto Walt Disney's ""It's a Small World"" attraction at the Fair's Pepsi-Cola Pavilion. Frank obeys and sneaks onto the ride, where the pin is scanned by a laser, and he is transported to Tomorrowland, a futuristic cityscape, where advanced robots fix his jetpack, allowing him to fly and join the secretive world. In the present, adult Frank (George Clooney) passes the narration to the optimistic teenager Casey Newton (Britt Robertson), telling the story of how they met and all events thereafter. Casey repeatedly sabotages the planned demolition of a NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) launch site in Florida. Her father, Eddie (Tim McGraw), is a NASA engineer, but faces losing his job. Casey is eventually caught and arrested. At the police station, she finds a pin in her belongings. While touching the pin, it transports her to Tomorrowland. Her adventure is cut short when the pin's battery runs out. With help from her younger brother Nate (Pierce Gagnon), Casey finds a Houston memorabilia store related to the pin. She asks the owners Hugo (Keegan-Michael Key) and Ursula (Kathryn Hahn) for information about the pin, but they attack her when she does not tell them where she got the pin from, insisting that Casey knows about a ""little girl"". Athena bursts in and defeats the owners, revealed to be animatronics, who self-destruct, blowing up the shop. After Casey and Athena steal a car, Athena reveals she is an animatronic, designed to find and recruit people who fit the ideals of Tomorrowland. Athena drops Casey off at the adult Frank's house in Pittsfield, New York. The reclusive, cynical Frank declines Casey's request to take her to Tomorrowland, having been banished from it years ago. Inside Frank's house, Casey finds a countdown clock predicting the probability of the end of the world. Frank warns her that the future is doomed, but she disagrees. Animatronic assassins arrive to kill Casey, but she and Frank escape, meeting Athena in the woods outside Frank's house. Frank resents Athena for lying to him about her true nature, but reluctantly agrees to help them get to Tomorrowland. Using a teleportation device, the trio travel to the top of the Eiffel Tower. Frank explains that Gustave Eiffel, Jules Verne, Nikola Tesla, and Thomas Edison co-founded Plus Ultra, a secret society of futurists, creating Tomorrowland in another dimension, free to make scientific breakthroughs without obstruction. The trio use antique rocket the Spectacle, hidden beneath the Eiffel Tower, to travel to Tomorrowland. Upon arrival, they find Tomorrowland in a state of decay. Tomorrowland's governor David Nix (Hugh Laurie) greets them. They travel to a tachyon machine, invented by Frank, which accurately predicted the worldwide catastrophe. Casey refuses to accept the end of the world, causing the future to temporarily alter. While Frank attempts to convince Nix to listen, he refuses and wants the group to leave Tomorrowland. Casey realises the tachyon machine is telling humanity that the world will end, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. They confront Nix, who admits he tried to warn humanity by projecting such images to prevent the future, but they embraced the apocalypse, refusing to act to make a better future. Believing that humanity simply gave up, Nix has also given up and intends to allow the apocalypse to happen. Casey, Frank, and Athena attempt to use a bomb to destroy the machine, leading to a fight with Nix. The bomb is accidentally thrown through a portal to an uninhabited island on Earth, the explosion pinning Nix's leg. Athena sees a vision of the future where Frank is shot by Nix, and she jumps in the path of this attack, mortally wounding herself. Making peace with Frank, Athena activates her self-destruct sequence, destroying the machine which falls on Nix, killing him. In the present, Casey and Frank become leaders of Tomorrowland, recruiting Eddie and Nate, and sending recruitment animatronics to give pins to recruit new dreamers and thinkers for Tomorrowland. Also starring Chris Bauer as Frank's Dad and Judy Greer as Jenny Newton. Robertson is amiable as the inquisitive science buff, Clooney is likeable as the gruff inventor, Laurie in a pivotal role is good, and Cassidy steals many scenes as the snappy child android. The story has its complications, with time travel, environmental issues, and philosophy at the forefront, but for its retro-cool style, wonderful eye-catching set pieces, action-packed scenes, and spectacular special effects to bring futuristic technology to life, it is a watchable science-fiction adventure. Good!",Tomorrowland
7,blanche-2,Timely,8,29 March 2017,"Given recent social media and news reports about the state of our nation, I found ""Tomorrowland"" not only timely but very positive.Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) is a brilliant, inquisitive young girl who wants to travel in space. She's discouraged by her dad, a NASA worker, because NASA is closing. When she climbs a few fences and makes her way into the Cape Canaveral Launch Center to sabotage equipment and keep it from closing, she's arrested.Upon the return of her personal effects, Casey finds a pin that isn't hers. She touches it, and suddenly, she's in a city of the future. This leads her on quite an adventure, which includes meeting a robot, Athena (Raffey Cassidy), who thinks Casey can help save the future. She brings Casey to meet Frank Walker (George Clooney), who has given up his life's project. As a former child inventor, he had worked to learn the secrets of a place somewhere in time and space that exists in collective memory.I hate to say it but I think this film was maybe too esoteric for the special effects audience. This is a version in a way of Ayn Rand's ""Atlas Shrugged"" and also deals with quantum physics. Wonderful, fascinating movie, with incredible special effects and yes, the theme of optimism versus pessimism, summed up in a speech by Nix (Hugh Laurie) that you could read anywhere today. And the message is clear: If you buy into a bad future, you can't change it.",Tomorrowland
8,tavm,I liked Disney's Tomorrowland enough for what it is...,7,27 May 2015,"Okay, after reading many of the reviews of this movie on this site-many of them on the negative side-here's mine: It was mostly quite thrilling and touching and a little thoughtful and occasionally humorous and it was awesome seeing it on an IMAX screen! Perhaps it was a little long for a family film but, still, I think many kids would be a little enthralled in this with the way director Brad Bird movies things along most of the time. George Clooney and Hugh Laurie perform well in their roles and that girl robot and teen girl also were pretty good, character-wise. I suppose I have to admit that the story took awhile to get together but when it ended, I sorta thought it made enough sense by that point. But I don't blame anyone who wasn't too thrilled by this movie not getting it. So on that note, Tomorrowland is at the least, worth a look.",Tomorrowland
9,Theo Robertson,What's Up With Disney ?,5,25 May 2015,"What's up with Disney these days ? I think the first film I remember seeing at the cine was 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA . If you have someone waging a one man war against humanity while taking on a giant squid it does tend to sticjk out in the young and vivid memory , The last Disney film I saw was the recent version of Cinderella which didn't impress me much and TOMORROWLAND continues in the same veinEffectively TOMORROWLAND is a run around featuring a young teen trying to find an important figure who has a secret invention and there's dangerous obstacles in the way . It's moderately successful in what it does but unfortunately like Cinderella it suffers heavily from an intrusive musical score that literally batters the audience over the head and tries to tell how they should be feeling in each and every scene . Again it counters the fundamentals of storytelling in ""Show don't tell"" and when you've got the soundtrack trying to elicit emotion out of the audience this has to be seen as a major blunder The cast are a mixed bunch . Despite having well known faces like George Clooney and Hugh Laurie it's the young cast who carry the story . Britt Robertson makes an okay heroine but isn't much more than okay and I'm afraid Reffey assidy is rather irritating . In fact the whole film is rather irritating and it's a shame the Disney Studio hasn't come out with better films recently",Tomorrowland

Armageddon if there are not enough ""Optimists"" left to spend $100 or $200 per person per day for Admission, TOMORROWLAND teaches us. This flick reveals the fact that off-shore miscreants are pumping America full of malign influences taking the form of vicious video games, malicious movies, and negative social networks. The future that Walt Disney himself predicted for the U.S. at the 1964 New York World's Fair has fallen victim to the self-fulfilling prophecies of obscene profits piped in by these non-native Nattering Nabobs of Negativity. TOMORROWLAND proves that in the 1960s, Americans were on the verge of Living Large like the JETSONS, but now in reality we are fractiously flailing around as if we're in the world of the FLINTSTONES. If every True American bought at least the $19.99 version of the TOMORROWLAND pin, and wore it proudly, that would separate the Servants of Good from the minions in thrall to the Dystopian future with which Sony Corporation is trying to brainwash us.

13,neil-476,"Somewhat muddled, but a star is born",7,29 May 2015,"We are introduced to two people trying to make a home movie about impending world disaster: one is George Clooney (playing Frank) and the other is a girl off-camera. Then we see some of Frank as a boy going to the World's Fair as a precocious inventor, meeting po-faced judge Hugh Laurie, and being introduced by young girl Athena to a high-tech future world. Then we switch to the home movie girl, Casey, and her misadventures after she is given a T button which give her interactive visions of a future world. Unfortunately, bad robots are seeking to catch her and, possibly, kill her, until Athena appears and saves her. It turns out the world is in danger, and Casey is possibly the only person who can save it, but she needs the help of Frank who, as an adult, is a bitter hermit because things turned out badly for him.The trailer for this Brad Bird movie was great, and I enjoyed the film despite being very aware of its flaws: the main ones are that the plot is rather muddled, quite preachy, and somewhat ploddy in places: far more work was needed on the script in order to tighten the story up and make it more accessible.Hugh Laurie's character is an odd one – villain or not? - which goes some way towards giving the film its uneven tone. George Clooney, after the introductory sequence, then disappears for an hour or so before reappearing in order to play a bad-tempered curmudgeon, and the film is given to Britt Robertson to carry through its first half as feisty Casey. She does perfectly well but, for me, the film belonged to Raffey Cassidy who, at 12 years old, commanded the screen throughout the time she was on it as Athena. This girl is going to go on and do great things on film.Oh, and the eye candy was well executed.This film isn't bad, but its ambitions exceeded its ability to achieve them.",Tomorrowland
14,morrison-dylan-fan,Welcome to the world of tomorrow!,6,29 September 2020,"Having gotten Disney+ for free for 6 months thanks to my phone company,I decided to look for more overlooked titles. Only having heard about the film in relation to it being a flop at the box office and a Brad Bird credit,I got set to escape to tomorrow.View on the film:Soaring onto the screen a project he had turned down directing Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015-also reviewed) in order to make, co-writer/ (with Damon Lindelof and Jeff Jensen) director Brad Bird & Life of Pi (2012-also reviewed) cinematographer Claudio Miranda ignite a Adventure movie atmosphere with a opening tribute to The Rocketeer (1991-also reviewed) that powers up outstanding special effects which seamlessly crosses Newton (played by a plucky Britt Robertson) between the real world and Tomorrowland at her fingertips.Flying between the gadget thrills of his Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol (2011-also reviewed) and the retro Sci-Fi of The Iron Giant (1999) Bird fills every corner of the screen with loving tributes to Sci-Fi flicks/characters,from Star Wars merch covering the store Newton visits to learn more about the Tomorrowland badge, to a ""Stargate"" being at the centre of the land, sparked in stylish 5 minute long one-take tracking shots gazing at the futuristic world.Keeping the head of Tomorrowland (played by a wonderfully hammy Hugh Laurie) chewing the Stargate scenery, Bird intelligently plays round the PG rating with the decision to make most of the baddies robots, allowing for explosive beat-downs that swing beheaded robots across the screen.Starting with a timer that pays tribute to his work on ""Lost"", the fingerprints of bumbling co-writer hack Damon Lindelof runs close to damaging all that Bird makes work on screen, with the ""Mystery Box"" of how to enter Tomorrowland (from it clearly being set-up of having to stay in the real world) being illogically changed with a flick of a switch that offers no answers.Lecturing at the audience a environmental message that stops the Sci-Fi dead in its tracks, (Lindelof can't do subtle) Lindelof shuts the enticing exploration of Tomorrowland's futurism with a dire ""across the world"" final undermining the challenges faced by the leads to enter the location, which is all neatly tied in a romance between George Clooney and a robot who looks 12 years old in the world of tomorrow.",Tomorrowland

Hugh Laurie plays the political leader in Tomorrowland.This is a Disney production that cost a whopping $190 million with another $140 million tacked on for marketing.

To be expected by the presence of a teen and a girl as the protagonists, the target audience seems to be pubescents and adolescents, but there's just as much for adults to enjoy with Clooney and Laurie, not to mention elements of Star Trek (the future, androids, robots, etc.) and the Terminator films (ditto). There are several thrilling action sequences with the unexpected one in the shop being my favorite.The opening is a little convoluted and the action sequence with the boy, his jet-pack and the robots in Tomorrowland takes you out of the realm of quasi-realism and into cartoonish fantasy. This turned me off and I was tempted to tune out but, thankfully, the tone quickly turned more reasonable and the story perked up with the focus on Casey (Robertson) and Athena (the girl).

16,zetes,"I guess I'm alone, but I loved this! Amazing and imaginative!",9,14 June 2015,"One of those movies where I'm thinking the whole time, ""Man, is everyone else absolutely insane? This is great!"" It was very similar to another live action Disney movie of recent years, The Lone Ranger. I'm not sure what other movie people are seeing, but this is a highly inventive, interesting, fun, smart movie. It has its flaws, for sure, but they're rather minor. Its big problem is that its so ambitious it can't wrap it all up in a 2 hour package without being slightly disappointing. We really don't get to see enough of Tomorrowland. The film follows teenager Britt Robertson, a smart kid who is interested in science and has positive views of the future. She is chosen by a visitor from Tomorrowland (Raffey Cassidy) to experience the wonders of her home. This wraps Robertson up in a strange conspiracy, where she is eventually led to loner George Clooney so she can learn the truth. Much of the film is a chase sequence, with Clooney, Robertson and Raffey running from robots trying to hunt them. The film has a positive message and absolutely wonderful special effects and production design. The main reason I was interested was the retro-future look from the 1950s/60s, and you get a lot of cool stuff to look at (this is the rare film where I might think seeing it in 3D would be cool, particularly the introductions to Tomorrowland). In addition to the three actors mentioned above, Hugh Laurie plays the villain (well, it is a Disney film, there has to be a villain). Keegan Michael-Key and Kathryn Hahn have an amusing appearance early in the film, and I loved Matthew MacCaull as the robot with the creepy smile. The script (co-written, along with Brad Bird, by one of the internet's most hated people, Damon Lindelof) is far from perfect, but there's a lot to love here.",Tomorrowland

I just don't like kid movies. And the first half hour I was certainly not convinced I was going to make it until the end. That kid Britt Robertson, I can't help it but I just don't like her. She's not credible in her role and not really good either. Raffey Cassidy on the other hand put down a good performance. George Clooney and Hugh Laurie have nothing to prove anymore.

From the very first scene with Clooney's caustic intro, questions are raised, and more questions (and some buildup thrown in for good measure), but we don't actually get to Tomorrowland until a good 90 minutes in; and even then, it's just to set us down and deliver the film's moral (my god is it heavy-handed). It's that tiresome ""mystery box"" screen writing that's the biggest pain. No one can deny this movie looks expensive, but it's also bloated and preachy to excess.The thing that really bothered me is that (despite the name listed as director) it doesn't feel at all like a Brad Bird movie.And that is a crime.4/10",Tomorrowland

Though stunning to look at & made with passion, this recent box-office dud, falls short in its Writing department.

The first-hour 20-minutes, especially, are wow. But, soon after, the pace drops. The energy drops. And sadly enough, it never pushes up. Damon Lindelof & Bird's Screenplay is below the mark. While the premise is brilliant, the story however doesn't translate into a big-scale adventure. The second-hour is not engaging, while the climax also looks hurried. A much stronger Screenplay was most definitely needed! Bird's Direction is dreamlike & highly stylish (The Graphics are mind-blowing too), but his own Writing puts him down after a point. Claudio Miranda's Cinematography is faultless. Walter Murch & Craig Wood's Editing is fine. Michael Giacchino's Score is impressive, as always. Production Design is top-class. Performance-Wise: George Clooney is excellent. Even though the Icon has less screen-time in the first-hour, he takes charge later. Britt Robertson is competent, as well. Raffey Cassidy is first-rate.

21,StevePulaski,To put it optimistically...,7,24 May 2015,"Disney's ""Tomorrowland"" may be a hot mess of ideas and ambition, but it's bound to inspire something in many viewers that few films today do, and that's visual wonder and imagination without a direct assault on the senses. A few weeks back, I saw ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" but the special effects on display in that particular film were used to show a gaggle of superheros waging complete war through cityscapes, making for quite the visual and auditory annihilation. ""Tomorrowland"" uses its incredible special effects to inspire that complex inside of us that finds itself neglected far too often.The film opens in the early 1960's with a young Frank Walker (Thomas Robinson) attending the New York World's Fair, meeting famous inventor David Nix (Hugh Laurie). Frank has worked to build a jet pack all by himself, though is condemned by Nix for making something that doesn't pose any kind of value for societal improvement. Following his rejection, he meets a young girl named Athena (Raffey Cassidy), who gives him a pin with a ""T"" symbol. Whomever holds this pin is transported to an alternate world known as ""Tomorrowland,"" where all the world's creators, inventors, artists, and geniuses can live free and build whatever they want, unfazed by political/societal restrictions.Fast-forward years later and we focus on Casey Newton (Britt Robertson), a teen girl who is arrested for breaking into a NASA compound in act of sabotage to benefit her father, who works there. Upon release, Casey obtains this ""T"" pin and finds herself transported to this fantastical world. Upon further research, which results in a very close call with two collectors, Casey winds up meeting Athena, who informs her of the powers that the pin possesses. They wind up reconnecting with Frank (George Clooney) in the present day, who is preparing for world's end and now bears a cynical attitude after repeated shortcomings and lack of support. Together, the three try to prevent the seemingly imminent world's end as well as rebuild Tomorrowland into what it once was after its downfall.""Tomorrowland,"" as a whole, is just as scattershot as it sounds. Co-writer/director Brad Bird (""The Incredibles,"" ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"") knows what he wants to accomplish on a visual level, and for that, the aesthetic grandeur can occasionally mask the coherency of the storytelling. Bird and co-writers Damon Lindelof (""Prometheus,"" which explains quite a bit) and Jeffrey Chernov work to predicate the first hour and a half of the film on mystery, catering to your desire to learn more about the fantastical world before you. It isn't until they try and wrap everything up in the end where things get a bit shaky.However, your overall response to ""Tomorrowland"" will be dependent on which lens you want to view it through. If you become too hung up on the film's attempts to summarize its world towards the end, you begin to view the film with a pessimistic mindset. If you allow yourself to get lost in the world Bird and company create, admire the visuals, and take in everything that you're handed from the perspective of enjoying an adventure, then, in turn, you view the film optimistically. I break the reception down this way because ""Tomorrowland"" not only caters to the spirit of cinema we don't see enough of today, but it also reminds us that, when it comes to fantasy films, there are generally two ways to view such films and one of those ways is more fun.",Tomorrowland
22,Hellmant,"Definitely a let down, if you're a fan of Brad Bird or Damon Lindelof!",8,3 June 2015,"'TOMORROWLAND': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new sci-fi adventure flick from director/writer Brad Bird, and writer Damon Lindelof. It was inspired by Disney's futuristic themed land, of the same name, and tells the story of a teenage genius, that teams up with a former boy-genius, to save the world. They enter a futuristic city, called 'Tomorrowland', in order to do so. Bird directed the film and co-wrote it; with Lindelof and Jeff Jensen. It stars George Clooney, Britt Robertson, Raffey Cassidy and Hugh Laurie. The movie received mixed reviews from critics and bombed at the Box Office. I also have mixed feelings about the film, but I still enjoyed it.Clooney plays a disillusioned genius inventor named Frank Walker. As a child, in 1964, he met a young girl, named Athena (Cassidy), who invited him to enter a futuristic society of geniuses, called 'Tomorrowland'. He lived there for several years, until he was kicked out. Robertson plays a teen science expert, in modern day, named Casey Newton. Casey is also invited to enter the secret world, by Athena, but against the secret society's wishes. She later meets Frank, and the two realize they must team together, to save the world; by returning to 'Tomorrowland'.The movie is full of spectacular visuals and has a good, positive message, about life, and the world, for kids. Bird is known for directing, and writing (or co-writing), some amazing science fiction kids' films (like 'THE INCREDIBLES' and 'THE IRON GIANT'); I'm sorry to say that this adventure flick, doesn't quite live up to them. Even with the help of Lindelof (who's an amazingly creative sci-fi writer as well), the movie gets bogged down in overblown special effects, and it loses any impressive creativity, or originality, it possibly had going for it. The film definitely doesn't have the magical wit, or charm, that makes Bird's previous movies so memorable. With that said, it's still a decent kids' film; it's just a let down, if you're a fan of Brad Bird or Damon Lindelof.Watch our movie review show at: https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=zfYb1KqmKxo",Tomorrowland
23,thesar-2,Tomorrow Has Died,3,29 November 2015,"Oy vey, what an unnecessarily long and charmless film that otherwise could've been an inventive, creative and fun movie.Tomorrowland seriously didn't know what it wanted to be. A kid's adventure film for the whole family or an adult Sci-Fi movie not meant for kids. This movie was all over the place at all times with so many different tones and ideas, never once grounded or focused. It reminded me a ton of Jupiter Ascendingand that's not a compliment.I guess the basic gist is a girl is recruited to be ""The One"" to save an alternate universe that has secrets both good and bad, but she rarely, if at all, shows she's even remotely useful. Heck, most of the time she's annoying and gets in the way.The plot, as stated, is a complete mess, and Clooney – one of my all- time favorites – lost all charisma and looked 93 years old, but probably worse than those was the fact the Editor took the entire shoot off. It felt like a much better 90 minute movie stretched to 130 minutes. This movie would never end and never knew when last call was.I haven't seen the middle Disneyland-attraction movie, The Haunted Mansion, but loved (ONLY) the original Pirates of the Caribbean. From what I've heard about Haunted and now this throwaway, Disney really needs to lose the ego.",Tomorrowland

27,ThomasDrufke,The Future Has Arrived,5,22 May 2015,"Sci-Fi is a genre of two opinions and two opinions only. You pretty much either love a Sci-Fi film or you hate on it repeatedly. It's very rare to fall in the middle of the two, it's just that polarizing of a genre. But it just so happens that I feel as though Tomorrowland is a film that does fall in the middle. On the one hand, it's a visually stunning film that doesn't rely on mind-blowing effects or spectacle. But on the other hand, there just wasn't a great story to back up the visuals. The message the film gives us is clear and I'm sure it will be inspiring to a lot of people, but the reality is a film isn't good because of what it tells us to feel, it's whether or not it gets us to feel that way.Britt Robertson stars alongside George Clooney as two people with very similar objectives in their hope to save humanity, but the ladder's heart is shattered and his hope for people has gone to the gutter. It's only when the two meet does his faith in a new beginning truly start. But they both take a back seat to Raffy Cassidy's Athena, who is pretty much a cross between the T-1000 and Hit-Girl. A badas* with brains, well a robot's brains. I really liked her scenes early on with young Frank and even her first scenes with Casey, but it's actually when all three characters are together that the film starts to fall apart. The film sold itself in the trailer as a mysterious new adventure like we have never seen before. But the coolest part of the trailer, Casey touching the pin to transport her to Tomorrowland, is only a brief segment. I understand it's hard to market a film that's shrouded with secrecy, but I just felt a little bit duped. We're only in Tomorrowland for 15 minutes or so, and I never felt the oohs and awes like the trailers suggested.That's not to say that there aren't great things about the film, there definitely are. But in my opinion, the film just doesn't bring anything new to the table. I saw in a review that ""Tomorrowland contains ideas from yesterday's Sci-Fi"" or something along those lines. And that's true, it's a predictable tale about us needing to clean up our act, wake up, and do something about the world coming to an end. But we have seen this same theme beaten to death in Sci-Fi after Sci-Fi. Look, when we get to Tomorrowland in the film it's absolutely gorgeous. Even though some of the outfits and ideas could be rehashed, the actual look of Tomorrowland felt fresh. But the film around it wasn't. But it was one of those movies that the longer the film goes, and the more you think about after, you dislike it increasingly. The last act of the film reveals a clichéd villain and plenty of emotional moments that end up falling short. Brad Bird can no doubt direct a film though. And you can definitely tell by watching the film that he loves Terminator and Star Wars. I just feel like he got caught up in trying to send a message to the audience rather than slipping the message in a beautiful and well put together story.+Athena +Visually striking moments +Character dynamics with Clooney-Film's message is shoved down your throat-Trailer moments are barely noticeable in the film -Rehashed ideas 5.6/10",Tomorrowland
28,cricketbat,Spends too much time creating questions and not enough time giving answers,4,23 November 2018,"The problem with Tomorrowland is that it spends too much time creating questions and not enough time giving answers.

29,lesleyharris30,"Expected more from Bird, Clooney and Disney,",5,26 January 2016,"Tomorrowland is a very mediocre movie with a poorly developed storyline, although it features a talented and charismatic cast. It certainly has its moments, the effects are beautiful and there's a nice Disney vibe to it all, the highlight of the entire movie would without a doubt be the chemistry between George Clooney and Britt Robertson, who clearly enjoyed working together, it's just a pity they could not have done a better movie. The plot is a complete mess, it jumps around from different characters too often and does not have a real lead role, it spends the first half with Clooney and Robertson giving ""back story"", but in reality we are wasting a lot of time learning very little about the characters, all we really know about Frank before the adventure begins is that he's an inventor who has a negative relationship with his dad, as for Casey, we know she's a mischievous young girl with a positive family relationship, that's pretty much it. The film never really gets exciting, every scene seems to just go through the motions and never feels truly dedicated in telling a unique story, also the ""big villain reveal"" is the most obvious, cringe worthy moment that trying to make it feel like a twist just makes it seem like the studio think we're idiots, especially since there's only four real characters. It may have stunning effects, but Tomorowland is an unexciting film with a poor story and, worse of all, weak character development, I wouldn't recommend it. An unlikely duo set off to find a place that only truly exists in their memories. Best Performance: George Clooney",Tomorrowland
30,A_Different_Drummer,Well worth recommending...,8,13 June 2015,"Aside from a few scenes that seem out of place, and some bizarre edits which should never have made it to the final cut, this is a surprisingly complex film but also a very consistently entertaining one.The high points (to this reviewer at least) 1. There is an ongoing 'inside joke"" in the script about the ""pin"" being part of a commercial or an advertisement which was cancelled. Although this is part of the plot it is also true that the name of the film -- TOMORROWLAND -- is itself a giant ad for the Disney machine, and, lest we forget, Disney is a mega-corporation, one of the largest on the planet, one of the largest in history, and it does nothing by accident.2. Clooney is very brave to play essentially the ""oldest small boy"" on the planet, a trope that brings back memories of Robin Williams in Jumanji (itself a really great film, if you have not seen it FIND A COPY NOW). To his credit, and considering he is doing dramatic scenes against a girl half his age -- who usually plays ""younger"" because of her size -- he pulls it off nicely.3. The opening, the pace, the sense of discovery, reminded me of ESCAPE FROM WITCH MOUNTAIN which, no coincidence, was also a Disney production.4. Cannot do a proper review of this film without talking about Britt Robertson. I have reviewed other films she has appeared in and what all her performances have in common is that they work. She sells it and she holds the camera. There is also something of the chameleon about her, as though at will she can change from a plain-looking secondary character to a stunning leading lady. She has a serious career ahead.5. Also cannot do a proper review without mentioning Brad Bird. Check his bio. This guy is the Elon Musk of fantasy writing. His credit alone would be reason to see this film regardless of this review, or any other.A bit long, some scenes seem not to belong, but overall a film well worth recommending. I suspect it will also prove to be one of those films which does better on second viewing when expectations are lower and the viewer simply wants a good time.",Tomorrowland

This wasn't what I expected, but that's not to say it was bad. I really enjoyed this quite a bit. I was expecting a really entertaining sci-fy type movie for the family to watch. What this is is a ""save the world"" type movie. This was something that I enjoyed and do recommend but it was almost a little too, humans are destroying the planet and not caring, more than a movie. I know that is basically what is happening but rather then entertaining me it made me feel like I was being guilted into changing.

33,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews....,6,16 October 2015,"TomorrowlandWalt Disney was an idealistic man who envisioned the not too distant future as a technologically advanced utopia where the white race reigned supreme.Luckily for any minorities in this sci-fi movie, his paradise didn't quite go as planned.When a prepubescent android (Raffey Cassidy) presents Casey (Britt Robertson) with a pin that temporarily transports her to a science based Shangri-La in a neighboring dimension, she yearns to return.However, the only way to do that is to partner with an exiled resident (George Clooney).With his know-how, Casey not only gets back but also learns from Tomorrowland's erudite leader (Hugh Laurie) that her reality is in peril.Imaginative and ambition, this adaptation of the Disney theme park ride doesn't skimp on special effects. But while it is visually appealing, its cautionary screenplay is more akin to an ecological guilt-trip. Incidentally, Utopian societies designed by scientists have absolutely no churches.

34,851222,Disappointing,6,3 October 2015,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Tomorrowland"" (2015) is a disappointing movie in my opinion. The concept is good actually, and first like ~15 min are promising (although a bit cheeze ""Disney style""). The acting by young Raffey Cassidy who plays Athena is amazing, she is very natural, but everyone else just got here clearly for a paycheck and everything else in this movie isn't that good. Special effects are uninspiring, storytelling is messy, and story after first 15 min. isn't interesting, although movie doesn't drag until the end surprisingly, it is kinda fun to watch. The sad part that by the end i wasn't really cared how it will end, who Hugh Laurie's character was (he doesn't age i guess), or what was really going on. The ending is kinda flat also.Overall, ""Tomorrowland"" is a very mixed bag. It is kinda original, and altogether very predictable and cheeze. Acting wasn't very good with one exception. The story is a mixed bag as well, but its not a bad movie neither, it is kinda fun to watch, but at the end it doesn't really leads to anything new, and the message of this movie is way to cheeze and old and predictable. You won't loose anything if skip this movie.",Tomorrowland
35,tabuno,A Breath Taking Vision of the Future,8,14 January 2019,"31 May 2015. It's hard to speculate whether like Avatar (2009) the novelty of the fresh new look of a movie has a lot to do with a movie's popularity or rating. In Tomorrowland there is both the initial nostalgic retro-feel of a glorified past 50s at the New York World's Fair which I did attend as a child and the fantastic images of a future that really never gets the brilliant and spectacular vision of hope and optimism. Unlike the sci fi classic Blade Runner (1982) and its dark vision of Los Angeles, Tomorrowland presents a different look. It's a look that is so enticingly omitted at the end of The Day Time Ended (1979) a rather mediocre sci fi movie that involves time travel.This family Disney sci fi adventure has a family connection element, a children's element, and except for some deadly live action scenes that seems out of character for a family Disney movie, this entertaining and emotionally appealing movie captures a step above the ordinary sci fi movie. Unlike Orson Scott Card's Enders Game (2013) there is more a personal, relational dynamic that plays with fate, destiny, and imagination of the innocent, wondrous, special type.",Tomorrowland
36,ironhorse_iv,"This movie had a great visual splendor of the future. I just wish, the writing was a little better. It fed the wrong wolf.",7,27 May 2015,"Indeed, the future has arrived, in the form of director Brad Bird's Tomorrowland. Unlike 2003's Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl, Tomorrowland wasn't based on a Walt Disney's theme park ride, but rather inspired by a region of Disneyland/Disney World, known for its numerous attractions that depict views of the future. Brad Bird takes the concept, even further, by adding the concept of the World Fairs of yesteryears to create an area with unusually advanced technology between time and space, where scientists and inventors can create an advance civilization, without intervention of the ignorant masses. While, this Brad Bird's visual soars high with ambition and creativity, it also does make you question, how the mechanics and the logic of this world, works. It's not precisely clear. I find it, funny and odd that an area with unusually advanced technology, would create, a very dangerous virtual simulation pin that allow people to see what Tomorrowland looks like, without truly going there. What a hazardous way to recruit people! Anyways, as we find out, Tomorrowland isn't the future Earth, but an Alter-Earth in a different dimension, running at the same time as Earth Prime. If a bunch of super-geniuses could build an advance city, in a Technocracy type society; why wouldn't they use their advance technology, to save Earth Prime from their dogmatic fate, move them to another world or ever better, conquer the original Earth. The movie doesn't give a good reason, why the smart characters couldn't, do that. It's just says, that the majority of people have become, so cynical due to ""dystopian chic"" type entertainment and paranoia doomday like news, that they don't care, if they live or die. I hate that the movie makes it seem like most people are just ignorant and self-destructiveness. It doesn't make absolutely no sense, since some infamously self-destructive, yet endlessly creative people were indeed Scientists. While, I like Governor Nix's (Hugh Laurie) speech about how he attempt to warn the world about its pending destruction. I found the whole cataclysm prediction machine driven plot, that the main character, a former boy-genius, Frank Walker (George Clooney) has invented, very confusing and one-sided. Yes, the Monitor machine could brainwash people, into giving up, but the movie clearly shown that people on Earth, haven't stop, from trying to prevent doom-day like scenarios, since 1984. I really doubt, the world is 100% pessimistic. If anything, the environment and social reform and awareness has increase. I find, the whole idea that only one optimism young teenager, Casey Newton (Britt Robertson), can change the two world's fates, pretty weak. I know the movie wants to turn a new generation of young people into the glories of intellectual curiosity and good old-fashioned optimism, but the cliché self-fulfilling prophecy, plot line makes it seem like least of a team effect, and more like recruiting somebody for the messiah type mantle. Very, non-science-like. Honestly, what happen to the other Plus Ultra scientists?! Why are they, not helping Frank or Casey, solve this problem? Where is the quick exposition on why, they can't help, the main heroes? Come on, you can do, better than that, Brad Bird. I really didn't like the marketing for this film. While, it's seem like Britt Robertson might be the main character of this film, in the trailer. For the most part, in the film, it's about George Clooney's character. George Clooney pretty much, mugs the whole movie and the movie posters that came with it. He's not bad, in the film, but he's clearly not, putting his all, in it, as well. By far, the greatest acting in the film, has to go with Raffey Cassidy's Athena. She really puts out, a well-rounded emotional journey for us. Raffey Cassidy nearly steals the whole film from the main leads. Although the film delivers in remarkable visuals, great music, alright acting, somewhat funny humor, and electrifying action sequences; the unnecessarily convoluted plot, with the heavy-handed preachy messages make for an ultimately underwhelming disappointing experience. Another problem of the film, is the pacing. I hate how the movie is interrupted by flashbacks and different retellings from other characters. I dislike, how long, it takes everyone to make their way back to Tomorrowland. One more problem with the movie, is how double standard, the production company is. It is very hypocrisy for Walt Disney Pictures to motivating creativity and originality in a film, when they, themselves have fought against the fair use movement for years, now. Honestly, it's hard to be, creative, when Disney own most of society's media sources and serve a harsh Orwellism type censorship, when you go up against them. Just think about it, how are you, supposed to teach people about Literature, if you have to pay Disney, a small fortune, just to retelling classic stories to a new generation. It's jarring. The movie feels more consumerism, when you see how many Disney-related brands/products are featured, in this film. It feels like a commercial, at times. While, the movie is indeed PG. There are some disturbingly casual violence, and mindless innocent people getting kill, that parents need to know, of. Some scenes might be a little too upsetting for children. For adults, it might seem, abnormal. A prequel novel, Before Tomorrowland was released in April 2015. In my opinion, while, I didn't read it, that prequel sound a little better than this movie plot. I kinda wish, they use that, instead of this complexity. Overall: Tomorrowland had potential of being a very smart good film. It just have some things that it could work on, better. I still do recommended watching.",Tomorrowland
37,The-Sarkologist,Why on earth did I watch this movie?,2,29 May 2015,"I really have no idea why I went and actually wasted my time watching this movie. I first learnt about it when a friend posted a trailer on Facebook saying that it looked cool (actually I think the word was 'awesome'), and when I watched the trailer my impression was: yeah, not really. Yet for some reason I still wanted to go and see it, despite that part of me knowing that it was going to be dull and boring. It turned out it even worse than that, to the point that I ended up falling asleep, and no matter how hard I tried I simply could not wake up. It was almost as if I really wanted this to end because I was not enjoying it at all.That is not to say that the premise didn't have potential – it did, and a lot of it. It is just that Disney was the one who produced it and it ended up coming out with what you would expect to be your typical, everyday, Disney rubbish. In fact if anything it is one long add for Disneyland. Tomorrowland is actually a section of the theme park, and as well as that they even threw in It's A Small World, one of the rides in Fantasyland (and don't get me wrong, my brother loves Disneyland, but that doesn't let them off the hook for wasting my time with this film).Anyway, Tomorrowland is about this alternate dimension that all of the smart and imaginative people visit to invent and to create. However, this one really smart guy goes there and ends up creating this machine that can predict the future, and what this machine does is that it predicts that the world is going to end, so they kick him out. However that does not stop the machine because it ends up destroying Tomorrowland and the pessimism of this machine filters into our world causing everybody to give up hope.However, not surprisingly, there is this really smart and optimistic girl who knows that there is hope, so a robot gives her this badge which reveals Tomorrowland to her. The robot then takes her to the guy who invented the machine and together that travel to Tomorrowland to destroy it. However, most of the film is them trying to get to Tomorrowland, and when they arrive they simply hobnob with the bad guy, almost get kicked out again, and then turn the tables on him and save the day. In the end it is typical Disney rubbish, and if you are wanting a family movie to take the kids I would suggest you save your money and wait for Minions.",Tomorrowland

When I watched the trailer I expected a Sci-Fi movie but not like this. The only explanation was that ""Tomorrowland"" is a Walt Disney movie and that's why was so futuristic and came into exaggeration.I liked this movie but I expected to like it even more. First I will start with the things that I found a bit annoying and after I will say what I liked. To begin with I believe that movie does not make a good explanation about what is going on and the viewer has to figure it out be himself. Another thing that I did not like was the visual effects that were used which I found too much and unnecessary to exist. On the other hand there were some good things in this movie which presented with a very good way. One of those was that you have to have faith, to believe at yourself and just dream. Because if we cannot dream then we are simply dead.Finally I think that ""Tomorrowland"" is not a bad movie but in my occasion I had more expectations from it. It's a good movie and I would recommend it to someone to watch it.",Tomorrowland
39,zkonedog,Great Adventure Piece Filled With Interesting Themes,6,27 February 2017,"When I first saw the trailer for ""Tomorrowland"", I was intrigued by the mysterious premise and the promise of adventure. It delivered on both accounts.For a basic plot summary, ""Tomorrowland"" tells the story of a number of different individuals who are introduced to the alternative-universe of Tomorrowland. A young Frank Walker (Thomas Robinson) just wants to be an inventor, and he is ushered into the strange new world by Athena (Raffey Cassidy). It seems like he has is entire, exciting life as an inventor planned out for him. Fast-forward a number of years and Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) is feeling stifled by a family life and school life that isn't challenging her enough. She stumbles across a pin that, when touched, transports her to Tomorrowland for short periods. Intrigued, Casey begins to investigate further, coming into contact with Athena herself and a sour, cynical, grown-up Frank (George Clooney). Casey and the gang are pursued by some shady forces too, proving that perhaps Tomorrowland isn't quite as angelic or benevolent as it may seem.The strongest facet of this film is that it simply is a great adventure piece. The characters are interesting enough to make you care, the visuals are spectacular (I'd recommend IMAX, as it truly was stunning), and the pacing is perfect. It's been quite some time since I've enjoyed a rollicking adventure like this without rolling my eyes.Another strong suit to ""Tomorrowland"" is that it contains enough futuristic themes to hook in more sophisticated viewers. Yes, it is made by Disney, and no, there isn't any questionable content, but this isn't a ""kids movie"" because, in all honesty, it deals with many of the same themes that ""Interstellar"" covered in its own more adult way. Simply put, ""Tomorrowland"" is the type of movie that an entire family can enjoy. It has adventure, humor, drama, interesting themes, and likable characters.The bottom line on this flick is that it is just great, entertaining cinema fun. Yet, it isn't ""mindless fun"" by a long shot, as the themes explored are ones that people of all ages can relate to. Highly recommended in all formats and for all cinema-goers.",Tomorrowland
40,eddie_baggins,"While not the classic it could've been, this is still great fun",7,4 June 2015,"Filled with much wonder and a refreshingly optimistic tone in a world of modern day ""dark"" blockbusters, Brad Bird's Tomorrowland is certainly bursting with creativity and life, yet there is an inescapable feeling that one gets from watching this entertaining family friendly Sci-Fi that there was more for this movie to be than its enjoyable incarnation.Taking inspiration from Walt Disney himself, Tomorrowland is embedded with much Disney lore and inspiration and with Brad Bird at the helm there are many dream like sequences that will bring a smile to the most cantankerous of faces. Whether it's the blast of fresh air from a jet pack ride, the thrill of a home invasion by a swarm of smiling robots or the sight of the Eiffel Tower splitting in two to reveal a rocket ship, Tomorrowland lacks nothing in the visual wonderment department and you can just see the Disney executives rubbing their hands together in glee at the thought of potential cash spins offs stemming from this tale. These elements make Tomorrowland a great big screen event and a film that will be cherished by young Disney fans for years to come but in a broad sense there is little denying that Bird and his writing partner Damon Lindelof failed to capitalise on all their various ideas and the film lacks a certain heart that Bird found in previous projects, particularly The Iron Giant and the lack of true soul hurts Tomorrowland's chances of becoming something utterly amazing despite its strong visuals and ideas and a great cast.Nailing the casting, Tomorrowland finds great leads in up and coming actresses Britt Robertson as the films hero Casey and Raffey Cassidy as the mysterious Athena, Robertson's Casey a great new Disney heroine with a believable heart of gold and Athena could just become a cult favourite of the Mouse House's rabid fan base. Surrounded by the ever reliable Clooney as old time inventor Frank Walker, Tomorrowland matches its lofty ambitions with a hugely likable cast that at times elevate some questionable dialogue and scenarios into something much more entertaining. With such a watchable leads, Tomorrowland's rose tinted view of what humanity can achieve never extends into sappiness and at the heart of this tale there is a positive message for both the young and old to be affected by.Many had great hopes for what Tomorrowland would be (myself included) and while it never becomes what so many had dreamed it would be, Tomorrowland is still a highly enjoyable original tale in a marketplace full of remakes, rehashes and re-doings and with its more than ever relevant message of humanity working for the greater good, this is a tale that offers more than your average family friendly faire of brainless entertainment. While not great, Tomorrowland is certainly movie making at its most fun, something Walt Disney himself would be proud of.3 and a half Star Wars props out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check into -",Tomorrowland
41,leonblackwood,Boring and confusing! 2/10,2,11 October 2015,"Review: I really didn't enjoy this movie! There's way too much chatting about technical jargon that is way too hard to understand and all of the back and forth into time thing was a bit ridiculous. Half of the time, George Clooney looked confused about what was going on so I don't know how the director expected the audience to follow the plot. For a Disney movie, who target many ages, I definitely can't see kids keeping up with the plot and for a 2 hour long movie, I lost interest after a while. Anyway, the bit that I understood was that Frank (George Clooney), is an inspiring inventor who helps to save the world with his childhood friend Athena (Roffey Cassidy) and there new recruit Casey Newton (Britt Robertson). They travel to a place somewhere in time and space to embark on a mission to find out why earth is going to be demolished in 58 days. I know that it sounds pretty straight forward, but it really isn't. Hugh Laurie plays a character called Nix who is only interested in the mysterious place that they live and he's against warning the people on earth about what is to come. On the plus side, it does look magnificent and the CGI was top class but apart from that, I didn't find it that entertaining. The action scenes against the robots wasn't that great and the dramatic ending was very disappointing. I usually enjoy George Clooney movies so I was looking forward to this film but it has to go down as a bad day at the office for him. Disappointing and Confusing! Round-Up: I can definitely see were the budget went for this movie but I must admit, it was a waste of money. George Clooney's movies have grossed over $2Billion at the box office, with Gravity being his biggest film and at 54 years old he still is highly rated in Hollywood. With 4 movies in the pipeline, which include Hail Caesar with Channing Tatum, Josh Brolin, Scarlett Johansson, Jonah Hill, Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton and Dolph Lundgren, I'm sure it's guaranteed to be a box office smash, if it isn't as bad as this movie. Anyway, this movie was directed by the highly rated Brad Bird who brought you the fantastic Incredibles, Ratatouille, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol and the Iron Giant. I don't know what he was trying to achieve with this movie because I was left feeling quite bored and tired after watching it. I was hoping for a mysterious adventure with some mind blowing action scenes and twists galore but it's just a lengthy movie with a over complicated concept.Budget: $190million Worldwide Gross: $209millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/family movies about an intelligent inventor who fights to save the world with the help of a robot and a young science-minded teenager. 2/10",Tomorrowland
42,TheMovieDiorama,"Tomorrowland constructs itself for a brighter future, but crumbles with its cumbersome admonition.",5,24 September 2019,"Optimism. The glass half full. The irreverent shrouding of hope for future success. In a modern world plagued by apathy and self-destruction, even the most minuscule amount of positivity can change an entire brigade of pessimistic attitudes. Yet Tomorrowland's ironic perspective on succeeding has fallen into the realms of failure, in what is director Bird's one and only misfire. No fault of his own ambition, but the unfortunate storytelling mishaps of Lindelof's screenplay that transformed a world of wonder into a stern lecture. A teenage scientist discovers an alternate dimension built by the world's greatest scientists and must team up with a disillusioned inventor to prevent the world from destroying itself.To dream of a better future. To strive for excellence. To become a better person. Retaining optimism, in a reality driven by cynicism, is irrefutably challenging. The mark of a genius consistently dreaming and thinking of a brighter future. Bird's exploration into futurism and all its ideals, is an ambitious passion project that holds its mechanical heart with the warmest of embraces. Tinkering along to the sound of outstanding visual aesthetics, accompanied by innovative futuristic architecture, and overwhelming positivity. Encapsulating the inventiveness of its characters with indestructible mechanisms that provide the plot with a greater meaning.The sole problem with the entire inception of Tomorrowland though, is just how incredibly basic the dimensional story is. The mystery revolving around the titular realm is less of a jigsaw puzzle and more reminiscent of a ""dot-to-dot"" activity sheet. The entirety of its premise is instantly laid out from the initial flashback sequence of a young Frank. The pestilence of optimism, right from that introductory erratic false smile of hope. Luring you into an advanced Disney-like cityscape, unequivocally not a ""small world"" (Damn, I loathe that song), that allows Lindelof to stretch his heavy-handed storytelling muscles. ""Please welcome to the auditorium to give his lecture on positivity, Professor Lindelof!"". Aside from the first half that executes its imaginative mystery well, to a certain degree, Lindelof clearly struggled to adapt to a family-friendly story (considering darker titles 'Prometheus' and 'Star Trek: Into Darkness'). With that, he clearly believed that the younger generation had limited intelligence, by issuing a conclusive half that reprimanded as opposed to inspired.See, instead of providing an insight into the positive outlook on life, he opted for a sizeable twenty minute berate regarding humanity's self-destruction. The ever-changing harsh environment as a result of humanity's carelessness. Overpopulation. Disease. Pollution. The list is endless. It almost reminded me of Michael Jackson's music video for 'Earth Song'. Disappointment arises from not the actual substance, as it is an eternally important message, but the method to which it's imparted. It overwhelming dissolves the optimistic perspective that preceded this overbearing talk. Yet that isn't the only issue. Clooney, not completely adversed to family-friendly flicks, had the emotional range of a burnt crumpet. Cassidy's accent was all over the place. And Robertson was surprisingly monotonous. Only Laurie provided the chops, and was merely pushed aside for Lindelof's discourse.A crushing disappointment, not because the film is bad, but due to the vast amount of missed opportunities. Bird's buoyant direction keeps this adventure afloat, but Lindelof anchors down a premise that should've been towering over Tomorrowland. The message is there. The morality exists. But it seems apathy took the glory this time.",Tomorrowland
43,digitalbeachbum,We all know George Clooney?,5,10 February 2016,"This movie is directed by Brad Bird who did Pixar movies such as The Incredibles. He is a smart director and he did a good job on directing this movie. I liked where he was going with it, but he missed the mark on completing a perfect movie.With that being said, have you noticed the direction of George Clooney's movies? Anti war? Anti big brother? Let's work together and build Utopia? Stop global warming? Stop violence? Stop killing Mother Earth? Well that is what this movie is all about all rolled in to one giant shell.The special effects are cool and I enjoyed the movie from that point of view but there are some silly leaps of logic in the script and I wasn't about to leap where these writers wanted me to leap. Too many illogical assumptions. Too many flaws.Case in point. You have a young, brilliant woman who is trying to save her father's job by disrupting the dismantling of the launch tower at NASA. She rides in with her motor cycle at night, tricks the cameras, then jumps the fence to do some sabotage.The movie wants you to believe that this sort of thing is valid. That destroying property that isn't your property is righteous.Next we are to believe that she is taken to the local sheriff office with out being taken by NASA security to be interrogated. Then the FBI? Then the CIA?They would have her so deep in a hole that he father wouldn't know if she was alive or dead. In fact I'm betting they would raid the house, take all the electronics, computers, they take her brother and interrogate him too.Totally illogical. They could have done better with the writing.There are other parts of the movie which are completely flawed but that is completely typical of Hollywood these days. They don't perfect stuff because they only want to pump out movies for profit.So what about the message of this movie?The message is that we are all consumed by feeding our egos. They didn't come right out and say it but that is what they meant to say. We feed our ego by feeding it with greed, hate and fear. When we aren't scientists, artists or engineers we are destroying stuff. We are mindless sheep for the slaughter. We don't care what happens.Well for the most part, they are right. The idiots of this world are mindless sheep and a majority of the people use greed, hate and fear to motivate decisions.With that being said, most of the rest of the movie is cool. I didn't get the little store in Texas which was setup so that people would travel there to sell their little pins. That was ridiculous. No. It was ludicrous. What an absolutely dumb part of the movie.I also have a problem with the character Casey Newton who is obviously bi-polar.This character shows amazing scientific ability and is able to create, fix and imagine almost anything. Yet when she runs from the store where she tried to sell the pin she goes in to panic mode which I find out of character.Instead of being logical and controlled she flips out when Athena shows her that she is an A.A. (Audio Animatronic) robot. She has just had her life saved and she totally wigs out stealing a truck and running away.This entire 15 minutes of the movie is wrong, from the time she gets the idea to go to Houston to the moment she is dumped out of the truck in front of Frank Walker's house.Other than these flaws I could live with the movie.5/10 stars because of the lack of attention to detail.",Tomorrowland
44,matthewssilverhammer,Brad Bird's First (Slight) Disappointment,6,30 May 2015,"Brad Bird is a filmmaker with an astounding track record. All four of his previous films (The Iron Giant, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, and Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol) were big, emotional successes that would rival Spielberg in his heyday as far as quality in sincerity and scale go. Tomorrowland, a love letter to science fiction and the imagination of Walt Disney, hopes to continue this trend. A celebration of nerds, ingenuity, and spunk, it's a rare sort of original magic in today's franchise-driven world. It's a spirited, family-friendly adventure with an old-fashioned heart.so why isn't it better than just ""okay""? The setup, a refreshingly unique structure for kid's fare, certainly isn't the problem: a non-linear science fiction film about geniuses and parallel universes, told with humor and plot surprises around every corner. The visual aesthetic is strong and fun, with some especially imaginative action sequences. The self-aware humor nicely compliments the film's earnestness without insecurely overpowering it. Robertson as our young protagonist is relatable and engaging. Even the convoluted nature of the plot is handled with skill, until the end when everything gets a bit preachy and muddy. That's where Tomorrowland truly falters. The tonal issues and mass amounts of clunky exposition were easy to overlook early on since there was such fun to be had around those small squabbles. However, the final act of the film all but completely falls apart, as if Bird only had 3/4s of a movie idea before filming. Still, the wide-eyed optimism, unabashed sincerity, and nostalgic humor provide for a mostly entertaining blast in this sci-fi family comedy.",Tomorrowland
45,Vartiainen,Fails to live up to its potential,6,13 September 2021,"Tomorrowland, starring George Clooney, Britt Robertson and Raffey Cassidy, follows Robertson's character, Casey, as she finds out about another dimension, the eponymous Tomorrowland, which was intended to serve as a safehaven for the dreamers and inventors of our world. But dreams built on sand have a tendency to crumble.The film was directed by Brad Bird, the talent behind The Iron Giant and The Incredibles, which definitely shows. His love for pulp action adventure shines through strongly in the aesthetic and the film definitely looks great overall.I also really enjoy the three main actors and they have great chemistry together. Frank's (Clooney) curmudgeon demeanour clashes wonderfully with Casey's youthful optimism, which is highlighted by Athena's (Cassidy) unchanging determination.All that being said, I do dislike the fact that the hopeful, bright future showcased at the beginning of the film has to succumb to the tired old tropes about corruption and the evils of man. For once, I'd like to see a film where a shining future is allowed to be just that. You could still have conflict and a threat, from outside forces, but it'd be so nice to see that humanity's best and brightest can build something lasting and enduring. Almost always - and likewise in this film - that vision of hope is shown briefly as an ideal, but it's always dragged back into the muck and mire of banal, shortsighted evil. And this film would have been the perfect chance for it not be so.Still, it's not an awful film by any means. It has nice visuals and nice characters. I'm simply mourning what it could have been if not for all its clichés.",Tomorrowland
46,Turfseer,"""Dorothy"" spends more time in ""Kansas"" than the ""Emerald City"" as Clooney does his best channeling ""Doc Brown""",5,24 May 2015,"""Tomorrowland"" has been one of Disney's futuristic theme land concepts featured at five different Disney theme parks throughout the world over the years. The film is an attempt to mine that concept and begins with young inventor, Frank Walker, visiting the 1964 World's Fair to show off his jet pack invention to David Nix, a renowned inventor who is awarding cash prizes for new inventions. Frank's invention is a dud; upon demonstration he is unable to make it fly and is dragged around on the ground after starting up the ineffective jet packs. That opening sequence is designed to be humorous but is too far-fetched to be taken seriously (yes ""Tomorrowland"" is supposed to be a fantasy but it starts out in the real-life context of the '64 World's Fair).Soon, much like the classic ""Wizard of Oz,"" Frank finds himself transported to a fantastic world, ""Tomorrowland,"" after following a spunky young girl, a Brit by the name of ""Athena,"" who beckons him to take a ride boat into the ""It's a Small World"" exhibit. The ride leads him to somehow be transported via a space pod to the futuristic ""Tomorrowland,"" which bears a striking resemblance to one of Disney's futuristic theme lands.Cut to the film's protagonist, Casey Newton, whose father is a NASA engineer. While attempting to sabotage machines that will take down the launch platform (the space program at Cape Canaveral is being shut down due to a lack of funding), Casey is arrested but bailed out by her father. Athena manages to leave a ""lapel pin"" which enables her to be transported to ""Tomorrowland"" when she touches it. This is perhaps the neatest cinematic bit in the entire film as Casey finds herself flipping back and forth between two worlds in an instant, simply by touching the pin.You would think that the bulk of ""Tomorrowland"" is set in the futuristic city but you'll soon discover that the bulk of Act 2 machinations occurs on earth. It's as if ""Dorothy"" spent more time in ""Kansas"", than the ""Emerald City."" Act 2 is very much a string of derivative chase sequences. First, Casey ends up at a science-fiction memorabilia retailer in Houston who she discovers is looking for the magical lapel pin. Athena must save her from the two proprietors who turn out to be robots, looking to destroy Athena (who also turns out to be a robot). The chase continues when men who claim to be Secret Service agents try to kill Casey and destroy Athena. These agents are also robots and resemble characters from ""Men in Black."" Athena deposits Casey at the home of the now grown Frank Walker, who lives as a recluse in upstate New York. Frank is played by George Clooney and attempts to play a ""Doc Brown"" kind of part from ""Back to the Future."" Unfortunately, Clooney is too identified as a heartthrob or suave criminal and does not have the acting chops to pull off the part of an eccentric scientist.Clooney manages to dispatch the ""Men in Black"" robots mainly by activating various booby-traps in his house. Before you know it, Casey, Frank and Athena are magically transported via a teleportation machine to France where they take off in a rocket ensconced inside the Eiffel Tower. Before launching, Frank explains that the four mannequins of Edison, Tesla, Verne and Eiffel honor those four inventors who started a secret group, Plus Ultra, who discovered the dimension which eventually led to the founding of ""Tomorrowland."" The third act finally brings us back to the ""Emerald City,"" so to speak. What originally seems like a flick for teenagers morphs into a convoluted sci-fi story, designed for adults. It turns out that Nix is now the governor and has been broadcasting ""warnings"" to people on earth about a future apocalypse. Nix soon realizes that his ""warnings"" are not being heeded and said messages are actually becoming a self- fulfilling prophecy that will end in the actual destruction of earth in 58 days, more or less. The next sequence of events are difficult to follow. Suffice it to say that the ""tachyons,"" which enable a glimpse into the future, are utilized by Athena to save the day (reminiscent of another glimpse-into- the-future-save-the-day moment in the sci-fi dramedy, ""Galaxy Quest"") as well as Athena's self-sacrifice in blowing up the big power source (check I, Robot for another nice cutting-off-the-power-at the-source implosion). Once the evil Nix is dispatched, it's time for director Brad Bird's ""Kumbaya"" moment. New Athena-like robots are sent to earth to give a gaggle of cool recruits (most probably culled from the ranks of young UNICEF workers) those cool lapel pins so they can catch a glimpse of the good things to come at ""Tomorrowland."" Now that the UN has taken over ""Tomorrowland,"" singing ""We are the World,"" we'll all be quite comforted to know that all is right with Walt Disney, Sleeping Beauty, his Seven Dwarfs and theme rides at Disney theme parks worldwide.",Tomorrowland

48,freemantle_uk,Visually stunning retro sci-fi,8,25 March 2017,"In an age of dark, grim visions of the future Disney's Tomorrowland is a delightful throwback to upbeat adventures of the 60s and 80s, a retro sci-fi film for the whole family to enjoy.Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) is a bright and optimistic high school student who does not share the pessimistic views of elders. When Casey discovers a mysterious pin that shows her fantastic world and sets out to find the futuristic city with the help of a jaded inventor, Frank Walker (George Clooney) and Athena (Raffey Cassidy), an English-accented Audio-Animatronics.Tomorrowland is a deliberately old-fashioned film both its tone and visuals: the film was loosely based on the Disney ride of the same name - considering that Disney were able to turn Pirates of the Caribbean into a billion dollar film series. Bird was a wise choice to direct and co-write, The Incredibles had a 60s style sci-fi look to it and he brought that look to Tomorrowland. It was bright and colourful with its showing of various technologies, from robots, jetpacks, lasers and a steampunk rocket.Brad Bird has already shown himself to be a capable action director with Mission Impossible: Ghost Portrayal and with Tomorrowland he had much better CGI. There are some cool fight sequences, especially with Athena - it is awesome to see a little girl beating up fully grown men and giant robots. Tomorrowland is visually spectacular especially when we get to see the city in all its glory for the first time. Bird certainly brought out a sense of awe, whimsy and wonder.Tomorrowland also has a great trio in the leads: Clooney, Robertson and Cassidy are terrific together, having many witty moments together when they are travelling and there is a zip in their interactions, like when they use a knock-out tool. Although Robertson's look too old to be a high schooler she pushes off the necessary enthusiasm. But it was Cassidy who stole the show: she was a revelation as Athena, playing a character who was older than she actually looked and at times acts a Terminator. She personally reminded me of Saoirse Ronan when she was younger, just with dark hair.Although Tomorrowland had a talented director at the helm it also had a screenplay with Damon Lindelof's fingerprints, a man who has poor reputation as a screenwriter. As an adventure Tomorrowland is excellent but when it goes to the science fiction the film gets bogged down with mumbo-jumbo about time particles and destiny. This part needed to be expanded and more refined. When it's revealed that Tomorrowland was a place for exceptional people to come to where they would not disrupted by government or civil society. Essentially this is similar to Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, a controversial sci-fi work that abdicates the philosophy of Objectivism, or if you prefer it's the ideology of Andrew Ryan in Bioshock. The prologue at the 1964 World's Fair could have been cut and it would have made the reveals more impactful.Tomorrowland is a good of romp of a film, providing plenty of laughs, action and visual spectcle. It was rated a 12A in the UK but it is on lower scale of that rating and could easily be enjoyed by children younger than that age.",Tomorrowland
49,dfranzen70,Underplotted Tomorrow,7,26 May 2015,"Loosely based on the Disney attraction of the same name, Tomorrowland is a kinetic frenzy of amazing effects. However, despite the fine pedigree of the director and star, the movie falls a little flat, with a plot that begged for more coherence and elucidation.Teenager Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) is one of those kids who loves to learn things. Okay, maybe there aren't many of those kids, but they're probably out there somewhere. Always tinkering, this one.Casey lives near Cape Canaveral, where a launch platform is being deconstructed. A launch platform means a job for her dad, who's a NASA guy, so our curious, proactive heroine routinely jumps a fence and sabotages the equipment used to take the whole shebang apart. This leads to Casey getting in trouble with Johnny Law, leading to a very brief stay in a holding cell, but when she emerges among her belongings is a mysterious metal pin with a ""T"" logo on it. That's odd enough, since she had little on her when The Man pinched her, but when she touches the pin, she finds herself somewhere that's most definitely not the police station: a large wheat field with a futuristic city on the horizon.Casey's experience dovetails with that of one Frank Walker, a boy inventor who takes his newly cobbled jet pack to the World's Fair and Exposition in 1964 in New York. Like Casey in the present day, Frank finds himself in possession of another of the strange pins, one given to him by eternally childlike Athena.But back to the present. It seems that the pin allows the holder (for a time) to travel to a different dimension. But poor Casey's pin has run out of juice, so she wants to find another mode of transportation. This leads her to the doorstep of one cranky Frank Walker (George Clooney), a recluse who sends out a holographic dog to scare off unwelcome visitors. They're all unwelcome.This being a rather straightforward Disney movie, there's a bad guy, a Governor Nix, played by Hugh Laurie. Nix here represents an obstacle to creativity and imagination, traits that both Frank and Casey proudly display. But, as written, the villain is pretty lame. Not only doesn't Nix attack his perceived opponents, he's actually quite accommodating to them. Very British of him, really. What's more, Nix's reasons for opposing the dynamic duo are actually quite sound, even if the methods aren't. What kind of bad guy is that? We learn very little about the magical new place that Frank and Casey visit. I mean, we know it's futuristic, what with all the flying cars and overall clean atmosphere, but we don't know how it came to be or what its long-term purpose is. We're given some vague platitudes about gather the best minds, but we're never really told to what purpose.Clooney and Robertson hold their own, even if their interaction does feel a little forced at times. Laurie seems miscast. Tim McGraw plays Casey's dad in a few brief but important scenes. Perhaps the best performance is turned in by young Raffey Cassidy, who plays the enigmatic Athena.Tomorrowland is, purportedly about the importance of remaining hopeful. Casey is our optimist; Frank is our pessimist. One has the benefit of experience that the other does not. But there's also an undercurrent of environmental awareness, or the imminent mortality of man, and other lighthearted issues.For a Disney live-action film, Tomorrowland is acceptably gregarious. It entertaining in its own right. But as a sci-fi movie, it falls short; there's too much superficial wonder and not enough honest-to-goodness science and ingenious wizardry.",Tomorrowland
50,PWNYCNY,Weak treatment of a serious subject.,6,26 May 2015,"This movie has an endearing quality but regrettably it is rather shallow. In other words, given the nature of the story's theme, that of impending global destruction, the story simply too weak. As a result, the movie is tepid. It delivers its message without much power. There is little sense of doom or foreboding. The bonding of humans and robots is unconvincing. The special effects do little to add to the story's intensity. The story does have some intriguing elements, such as the existence of particles that travel faster than the speed of light and of the concept of another dimension, but they are only touched upon, and only superficially, thus failing to raise the intellectual level of the story to a level commensurate with the story's theme. A movie with a serious theme should present a serious story. This movie fails to do that. Instead, the movie promotes a certain political message that is neither original nor in need of repetition. Yes, the world's survival is at risk, and yes, it is a serious matter. But this movie delivers that message in such a ludicrous way as to trivialize the issue.",Tomorrowland
51,stevendbeard,Optimistic Look Towards the Future,7,22 May 2015,"I saw ""Tomorrowland"", starring George Clooney-Gravity, Return of the Killer Tomatoes!; Hugh Laurie-House M.D._tv, Stuart Little; Britt Robertson-The Longest Ride, Scream 4; Tim McGraw-Four Christmases, Friday Night Lights, Oh Yeah, he is a country singer, too and Raffey Cassidy-Snow White and the Huntsman, Dark Shadows_2012.This is based on the Disney theme park attraction-Tomorrowland, of course- which paints an upbeat, fantastic looking future with flying cars, jet packs and contented people that walk around with smiles all the time and swim in multi layered swimming pools-they really look pretty cool. It's directed by Brad Bird, who also directed Mission:Impossible-Ghost Protocol and The Incredibles. There are two parallel stories going on. The first one takes place in 1964, with George's character as a young 10 year old boy that is an inventing prodigy-he invents a flying jet pack-and he is headed to the New York World's Fair. There, he meets Raffey, a young mysterious girl that seems interested in his invention. The other story is set in the present, with another science loving character, Britt. Tim plays Britt's father, a NASA technician that is soon to be out of a job-as you well know, in present day, no one is interested in exploring space like they used to. The future is not going like they envisioned back in 1964; world wide famine, wars, oil crises, climate changes, etc. Hugh is in both stories and thinks mankind is coming to an end, thanks to mankind itself and he has plans to rectify the situation. George teams up with Britt to try to make the future become more like the happy one from 1964. There are lots of cool effects-I mentioned the multi layered pools, didn't I?-and there are some nice cameos-I liked Keegan-Michael Key's appearance as a hobby shop owner. Overall, the message is an optimistic look towards the future. It's rated ""PG""for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 10 minutes. I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on DVD.",Tomorrowland

The premise of the film sees a young girl find a pin that shows shows her tomorrowland. With the help of friends she tries to get to tomorrowland. Britt Robertson is pretty unknown but she is really good as the lead character in this film. Her character was interesting and likable as you followed her on this journey. George clooney is also really good in this film as her mentor who tries to get over his own personal problems. His character was also really interesting and he delivers a really good performance. There's a young girl in this film and I don't know the actresses name but she is great in this film and delivers a good performance especially for her age. Hugh lawrie is a great actor but unfortunately his character was really cliché in this film and didn't add anything to the film overall. The story is pretty interesting as you follow these interesting characters on their journey. However, this film does get a bit overpreachy with a moral message. Also the last act of the film has been seen many times before. The script is really good, it has allot of well placed humour and also some drama that works. The style is really good, the contrast between the real world and tomorrowland really works for the film. Overall this is a fun film that is worth watching.",Tomorrowland
53,estebangonzalez10,Unfortunately settles for a lackluster and uninspired second half,6,22 May 2015,"""I want you to take me to the place I saw when I touched this.""After having seen the trailer for Tomorrowland, I didn't have very high expectations for it, but once I heard Brad Bird was directing this project I knew I had to see it because everything he had done up to this point was amazing. Ratatouille is one of my favorite animated films and The Incredibles was also an entertaining one. I have heard great things about his first animated film, Iron Giant, but I haven't seen it. Tomorrowland is his second live action film after having directed the latest Mission Impossible sequel which was also quite impressive (that Abu Dhabi scene was breathtaking), so there was no reason for me to doubt Bird and I was ready to give him my full support. I've got to give him a lot of credit for taking a risk by directing this unique project instead of accepting to make the Star Wars sequel, and in a way Tomorrowland feels refreshingly original. Bird also co-wrote the screenplay along with Damon Lindelof (one of the writers of my favorite TV series, Lost) so I raised my interest again considering they were involved. Unfortunately this is by far Bird's weakest film, but I still had a decent time at the movies. The film opens with Frank Walker (George Clooney) speaking directly to the audience and explaining what the future holds for the planet in a rather pessimistic tone, but he is constantly interrupted by a young teenager named Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) who wants him to be more optimistic. So Frank begins by explaining that the future wasn't always as bad as it looks now, and in a flashback we are introduced to that time when as a young boy (Thomas Robinson) he invented a jet pack in order to try to impress a judge at a science fair named Nix (Hugh Laurie). The only problem was that it didn't actually fly so Nix wasn't impressed. However, he did catch the attention of a young girl, Athena (Raffey Cassidy), who gives him a special pin and asks him to follow them from a distance. What Frank discovers is a fascinating futuristic place where all dreams are possible. Somewhere along the way something goes wrong and we are back in the present where we are introduced to Casey's story. She also discovers a pin similar to the one Frank was given and is fascinated by the visions she gets of this wonderful place. Destiny will lead her to search for Frank and try to find a way to return to this place, but along the way she experiences several setbacks as many people try to stop her from reaching him.Tomorrowland begins with a very promising and gripping first half and I was completely engaged with the story. The visuals were impressive and the action scenes very entertaining. Britt Robertson was delivering a strong lead performance and the quest to reach Tomorrowland felt incredibly refreshing and unique. She shared a strong chemistry with George Clooney and her upbeat optimism contrasted perfectly with Clooney's pessimism. There is no denying the level of ambition this film has, but unfortunately the second half of the film doesn't deliver on the promising premise and the ending was very bland. My interest fell completely and I lamented the fact that the film couldn't maintain that same level of intensity delivered during the first half. Hugh Laurie is a great actor, but as the antagonist he never really felt the part. The film ran out of steam and imagination pretty quickly and delivers a somewhat predictable and uninspired ending. The film is also pretty heavy handed in delivering its upbeat message (which is recurrent in most Disney movies) of never giving up on your dreams and being optimistic towards life despite all the negative things surrounding us. The fact that there have been tons of films reiterating the ""you are special"" message to young adolescents also hurts the movie quite a bit. But I did have a great time during the first hour of the film so I'm still going to give it a mild recommendation. Rafael Cassidy delivers one of my favorite performances of the film as Athena. Dave Clark also has a couple of hilarious scenes playing a Secret Service agent. Tommorowland could've been a great film, but it runs out of imagination pretty quickly and settles for a lackluster ending. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Tomorrowland
54,Fluke_Skywalker,Future Turgid,5,23 April 2016,"Optimism! That seems to be the lesson, mantra and chief narrative band-aid of Brad Bird's very earnest, occasionally preachy and ultimately kinda dull retro-futuristic sci-fi family action adventure comedy... thing.The visuals are impressive, and set to a pleasingly derivative Michael Giacchino (doing his best John Williams impersonation) score. And the cast is certainly game; particularly Britt Robertson, who manages to resuscitate this flat-lining story more than once with her likable feistiness. But despite its pure gee-whiz! DNA, 'Tomorrowland' just ends up feeling like a $200 million version of those old buy the world a Coke commercials from the 70s.",Tomorrowland

The special effects are very nice, also.As for the casting, I guess it could've been better. However, I did like the main quartet of Britt Robertson (Casey), George Clooney (Frank), Raffey Cassidy (Athena) and Hugh Laurie (David) - the latter has a good rant late on. I rate the way the story is told, mostly in retrospective by Robertson and Clooney - it keeps it interesting.I just feel more should've been done with this, given it's fairly entertaining even in its current state and has a load of potential. Either way, I did narrowly like it.",Tomorrowland
56,3xHCCH,"Overwrought Optimism, Disappointing Dream",5,22 May 2015,"In 1964, Frank Walker was a child genius who bravely showed up at the World's Fair, bringing a crude jetpack he had invented by himself. In 2015, Casey Newton uses her own mechanical inventions to try and delay the dismantling of NASA platforms at Cape Canaveral. A mysterious little girl named Athena chooses both of them to receive a pin inscribed with a letter T, a touch of which brings them to a magical futuristic wonderland. With Athena's intercession, Walker and Newton cross paths in the present day in an effort to emancipate this ""Tomorrowland"" from the negative forces which control it.From the trailer alone, we know ""Tomorrowland"" would be an extravagant visual treat. And that it really was. From meticulously recreating the 1964 World's Fair with its retro fashion and quaint technology to imaginatively envisioning a metropolis of the future with its outlandish architecture and snazzy hovercrafts, this film is a masterpiece of production design. An old wooden farm house becomes a high-tech ironclad fortress. A store in Houston becomes a treasure trove of pop culture memorabilia, a true blast from the past. And best of them all, the iconic Eiffel Tower in Paris becomes a sparkly and spectacular rocket launch station! Visuals alone though do not a great movie make. The way director Brad Bird tells it, the story goes through 130 minutes of convoluted loops and elaborate turns. The first act was slow and long-winded, with so many fancy stunts that led nowhere. The second act when Franky and Casey get together was the best and most exciting part of the film. I forgot my dissatisfaction of the first act, and felt the rising tension so effectively built. Disappointingly, whatever momentum was created by the second act got eroded away by an overlong and even tediously anti- climactic third act. I could not wait for it to end, but the end was not coming soon enough.Since his two main co-stars are relative newcomers, the talent and experience of George Clooney were essential to bind this whole rather messy bundle together, and he does so effectively. Clooney plays his disillusioned genius character as a gruff curmudgeon, and he was charming and funny. Britt Robertson has been acting for 15 of her 25 years and this lead role is her biggest break. I do not know if it is her acting or the way her character was written, but she did not succeed to have me rooting for her Casey. She came across as too sassy and smart-alecky for comfort. Aside from optimism, what exactly is Casey's dream? We were not clearly told. Her closeness with her father is only implied but not elaborated. It seemed too easy for her to just run off to another state without seeking her father's permission. This was bothersome from a parent's point of view.Child actress Raffey Cassidy fares much better in her role as Athena. We had seen her delightful pixie face before as the young Eva Green in ""Dark Shadows"" and the young Kristen Stewart in ""Snow White and the Huntsman."" Here she had good chemistry with Thomas Robinson, the actor playing the young Frank Walker, as well as with Clooney as the old Frank. It is just too bad that her character was not developed too clearly. When her climactic dramatic moment came at the end, we fail to emotionally connect with itHugh Laurie was given the thankless role of Nix, the leader of Tomorrowland whose motivations are unclear and do not really make any sense in the final analysis. This underwritten antagonist character was certainly one of the factors why the story did not fly.Since his auspicious animated feature film debut ""The Iron Giant"" (1999), Brad Bird had consistently given us top-notch films: ""The Incredibles"" (2004), ""Ratatouille"" (2007) and the live action ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" (2011) are all excellent. Audacious as it may seem on the surface, ""Tomorrowland"" is Bird's most disappointing project to date. Of course, as this is a Disney movie, we are expected to approach this film with childlike idealism, flawed as the underlying message may be. Optimistic dreamers are the ultimate saviors of the world. For me, ""Tomorrowland"" was not able to sell that idea too well. It concentrated too much in developing grand images guaranteed to awe and amaze us, hoping that the poorly-told story will not matter so much. Young kids will stop at the visual feast and not really understand what is going on. Most adult audiences will see through the smoke and mirrors and feel oddly empty after the final (supposedly inspirational) scenes. 5/10.",Tomorrowland
57,jfgibson73,Mastermind Group for the Ages,7,24 October 2015,"I enjoyed this movie way more than I expected, but not quite enough to want to own it. I do like the message that dreamers can change the world. I didn't really see the story problems that many other reviewers seem to be pointing out. To me, it all made sense, and I wasn't really bothered by the structure of the movie, which spent too much time in present-day, according to many. I would have liked to see more of the city and what life is like there, but that is more of a reflection after the fact. When I was actually watching the movie, I was caught up in the story completely. I think there were sequences that won't be as entertaining on second viewing now that I already know where they're going, such as the Eiffel Tower launch, but I think that the idea of great minds working together is still exciting enough that I will always view this movie favorably.",Tomorrowland
58,aharmas,Incredibly Disappointing,1,24 May 2015,"When the director of ""The Incredibles"" signed for this film, I was looking forward to the same amount of humor and exhilaration present in that animated masterpiece, something similar to what the little boy expresses when he realizes he can run on water. Nothing remotely close occurs in ""Tomorrowland"", a film that suffers from having too big a budget and hardly any original or exciting thoughts. It is also hindered by the fact that almost all of the actors appear clueless and not quite matching their characters. There's something about George Clooney being suave when needed and bit of an oddball in some other cases, but he's no Harrison Ford or Tom Cruise, and though the lead actress is pleasant to look at, she makes you wonder if casting directors shouldn't go through a more comprehensive training.Just recently ""Mad Max"" showed how an apocalyptic universe can be created with the use of minimum CGI, giving the film and story more weight because it felt real. ""Tomorrowland"" has some gorgeous computer graphics and way too many visual effects that must have caught a good deal of money but don't add much to the dramatic, action, or comedy scenes. They distract.The premise was interesting, and I liked the idea that girls are giving important roles, but as I said before the introduction is sluggish, and the movie never recovers from it. Traveling through multi-dimensions has been explored before with even more complex concepts, and the results have been spectacular. We can think of ""Back to the Future"", ""The Matrix"" among others, and some of the ""technology"" that pops here has been displayed to a much better use and without overdoing the clunkiness in shows that some people might consider cheesier but a lot more fun. Do you remember ""Lost in Space?"" I had flashes of ""Aliens"", ""The Transformers"", ""The Rocketeer"" among others, and though there was a lovely recreation of the fifties. There is not much to commend in the film. It's like a dark ages of cinema took over whatever inspiration went in, leaving not much but a pretty, loud, expensive, but expensive package. I remember a few years ago when ""The Return of the King"" was criticized for its many endings, well, I did experience quite a bit of anxiety and pain by watching the endless final scenes in this film as the point was made over, and over, and over, and over, and sadly enough another modern masterpiece came to mind as flashes of ""Ex Machina"" went by. Yes, money can buy a lot but it's hardly the currency Hollywood needs for true imagination or inspiration. This is a film that was 130 minutes too long.",Tomorrowland
59,peterp-450-298716,I thought this Disney SF wasn't so bad as I heard. Especially the futuristic images were amazing.,6,1 October 2015,"""If I was walking down the street and I saw some kid with a jet-pack fly over me... I'd believe anything's possible. I'd be inspired. Doesn't that make the world a better place?""Worldwide, there should be an obligation for doom-sayers, negativists and pessimists to watch this film. I'm sure it won't make them happier, because most of them are hopelessly lost and trapped in their negative spiral. But maybe there will be a few individuals who'll understand the message of this action packed futuristic Disney movie. The message that positivism and optimism are better features to make a better world out of the present world. Perseverance and self belief will make you reach your goal. Such optimism luxuriated in the sixties. Because of that optimism progress was possible and the future looked brighter. In today's world, the future looks frightening and menacing.And that's how we get to know Frank Walker. An eager young inventor who firmly believes that his jet-pack could be useful. Even if it doesn't work flawlessly. We meet him during the World Expo at Flushing Meadows in 1964. With the aid of the lovable girl Athena (Raffey Cassidy) he discovers a futuristic world called ""Tomorrowland"". A safe world situated in a parallel dimension where technological progress hasn't stopped and serving as a shelter for visionaries and geniuses. However, they couldn't avoid one particular fact. The world we're living in, is heading towards a devastating catastrophe. And that's when Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) comes up. Together with the older Frank Walker (George Clooney), who's banned from Tomorrowland, and Athena, she tries to turn the tide.You'll easily see this is a Disney product throughout the entire film. It's all beautifully visualized with breathtaking images and unparalleled special effects. It certainly would fit nicely as an attraction at a Disney theme park. Tomorrowland looks extremely futuristic and you won't be able to take it all in. It reminded me of futuristic cities from comic strips and went from one surprise to the next. You'll be awestruck by the dazzlingly spectacular images of flying vehicles driven by an unknown traction, floating pools and curved landscapes (same as in ""Interstellar"" and ""Elysium"") full of strangely shaped buildings. The ""Eiffel Tower"" moment is fantastic and grotesque at the same time.Unfortunately the Disney input ensures that it sometimes feels rather childish. Towards the end, the message sounds quite moralistic. It gave me that 60s feeling full of values and standards which were applicable at that time. In our case we have to take care of the current environment and try to bend our egocentric thinking into a sense of solidarity. Of course in the end we got an obligatory emotional moment. Fortunately we could also admire some excellent performances. Clooney has omitted his pose as Nespresso charmer and appears as a capricious genius. But especially young Cassidy steals the show, both in the action-packed as the sentimental moments.""Tomorrow Land"" (or ""Project T"" as it's known here because the original title is a registered name of an eponymous music festival) for once isn't a book-based movie, prequel, sequel or reboot. It's a unique project targeting the whole family. It was pleasantly entertaining and exciting enough. Besides the corny, predictable end it was actually all right and I don't really understand all the negative criticism.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",Tomorrowland
60,ShootingShark,There Are Two Wolves Who Are Always Fighting,7,29 May 2015,"Casey Newton lives in Cape Canaveral with her Dad and little brother. After a run-in with the law she comes into possession of a mysterious badge, which transports her to a fabulous futureworld. But where did it come from, and why was she chosen to receive it ?This Disney sci-fi thriller is a beautifully made, highly original, hugely entertaining film which is consistently gorgeous to look at but also a wonderful story with great characters and terrific themes. What I like best about it I think is its driving sense of optimism and its faith that humanity can overcome any problem once we realise that our destiny lies in our hands. Frank and Nix represent opposite sides of this philosophy - one disgruntled but never giving up hope, the other pragmatic and visionary but resigned to humanity's shallow indifference. The film explores these ideas through rich motifs - the story of the two wolves, the contrast of Frank's youth in the sixties with Casey's in the twenty-first century, the whole Paris Edison/Tesla sequence, Frank and Nix's literal clash of interests. It's a story about not giving up, and not accepting the never-ending tide of bad news the media loves to spoon-feed us all, and it's joyous, exciting, scary and terrific. Clooney and Laurie are both excellent, but it's really Robertson and Cassidy as the kids who hold the picture and who the story is really all about. Twelve-year-old Cassidy in particular steals it, continuing the rich tradition of cinematic robot heroes (see also Aliens, A.I. Artificial Intelligence or I, Robot) who encompass humanity's best qualities. I also love MacCaull's brief role as cheesy android villain Dave Clark - his toothy smile alone is worth catching the movie for. There is a fantastic bombastic string score by Michael Giacchino, which surges through the whole picture - he is rapidly becoming the John Williams of modern cinema - upping the dramatic stakes, and adding warmth and tension. Equally wonderful is Scott Chambliss' fabulous production design, which runs a gamut of imagination from the multi-layered swimming pools and gliding transportation hubs of Tomorrowland to the charmingly kitschy cult movie memorabilia shop in which Casey first encounters the enemy agents. A sensational achievement for Bird (the creator of animated classics The Incredibles and Ratatouille), and a fabulous family movie which reminds us that it's okay to have hope, encourage creativity and strive to make the world a better place. Released here in the UK as Tomorrowland: A World Beyond.",Tomorrowland
61,AudioFileZ,Sink It With Big Budget Bomb,3,25 July 2015,"Disney can, and does, make turkeys. Witness Tomorrowland. Clooney needs something narrow to fit his niche and this is completely out of his wheelhouse. If that was the worst thing it may still be salvageable. In fact, it's the story that never seems to gel. After watching the whole 2-hrs. I'm asking what it was? It's hard to follow or make even Sci-Fi sense out of. Totally dis-jointed feeling in telling whatever it sought to say.

I'm not saying it is the greatest movie ever made or anything like that, you know what I'm saying. It is a fun film with great visuals, so stop hating so hard.

63,jadepietro,High Apple Pie-in-the-Sky Hoke,6,25 May 2015,"(Rating: ☆☆ ½ out of 4)This film is mildly recommended.In brief: A cockeyed optimistic kiddie movie.GRADE: B-To this day, I still have fond memories of going to the 1964 World Fair in Flushing, NY. As a teenager, the experience was just so COOL, even if I had to be there with my family! Especially impressive was seeing the technical progress that laid before me, a Jetson-like paradise of robotic marvels and futuristic buildings of chrome, glass, and steel that only hinted at my future, my tomorrow land. Monorails and talking robots, with not a hint of doomsday or post-apocalyptic disaster so commonplace today! Like I said...COOL!￼Tomorrowland (the movie) isn't. The film takes that premise, of our space-aged dreams ready to be fulfilled, of a promised future filled with new technology and yet-to-be-invented inventions, and it certainly promotes creativity and imagination to the nth degree. The film celebrates inspiration but never inspires. What it lacks in logic and truth, it more than compensates in its buoyancy and unmitigated confidence. This Disney-inspired and Disney-produced futuristic fantasy romp is surely kid-friendly fare, although some children may get a bit bored in between all of the hyper chase scenes. Adults who have never dreamed will be disenchanted also. Directed by the talented Brad Bird, the film tries to meld the past with the present before we get to the future, with varying results.￼The set-up: Well, it's a small world after all. A prologue takes place in that aforementioned Disneyesque wonderland before a magical lapel pin abruptly transports our teenage heroine, Casey (a winning Britt Robertson), into the future and into the world of a now cynical inventor named Frank Walker, well played by George Clooney, Frank was once a young idealistic boy, who visited the World's Fair and believed in America's bright future. Bought together, these misfits decide to join forces and change the world.Tomorrowland works efficiently, like the well-maintained animatronics on display. Whenever the film is concentrating on the action set pieces, the movie keeps one riveted to the screen. But far too often, it stops dead on its own tracks. This happens frequently as the characters need to stop and explain some scientific jargon or feel the urgency to provide more exposition and background information. The CGI is, for the most part, effectively done, with some less than stellar images thrown in that become too jarringly bogus as the overenthusiastic music score swells endlessly to signal its insignificance. ￼However, the film's production design is the film's most valuable tool, especially since the dialog and characters lack any cleverness or depth. The preachy screenplay by Mr. Bird and Damon Lindelof (of Lost fame) just gets lost in its own platitudes, leading to an ending that is a gross simplification about the magnitude of the issues it tries to present. Apparently, subtlety is not in our future either.High on optimism and low on any resemblance to reality, Tomorrowland fills the screen with heady bromides and feel-good positivity which tends to self-destruct its own worthy message. The film plays it all too safely, never achieving any degree of importance or creative ingenuity. It's a kiddie adventure movie trying to play grown-up, a hippie-dippy parable with a liberal mindset.

64,Seraphion,Just another kids movie,5,7 June 2015,"Having George CLooney at the cast list doesn't really necessarily interprets into a great movie. This is what this movie proves. The story is just another common cliché of alluring stories for kids, of how someone gets sucked into another world and fights to cancel an impending doom. But honestly for me, it can be really wrapped far better than this way. Take TRON movies, or the recent Jupiter Ascending of the same grand theme. They are far better than this one. Despite having all those cool tehcs and stuff to explore more on, the movie instead focuses more on the relationship side, taking much of ts duration. Even kids would be bored by that. The acting overall is also a standard job even with George Clooney. Britt Robertson looks hyperbolic and over-acted in most of her parts. Even Hugh Lourie looks flat.",Tomorrowland
65,Blueghost,I know why it flopped.,2,5 April 2016,"I was going to title this review ""Disney Princess does Terminator"", but it sounded way too suggestive, even in a G-Rated double-entednre kind of way. But that's essentially what much of the plot is about, only Disneyfied for a mainstream audience.I'm not going to pull any punches. This film is a borderline disaster, but saves itself with lots of spectacular visuals. However, when I was growing up Disney didn't just cater to young females, as they predominantly do now. Disney was about Treasure Island, Davy Crockett, Swiss Family Robinson and their staples of animated comedy aimed at young children with the likes of Mickey Mouse, Donald duck and gang.But ""Disney Princess"" seems to have dominated their market model, even when it comes to making a film about a region of Disneyland, which is focused on ""the future"".The film invites a young teen-aged or pre-teen girl to access a world that is ostensibly a kind of ""future"" version of Earth, only in another dimension. There's a rift in thinking between the two worlds, and a possible cataclysm which propels our heroine to do feats and derring-do.The bottom line is that we have a dimensional rift as opposed to a possible future. The story shows us a world that is and is apart from Earth, as opposed to what Earth could become with some positive qualities put forth.And in the middle you have a teenage girl trying to bridge the gap by herself, but with a little help from another little girl (robot) and a world weary and world wary middle aged man. The story regards bridging worlds, as opposed to trying to get their world on the right track to evolve into ""Tomorrowland"". The film needed a boy to help the girl, not a young British girl-android fraught with equally automated enemies. There needed to be more in the plot regarding Tachyons and possible ""future outcomes"" (someone didn't hire the right screenwriter, and didn't do enough research on the science itself). And, finally, the film needed a very much tweaked (or altogether different) screenplay to work from.The film has a real patchwork feel in spite of being a single production. The ""Terminator"" aspect feels out of place in spite of being needed to push the plot forward. And some of the SFX sequences seem quite over the top.The film could have been subtle and magnificent, but Disney probably knew that there wasn't much to work with for a film premised on a section of Disneyland, and therefore went the ""safe route"" of making a SFX spectacular. The script I would have shot might have had a little bit of time-travel, but not much. A bit more science, fewer robots, some intrigue regarding human dramas in the ""real time"" in which the main character lives. She would still experience ""Tomorrowland"", but would have a male companion her age helping her, and we wouldn't get involved in some far out plot about alternate dimensions and social commentary from afar. It would have been a better film. But, as per the film's Parisian sequence, cest la vie.In short, I was expecting more, something more art and less flash, and something that wasn't skewed strictly to the female demographic. See it once, but only if you really want to. Otherwise there's better movies out there.",Tomorrowland

67,rgkarim,Like A Beta Version Of The Theme Park,7,22 May 2015,"PLOT: Casey Newton (Robertson) is a genius who has a strong interest in the world around her. After posting bail for a crime, Casey finds a pin that brings her to a place of limitless potential, a new world where anything seems possible. In order to gain access to this futuristic dimension though she will have to enlist the aid of a former resident of that place named Frank (Clooney). However, Frank's history with the utopia may prove an insurmountable obstacle, especially when hunters continue to track he and Casey. ACTORS' PERFORMANCE: Perhaps one of the strongest components of this movie is the acting. Robertson once again dazzles the screen in both looks and talents as she brings her character to life. Casey seems like a real person, who has the right balance of wits, passion, and emotion as she ventures into the unknown. Robertson knows how to deliver her lines with sass, keeping you laughing and engaged, but not overdoing it to get annoying (most of the time). Clooney also lives up to his potential, somehow managing to deliver powerful dialog despite his limited emotional spectrum. The aged hunk for the most part is either angry or emotionally moot as his character explains the ins and outs of technological history. While strong alone, together Clooney and Robertson are stronger, their chemistry amazing as they play off each other like a father-daughter combination. Even though she isn't the top credit, Raffey Cassidy is the other major contender in the film. Cassidy is already very impressive to me, another wild card who can play a wide variety of qualities into one character. She has an ability to bring wit and laughs with her sarcasm, but yet bring class and charm to ground her jokes. SCENES: Tomorrowland's scenes aren't half bad, and can be split essentially into two parts: real world and tomorrowland. In the real word the scenes are well shot, the camera work in particular well directed to capture the detail. Our journey across the world has great visuals and is filmed in a number of beautiful areas that are appeasing to the eye. As for tomorrowland visuals, they are okay. The graphics for the imaginative technologies are sleek, shiny, and bright, representative of the good old Disney imagination. Yet, the design team has some edges to smooth out if they want to compete with other animation works like Transformers and Jurassic Park. Most of the robots and gadgets have a cartoony look to them, some looking no more than a plastic kids toy that lights up. It is PG, but come on you don't have to go that cheap. Regardless the scenes are well edited, and the visuals are beautifully woven into the live action to make a world that mirrors the park's scenery. LIKED: Aside from the acting, Tomorrowland does have a few other good qualities that I found entertaining. This film is constantly moving, our heroes being hunted keeps them on their toes as they try to elude their captors. Clooney's ingenuity, combined with creative movie magic, allows them to find new ways to keep the chase going and the excitement as well. Speaking of excitement, Tomorrowland surprisingly has some okay action that spans across hand to hand combat, robot boxing, and laser gunplay. Don't blow a gasket people, the action has been programmed to be family friendly and happens so quickly it's like it wasn't there. Be warned there is a bit of darkness to the fights though, and you may exercise caution for kids who are sensitive. Even better is that all of this action is intertwined with character development and mystery to help keep suspense building in the movie. I found myself trying to decipher what had caused each character to act the way they did, everything hovering around some major incident. It kept me engaged in the characters and wondering what would transpire to force them to reveal their secrets. DISLIKED: The first weakness I disliked was the lack of time in Tomorrowland. Despite the title, you don't spend that much time in the futuristic utopia that you saw in the commercials. Casey does venture a few times to give you a taste of the computer generated dimension, but she doesn't really get to interact with the world the way you might expect. I felt robbed and was disappointed that we didn't get more time with the fun technology the world held. Another flaw was what the big event was they were trying to prevent. The big reveal was a convoluted mess, that really didn't hold much threat or evil as I had expected. Personally it was just a plot device used to preach the morals of this movie, which while good, doesn't make for a good antagonist. Even the solution was uncomplicated, and despite all the chasing, the movie lacked the edge I wanted, (blame it on the PG ranking). Some parts were also boring and a bit too drawn out, leading to the 130 minute runtime, which was not necessary. FINAL THOUGHTS: Tomorrowland immerses you into Disney Theme park imagination and is a fun tale for families alike. The concepts are convoluted, and the situations are a bit more mature for the typical Disney goer, but they do contain sustenance older adults like to see. It's a fun blend, and does have some well crafted graphics, but I've seen better, more engaging tales in some of their earlier works. Worth a trip to the theater? For the special effects yes, but I recommend renting this one. My scores are: Action/Adventure/Mystery: 7.5 Movie Overall: 7.0",Tomorrowland
68,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Tomorrowland,5,24 May 2015,"In the late 1990's or early 2000's, I read that George Clooney seemed bent on being pickier via his upcoming projects (after Batman & Robin, who could blame him). He has in fact, stayed true to this notion for most of the way. However, with The Monuments Men and another misguided mishap in 2015's Tomorrowland (my latest review), the Cloonster isn't being pickier. Now he's just ""picking"".Directed by Brad Bird (The Incredibles) and featuring plenty of green- screen overload, ""Tomorrow"" is a sci-fi threadbare that seems too complex for its own good. It's being promoted as a kid's movie mind you, a Disney movie. But there's too many thoughts and ideas coiled up here to facilitate even 130 minutes of running time. The pace for what its worth, is dictated on characters who bicker, fight, and talk rapidly. This is for all intensive purposes, to thrust the story along. What a travesty. Honestly, if I was a budding ten year-old, I'd probably exit the theater halfway through the second, combative act. Could it be that my inner brat is trying to get out and break free? Oh you know it.With injecting humor that is uncomfortably tongue-in-cheek (more like tongues bitten right off), enough cartoonish, PG-rated violence that is manageable, and a showcase of steely-eyed contraptions that would make Inspector Gadget jealous, Tomorrowland has a structure that is predicated on two flashbacks (one long and one short). The proceedings chronicle young Casey Newton (Britt Robertson). She's the daughter of a NASA engineer, a curious science nut, and after finding a pin that transports her to a futuristic borough (just think of 'Tomorrowland' in the same vein as The Emerald City from The Wizard of Oz), well she's tapped to save the world. In order to succeed, she aids in the help of an inventor who's already taken in the sumptuous scenery (Frank Walker played by George Clooney) and a robot that doesn't age over five decades (Athena played by Raffey Cassidy who gives the film's strongest performance). As the three renegades come together, the only obstacle standing in their way is another inventor who eventually becomes governor of 'Tomorrowland' (David Nix played by Hugh Laurie). He's content with our world frolicking in natural disasters, calamities, and civil disorder. This dude can see into the future and it don't look too bright.Now in terms of the acting, the leads are standardized in bringing their characters to life. It's the smaller roles and bit parts that come off as incredibly laughable. Anyway, Britt Robertson plays Casey Newton with a ton of overacting and reacting. After the final credits rolled, I realized that she's the closest thing to a female Shia Labeouf. Hollywood will probably embrace this and give said starlet more top billing. Does that mean I'm okay with it? Not really. But it doesn't matter because I don't have any say in the workings of Tinseltown. Then we have of course, George Clooney. He channels Frank Walker with a side of grumpy, a side of gruff and grizzled, and plenty of obligatory, Clooney head tilts. He looks bored but at least he looks bored and restless at the same time. That's a step up. Finally, we have Hugh Laurie playing the villainous David Nix. Listen, I think Laurie is a heck of an actor. What I don't get is why he would agree to spout such farcical soliloquies contained in ""Tomorrow's"" script. His speeches about the so-called ""end of the world"" and such feel more like acts of grandstanding than ploys to move an audience. And don't you just wish he'd don an American accent this time instead of using his normal, British one (that's just a personal preference for me)?Bad lectures and Shia Labeouf cloning aside, ""Tomorrow"" is the type of ragtag conundrum that harbors a big budget ($190 million). It's strained Spielbergian and I predict that it might not find its audience after opening weekend. I mean yeah it is somewhat visionary but its vision is also kind of skewed. Granted, this could almost be 2015's version of Dune or Wild Wild West (I have opted to call Clooney's latest, the ""Tinkertoy"" movie). And I might as well say this: Two instances could have occurred during production. The first one could of involved an inebriated David Lynch wandering on set and whispering something into director Brad Bird's ear. The second one could have revolved around Bird emailing the Wachowski siblings for secretive consultation. You know I'm kidding right. Or am I?All in all, Tomorrowland may have tip-top intentions and stilted aspirations. But it's mauled over with a preachy shtick and a little bit of manhandled cynicism. In one fell swoop, it settles in the ""land"" of the grandiloquent. The result: 2 stars.",Tomorrowland
69,rannynm,Tomorrowland Delivers Wow Factor Along With Important Messages,10,20 May 2015,"How can you describe this film, a film that is original (which is very rare these days), surprising (also rare) and it has a perfect ratio of pretty much everything! Tomorrowland is a movie of wow that makes you want to go out and do something knowing that nothing is impossible.This film has everything. It has a wonderful, heartwarming plot with a good 50/50 split of drama and comedy and is filled with many wonderful morals and messages. It can be called a tale, sci-fi, adventure and more. But, this film has something for everyone. Tomorrowland starts off showing a young high school girl named Casey (Britt Robertson) who is told that the world is being polluted, destroyed and slowly ending. She asks why something is not being done about it. One day, she finds a mysterious pin which takes her to a world not in the future, past or present, not on Earth. It is somewhere beyond our knowledge, known as Tomorrowland. She embarks on adventure trying to get there and meets many people including Frank Walker (George Clooney) who is a former child genius and actually lived in this place for some time.This film is truly an enjoyable experience to watch. Director Brad Bird does an extraordinary job making this a master piece. From the perfect cast to the original story, it is breathtaking to watch. The cinematography is perfect - not too modest and not to forced either. The cast is inspiring. George, Britt and the rest of the cast make jokes, deliver dramatic moments, and everything in between. The relationship between the main characters are sad at times, happy at times. They are heartwarming and draw you in. Disney has really outdone itself so many times and they surprise us again with a very original and nicely done film which will become the next phenomena. My favorite scene is when Casey, Frank and a girl named Athena (you must watch the film to learn more about this very special character) go to Paris and they launch something out of the Eiffel tower. It is action-packed, funny and stunning to watch. The special effects are out of this world and thrilling. There are so many moral messages. The main one is ""nothing is impossible and never stop questioning the world around you."" In the film, Casey never stops asking questions and, because of this, a very surprising thing happens.I recommend this film for kids ages 8 to18 and give it 5 out of 5 stars. This film is truly one of the greatest films of the year and wonderfully executed. It opens in theaters on May 22 so don't miss it.Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

70,Rob_Taylor,A good fun movie with a message of hope,8,17 April 2016,"So, before I get to the movie, a word about some of the negative reviews here. Wow, there are so many! I'm not sure if they saw the same movie as I did, or if they are all just devoid of a sense of wonder and fun, but there are an awful lot of people that really disliked this movie. Of course, when you read their ""arguments"" (I'll be generous and call them that), you realize that most of their discontent stems from the fact that they thought the movie was going to be something else entirely.I'm one of the most cynical and jaded moviegoers going and I'm always ready to rip a new celluloid butthole in any film that deserves it, but this film does not warrant some of the comments here. When I see people complaining this movie is too violent, or that it isn't a family movie, or any of the number of bemusing complaints, I wonder if they aren't exactly the kind of people that this movie warns its viewers about. Namely, those so obsessed with negativity, that they can't accept anything that is fun.This movie surprised me, because I had heard bad things about it and it was, in part, penned by Damon Lindelof, whose work it is fair to say I find by turns amusing (not in a good way) and irritating. I'm not sure how much of the story is down to him, but regardless, this counts as one of his better efforts in my book.So what will you get when you sit down to watch this movie? You'll get two hours or so of utterly harmless fun, aimed primarily at kids, but with enough more adult themes in it to entertain the adults among us. That said, it isn't at all offensive, or violent, and it isn't boring. It moves along at a decent pace. There are slower moments in it, but the action scenes move along briskly when they appear, and they appear quite often. Any violence on display at all is aimed squarely at robots.There is only one scene where I exclaimed out loud in surprise, because I wasn't expecting it at all, and that was when the little girl robot gets hit by a pickup truck out of nowhere. It's a bit of a shock, to be honest, but she is quickly shown to be unharmed by the incident. However, it might frighten some younger children for a moment, so be warned.I think a lot of the negativity this movie has received is down to the fact that at one point, the bad guy of the film (Hugh Laurie) spells out just how horrible people are and that their impending doom is entirely down to their own fault. There is a little speech that essentially blames people for their own lack of foresight and bone-idleness, which has led them to the brink of destruction.Now, I normally might find this sort of thing preachy and condescending, but it fits well in the context of the movie. However, some people, I think, aren't able to have fun poked at them and seem to have taken an unnecessary amount of offence at this, and taken it out on the movie as a whole.Despite this darker tone, the movie as a whole paints a hopeful vision, showing us that we can change our future if we really want to. The ending is a little cheesy, but it is a good kind of cheese, with the message that it is never too late to make a change.Overall, the movie is just a fun flick for kids and their parents. Older teens might be bored a little, but younger kids will love it. It isn't meant to be taken too seriously, but just enjoyed for what it is.Oh and for the person that suggested the movie was unsuitable for any child under fourteen, your kids have my sympathies. Oh my God! Their lives must be filled with so much cotton wool padding that they are perpetually on the verge of smothering to death. Good job!SUMMARY: Way more fun than its rating would have you believe. Generally harmless entertainment of a family nature. Don't take the negativity seriously, because the movie never takes itself seriously. Its fun, that's all there is to it.",Tomorrowland
71,yoggwork,The plot is fragmented,5,19 February 2019,"The plot is fragmented, and wants to show the ""future"" world, but is unwilling to give up the local links, but also self-righteous to start with a flashback. Then set the end of the world, disaster, climate, nuclear war are all there, in order to highlight 100%. Solutions remain as mentally retarded as ever",Tomorrowland
72,moviexclusive,"Like a seemingly thrilling theme park ride that never delivers a satisfying payoff, 'Tomorrowland' offers thrill in the journey but not in the discovery of what it really is",6,21 May 2015,"Very little has been said by its creators about 'Tomorrowland', so you can't quite blame us for feeling skeptical about this amusement- park adaptation. After all, pretty much all we know is that it has something to do with a teenage girl named Casey (Britt Robertson) who comes into possession of a magic pin capable of transporting her into the titular metropolis, almost just as soon finds herself being chased by a couple of 'men in black', and is saved (reluctantly) by a grumpy scientist played by George Clooney who has a rocket attached to his second- floor bathroom tub. But as we've come to realise, there is a good reason for all that secrecy; indeed, if there's one thing we will say now that we have been there and back, it is that the thrill is in the journey of discovering.Framing the narrative that follows is Clooney's curmudgeon inventor Frank Walker, who tussles with an off-camera female voice at the start over how to explain the context for our benefit. When he finally gets started, we find ourselves being acquainted with Frank when he was a young boy (Thomas Robinson), who brings his first big invention to the 1964 New York World's Fair. A retrofitted Electrolux vacuum cleaner that he intends as a jet pack, the contraception is scoffed at by a dismissive Hugh Laurie, but greeted with admiration by an enigmatic wise-beyond-her-years young girl named Athena (Raffey Cassidy). Athena invites Frank to follow her without telling him where she is headed, but after a brief ride through a wink-wink attraction called 'It's A Small World', Frank ends up making his first trip to the gleaming city of the future, or to be more accurate, a city situated on a whole different plane.Fast-forward many years later, and we are in Cape Canaveral, Fla, where we meet Casey for the first time. The daughter of a NASA engineer (Tim McGraw), Casey sabotages the imminent demolition of a NASA rocket launch site in hopes of keeping the space programme going. Her latest attempt gets her caught, and it is upon being bailed out that she first finds the small pin with a 'T' emblazoned on it. Her initial shock and disbelief aside, Casey is fascinated by the shiny skyscrapers at the end of the golden wheat fields and heads right towards them to find swooping highways, crystal spires, airborne automobiles, and spectacular multi-level cylinder-like swimming pools that allow you to plunge one into another. It's spectacular all right, and we are invited to share Casey's awe in a single extended tracking shot that follows her monorail ride through the futuristic city.Alas, the future which Casey glimpsed is already in the past, and as she soon learns from she-who-gifted-the-pin Athena, the Tomorrowland of today is a hollowed-out mausoleum of glass towers. This is also where we stop, and leave the rest for you to find out layer by layer. Why was Frank and Athena booted out of Tomorrowland? What is that invention Athena talks about which should never have been invented? How is this tied to Casey, or for that matter, the fate of the present world as she knows it? TV's Lost creator Damon Lindelof is one of the two screenwriters here, so be warned that his story does keep its cards very close to its chest, revealing just enough at each turn to sustain your intrigue. And yes, there's no denying that Lindelof, who co- wrote the script with director Brad Bird, has woven an engrossing mystery about the intertwining fates of three distinct characters that are surprisingly well-defined next to one another.Like we said earlier, the thrill is in the journey of discovering; and sure enough, what we eventually find is somehow not quite as exciting or groundbreaking as one may come to anticipate. To reveal the destination would inevitably spoil the trip itself, but suffice to say that Bird tries to make a statement about the future that pop culture seems all too happy to sell us these days and ends with a call to action. Yes, many commentators have already pointed out the film's message on how inaction and nonchalance leads to a self- fulfilling prophecy of doom and destruction, and notwithstanding Bird's noble intentions at using a big-budget studio movie to put across an earnest plea for imagination, hope and collective will, let us warn those who don't like to be lectured that it does get extremely preachy right before it ends.That however proves to be the lesser of its faults. Saddled with the need to deliver blockbuster action, Bird relegates the second half of his movie to a glorified chase movie. From Frank's house of booby traps to the Eiffel Tower and all the way to Tomorrowland before the big finish, we get the equivalent of a souped-up kiddie flick, so much so that when the Paris landmark transforms into an interstellar rocket ship launcher, we are left unimpressed. Conversely, too little time is spent in and around where we actually are spellbound, such that the Tomorrowland we see seems like the build-up for a ride that never took off, which is unfortunately how we end up feeling about the entire film once the answers we are looking for are in essence told to us through clunky exposition delivered in part by Clooney and in part by Laurie.For a film supposed to move its audience to think bold and stay positive, 'Tomorrowland' comes off feeling just 'meh'. There is excitement in finding out what it is all about, but once we do and that veil of secrecy is lifted, we are left thinking 'so, that's it?' And yet for all its promise, it neither leaves you much inspired nor even enthused; instead, it leaves you wanting, wanting for more adventure, more heart, more wow, and most of all, more of Tomorrowland.",Tomorrowland
73,denis888,"Incredibly Bad, Shallow Mess Of All Genres",2,31 May 2017,"Are you being serious, guys - this is a Disney movie? This awful mess of mish mash of nonsensical mess of a whole array of genres that do not mix, do not get along and do not make any plausible sense whatsoever. This is not a family movie due to a real plenty of terribly violence and bloody mess. This is not a sci-fi flick due to a preachy tone and candy-floss sweetly-sweetly approach. This is a real bastard of a movie with all the wrong elements thrown together to cook a very unstasty vapid brew that looks sweet but tastes sour and dated. George Clooney is OK, as well as Hugh Laurie, bit of it, but never further than plain average. Younger actors are plain generic and bland. This is a strange weird mixture of genres which do not go well together in any proportions and thus create a strangely looking fruit which only seems attractive, because the final is terribly shallow and utterly disappointing.",Tomorrowland
74,Sergeant_Tibbs,"Despite its many flaws, there's some refreshing escapism in Tomorrowland.",6,1 October 2015,"Whether at the helm of an animation in both dimensions or a big franchise, Brad Bird has proved himself to be one of the most refreshing action directors in the industry. Why people doubted Tomorrowland so much even after the intriguing marketing was beyond me, though surely it mostly stemmed from a script from Damon Lindelof. Yes, there's merit in their criticisms, but there's also some merit in the film even if it can be derivative. It's not quite the next Spielbergian blockbuster for the ages, but at least it has a heart that many other big movies neglect. However, with that heart comes a heavy-handed message of which must have struck an irritated nerve in its guilt trip. Thankfully it's mostly isolated in a single monologue from Hugh Laurie and besides that and a clunky opening - which has a framing device that feels like such an afterthought to get George Clooney in the movie quicker - it's a pretty solid movie. Otherwise, I'm quite glad the film traded Clooney off for the kids for the first half of the film. In the lead, Britt Robertson is a welcome new personality for Hollywood, like a more efficiently comic Jennifer Lawrence. A lot of the film's best moments come from the charm of its cast, especially when the core trio bicker, though I found Raffey Cassidy lacklustre until her character was justified. The complex relationship between her and Clooney's is fascinating but it's easy to see why it could make mainstream audiences uncomfortable. The film is very guilty of certain Lindelofisms with vagueness and loose mysteries but it grew on me steadily during the second act. There are certainly pacing issues where it's clear that they've had to pave over something deemed unusable. It's a mixed bag of strong hits and misses, but it never soars quite high or sinks too low, excluding its great score from Michael Giacchino. It's ultimately quite likable as a whole with some refreshing escapism. Bird's done better, and he will again in the future, namely The Incredibles 2.6/10",Tomorrowland

77,Screen_Blitz,Imaginative science-fiction adventure will please the family,7,27 November 2015,"This sci-fi action adventure, based on the popular attractions at the Walt Disney theme parks, follows the story of Casey Newton (played by Britt Robertson), a young teenager with a strong curiosity in science and technology who breaks in NASA's compound. After getting caught and arrested by cops, at the police station she receives a mysterious pin with a ""T"" on it. Upon picking it up, she instantly transports into an open field in a futuristic world known as ""Tomorrowland"". She begins exploring the futuristic environment of the land until the pin runs low on energy and she transported back into the real world. She enlisted the help of a disenchanted scientist Frank Walker (played by George Clooney), who knows about Tomorrowland, and an audio-automated robot named Athena (played by Raffey Cassidy), to travel the world of Tomorrowland where the future of the Earth is held and their actions affect how the future will sustain and the world around them. This is brought together by the visionary director Brad Bird who was responsible of the Pixar film 'The Incredibles' and 'Ratatouille'.Time-travel is one of those science-fiction genres that seems to be dying these days. This Disney sci-fi flick may not be one of the strongest entries in the genre, or perhaps anything original but is still quite a lot of fun and exciting for most children and adults alike. The plot is something of excitement and pulls viewers into some exhilarating action and moments filled with wild imagination such as the fights against the robots and the ray gun battles. These scenes treat viewers with some splendid special and visual effects, lots of CGI-heavy scenes ensue. While the plot is something fascinating, there are some times where the film gets a bit slow and muddling in terms of storytelling. My little brother (age 7) begin losing interest towards the end. There is a lot of mature discussions dealing with environmental change and how the future reflects on our actions. So the writing may not fall under the line of being the best aspect of the film, but is is still fun for the most of the part and the characters are quite likable as well. Britt Robertson does very great as the main character, George Clooney and Raffey Cassisdy also does an amazing job, though not as appealing the Robertson's character. Overall, Tomorrowland is a decent film that should appeal to not all, most families and offers an important message about how actions can affect the environment around you. While it is a great film, it isn't what I would call one of the best films of the yea as it still some noticeable flaws here and there.",Tomorrowland
78,Troy_Campbell,"Wonderous for kids, tad boring for adults.",6,2 June 2015,"This live-action Disney effort is nothing if not ambitious. Not only because of its grand aspirations from a story and visual perspective, but due to its firm targeting of a demographic rarely catered to specifically. Aimed at children who are outgrowing animated kiddie flicks and yet to progress to (the increasingly dark) mainstream blockbusters, Tomorrowland could be your child's first foray into intelligent, thought-provoking sci-fi. Big ideas wrapped up in a mystery-driven plot wrapped up in a fun chase movie, all delivered without pandering or condescending; the pre-teen audience fully respected in the process. A sense of wonder, of nervous excitement when venturing into the unknown, is captured superbly by director Brad Bird, and will no doubt allow those stuck-in-the-middle cinema-goers to connect on every level. But what about the rest of us? Unfortunately, those outside the key demographic are likely to experience a whole lot less wonder and excitement, but more eye-rolling and yawning. Narratively flawed, structurally tiresome and at least 30 minutes too long thanks to an inflated prologue and dragged out finale, it doesn't land the same punch for fully formed sci-fi enthusiasts. All, however, should delight in the numerous set pieces on display, not least a booby-trapped house sequence that is essentially Home Alone with lasers, as well as a toy store melee with a spot-the-Disney-reference bonus game. Tomorrowland will mean different things to different people, but my suggestion: see it with a family member aged between 8 and 12 (best guess, could be broader) and just watch their eyes fill up with amazement.",Tomorrowland

I gave my review a spoiler alert although I'm not sure I understood much of what happened, so I'm not sure how much I could ""spoil"" anything. Before the movie started I was wondering randomly whether I really wanted to continue seeing Disney movies, their God-less, asexual, politically correct orientation has so little interest for me. I say with a little trepidation that this could have been an interesting movie. But beyond the Peter Pan Disney culture which permeates this movie, there were two major problems: 1) similar to other recent movies, there wasn't much character development, so we understood that this character had these traits, but we never really understood why they do what they do (including the bad guys); and 2) this was way too complicated. And add 3), some stuff happens that looks good but doesn't make much sense. For example, late in the movie the good guys arm a bomb and then seem relieved when it explodes harmlessly. Huh? But in the end my biggest beef is with Disney's sterile, infant's-eye view of Nirvana - which, in shameless self-promotion, seems to be sponsored by Disney. I'm not sure I can agree that ""Imagination is greater than Knowledge"" (aren't they both important?). So it's the pretentiousness of this I find most offending.

81,one9eighty,Family fun Sci-Fi adventure - better than the reviews led me to believe it would be!,7,24 February 2021,"How many times have you heard ""Disney"" and ""Bombed at the Box Office""? Not many times , so, sit back and let me tell you about ""Tomorrowland: A World Beyond"" which was directed and co-written by Brad Bird who also directed ""The Iron Giant"" (1999), ""The Incredibles"" (2004), ""Ratatouille"" (2007), ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" (2011), and went on to direct ""Incredibles 2"" in 2018.In detail
In the past, 1964, a boy genius, Frank Walker, finds his way into an alternative dimension called Tomorrowland. It is a place where the cleverest people can co-exist to make a better reality. Fast-forward to the present, presumably 2005, and Casey Newton is living with her brother under the watchful eye of single father Eddie Newton in Cape Canaveral. Space exploration is a forgotten thing, and Eddie being an space flight engineer spends his time working in his garage, which Casey, in her spare time is sabotaging the removal of the rocket platform that is on the outskirts of town. Casey is a genius in her own right and dreams about going into space, she is forever asking the question how to fix the world she lives in. One day she receives a mysterious pin that shows her a vision of Tomorrowland. Hungry for more she attempts to find out about the pin, and gain entry to the mysterious place. She is eventually tracked down by Athena who hails from Tomorrowland and is trying to recruit Casey to help the future of existence. In order to help, Athena convinces Casey to get a much older and grumpy Frank Walker onside too. The idea is that Athena needs both Frank and Casey to stop the world from going through a catastrophic event that kill be the downfall of humanity. The journey to save the World, via Tomorrowland starts - but the trio are tested on the way by conspiracy theories who want in on Tomorrowland, and also by the hierarchy of Tomorrowland itself.In 180 characters
Possibly child genius recruited by mysterious age-less child from alternative reality, to find ex-child genius and save the world. Colourful family adventure from Disney with George Clooney leading the cast.The film tries to recapture a failing passion in the world for some of the things that Walt Disney initially tired to bring to his media and parks - space, futurism, and a sort of utopia. It's a sci-fi adventure film which is mostly grounded on Earth, and an alternative reality of Earth, but does have a moment in space too. ""Tomorrowland"" is a colourful and imaginative film which is visually pretty to look at and flows nicely. Although I am an adult these days, this is still a fun filled film which is as entertaining to me now, as it would have been in my pre-teenage years too.George Clooney leads the cast being a seasoned A-lister that he is. His range is not really tested in this and his performance is not that far removed from other family films he has appeared in. Stealing the show though are Britt Robertson and Raffey Cassidy who both feel like a good fit for a Disney film. They are fresh and deliver solid performances in their roles. While neither necessarily being Oscar worthy in this, when I compare what they bring against other live-action Disney films of the past, they both fit the bill well and come across as authentic.I have mentioned that the film is visually good. There is a lot of CGI in this film and for the most part it is not off-putting and distracting. This is fuelled by Disney's Industrial Light & Magic, which does not put too many footsteps wrong in this feature. I am fairly sure that this would have blown my mind if I were watching this as a young boy - sure, it's on the family friendly side so it wouldn't necessarily be as cool as something like ""Tron"" (1982) or ""Transformers"" (1986), but it would have still enthralled me. It was hard for as an adult not to see some of the continuity errors that cropped up from time to time (there were a load of them!), but I easily overlooked them because of the sense of fun that was been delivered.I watched this film with my wife, and it is fair to say that she did not enjoy this. She claimed that she feels robbed of 2 hours of her life. Likewise, I have spoken to other people that thought this was a bit weak too. On the other hand, I know that there are some audiences who loved this and cannot understand the negativity and how it bombed at the box office (it cost $190 million and earned $210 million). I kind of sit on the fence, with my feet dangling in the positivity side of the garden. I enjoyed this film, but I know that not everybody will do - I did. It was a fun family adventure which used a Disney-esque steampunky (very loosely of course) sci-fi element, and it made me think of the live action films of Disney's past that I enjoyed, the kind of films that Disney made before they went whole-hog on animation epics. Films like: ""The Island at the Top of the World"" (1974), ""Escape to Witch Mountain"" (1975), ""the Cat From Outer Space"" (1978), ""The Black Hole"" (1979), ""Tron"" (1982), ""The Flight of the Navigator"" (1986), and even ""Flubber"" (1997).So, it may be a film that will divide audiences, but if you give it a go it can still be plenty of fun.

I took my girlfriend with me after telling her that I'll pay for the tickets. However, I didn't enjoy watching Tomorrowland as much as I thought I would. That's because there are a number of problems with this film. Firstly, this is more of an adventure film than a science fiction film. It's not so much about Tomorrowland as it is about getting to Tomorrowland. Secondly, while the characters are a likable group of people, they're not that interesting and their motivations aren't that clear. This is mostly a fault of the screenplay by Damon Lindelof. By the way, I was a bit impressed that they were able to find a young actor (Thomas Robinson) who actually resembles George Clooney. And, for once, we get to see a robot in a movie that's good and helpful and not bad and menacing. Thirdly, Tomorrowland is not a well-paced film. Scenes just happen, and you don't get the feeling that there's much of a purpose to what's going on. Logic also goes out the window during some scenes. Perhaps this wouldn't have been such a problem if a number of exciting action scenes were included. But there's hardly any action in the film. The best thing about Tomorrowland is the special effects. This is what one would expect from a $190 million production by Walt Disney Pictures. Tomorrowland itself is mostly a well-designed place. It's a futuristic city that one would definitely want to visit. It's best presented in one memorable lengthy sequence after Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) touches the T pin. But, again, the way that it's presented is best suited for a young audience because Tomorrowland seems more like a theme park than a place where people actually live. And in Disneyland it is a futuristic themed land. Before going to see this film, I watched many of the promotional videos on the internet. The filmmakers and actors mentioned that Tomorrowland is about optimism and innovation. This is something that, I think, works well in the film. While I was watching it I did get the feeling that I can get things done. This message of achievement and positivity is in great contrast to our current stagnant culture of doom and gloom. In a way, Tomorrowland is meant to represent the 1950s and 1960s, a time when things were much better in America. So, do I recommend the film? Yes, I recommend the film. It is, for the most part, enjoyable to watch. It has a good message. But keep in mind that it's a film for children, so adults won't like it as much because the end result is more formulaic than inspired.",Tomorrowland
85,RforFilm,"The bright Ideas of Tomrrowland should have fixed story before fixing the future, but I still had fun",7,1 June 2015,"Flying jetpacks, daily rockets to the moon and robot that help us in daily lives; this all sounds like something that you would find on The Jetsons. This, a long with much of the science fiction before 1970, showed a future where everything has become easier and where mankind has put aside their differences to make the world a high tech candy land. I recall watching that cartoon a long with the more optimistic future ideas from Walt Disney on the Disney Channel, back when they had a Vault Disney segment in the evenings. Being that this was the vision of the world of today, what was my world of tomorrow going to be like?The future that I had grown up with had turned out much darker. I'm not talking about the world were living in, but the ones that have been presented to us in film and television. The ones where killer machines, deadly weather or even totalitarian governments have stolen our tomorrow. Why the sudden shake up with the way we have shown the future. I trace it back to the energy crisis of the seventies where people suddenly realized that to power ourselves, we still need energy and resources that could abruptly run out. With a future of fear, the heroes of Tomorrowland look to fix the future. A young woman Casey (played by Britt Robertson) is a brilliant optimist who truly believes in what our future can be and hates listening to the current news of climate change, political turmoil and third world countries starving. She gets arrested after attempting to sabotage a construction crew from demolishing the NASA shuttle launching point that her father Eddie (played by Tim McGraw) works for. Upon receiving her items back from the police, one such piece is a pin that when touched, finds herself in a beautiful futuristic city where anything is possible. She's confronted by a young girl Athena (played by Raffey Cassidy) who reveal herself as a audio animatronic who was built in the wonderful place called Tomorrowland. Upon asking how to get there, Athena leads Casey to the home of the last person to go there, Frank Walker. Upon arriving, Frank (played by George Clooney) is a grumpy hermit who refuses to do anything. An attack by other robots changes his mind and with rocket bathtubs, a spaceship inside the Eiffel Tower and teleportation, they make it to Tomorrowland where it's leader David Nix (played by Hugh Laurie) has given up on the future. Casey believes it can be fixed.With Brad Bird (director of The Incredibles, and Ratatouille) running the show, expectations were very high to deliver a high-octane, engaging mystery about a future that could have been. Honestly, It's not up there, but I still had fun. All of the actors (especially newcomer Raffey Cassidy) are great. The look and design of Tomorrowland is amazing. This is one of best looking high tech worlds I've seen (they make it clear it's a vision from the past) and makes me want to step into the film to take a stroll.The actors, design, and even the journey is all ready to go. What falters is the story. For a movie that's based on a land at Disneyland, it's surprisingly complicated that took me a while to patch up the pieces to understand what was going on. The first half, which was more of a chase scenario, was great. Once they get to Tomorrowland, the story tries to juggle having a positive outlook on the future and saving the Earth, but it's that kind of complicated storytelling that will turn off a mainstream audience that Disney is usually accustomed to catering.I'll give this seven pins out of ten. I felt happy enough with this optimistic story that I think most families will enjoy this. I'd say that children are the best audience for this. It's not that adults won't like it (I'm twenty-eight and I liked it), but it's the film's message that most children need to hear these days. I'd say that if your willing to have a great big beautiful tomorrow, then Tomorrowland will make for a satisfying summer movie, though not much of a conversation starter.",Tomorrowland
86,Quietb-1,Interesting on a lot of levels.,8,28 May 2015,"Here's a big loud science fiction fantasy that is reality based. The message is there is still time to save the world. Do something about it.The movie is a tad too long. It seems to take way to long to get back to the George Clooney character after his first introduction. The cast is excellent. Expect to see a lot more from Raffey Cassidy as she shines here as Athena. The movie benefits from a theatrical environment. A big screen and big sound helps the rousing score. While the movie is rated PG, it may be too intense or just plain too scary for younger kids. Looking for the definition of a ""Hollywood Ending"" look here.",Tomorrowland

88,agmoldham,Nothing original here,3,10 October 2015,"Tomorrowland is a time travel movie that doesn't really have anything original to say about the genre. The movie follows the life of Frank Walker who is played by George Clooney as a grown up and Thomas Robinson as a child. Frank is very interested in science which results in him being given the opportunity to investigate the future.Have to confess that I saw this movie on the small screen, so I suppose it is possible that the special effects may have lifted the movie on a large screen. There wasn't very much in the script or acting to get exciting and Clooney didn't seem especially enthused by the role. Maybe those that are especially interested in time travel or Clooney should give, but for everyone else give it a miss!",Tomorrowland
89,MihaiSorinToma,An unexploited fantastic world,7,7 September 2017,"A curious science-passionate girl receives a special badge which gives her the ability to enter a trans-dimensional world, but for a limited time. Thus, she meets an exiled inventor which will guide her to that world which seems to have many problems of its own.It's a very interesting idea which attracted me from the beginning, but, as it happens with many movies of this kind, soon fades away due to bad implementation or exploitation. They, for some unknown reason, decided not to focus so much on the fantastic world which had a lot to tell and instead presented in detail the life of an annoying young girl and her forced attempt to enter the fantasy world. As I said, intended or not, her character is very rebel and annoying, asks a lot of stupid and useless questions, contrary to what you would expect from someone passionate for science, while having a lot of attitude issues which simply end up on your nerves. Clooney's character isn't far from hers but is on a much lower lever, managing to be even funny at times. The plot is very linear, without any twist, predictable and with a sudden happy ending which is far from satisfactory.I don't understand why they decided to present it this way, when they had a huge new world which could have kept the viewer amazed and entertained for a long time, especially with its raise and fall, not to mention the amazing animations and details. It had so much potential, but somehow managed to make it almost dull.",Tomorrowland
90,bryank-04844,'Tomorrowland' isn't the Disney movie we hoped for.,5,27 July 2015,"There's one hell of a cast and crew at work here for Disney's 'Tomorrowland', which is loosely based on the famous theme park at Disney resorts. Directed by Brad Bird ('The Incredibles', 'Ratatouille', and the recent 'Mission Impossible' film), produced by Damon Lindelof ('Lost' and 'Star Trek'), and starring George Clooney, Hugh Laurie, and Britt Robertson, 'Tomorrowland' is a throwback to those old innovative Disney films full of adventure. I felt like a kid again through its two hour run time as I was watching each suspenseful and fun moment on the IMAX screen. That being said, 'Tomorrowland' does have a few problems, but fortunately the good outweighs the bad this time around.The film follows Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) and Frank Walker (George Clooney) who cross paths when they realize they have been to the same mysterious place when touching a certain pin button known as Tomorrowland. We see that Frank was there as a child, but is now a crotchety old man who is more bitter than sour milk, where a teenage Casey is as optimistic as they come. This place called Tomorrowland is a magical place not in this visual place where the brightest and smartest people have come together to make the world and human race a better place.Basically, it's pure euphoria, which is actually what Walt Disney and his fellow co- workers did in creating Epcot, which was to showcase the best inventions for a better tomorrow. But something went wrong somewhere, as Frank knows exactly when the world will end. Casey and him, along with a young special girl named Athena (Raffey Cassidy) set out to get back to 'Tomorrowland' to confront the person in charge (Hugh Laurie) in order to reverse the destruction of the world.With all of the dazzling effects, robots, futuristic landscapes and inventions, and jet packs, 'Tomorrowland' looks incredible on every level. The amount of imagination and detail that went into every prop and invention is stunning, and made my eyes widen with wonder, just like when I was a kid watching sci-fi films for the first time. However, there were downfalls with this movie too, one being that it dragged on a bit too long with the script really going overboard with political and social views. It happened more than once and they literally hammered it all the way in, detailing what they thought.It was completely out of place and took out the magic of the film in these moments. Another little annoying quality was that the story was somewhat narrated by Frank and Casey, which would be fine, but there was a running joke where the young teenager would always interrupt the old guy when he was narrating. It became tedious and unfunny after the second time it happened. Despite a few script issues and pacing problems, 'Tomorrowland' still packs enough adventure and amazement to satisfy the summer movie blockbuster crowd. There is a great scene set in a comic book and toy store that brought memories back to me that starred Keegan Michael Key and Kathryn Hahn as the store owners, complete with all the 'Star Wars' figures you could want. It had me rolling.'Tomorrowland' isn't the Disney movie we hoped for, and several plot points are there one minute and gone the next, including a very 'Matrix' like villain similar to Agent Smith. That all being said, there are enough positive things here to keep adults and kids entertained, but don't expect them to purchase any of the toys.",Tomorrowland
91,witster18,stuck between 6 and 7,7,2 November 2015,"The first hour is great! Amazing visuals, great action, good characters... no complaints.The film seems to have a good premise to start, but the last 45 minutes really fails to pull it all together and in the end it's the plot that is a little light. The meaning/intent is there, but the story- telling in the second-half wanes a bit, and everything that made the first 2/3rd's of the film great, goes missing down the stretch.I almost gave this a 7 anyway because the set-up and middle portions of the film are aces... really, really good stuff.I was 'pinned' to the screen for the first hour, and then with 10 minutes left in the film I was completely losing interest. I'm still giving this a passing grade and mildly recommending it because the first half is just so great. Kid-friendly Sci-fi that starts this strong is hard to come by. Some good performances and a little humor helps the entire film. I could have used even less 'tomorrowland' and more real world with Raffey Cassidy and George Clooney. It just seemed like a very intriguing story and state-of-the-art effects to start with, but fizzled to an anti-climactic ending.64/100 this could actually hold onto a top 25 spot with the way this year has gone.",Tomorrowland

93,virek213,Disney Goes Ultra-Futuristic In TOMORROWLAND,9,24 May 2015,"Disney, with only a handful of notable exceptions, (THE BLACK HOLE; 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, and WALL-E chief among them), has not really gone whole hog into the science fiction genre all that much in its history. But with the 60th anniversary of the opening of Disneyland in Anaheim (an event that took place in July 1955) in mind, they went ahead and made TOMORROWLAND, a cinematic, special effects-laden expansion of what is perhaps the most popular section of that park.In doing this kind of film, which asks us to imagine and subsequently make a better world out of one that seems rapidly heading towards apocalypse, the film's director Brad Bird (RATATOUILLE; MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL) has taken what must seem like a radical approach for what we normally think of as ""Disney fare."" In it, George Clooney portrays a cynical grumpy inventor whose idea of a jet pack, which he built when he was a kid, bombed at the 1964 Worlds Fair in New York, who encounters an extremely inquisitive and adamantly optimistic teen (Britt Robertson), and subsequently takes her and a robot child named Athena (newcomer Raffey Cassidy) on a journey to change a future that is rapidly going downhill in all the many ways people in the late 20th century had warned about. The subsequent journey is filled with a lot of peril, some of it fairly hair-raising (even for a 'PG'-rated Disney film), and a lot of twists, turns, and ponderings of space-time continuum that we saw in the 2014 sci-fi epic INTERSTELLAR, and which would make visionaries like Arthur C. Clarke, Rod Serling, and Ray Bradbury beam with pride in the Great Beyond they occupy. Hugh Laurie, known for his extremely caustic role on the Fox hit show ""House M.D."", portrays the sinister Nix, who nevertheless gives the admonishment that a bleak future is always preventableif there were only more young people like Robertson (and her NASA engineer father, played by country music star Tim McGraw) to make it happen.The lengths that this movie goes are so outside of what we think of as traditional Disney convention. Occasionally, it is a touch preachy, but nevertheless very fantastic, and willing to bend the Disney narrative for the sake of futuristic cinematic storytelling that might otherwise have been left to a Stanley Kubrick or Steven Spielberg. Bird, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Damon Lindelof (the two also co-authored the story with Jeff Jensen), really does a great deal of mixing science fiction and fantasy with typical Disney charm. In short, even if TOMORROWLAND is in some ways a plug for its flagship theme park on its 60th anniversary, it never flags once during its 130 minute running time.",Tomorrowland
94,timdalton007,Welcome To Tomorrowland,8,22 May 2015,"Tomorowland (or as it was originally titled 1952) has been much talked about for awhile now. Despite a drip and drab social media campaign that dropped hints about the film, little had been revealed about it until close to its release date which added an air of mystery to it. Opening this weekend with a cast including George Clooney and Hugh Laurie, the latest film from director Brad Bird (who also directed The Incredibles) looks to be an intriguing piece of work. Is it though?It's certainly got it's share of good performances. Though Clooney has top billing, the real star of the film is Britt Roberston as the young and optimistic Casey. Living in times that stand in stark contrast to her world view, she becomes the soul of the film with everything literally revolving around her. Robertson wonderfully portrays both a sense of awe and also believability as she is trust into a world can be as threatening as it is awe inspiring.Contrasting with her is Clooney as Frank Walker. The film opens with Walker as a boy genius at the 1964 World's Fair (played by the delightful Thomas Robinson) and it is through him that we're introduced to the titular Tomorrowland. From there we, and Casey, find him as a reclusive and cynical adult who she forces to confront his past and possibly our future. Clooney, who has always seemed to be a bit out of time anyways, is perfect casting for the role and his world weariness makes for a wonderful contrast to Robertson's Casey. Watching the interactions between the two of them is one of the film's many highlights.That's not to undersell the rest of the cast. There's Laurie in a role that's hard to easily define but which he fits perfectly despite his limited amount of screen time which largely comes in the film's last act. Looking like a throwback to live action Disney protagonists of the 1950s and 60s is Raffey Cassidy as Athena though the role she plays is quite different to any of those characters. The cast also includes Tim McGraw and Pierce Gagnon as Casey's family, Kathryn Hahn and Keegan-Michael Key as a pair of interesting characters plus sci-fi fans might spot Stargate franchise actors Paul McGillion, David Nykl and Garry Chalk in small roles. Together they form a nice ensemble that populates the film and surrounds its lead actors.The highlights of the film might be in its production values. The production design and costumes range from a wonderful recreation of the 1964 World's Fair and a couple of Disney related attractions there to the near future and Tomorrowland itself. The results are a wonderful mixing of past with present, retro views of the future with a world quite similar to the one we live in now. In terms of design, Tomorrowland itself is a feast for fans of the genre with its wonderful use of everything from jet packs to 1950s rockets. Adding to that atmosphere is the score from composer Michael Giacchino which musically encapsulates what the film does visually while also properly underscoring events unfolding on screen. The results are a feast for the viewer's eyes and ears.The film is also something that seems increasingly rare: a film you can take the entire family to. While it features plenty of action sequences, there's no real gun-play or gore. The film also proves that one can do an effective science fiction/action film without resorting to dropping foul language in every other piece of dialogue. The results are oddly refreshing to say the least, especially as the film counteracts its sometimes dark themes with just the right amount of well timed humor. All of which is important because of what the underlying message of the film is.More than anything, Tomorrowland is a film about optimism and hope. It's safe to say we live in cynical (if not outright depressing) times where it seems that everything around us is out to kill us and that the world is going to hell. Tomorrowland calls back with nostalgia to a time when they wasn't the case and, using Clooney's Frank Walker character, shows us how we made the journey from optimistic futurism to the dystopia-fearing world we live in. Yet, through Robertson's Casey, shows that maybe we can recover that hope and start moving again. It's a message that seems to be working its way into popular media in recent times, including both the galaxy spanning Interstellar and the time altering antics of X-Men: Days Of Future Past from last year, yet I feel this film expresses that message better than either of those films. It may waller in that sentiment but it's better for doing so.None of which is to say that it's perfect though. The film's pacing seems a bit off somehow with the script by Bird and Damon Lindelof as it does seem to rush from one bit of spectacle to another. The film raises a lot of questions but only provides suitable answers for some of them, leading to characters and subplots that are underdeveloped (such as Laurie's character for example). Weirdly though, especially given the message at the film's heart, that seems almost forgivable. Bird, his cast and crew are taking us on a ride and we are invited to settle in for it with the underlying message being more important that the plot itself.In the final analysis, while the film perhaps has its faults, the positives far outweigh them. From its performances, strong visuals and stirring score, it calls back to the future that might have been while also addressing the world that we live in now. It's a tale of optimism and hope with a message we ought to be embracing. One can only hope that we do.",Tomorrowland

96,griffolyon12,"""Tomorrowland"" is Nothing Short of Superb",9,23 May 2015,"The latest Disney film, Tomorrowland, is a wonder of imagination, breathing with more originality than the title leads one to believe. As a matter of fact, this film has very little to do with the Disney parks other than the concept of what Walt Disney always wanted Tomorrowland to represent. While there is a very fun excursion to the 1964 World's Fair where Disney premiered the ""It's a Small World"" ride, that is where the Disney connection ends and the real story begins. So what is the titular Tomorrowland exactly?Well, Tomorrowland is a city in a parallel dimension to our own where some of the brightest minds -- both creative and scientific -- convened to try and create a better future for our tomorrow. In the film, teenager Casey Newton (played very likably by Britt Robertson) is given a tiny pin with the Tomorrowland logo on it that when she touches she is presented with visions of Tomorrowland. These visions set her on a quest to figure out what this amazing place is that she is seeing, and on that quest she meets an android girl with some pretty awesome martial arts moves named Athena, a cadre of robots hunting Casey down trying to keep her from uncovering the secrets of Tomorrowland, and a grumpy George Clooney, who portrays Frank Walker, a former child genius who once lived in Tomorrowland but was exiled. Frank is the only one who can take Casey there, and thus their adventure to reach Tomorrowland shifts into high gear.Few movies nowadays have the breadth of imagination that this one has, not to mention its sense of optimism for the future. Yes, the world is ultimately at stake here from annihilation (but would it be an adventure film if it wasn't), and yes, the movie probably wont appeal to all, but to anyone who still dares to dream, Tomorrowland is the old-fashioned sci-fi adventure film you didn't know you've been waiting for. Director Brad Bird has crafted a film that mixes mystery, wonder, and suspense beautifully with touching human moments between characters, both man and machine, and some wonderfully executed comedic beats as well. This is the kind of movie that I grew up on, the kind that Disney used to make and should make more of. I could easily have seen Fred MacMurray in the George Clooney part and Haley Mills as Casey, that's how old school Disney this film feels to me. With that said, George Clooney proves to be a worthy successor to MacMurray, and Britt Robertson really proves herself here as a leading lady. It is Robertson's awestruck reactions and well-timed comedic chops that sell the wonders of this movie and grounds them in humanity. From top-to-bottom, Tomorrowland just works.The musical score by Michael Giacchino is one of his best in years, mixing his usual style with that of an old-fashioned adventure film score that really sells all of the epic, beautiful, and wondrous moments that this film features. Then there are the fellow cast members, with Raffey Cassidy being a particular standout as the android girl, Athena. The warmth and charm that Cassidy has as Athena really contradicts the traditional portrayal of robots on screen and actually makes you believe that maybe our future with robots is not annihilation, but actually to live side-by-side with them. Ultimately, that's what this movie is all about.Tomorrowland is a movie about the future and about recapturing our collective sense of optimism as a race. As a whole, we are too pessimistic and cynical. The news that is reported is all mostly negative, the movies that we watch are all dystopias about death and destruction more than they ever are about hope. This is the idea that Bird and company wanted to get across with Tomorrowland and they do so brilliantly. Add on to that the idea that anyone can be special and change the world if they just have a dose of optimism, and I really think that Walt Disney himself would have loved everything that this movie says and does. So if any of this sounds appealing to you, go see Tomorrowland. You wont regret it.",Tomorrowland

Those are few of the words and phrases that come to mind in describing the new Disney movie, Tomorrowland. However, it is Magnificent that cries out for expression. This film is one of the greatest science fiction films ever made as well as simply one of the greatest motion pictures ever made, period. Gifted director Brad Bird creates a world that is overwhelming in its beauty and epic in scope. It is a visionary view of the future and when Oscar time comes around, Bird will certainly be holding one in his talented hands.

98,SquigglyCrunch,Unexplored Potential,5,26 October 2015,"I was somewhat looking forward to this movie, but that excitement died as soon as the ratings came out. Nevertheless, I went and saw it with my family. It really wasn't anything special. The idea of Tomorrowland is interesting, and the plot was well-presented enough, but it was never fully explored, leaving me unsure about what had happened by the time I'd finished it. The characters were only okay. They weren't super well developed, but they weren't horrible either. They were just average. Tomorrowland features my biggest movie pet peeve, which is showing the end at the beginning. Now this doesn't necessarily make a bad movie, but they kept referring back to it to build tension or show some meaningless scene that although makes sense in the end, feels forced and used simply to increase the run time of the movie. Probably my biggest complaint about this movie is something small, but it bothered me way too much. The climax had an obvious solution, but it wasn't done until it was already over. You'll understand if you watch/watched the movie yourself. This single, poorly thought out scene really took away from it for me, no matter how small it may seem. Other than the idea itself, the best part of the the movie was Britt Robertson. Not that she was a particularly good actor, but she's just good- looking, and made the movie at least a little easier to watch (I haven't seen her in any other movies, so this was a nice surprise). Yes, this is shallow, but nevertheless it played a role in the ease of getting through the movie. Overall, Tomorrowland had an interesting story and idea, but was poorly presented with a poorly planned climax, and thus suffered. Everything else was average (except Britt Robertson), which may have allowed it a higher rating, but with everything on top of it the average-ness couldn't support it. If you did enjoy it, good for you, but if not, then we more or less agree. If your interested in Tomorrowland, then give it a watch. It's not horrible, but it's not particularly great either.",Tomorrowland

100,DareDevilKid,"Ambitious, Visually Stunning, Evocative, and Strikes a Major Cord",8,22 September 2015,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.8/5 starsIn the modern world, youngsters are decreasingly optimistic about their chances of having an impact on the world in which they live. ""Tomorrowland"" hopes to turn that concept on its head by giving the youth around the world a lofty goal to which to aspire.Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) is a passionate, dedicated young woman. Her father (Tim McGraw), a NASA engineer, is on the brink of losing his job as the premiere-international, space-research agency dismantles one of its legendary shuttle launch pads. Through careful midnight excursions, she disables vehicles and ensures that work will prolong each day just a bit longer. Eventually, she's apprehended. After being released, she discovers a bright pin among her belongings that allows her to see a vision of an alternate dimension for which she craves.When the medallion loses its power, Casey goes in search of this Utopia, uncovering a strange conspiracy that prevents the world from discovering that this future not only exists, but the real world in which we live is also headed toward a major catastrophe. Alongside an aging conspiracy junkie (George Clooney) and an automaton/super- android from this futuristic world (Raffey Cassidy), she embarks on an odyssey to save the future and ensure that those who can realize it get their inspiration.Walt Disney may have been a flawed individual, but there's no denying that he always had a profound passion for molding the minds of young viewers and encouraging them to reach out beyond their moribund existences and strive to become something better. Created on a strict budget from 1955 to 1956, Tomorrowland was envisioned as a part of Disneyland that would highlight the future, focus on scientific discovery,and act as a catalyst for impressionable minds. Disney's feature version, directed by gifted action-helmer Brad Bird, strives to encapsulate Walt's massive vision of a bright and optimistic future and Bird, along with co-writers Damon Lindelof and Jeff Jensen, largely succeed.Aided in no small part by the talented Robertson, ""Tomorrowland"" keeps the action intense for large parts of the film, slowing down just long enough to give the audience an idea of what's going on. Perhaps a bit too motivated by verbal recitation of backstory, the concept is solid and mostly transcends those minor drawbacks. Robertson infuses Casey with the type of wide-eyed wonder we often envisage our young visionaries having. Her constant perky desire to explore and expand her knowledge is infectious, rooting the audience clearly in favor of her victory, however expected it is. She's a charming, affable presence that frequently boosts her co-stars' scenes, even those she shares with the incredibly familiar Clooney.Clooney seems particularly well suited to working alongside young actors. As was evident in ""The Descendants"" when he starred alongside the sublime, Oscar-worthy Shailene Woodley, he recognizes when his scene partners need to shine beyond him, and relinquishes those moments with little concern for his own ego. Clooney and Robertson work so well together that it would be great to see them show up in future features together.""Tomorrowland's"" loving appreciation for the strength of its characters' passions enables the audience to feel emotionally invested in their success. It's a Disney film, so their success is largely guaranteed even if the obstacles in the way are particularly onerous. This inevitability isn't a detriment in this case. It improves the film's credibility as a visionary exploration of bolstered self-confidence. It wants the audience to identify with the characters so that they'll be inspired to break out of the conformity that seems to be constantly pressing in on them in today's society It wants us all to see that the future can only happen if we fight for it. Letting others create and advance our culture while we're perpetually absolved of responsibility creates a passive society, one which can be more easily manipulated by those in power.I would seldom give Disney credit for subversion, since many of its films are cotton candy commodities designed to rake in boatloads of cash. However, Bird is a byproduct of the Pixar brain trust, a group accustomed to taking on subversive topics in the guise of free- market entertainment. ""Tomorrowland"" owes a great deal of its inspiration to the works of Pixar, where topics of concern for our modern world are embellished with grand adventures and humor. While not nearly as perfect as many of those Pixar efforts, the influence is obvious and the result all but approaches that level of excellence.",Tomorrowland
101,dragokin,contemporary entertainment,5,14 May 2015,"Tomorrowland is one of those movies that appears to be a litmus test for the audience on IMDb. Either they'd give it the maximum number of stars and it would be seen as useful by like-minded people. Or they'd get revolted by the high rating and opt for one star to get the rating in balance. The truth is clearly somewhere in-between, as my rating demonstrates.I'm not sure whether i'm getting old or simply appreciate my spare time, but as the time goes by i can't relax and enjoy the CGI overkill of contemporary entertainment. Tomorrowland is probably not the best example, since it has a story, unlike other giants of modern cinema, such as Godzilla, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Transformers: Age of Extinction, 300 Rise of an Empire, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1, just to name a few.But i might be too harsh on those movies, since it seems that the moviegoers of today want their money's worth of action. Besides, i wasn't sure whether i've been the right target audience for Torrowland. I guess this was supposed to be some kind of fairy tale. Discussing actors' performance or character development would be beyond the point.Anyhow, go see Tomorrowland to switch off from everyday activities, then forget Tomorrowland and get back to reality.",Tomorrowland
102,bregund,Three-fifths of a good movie,4,27 September 2017,"This film starts out exciting, with a young woman slowly discovering a mysterious world that exists in another dimension, but you can almost see the point at which the writers started quarreling about which direction to take the story. For some reason they get in a ball that transports them to the Eiffel tower, and then it's another trip in a rocket into outer space and then back to earth, and then there is endless monologuing and gibberish at yet another portal back to earth...it goes on and on like this, save the whales, global thermonuclear war, the girl's childhood home is flooded; if only she can prevent the future by destroying some hackneyed, thrown-together sci-fi phenomenon that somehow powers Tomorrowland. None of it makes any sense. Why even have the pin? The robots break their necks trying to kill Clooney & company, but once they arrive in Tomorrowland, Hugh Laurie decides to safely return them to earth...why not just kill them like the robots were trying to do all along? Hard to see this as a family film, several people are violently killed, and the product placement doesn't even try to be subtle. Glad I didn't pay to see this in a theater.",Tomorrowland
103,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Look Who's Preaching,1,23 May 2015,"Veiled in sparse, mysterious promotion, TOMORROWLAND is, well, kind of based on the section of Disneyland providing a retro-reversed future, viewed through the awe-inspired eyes of the 1950's when true Science Fiction reigned and dreams were storybook creative and Utopian deluxe.Starting out as a ROCKETEER meets CONTACT, we have two young heroes – first a brilliant boy who will grow into George Clooney; and then a determined girl who receives a magical pin to enter the titular location that includes a monorail (sans the rail) and other futuristic CG visuals, as if George Lucas created a live-action JETSONS... But Steven Spielberg seems the nostalgic influence of director Brad Bird. Unfortunately, as we're detoured into a clunky road picture involving intrepid kids and banal villains, it's more of a limp GOONIES than a Millennial CLOSE ENCOUNTERS.The lead character, Casey Newton, has a ""special"" gift, especially heightened when she receives that device, allowing her to glimpse into a strange new world, introducing that splendid location teased upon before detouring back on our ""filthy"" present time. The action sequences are shot well enough, but there's never a legitimate reason to go from one point to the next. And as Brit Robertson overacts through this big budget blockbuster, she'd be perfect for a Nickelodeon TV movie or sit-com...Not that our A-list George Clooney is that much better. Grumpy and lethargic, when his eccentric former boy genius Frank Walker engages in physical activities, it's as awkward as the non-chemistry with his young partner – think Doc Brown and Marty McFly, on Valium. And from the very onset, there's another young girl whose purpose shouldn't be spoiled She winds up taking away from what Robertson should have had: a genuine connection with Clooney. Instead, the trio, together during a supposedly pivotal arc, seem like they're rehearsing for three different movies at the same time and badly.Calling TOMORROWLAND preachy, as some mainstream critics have had to reluctantly admit, is an understatement – and an insult to films with a more subtle/less overwhelming message intact: not uncommon in the Sci-Fi genre, especially going back to the Atomic Era 50's. Yet the final doomsday monologue by Hugh Laurie, while reminiscence of Michael Rennie's anti-nuke lecture at the peak of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, is more annoyingly hypocritical (coming from Disney) than overall effective.Too silly to be deep and too complicated to be involving, TOMMOROWLAND doesn't feel especially catered to any particular age group. Basically, director Brad Bird and co-scriptwriter Damon Lindelof have taken us for a long misleading ride. And the irony is... they meant to.",Tomorrowland
104,bbickley13-921-58664,Nice little adventure with good visual concepts and a message that hits you,8,23 May 2015,"When I first saw the trailer for the Disney flick, and saw Gorge Clooney was going to be in it, something in my gut thought it was strange he would do a film like this, but now I get it. Tomorrowland is a place where the most creative science and art minds alike are selected to freely create without worrying about politics, capitalism, and other things that can stop this progression. But all good things must come to an end, and it's up to George Clooney as ex-boy genius Frank Walker and his like minded teenage sidekick to prevent that from happening. It's a perfect film for former animation director, Brad Bird. Its a live action cartoon as fun and exciting as the Disney attraction its loosely based on. I'm a fan of what the mouse house refer to as imagineers and I feel the movie celebrates these people. The movie also self serves Clooney's wanting to save the world from itself, hitting us over the head like a blunt object with the idea that the world complains too much about its problems and how it could use a place like Tomorrowland to change it. The message might have carried over better if it was a Disney animated feature that tends to tell a better story, keeping politics out of it. Overall, it's fairly easy to get over the fact that Clooney is selling his message and to just enjoy the movie for the fun action adventure flick filmed with some great sci-Fi visuals, that it is. See it today not tomorrow.",Tomorrowland
105,osj2507,Strong female presence in a Disney magical way,7,28 September 2015,"This was very entertaining the Disney way, nothing that kids can't handle watching, funny fight scenes and overall a really decent story and plot to entertain kids of all ages (above 8 or something).I saw it with my kid, we had seen the trailer and he had watched some of the cartoons on the Disney channel (if they are related, not sure haven't seen them). But we both had a wonderful time with this, it has Disney magic about it, not a princess but it is really nice seeing more female leads that are able to take charge, be themselves and wanting more, wanting a different.This might have a lot of fantastic stuff to wow the audience, and maybe a bit of the whole ""lesson"" about it is far fetched presented in the way it is, but there is a point and it is told in a vigorous and entertaining way.",Tomorrowland
106,MattBrady099,The review of the future,5,23 May 2015,"The review of tomorrow.The story is about a pair of geniuses - one a bright, optimistic teen, the other a former boy-genius-turned-jaded adult - happen to share the same destiny - one that leads to a place outside time and space and into their collective memories - a place called Tomorrowland.So I just seen Tomorrowland and I got to say that I'm a bit disappointed, but judging it on a visual experience the movie was pretty decent. I had high expectations going in and why wouldn't I be the the first teaser trailer really hooked me in with it's magically new world and the films storytelling. Now I don't think this is a bad, I was just a bit let down and I know there's probably going to be some people out there that are trying to confidence me that this is brilliant movie just like what some people did when I said Chappie was the biggest let of the year and it still is.Brad Bird turned down Star Wars Episode 7 to do this movie and straight away I though that this movie was going to be great, because Brad Bird is a great director and he made the best Mission Impossible movie to date. And in this movie Brad Bird does get all of his creative vision out on the screen and Tomorrowland looks absolutely stunning to watch. Brad did what he can for what he had to work on and at least this is a original story and Brad Bird took a huge risk by saying no to Star Wars just because he wanted to do a original story. Nicely done Brad.George Clooney was the only thing worth watching in this movie, because he did good in the movie and his character was the only interesting thing in the whole movie. This time he wasn't just playing the George Clooney, he actually played a character this time and a interesting one.The visual effect's in the movie worked perfectly in a way to show this future place known as Tomorrowland and it's nothing like Avatar where every single thing is CG and you feel that Avatar creative ideas came from better well done movies, so Avatar is a underrated copy cat of a film, at least in Tomorrowland it creates it's own original environment and made it look like a place that anyone can go to, and that's call Disneyland.Now for problems and sadly these a lot: Britt Robertson as Casey got a bit on my nerves a little bit, and I got nothing against the actress she's good in the movie, but I just didn't care about her as a character.The other character I didn't really care about Athena played by Raffey Cassidy. Just like what I said about Casey I didn't really care about her story ark.The villain of the movie was pretty lame and weak, when the movie did the big twist by showing the villain I already sawed it coming minutes ago.The third act of the movie really brought the movie down for me, because the first and second act was pretty solid but the third was the most bloated cop out I've seen this year and it ended so disappoint.Overall Tomorrowland is a alright movie but the reason why I found it disappoint is because I expected something big and something great I mean that's what the movie was trying to be in the trailer's. The movie is different and I always like different movies that try to be something else, and I give the movie that.",Tomorrowland
107,Al_The_Strange,Feed your optimism,8,27 May 2015,"I expected this movie to suck. Most reviews I see have written this off as just another fluff piece with too much CGI, too little story, and a message that seems to make everyone sick. Given all the negativity, I got the impression that I'm not supposed to enjoy this.And yet, I found myself captivated by the film, and I became enamored by the escapist experience.You could write this off as just another advert for a Disney theme park. The film definitely strives to wow the audience with fantastic visions of futuristic cities, rockets, jetpacks, flying cars, robots, laser guns, and more. In between all this utopian scenery, the film maintains its pace by constantly putting the characters in peril, forcing them to run from one dangerous situation to another. Action scenes are pretty frequent, and include such cool things as laser-gun firefights and robots with martial arts, all of which are captured in very solid and steady photography. In between the action, the film maintains a light and colorful tone, with plenty of snappy dialogue and humor.The story is brimming with adventure, the likes of which would be on-par with The Neverending Story or Last Action Hero, or something along those lines. It plays into the standard scenario of a kid finding out that there's another world, and sets out to find it. The actual plot doesn't have a whole lot of dots to connect; much of the runtime is devoted to the characters leaping from one peril to another, to the point where it becomes one thing after another. There are a few parts that are unbelievable, and there may be some plot holes, but given the fantastic nature of the story, the creditability of various scenes seems to defeat the point of the picture. As far as characters go, I grew to love them; the main character is a perfectly lovable kid with passion that drives the plot, and it provides an apt reflection on the other characters, who in turn have their own motivations that make them compelling.Plotting is not so much the highlight of the film, as it is the ideas. Tomorrowland offers a pretty fun sci-fi scenario in which the world's greatest and brightest built a utopian paradise of innovation, hidden from the rest of the world. As the characters work to find their way there, an even greater theme emerges, and all of the film's conflict becomes hinged on pessimism versus optimism. The film asserts that our world is so full of doom and gloom, and our future could become a self-fulfilling prophecy of disaster if we let it. Naturally, the characters' struggle sides with optimism, to the point where it seeps out of the picture and becomes infectious. The theme resonates with me personally, because I am a firm believer in what the film says - that the future is what you make of it. In the end, I personally found the film's message inspiring, and moving in its own way. Walt Disney himself originally built Tomorrowland into his theme parks with the motive to foster inspiration, imagination, and invention. That same spirit permeates through the Tomorrowland picture; many folks find it distasteful, probably because the film wears its heart on its sleeve all too well. I realized that this is something you won't find in any other movie this year; for once, this is a movie that made me smile, and left me feeling hopeful. Movies don't usually set out to paint a pretty picture or tell the audience that you can make things happen through your actions; this one does, and I personally find it refreshing, inspiring, and moving.This film has good-looking photography and editing. Acting is good for what it is: Britt Robertson is perfectly colorful and fun in her role, George Clooney plays it pretty grumpy most of the time for decent effect, and Hugh Laurie is awesome. Writing probably could have been a little sharper, but I appreciated most of the dialogue. This production spares no expense on the sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Sound design is great. Music is alright.A lot of people won't be so easily charmed by this film, maybe finding it sappy, messy, or stupid. I think this attitude only proves the film's point; if you feed the negativity, you will hate the film. If all you see is shallow CGI, then you won't care about anything the film has to say. If you can approach this optimistically and become swept away in this adventure, then maybe the film will speak to you the most. As such, I can only recommend it as a rental to those interested. I think it's a perfectly good family film, and its message is far more inspiring than anything a Marvel film or a Michael Bay film can provide.4/5 (Experience: Good | Content: Good | Film: Good)",Tomorrowland
108,ArchonCinemaReviews,"No hope, no wonder, no magic - what happened to you Disney!?",5,24 May 2015,"Tomorrowland - a bloated and blundering spectacle only the kids could enjoy.It feels exceedingly cynical and pessimistic to dislike a film with such a positive message as Tomorrowland.Very rarely do we at Archon Cinema Reviews not write a summary for a film. Only for the incredibly odd and unique stories in which there is a mysterious aspect do we leave it to the film studio itself. This is true of Tomorrowland as well, but that is only because its plot is a redundant, uninspired, cyclical mess.When a film viewer wants to lob off a twenty minute chunk of a film, there is a problem. And yes, if it was up to us as editors, we would have unceremoniously gotten rid of the first twenty minutes of the film. The only point of these scenes were to unnecessarily feature its male star George Clooney in a desperate attempt to hook theater goers into sticking around for the next two hours.It is completely acceptable for a science fiction family film with a mysterious adventure sub plot to have a moderately complicated plot. Tomorrowland has a very simple plot, with so much superfluous brouhaha, you really have to roll up your sleeves and dig past the garbage to find it.The narrative features a female lead played by Britt Robertson. And yet, rather than center on the protagonist's path, the film veers unlinearly back to Clooney constantly. For all that Clooney is worth, he is a complete miscast in this film and his lazy acting is near unbearable.For a film about a wondrously enigmatic land filled with nothing but possibilities, Tomorrowland even manages to fall short on the awe. Disney used to be synonymous with magic, and this film has none. What it does have a plenty are action shots complete with spectacular visuals to sate audiences.No amount of explosions can compensate for the lack of clarity in a film with no driving force. Worst of all, it has no hope, no innocence, and no excitement. How can a film about the future of tomorrow be missing all that?Please check out the website for Archon Cinema Reviews to read all our reviews of recent releases in full.",Tomorrowland
109,estreet-eva,Um...what?,4,25 May 2015,"Brad Bird known for working on classic movies in the same way Michael Bay is known for working on movies that cost the audience anywhere from 3 to 6 IQ points goes with a more-is-more strategy for his latest outing. Time travel? Yep. Inter-dimensional travel? Sure. A father-surrogate daughter plot line? Got it. An environmental message? Done. A allegory about the dangers of A.I.? You betcha. Disney references? A plenty. A little Buddhism? Ask and you shall receive. Violence that strains the bounds of the PG-rating? Plenty. A lament for our slapdash space program? It's there. Stunt casting? How about Hugh Laurie and Michael Key as bad guys. Enough references to Bird's previous work so that you don't really need to worry about following the plot? Got that too. All of this more-is-more leads to an incomprehensible plot line about a geeky boy who is recruited by an android to help build a new world housed in another dimension (right?) but who is later exiled back to the crappy old world where he holes up in his house in case those new world people come looking for him although he lived there throughout his boyhood so couldn't they just have kept him if they wanted him so badly? And this is just like the first 12% of the plot. To recount the rest would require a retreat and large a study group of film nerds.Nevermind, if you want to work that hard go figure out the ""Lost"" finale. The movie does have many pretty colors, lots of action (although much of it far more violent than what you would expect in a PG) and walls of sound. A lot of critics have already pointed out ""Tomorrowland"" would have worked far better as a cartoon given the level of violence and the difficulty presented in trying to follow the CGI. The decision to film as live action does offer some treats. Hugh Laurie turns out to be the baddie with a wardrobe as ridiculous as any 50's TV serial (think Ming the Merciless if he were headmaster at Eton). George Clooney's character - both as boy and man - repeated gets dumped in bodies of water including an early scene where he and female lead emerge from a swamp obviously cold and wildly uncomfortable while trying to force out their scripted bickering while desperate for the scene to end. Finally, the recreation of the World's Fair in Queens early in the film lets us know what would happen if Disney took over Corona Park.In short, what a mess - right down to the film's moral of the story which seems to be if you think about Armageddon then you'll cause Armageddon so don't worry, be happy and nobody gets hurt.",Tomorrowland

111,p-jonsson,A mix of good and bad,7,16 February 2016,"I have to say that I quite enjoyed Tomorrowland despite its way too common mistake of being quite a bit nonsensically preachy to satisfy the current politically correct view of what is ""wrong"" with the world today. Filtering out those parts this is a quite enjoyable, visually very entertaining, family movie. If you have strong opinions about certain things then you might want to be with your kids when watching this one. Personally I consider my oldest son to be quite capable of making his own opinions and as for the two younger kinds I try to point out the pro's and con's and let them grow up to make their own mistakes.Having that out of the way this is a visually quite wonderful movie. it is of course quite CGI enhanced but in a good way. It is a Disney movie after all so you would expect, at least I did, some ""artistic freedom"" as far as the scenery is concerned.The story is actually a quite lovely ""fairy tale"" kind of story about a ""wonderland"" far far away. Initially it is a wee bit difficult to get a grip of what is happening since it all moves about all over the place a bit. If you can overcome that first disorientation it does indeed get somewhat sensible after a while. Having said that I mean ""sensible"" in the context of not only a wild and whacky science fiction movie but in the context of a wild and wacky science fiction movie aimed at the younger part of the audience. Despite the scientific blurb thrown around in the last half of the movie do not for a minute believe that any of the script writers have more scientific knowledge than the average Hollywood script writer which iszero.To me the enjoyment of this movie came from the childish fantasy style (it does have quite a bit of a fairly tale story over it), from the rather enjoyable cinematic effects, quite a bit of cool action and last but not least  George Clooney. Actually that is not entirely fair. George was part of it but what I really liked was the recruiting android all the way from the start. When Clooney entered the scene both him and the android pretty much stole the scene. I am afraid that the Newton girl, for a lot of the time, felt more like a ""plot element"" than a main character to me.I have to say that I quite liked the scenes in Paris as well. Sorry guys but I do live in France after all. The Eiffel Tower scenes where quite enjoyable and I do like the touch where they used Mr. Eiffel's apartment at the top of the tower as a scenery. Actually I am not sure how many people actually know that there is an apartment (now a museum) up there. The stuff about a hidden room and a hidden (naah, that would be a spoiler) beneath the tower is of course truly nonsensical.So, bottom line, if Disney would not have gone down the line of trying to make a political statement, and I do not care what that statement was except that it was blunt, obvious and unconcealed, then this movie would have gotten another star or two. I cannot justify giving it much lower than what I did since it was, technically speaking, a quite good and entertaining movie. However, movies for children is not the medium to make a statement unless you believe that you are living in a socialist state a 'la the Soviet Union.",Tomorrowland
112,twelve-house-books,I Was So Excited! And Then...,1,8 March 2018,"My father was an aerospace engineer for NASA, in New Orleans in the 1960s. You can see why I was so excited to see this film. Finally, I thought, all of our hopes and dreams for the Space Age put into a film capsule, all of the ideas--even the classic jet pack! Then, CGI took over, and Hollywood's new penchant for shocking the viewer with POV character tumbles and other violence that would leave a normal human being incapacitated--if not altogether decapitated. Long story short, after my father lied to my mother and us children and said he had been laid off from NASA instead of taking his promotion in Seattle, which was the truth, I began to hate Science and Sci-Fi--a hatred that grew inside of me year by year. But, I always held a soft spot for Ray Bradbury's imagination, and this film looked like it would bring all of the disparate ideas and concepts together--and with a precocious lad and cute girl to boot. How could we miss? But, we did. Will Disney try again? I hope not. They get progressively worse as the years and decades go by. In any case, unless you thrive only on wild color and swiftly moving cameras jerking this way and that, skip this one. It promises so much, but it never delivers. I'd be willing to bet Ron Howard could do far better with the Space Age. Agree?",Tomorrowland
113,rooee,Ahead of its time?,7,11 June 2015,"Disney's conspicuously insistent ad campaign – more, more, MORE! – suggested a lack of confidence in their product, and while it hasn't sunk like John Carter, the relative failure of Brad Bird's latest is another nail in the coffin of original action-adventure movie-making, already incinerating plans for Tron 3, and likely setting the company's focus solely on stuff with ""Star Wars"" in the title for years to come. This is a pity because, while not flawless, there is so much to enjoy in this intelligent, exuberant sci-fi epic, written by Bird and Damon ""Lost"" Lindelof. It's certainly a darn sight more interesting than that bloated Avengers behemoth in the next auditorium. Perhaps its sequel-less fate will see it claim cult status in years to come. The luminous Britt Robertson gets the insta-star treatment, playing Casey Newton, a bright young optimist who stumbles upon a pin badge which gives her a preview of a parallel world. That world is Tomorrowland, a place where the greatest minds – scientists, inventors, artists – have created a utopian metropolis. (Old Walt himself was one such mind; overtones of fascism are skilfully evaded here.) Casey tracks down Frank Walker (George Clooney), an ex-denizen of Tomorrowland, now jaded and cynical. Together they are chased by a group of creepy robot agents (think Agent Smith with a rictus grin) into the threatened utopia, and into Frank's sorrowful past. Hope and optimism are all that can save the world. This is a big, passionate movie, full of energy and earnestness, and never self-mocking. I thoroughly enjoyed its 80s-influenced sense of adventure. Indeed, Bird's direction is reminiscent of a youthful Spielberg, combining simplicity with thrilling flashes of virtuosity. The attack on Frank's booby-trapped house is a dizzyingly inventive sequence on multiple levels. Tomorrowland is morally upright, although perhaps its heavy central message is a hard sell for youngsters. It's basically a cautionary tale about media responsibility in influencing public consciousness. Hugh Laurie gets a dramatic final speech which is laughably preachy, but the guy has a point; and it puts his character, and the whole concept of Tomorrowland, into an ethical grey area. A two-hour-plus Disney sci-fi movie where the bad guy is the misappropriation of laudable ambitions? Quite a challenge for the marketing guys. Offsetting this philosophical weightiness is a determined focus on awe-inspiring wonder. Yet Spielberg managed this in a single shot of a lagoon in Jurassic Park, so, without wishing to sound ungrateful, do we really need scene after scene of whooshing, swooping, and whizzing around this exquisite CGI cityscape? Perhaps Disney could have halved the budget – and thus their imminent losses – and focused instead on the ideas and moral quandaries of the narrative. Plot-wise it's exposition-heavy, but this is made up for with bags of visual invention and some engaging characters.In particular there is a lovely niece-and-uncle chemistry between the adorable Casey and the grizzled Frank. Less well sketched are the relationships between Casey and her father (Tim McGraw), and Walker and his childhood sweetheart, Athena (Raffey Cassidy). But Tomorrowland is all about the central odd couple, and their encounters with Laurie's misguided David Nix. This is where the beating heart of this appealingly imperfect and delightfully ambitious movie can be found: in those who look upon Tomorrowland with very different eyes.",Tomorrowland
114,James_De_Bello,7/10,7,21 May 2015,"A fun sci-fi adventure that unfortunately doesn't gives itself enough space to explore what it hints at and makes more confusion in its message than it should. It is a truly fantastic ride, but unfortunately it isn't the mind piece it promises to be.Before getting into positives and negatives I just want to talk about a scene in the film, but just give me a second to introduce it. I am a big, big, big fan, actually I will go as far to say I am a maniac about long takes. I am really obsessed with them more than anybody (except probably Alejandro Inarritu and Emmanuel Lubezki), I am a person who is into cinematography a lot and thinks of the visual aspect of a movie before anything else and there is just something about long takes that fascinates me, I think they are able to give an experience that no other shot will deliver many times and sometimes go as far as thinking that everything should be shot in a long take because it would make it more effective. That long premise is just to modestly give a little more weight to what I am about to say: ""Tomorowland"" has probably one of the best long takes I have ever seen in my life. It might just be better than classic long takes as in ""Touch of Evil"" or ""Goodfellas"" and no I am not exaggerating it is that good. It uses the idea that is behind the long take to it's advantage and makes the scene jaw dropping, riveting and fantastical because of that. The best part is that I didn't realize it was a long take up until the end and that generally doesn't pass under the radar for me. I'm telling you no matter what you think of the movie, you will be mesmerized for those 3-4 minutes and I don't want to add anymore so not to spoil the beauty you will witness. It added a couple of points to the film to me because other than being splendid it fit perfectly.Fortunately that is not everything that is going on in ""Tomorrowland"". There are brilliant visual ideas all around, the imagination that is pored into the film is astounding and absolutely pleasant. Its originality is very genuine and brings to life a world that I was totally fascinated by and loved spending time in, yet unfortunately didn't spend enough. The movie doesn't focus really that much on Tomorrowland itself and with what it promises that really is a major let down. Fortunately you spend time with characters that are interesting and played with heart, with maybe Roberston's character being a little one dimensional yet compensated by a very good performance. Now probably the biggest plus the movie has, aside that long take, is Raffey Cassidy. She is Tyler-Sheridan-in-""Mud""/Haley-Joel-Osment-in-""Sixth Sense"" level brilliant. Truly. What a performance. I was in awe, every time she was on screen I thought to myself: ""Is that really a child actor??"". Giacchino also delivers another one of his great scores. More on the negative side is the fact that the film too often ponders into generic storytelling and it has a very, very unclear message other than also making less and less sense the more I thought about it. The third act completely ruins the film and wastes what could have been a really, really wonderful climax. Moreover the green screen is intolerably noticeable in some scenes and others have too much CGI involved.The experience was great, I was always on board ready for the next event to unfold and had really some load of fun despite there being a bunch of holes, which *rant* I confidently attribute to Lindelof given his embarrassing resume in storytelling, as always he proves he is incapable of writing anything that comes to close the circle he started, but since Brad Bird has a writing credit too I won't indulge in this rant anymore *end rant*.",Tomorrowland
115,scottshak_111,A fun ride into a fantastical world!,7,26 May 2015,"Bird soars! Disney's fast paced sci-fi adventure is an entertaining package. With a great fantastical story in its vanguard, the flick unfurls into a beauty thanks to powerful performances by Clooney, Hugh Laurie and the brilliant Britt Robertson. What constantly gallops the story is its mystery quotient that unfolds gorgeously with luster, amazement and pizazz. Britt lets you see everything with her eyes of awe as you sit on her saddle to perceive the beauty of an unseen futuristic world that is not only downright advanced but marvelous too.Tomorrowland is something we have always dreamt of. A place where limits of the mundane don't bind us. We are free to choose our profession and use ideas to build something beautiful without inhibitions from stuff that bring us down – malice, regulations and confinements.As a kid, I have always wanted to split open the world's mystery and walk, with open arms, into the magical dimension of what-ifs. The possibility of the existence of different dimensions in our own has always beamed me up. The part that follows Britt discovering the pin that shows her Tomorrowland is an excellent reflection of our childhood fantasies. How many times have I dreamt of finding something that took me away from all this! Also the frames that follow Britt literally globe-trotting to see the future are visually majestic.This movie skims the surface of dimensions, portals, and time travel subtly, without prodding into it like pros. This could be counted as a con to the movie. However, it being a Disney flick the specifics can be overlooked. Also, at times you feel the profundity factor missing from the movie, but not for once does the cast drop its guard. Excellent performances I would say buffed up everything, not to mention the concept that keeps you riveted.Kabooms happening in the middle of the light and the crowd not caring, people disappearing without people noticing, not capturing the world's reactions are some of the instants that would make you think out loud, ""Really?"" The dark is completely absent from the movie. There is no time where people sit and brood for a while about the happenings. Even the animation sometimes lookswell really animated. But that was the kind of movie it was supposed to be. A Disney movie! Screenplay is great, with the majority of the melodrama brought in to play by the animate Athena, and Frank taking things up from there. Hugh Laurie as Nix is exceptional with his villainy touch. His reflection on mankind's recklessness was really something.Overall a good movie! Worth a watch!",Tomorrowland
116,akshatmahajan,Don't go by the critic's review,8,9 July 2021,"Tomorrowland was a bit childish movie but was enjoyable sci-fi tale. This movie can be watched by any age audience and everyone will enjoy it.The story was a bit uneven. The pace was not good at the starting. It takes the movie about 30 minutes to really kick into gear but it will not effect your overall experience. I enjoyed the plot of slowly figuring out what is Tomorrowland and what's the purpose behind it all. Yes, the movie is not a perfect one but it is neither a bad one.I have read quite a lot of negative comments about this movie and even its message and I find that to be slightly odd. The main purpose of this movie was to provide fun and entertainment to the audience and it does fulfill it's purpose.Overall, I will surely recommend this movie to anyone. At least it tried something new in childish and entertaining way. Don't check critics reviews, they wrote more childish reviews than the movie's story.",Tomorrowland
117,Okonh0wp,Ugh,3,1 July 2015,"A while ago I made it a point never to see a George Clooney movie again. The actor is serviceable but he's such a tabloid fixture at this point, that there's too much smarminess and adoration surrounding him to get invested in him on screen. Sure, when he gives 110% and finds the best writer-directors in Hollywood like Jason Reitman and Alexander Payne, something noticeable and a great film will transpire. In fact, Clooney's choice of film projects make it so even if I'm not a fan of the actor, I would never think of missing Burn After Reading, Syriana, Michael Clayton, O Brother Where Art Thou or Gravity.It was with that optimism, that I decided even if I'm not a Clooney fan, a film about the future based on the 1964 world's fair sounded really intriguing in the face of all these dystopian films..What a mistake I made. While the film boasts some really great special effects and has some wonderful background art, the story is highly convoluted and after a while, you stop being invested in it. Despite my hesitations about Clooney for all the media buzz that surrounds him, I can say without hesitation that this is one of his worst acting roles. His attempts to be a cranky uncle are off and seem overly borrowed from his Burn After Reading persona. It's also ridiculous that the main romantic tension is between him and a 12-year-old girl. That made as much sense as that Saturday Night Live skit this past year with Chris Helmsworth revealing his love affair with a chicken. His co-star Britt Robertson is serviceable as well but her plot feels really rushed (she would just jump on a bus from Cape Canaveral to Houston?).The trio of Frank, Casey and Athena do not have a convincing chemistry and some of their banter is just plain annoying. There is a strange practice of exposition through arguments between Frank and Athena. There's also the issue of the voice over at the beginning which takes you out of the film almost instantly.",Tomorrowland
118,jackmeat,Fun kid safe sci fi movie that looks great,6,25 September 2015,"My quick rating - 6,0/10. Unfairly dogged in the theater but it does have its flaws. The story itself is contrived and really doesn't try to explain itself to well. Then again, it is fantasy ad summer blockbuster so why am I bothering being critical. The movie looks fabulous as expected (200 million in budget will do that) so at least the movie broke even (not even close with marketing). Britt Robinson(female lead) does a very good job in her acting role and is very believable as the apprehensive young kid. Nice to see some good wholesome kid sci fi that still entertains adults, this is why I think it didn't get a fair shake. Parents should've been rushing their kids to a little more mature sci fi film but I guess the marketing just didn't hit the right audience. To be honest, by the marketing, I personally saw it as another George Clooney vehicle which it wasn't. Oh well,still an enjoyable film that stands up even with its flaws.",Tomorrowland

Shame that because this brings together marvellous storytelling with bang on special effects with a really good story. Not a fan of Clooney but he sits nicely in this...all the females in this are outstanding here...pretty daft thing to say about what is generally a bubble gum movie but check it out and you will see. The premise has been used a million times before in Marvel movies and disaster movies but that allowed us to look sideways and enjoy the spectacle. This is what cinemas are made for..good guys v bad guys with a dollop of mush thrown in. Wasn't many giggle bits in here but very well directed.A lot of reviews have been harping on and moaning about stuff that don't matter..ie..product placement and the usual ""Disney are taking over the world"" rubbish but that's not reviewing movies,,that's just politics. Sequel is a given as the whole idea is expandable...who knows..A T.V series??? Get and watch..my 12 year old daughter were enthralled and will be at the DVD shop on the day of issue.

It felt like watching ""Meet the Robinsons,"" which I loved. The one thing I didn't expect (especially in a Disney movie) was the warning about dystopian futures. It uses books like ""1984,"" and ""Fahrenheit 451"" as examples. There is one scene where there's a vintage comic shop and there's Star Wars merchandise everywhere. (Subtle, Disney) I really enjoyed the positive message the movie has to offer, and highly recommend this film to everyone. If Brad Bird directs ""The Incredibles 2"" half as well as he directed this, I'm excited for it. He declined to direct ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" to direct this, and that was still a good decision because this movie is amazing!

122,ayoreinf,Spoiler alert! spoiler alert! - pessimism is bad for our future,8,28 May 2015,"I just read a review here ranting about how unlikely this whole movie is. I'm seeing this sort of comments on this site reviews almost on every science fiction or fantasy film covered. I'm sorry to say but too many people don't understand the difference between plain fiction and science fiction. The question is not how likely it is, the question is whether it makes sense within the world that was constructed in the film. Well I think it does, and I don't think the CG were awful, but I'm no longer impressed with good or decent CG or special effects - that's the standard of the industry nowadays. I also think the acting was very professional, and well above professional when considering George Clooney and the very young and very impressive Raffey Cassidy, who's biography on this site is sadly amiss. She did perform superbly in a most demanding role. So I did like most of what I saw, but, and I do wish there wasn't any but, it made my rating drop about a notch and a half. One of my life mottoes is - whenever I hear that the solution is simple I get worried. Well I got very worried at the end of this movie, I'll add no spoiler here, and the spoiler comment at the title is a sarcastic one obviously, because that's what the massage of this film is, and for me that's as simplistic as they come.",Tomorrowland
123,kaptenvideo-89875,A wonderful failure,6,14 December 2016,"A former boy-genius (George Clooney) and optimistic teen girl really good at science (Britt Robertson) try to save our world. In order to do that, they will have to travel to futuristic parallel world.A family movie unlike any other. It's has action, effects, verve, exciting concept... It also has ambition and something meaningful to say. And putting young two girl heroes (one's a robot!) in the centre of the story was quite refreshing. But all in all, the movie is so uneven that I can't fully recommend it.""Tomorrowland"" feels never elegants script-wise and the acting style seems kind of hammy (I think it's intentional). But the first act, or about 45 minutes, is really catchy.A lot is happening then, movie is chock-full of ideas how to take us on a visual joyride. New things are coming in like flood, often way before we are finished enjoying the previous things.The parallel world is quite cool too, think Luc Besson's cult classic ""The Fifth Element"" (1997) in a Disney remix. Too bad we get to see actually so little of it.But from during the second hour, i really started feeling disappointed of seeing so much material to build on (both story and the world) but makers choosing to fill the time with endless mediocre mindless action. The second half turns out to be a bit of a drag, especially final ""battle"". The movie should really be shorter. Not to mention wasting the message part of the movie, being just ""Facebook deep"".Brad Bird is known for near-flawless directing career so far. He is the man behind three animations (""The Iron Giant"", ""The Incredibles"", ""Ratatouille"") and ""MIssion: Impossible 4"", all well regarded in their genres. But ""Tomorrowland"" is messy, having too much material and not knowing where to put all of it. Maybe it was a mistake for Bird to write screenplay with Damon Landelof, the creator of ""Lost"" which also started strong and ended having way too much of everything.""Tomorrowland"" is based on the Disney amusement parks' areas of the same name, by the way. Just like ""Pirates of the Caribbean"".",Tomorrowland
124,ritera1,A confounding mess,4,15 July 2015,"This film was baffling on many levels. Story, acting, direction, producing, marketing.Storywise, we really don't know the plot for a long time: The end of the world. We dwell for a long time on the boy and then on the girl and her recruitment into Tomorrowland. We have no ticking clock, no bad guys.But let's stop for a second on the recruitment. That lapel pin. Now for an advanced ""society,"" that thing was incredibly dangerous and irresponsible. With no warning you're thrust into a ""commercial"" for Tomorrowland but are blinded completely from the physical hazards of the real world. Although it looked great on screen, it was completely divorced from common sense in a myriad of ways. The girl goes down stairs which were not psychically there. Everything is flat in a field? No rocks? No tripping hazards? Then, for effect, she trudges through the real lake at the end? Doesn't help when your candidates wander into traffic or over a cliff.And Tomorrowland (like the 1964 segment) didn't look good. It reminded me of the sets for the 1980s Back to the Future films. Just not...good.Then the girl, with the motivation of the pin, goes on her quest. (And what was the acting choice of this girl? I strongly suspect that she's actually a really good actress but was excessively annoying in the role as she was channeling Calista Flockhart in Ally McBeal.)And what was with the robots in the collectible shop? Who were they? The same as the blank smiling Tomorrowland robots we are then introduced to? That wasn't clear. If they were, why didn't they immediately subdue the girl? What was the jokes (that only played well on screen but made no sense in the context of the story)?Then we are reintroduced to the little girl robot. (Actually a very good character and actress.)Okay so we reach Clooney and finally start the real story. He was enjoyable but a second banana (had the only arc in the story). Then we get a glimpse of the metaphysical element of the movie with the girl, which turned out to be a complete failure.More conventional action (with a ridiculous rocket ship under the Eiffel Tower that made no sense even in a sci-fi film), some good but uncomfortable bantering between Clooney and the little girl his character was and still is in love with, and we're in Tomorrowland.Now up 'til this point we've had a ""hero"" in the girl who has only demonstrated her aptitude for science briefly but is somehow the carrier of a vague metaphysical ""hope."" What she isn't is largely active in her adventure since the battle at the collector shop.But we're in Tomorrowland. A figment of its former self since everyone found out that Earth would destroy itself. We find out about the future machine and the destruction of the Earth.I'm still lost on how Tomorrowland fragmented from this. Nobody thought they could do anything about it. So...why did it go to heck? Apparently the fate of Earth had no effect on Tomorrowland.But we have a flash of how (SOMEHOW) the girl's hope could make a difference. But the metaphysics end up having no bearing on the ending.Then the girl figures out that the machine is the cause of the end of the world. Only problem is, the real world and history does not match with the accusations of the story. The world was on the brink much more before the machine was built (1964) vs. what came after. It tried to be feel-good as it sacrificed logic.But alas, the bad guy knows that the machine was going to cause the eventual demise of the Earth. He wants it to happen? Why? We never know. But he wants it to happen although the condition of the world had no bearing on the fate of Tomorrowland. (Nevermind that Tomorrowland made no attempt to help the world before the 1984 downfall.)(And I was curious who built, maintained and fed Tomorrowland.)We then fight it out and it's almost the end.The grown man and a little girl robot lament their love for each other. I defy you to find a way for that to work on screen as it didn't work the way they did it. (And how can't she just transfer her memory banks to some mainframe?)Okay so Clooney flies up with his jet pack and drops the little girl/bomb into the machine and we're all saved. A good shot 'cause he was very high above the machine and dropped her into a little hole.Which brings me back to before this was ever made. Nobody read the script? Nobody saw the storyboards? They just wrote a $190 million dollar check and didn't look back? Didn't ask who would actually want to see this?",Tomorrowland

126,Jerique,Time Travel Done Awkwardly,5,24 June 2016,"I'd prefer to give this a 5 and 1/2 but can't give half points. This film is nothing more than a standard popcorn flick. But it doesn't achieve this very well. Britt Robertson is becoming a household name, and plays well opposite of George Clooney. This film, though, never really gathers steam or gives purpose. It is strange that the film progresses along and hints that the Casey character has a pre-destiny, but really the film is just a basic puzzle plot and the future isn't anything spectacular.Visually the film does nothing special with the use of effects. A large majority of the film feels like they were making it up as they went. It doesn't feel like a time travel movie such as Back to the Future. Instead it lazily uses ""what ifs"" through a pin, and then uses exposition through a character that explains the future. Hugh Laurie's appearance in the film sticks out like a sore thumb, since he doesn't really add much to the film. He definitely seems like a miscast. Acting was average by everyone and honestly Clooney phoned in his performance. This film is just a mediocre one that could be watched to pass the time if you have no other options on Saturday night.

If the film is called Tomorrowland then why isn't about time travel. (it's a terrible joke). This is actually based on a Disney attraction that i'm guessing that had to do something with a persons imagination and they would create wonderful things for this world. The film centers on a girl named Cassie(Britt Robertson) who finds this pin after she is arrested. When she touches the pin she goes to this amazing place called Tomorrowland. But when the pin dies she tries to find out more about this place while being chased by Security agents from Tomrrowland. Along the way she meets Athena and Frank who help her try to save the earth and bring us to Tomorrowland. Before I saw this film I heard it wasn't that impressive which broke me to pieces. I honestly thought this would be the best live action Disney film ever. That titles still belongs to this years Cinderella. But a lot things buged people about this flick, on the other hand only two of those problems I can agree with, it's the inconsistent tone and ending where it's like save your planet. We have seen that message a million times and it's been done to death. The inconsistent tones comes from how the movie can feel like a children's film, but then its a hard adult drama and then back and forth. Everything else I found to be fine with in the movie, the acting is great, the pacing is good and I still can't see what else there isn't to like about this picture. It's creative, imagnititve, fun, has good characters and Brad Birds direction was impressive, not his best work clearly but for a mis-step it's not that bad, it's a pretty great film.

129,Ziya90,This is not the same man who brought us The Incredibles and Iron Giant,1,7 June 2015,"I am a fan of Brad Bird. In fact, I was. I met him by Iron Giant and it made me cry despite I was not a kid! It was spectacular. Then I saw The Incredibles and it was incredible though. I will skip The Ghost Protocol, because it was a huge disappointment for me. Now, Tomorrowland... I went to see the movie because of three reasons: Brad Bird, George Clooney and as being a science fiction fan, because it was a sci-fi story. However, what I saw was a boring kids movie for TV channels with a daydreamer message in a bad way. Unfortunately, the kid characters were not likable in the movie and even Clooney was dull in this. He is one of my all time favorite actors. The story is rather ""ancient"" than boring, old themes, old twists etc. but the most important point here is that the story has a message which is ""use your imagination, you can be one of the chosen ones who are able to do time travel, change the world's destiny and save the world from evil aliens? Sorry, but it is not just uninspiring and boring, but also too naive which turns into ridiculousness in the end. All those action in the final chapter or that weird store owners who reveal their secret later in the film were just ridiculous. In the movie, there were lots of references to other movies such as that little girl reminded me Terminator 3 (you know what I mean) It is definitely not for the people who want a smart, brilliant or exciting sci-fi adventure. I had supposed that this movie would be Interstellar for kids, but I was definitely wrong! This is the worst Brad Bird movie so far. It has no art, no real entertainment and no cinema magic. Just a bunch of impressive visual effects and no more than that. If you want a time killer movie which you can watch with your kids in a Sunday morning, this movie is OK for you. It is not like some kids classics such as E.T. Goonies, Stand by Me, Back to the Future, Close Encounters etc.",Tomorrowland
130,CleveMan66,"""Tomorrowland"" is simply one of the best movies of 2015.",10,22 May 2015,"In 2003, Walt Disney Pictures released a movie with the same name as one of its theme park rides. ""A movie based on a RIDE?"" said many, including yours truly. It sounded really lame. Turns out, a ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie wasn't such a bad idea after all. Four films later (and counting) – not to mention the $3.7 billion in worldwide box office receipts – and basing a film on a Disneyland attraction was clearly a VERY good idea, so why not return to that well of inspiration that is the Disney theme parks? Why not, indeed. The result is ""Tomorrowland"" (PG, 2:10).The name comes from the section of Disney parks which shows visitors a utopian vision of the future based on imagination and innovation. At first, Tomorrowland came across as being more about big business showing off and seemed doomed to becoming no more than a quaint relic as the future became the past, but it transformed into a more vibrant and pure representation of the optimism that Disney represents. At this point you might be asking yourself, ""Why is this review still talking about the Disney theme park attraction?"" It isn't. But, like the ""Pirates"" movies, rather than ""based on"" a section of the Disney theme parks, ""Tomorrowland"" is better described as ""inspired by"" the attraction of the same name. And what an inspiration it is! The film's theatrical trailers may look interesting, but they don't really tell you what the movie is about, whereas I will (without spoilers, of course). Tomorrowland is a place where there's no bureaucracy or politics and the smartest and most creative people are able to realize their visions for a better world. It's a world of architectural beauty, stunning technological achievements (I have GOT to get one of those swimming pool sets!) and where people of different backgrounds actually get along. Within the movie, Tomorrowland does exist, but in another dimension, and only a few special people can see it and actually go there. For the place to function, grow and realize its true potential, Tomorrowland requires people who are both dreamers and doers.Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) is such a person. Inspired by her NASA engineer father (Tim McGraw) and encouraged by her little brother (Pierce Gagnon), Casey is a young woman who has an impressive intellect, a boundless curiosity and a heart which absolutely refuses to believe that she can't make the world a better place. The same was true of Frank Walker (George Clooney) who, as a boy (Thomas Robinson) at the 1964 World's Fair, showed himself to be quite the budding inventor and with as much optimism and wonder as present-day Casey. Although separated by a generation, both Frank and Casey are clearly people with dreams, ideas and abilities that are larger than the world in which they live. It's a good thing that there is a Tomorrowland – and that there's a mysterious, but unflappable little girl named Athena (Raffey Cassidy) and a very smart man played by Hugh Laurie (now able to use his natural British accent that he had to keep hidden while playing TV's ""Dr. House"") to help them get there.But it's not just as simple as unleashing your full potential on a strange new world. Tomorrowland isn't quite, say, open for business just yet. And before it's ready to become Today-land for everybody on earth, the people who care most about bringing their visionary future to fruition are going to have to get past some who, for their own reasons, don't want the project to move forward. That's where the ""action"" in this ""action/adventure"" comes in. Now, if you're concerned that I may have spoiled the movie, I didn't. And if you're bothered that I didn't explain much more than the trailers, I couldn't. This isn't just about avoiding spoilers (which IS tougher than usual with this review). It's more about allowing people to experience the joy and wonder of this film for themselves. To be touched – and inspired.""Tomorrowland"" is a very special movie – because it's more than a movie. It's a chance to dream about a better future for our planet and for the humans which call it home. This film is an oasis for optimists, but it avoids getting all Pollyanna on us. The earth's problems are shown as overwhelming, if not insurmountable (although the movie never clubs us over the head with them), but it doesn't give us easy answers or a simple recipe for success in solving these problems. Rather, it shows how the answers are already among us. With impressive and imaginative visuals, appealing characters who are effectively portrayed and a realistic yet optimistic look at problems and the beginning of solutions, this is one of the most enjoyable and encouraging movies of the year.

The first problem is that it doesn't know if it's a kid's movie or one for an older audience. It seems to be geared to a younger audience, but then you see people being blasted into a blue goo, it seems more gory than it needed to be.
The next problem is the second half of the movie feels like it's mostly filler. Like the trip from the house to the other dimension, how many steps did that take? What? Why did it take 20 or 30 minutes to show all that?
And then the ending and explanation for why things were happening didn't make sense. I guess it was supposed to be a morality tale about humans and caring about the planet. I'm not sure how negative thoughts would have brought about flooding.

How? Why? Who's behind it? She tries to figure it out, and an enigmatic tween named Athena, replete with the obligatory annoying accent, shows up along the way to provide some timely rescues and tantalizing clues but not much candor.The pace and plot don't really pick up much until the George Clooney character (reclusive and embittered former child genius Frank Walker, presumably no relation to our governor) puts in an appearance and gradually reveals the secrets — and pitfalls — of time travel. Along with some spiffy gadgets and booby traps.Of the movies based on Disneyland rides and attractions, the Pirates of the Caribbean series clearly holds pride of place, and this one is probably a middle-distance second, but it's still way above the Eddie Murphy vehicle The Haunted Mansion (2003) and the gaggingly bad The Country Bears (2002).Directed and co-written (with Damon Lindelof) by Brad Bird, the guy behind The Incredibles and Ratatouille, this one comes from Walt Disney Pictures but lacks the Pixar magic touch.It's available in Imax for no discernible reason, since most of the scenes are close-ups and interiors.",Tomorrowland

The camera follows her and does not cut to a new shot as she explores this world filled with students who use jet- packs for traveling, divers who use pools that cheat gravity, allowing the divers to reach the bottom of floating pools to continue their gravitational fall at normal speed as they exit and start a dive into the next pool (a minor detail that I can't get out of my mind since it was such a cool concept) and a population that seems very joyful and at peace - it's kind of like they are advertising Disney World. In fact, at the opening of the movie, the young Frank Walker gets into Tomorrowland by a portal in the Disney ride ""It's a Small World.""The only aspect I found cheesy to be on the ""Disney extreme cheesy"" on a scale of 1 to 10 on cheesiness would be the robots that appear in the first half of the film. While Keegan-Michael Key is a great comedian he made for a horrible robot until he was shut off after being in battle with Casey and Athena - his eyes glitching were spot-on and I have no idea how they captured that and made it so robotic. Before that moment, he was a robot who went from extremely optimistic to extremely evil in a matter of minutes - that's Disney with the extremes for you. And then shortly afterwards a robot who addresses himself as secret service comes in who is even more cartoonish with an obviously fake smile that is so ridiculous it has to be the worst acting in the film. Thank God these robots are gone once Casey and Frank meet up with Athena.The film picks up when they ACTUALLY get to Tomorrowland, but it is a sight for sore eyes as it is in shambles for a reason they never quite explain - the Hugh Laurie character explains there is an apocalyptic event that will occur in about 2 months of Earth time, but that problem shouldn't transfer to this world since they explain it is in a different dimension.I have no idea why since this was a little more creepy than sweet and sentimental, but there is a moment I almost felt genuinely sad at where Athena is ""dying"" while Frank comes to tears as she is basically proving to him that she loved him even though she is a robot and always has been. It was a weird moment where I wanted both for them to perhaps kiss but simultaneously cringed at that possibility because - well come on, she's a kid (though she can't help it she can't age) and he's in his fifties or older.The ending of the film was cheesy yet uplifting at the same time, but felt truly right as the way the film should have ended. This is such a Disney cliché, but it made me want to ""chase my dreams"" in a way. It is not one of the greatest movies or one of the greatest movies by the great Brad Bird, but it is a delight to watch.",Tomorrowland
135,pinkarray,Okay movie but...,6,28 January 2016,"I think it took a bit too long to come to a conclusion for a kids movie. Should've been cut like 30 minutes down and it wouldn't have been meandering and torturous. I couldn't sit through the whole movie without putting it off for later. Also, I think that it is creepy for younger kids. If they took out the dark parts, perhaps it wouldn't make 5-year- olds liable to get scared. But since they made the film we got, it shouldn't be for small children. The acting was okay, the Young Casey did worse due to her young age while actors like Athena was cute but still could've done better. There were some ""What"" moments in this weird movie, though sometimes it was weird in a good way, other original parts didn't work well.The story shows a young boy in Disney World's tommorowland, he has got a girlfriend (oh no) named Athena. He chases her on the Small World ride, which has detected his T thing and led him to a big water and soon, we see him flying.The ending of the movie took some time to figure out what this whole movie was about, at first, I didn't think it did the film justice but the more I think about it, I understand it more. Though, the dialogue was been-there-done-that.5.9/10.",Tomorrowland
136,JohnWelles,Yesterday-land,5,10 September 2015,"""Tomorrowland"" (2015), directed by Brad Bird, is a science fiction film that tries to be bold, original and optimistic, to translate the hope for the future felt in the 1950s into 2015. It's a brave attempt, but sadly Bird isn't successful. Formerly the director of the animated films ""The Iron Giant"" (1999), ""The Incredibles"" (2004) and ""Ratatouille"" (2007), before making his live action film debut with ""Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" (2011), Bird has always been hailed as an unique filmmaker, someone who helped seal Pixar's reputation as the finest animation studio in America, but here something has seriously gone askew.It's perhaps the script's fault, authored by Damon Lindelof with Bird, which insists on a bright, cheery optimism as its rasion d'etre and then tells its audience this, repeatedly. Hugh Laurie as Nix, the principle villain, is presented as such a ridiculous, doom-mongering character that it is hard to take the character's threat to the protagonists seriously. What is normally a thematic undercurrent to a movie becomes a hyperbolic statement, expanded upon by character's being given speeches as clunky as the retro design of Tomorrowland itself is sleek and smooth. There's no subtlety in the script at all and talented actors like George Clooney and Britt Robertson have an uphill task when their roles are defined in single, non-changing character traits. Only Raffey Cassidy as the android Athena manages to imbue her character with any nuance and depth.This might be all the more easily forgivable if Bird handled the scenes with the wonder and awe the script continuously rhapsodises about, but the design of the future, in keeping with the 1950s roots of the film, is predictable and is more likely to inspire waves of familiarity rather than astonishment, even when Tomorrowland is introduced to Casey via a continuous six minute shot. The computer-generated effects here are frequently more banal than extraordinary; only two sequences, at the decommissioning of a NASA shuttle launch pad and a scene at the Eiffel Tower really work in terms of special effects. These highpoints contrast with the film as it nears its climax, which becomes rushed and unclear, with the editing of Craig Wood and Walter Murch (who cut many of Francis Ford Coppola's films, including ""Apocalypse Now"" [1979]), becoming depressingly reminiscent of television commercials.Many of these defects might have become mitigated in fact, if, like Bird's finest films, it had been animated. With another script rewrite introducing much needed doses of humour, it wouldn't be hard to imagine it as a successful Pixar film. As it is though, this is an extended misfire.",Tomorrowland
137,abouhelier-r,Tomorrowland,9,24 May 2015,"Bound by a shared destiny, a teen bursting with scientific curiosity and a former boy-genius inventor embark on a mission to unearth the secrets of a place somewhere in time and space that exists in their collective memory.Tomorrowland is a geographical situation in Disney World but there's no proper backstory and that is exactly what's interesting, finding this unique way to tell this story that anyone could have a connection with. This film is a new branded Disney big action summer blockbuster that feels like a theme park ride with also real emotional experience. Walt Disney was a guy that believed in taking an active role in the future and he viewed it as an exciting thing, as something that have enormous challenges. The promise of Tomorrowland is that the future is what we make of it, a shining hope. This is what can happen if you don't give up, this is what we're capable of and this is what we can achieve. I was really excited to see that movie, not only because it's Disney branded but also because Brad Bird is an amazing director. I've loved his animation works such as The Incredibles or Ratatouille and his live action premiere with Ghost Protocol was fantastic as well. Once again with live action and sci-fi, he showed he completely understands what he's doing behind the camera and he's by far the aspect of this movie. Plus, sounds and visuals are such an experience. In fact, everyone's complaining about movie industry originality and the fact that we're making the same movies over and over again. Here we have not a sequel, not a movie which is part of a franchise, neither a reboot but a holly original and unique film with an extremely creative vision. Part Jules Verne, part Apple Store, Bird's vision of the future is everything you hoped you'd live long enough to see when you were a child. This film attempts to bring back optimism into style by making a strong argument against the kind of future we usually offer to our own children and against this collective resignation about our future like ""yeah we're all just passenger on this crappy bus..."" But when did it change? Our vision when we were kids was so positive, what made it change? Can we make it back to this other way of thinking? The trailer did not really show much and in this day and age I have to respect that and stay super vague. Casey's passion is space, her father worked for NASA, she's not the most popular girl at school but she's not really an outcast either, she is a normal girl who wants to find her place in the universe and she believes that is in space but NASA system is obsolete. Casey seems very hopeful about the future. Indeed performances are all very good. Britt Robertson really manages to explore the depth of her character. There are lots of humour as well as action in this film and she does a great job with that too. Moreover, George Clooney is a great actor but he's also in our popular culture a guy who sticks his neck out for things he believes in, who means what he says and steps out in order to say it. Here he's not his usual ""Ocean"" playboy character as Frank is the most cynical person you could ever meet ever. We get the sense that he's an older grumpy man and once we get to know more about him we start to understand why he behaves and feels that way which makes us care a lot more about him. Plus, the whole family dynamic is turned upside down because the parents are the younger version. However, the way the villain was introduce and how they have to avoid the catastrophe did not work that much and felt a little cliché for such an original movie.Tomorrowland has a special and cool way to unravel the plot, it didn't tell you everything out all at once. It's like bread crumbs you're following along with the characters and it made me feel like a child again learning along going on this adventure. Good feeling! The film is actually not about Tomorrowland but about the journey to Tomorrowland and it's an interesting journey, but some people might be disappointed by that. It's like a movie called Neverland but for the whole movie it deals with Peter Pan figuring out the second star to the right and straight on till morning is how you actually get there. Somehow the movie finds a way to take us on this journey with a strong point. If you look at something and keep aiming to your goal you'll be drowned by it. We all shaped what the future is we just have to change our vision and we'll be moving towards that goal, don't just accept a future you don't believe in. Overall, the journey to Tomorrowland was so much fun. Filled with a lot of awes and wonder, amazing design and scene constructions, great humour, original plot and good performances.",Tomorrowland
138,Come-and-Review,"Not that bad, but needs to be seen once",6,20 June 2015,"I think many users went down a little too much with ratings on this, 1/10 ratings are deserved by that huge amount of B Apocalipse Movies, and just a few other titles.As I said in the title, this movie is not really a bad movie, it's more an OK movie. Afterall, much of the acting was quite good, I was partly impressed by the performance of actress Raffey Cassidy, I enjoyed Hugh Laurie's monologue towards the end, and Clooney managed to give a good impression on that. I wasn't homever that sure on the lead role actress, though I can't say that she did bad acting.Afterall, much of the story was enough entertaining until a series of things that constantly changed in the plot left the last half-hour with a bad taste and the feel that writers started up with a well conceived plot, that they changed constantly until the end. Also, the way the story is introduced left me disappointed. Effects where well made, not as some reviewers say.The final message of the film wasn't a bad message either. That's the reason I must say that this isn't a bad movie, because it delivers a good message, it has quite some good acting in it, and very many points in favor.The real problems that I've met are the following;First: This wasn't the movie I was expecting. The trailers made believe that it was something more ""Interstellar""-ish, thoughtful than what it was at the end. Even the minimal score I heard in the trailer was different.Second: Product placement. I can't accept the way in a particular scene the need of advertising a well-known biscuit trademark distracted from the movie plot, and how a character broke on the back of another a sacred millennium falcon model.Third: Music. As I said, the trailer featured a more adveniristic kind of music, which reminded me of Zimmer's late works, which was completely different by the score by Michael Giacchino. Giacchino indeed has made undoubtfully great scores, like the entirely played by a big band ""The Incredibles"" score, or the catchy ""Up"" score, or maybe even the last two star trek movie scores; but what I heard in this movie was a 'usual' Giacchino score, of which I see no reason to hear in every single movie.This is what left me putting a 6/10 rating. Again, I don't think that you should not watch this movie. Watch it, just don't have the expectations I had by watching the trailers. I suggest also to skip any trailer.",Tomorrowland
139,stephendaxter,A fun family film with some late plot issues,8,28 May 2015,"Tomorrowland was one of my most anticipated movies of 2015 and a lot of that was because the film was shrouded in mystery and did not give a lot away in the trailers making me really interested to see it. Although it was a really good film, some things just didn't quite work as well as I thought they should have. Firstly, the film was as expected visually amazing and the scenes in Tomorrowland I thought looked great despite the city being a white futuristic place that has been visualised before. I was a little disappointed that the film didn't spend a whole lot of time in the Tomorrowland we see in the trailers but I guess that was due to the overall story of the film reaching well beyond just Tomorrowland. The characters and their interactions with each other we're definitely the highlight of the film. You see how they develop their relationships over the course of this movie.The overall plot of the film, or what we knew of the plot prior to watching it seemed very interesting, and for the first half of the film I was completely engaged and wanting to know more. Even though I was still intrigued, as the film went on the plot got pretty complex and had a lot of moving parts that were getting difficult to keep track of. I feel that it was trying to do so much with so little time and that resulted in some things going unexplained for most or all of the film. Despite those late story issues and a few unexplained events in some characters' histories leading to some confusion, the movie was overall pretty entertaining. The greatly written characters and performances come together to make this film a fun time for both kids and adults. - 7.7",Tomorrowland
140,michaelhirakida,Asking Questions: The Movie!,3,13 June 2015,"So many god forsaken questions are asked in Tomorrowland. It's always Why are we doing this? Why can't we do that? What's Happening? What's Going On? Who in the hell are they? What is that? So on and so on. This is one of the most tiresome and annoying movies of 2015 and for good reason. The whole movie is a mess. From it's crappy acting to crappy story, there is no hope once the first quarter of the movie is over.I was also disappointed. This is one of the best concepts I have seen in a long time and to see it used in such tripe is cringe worthy. First off, the movie begins with traveling to an amazing world. It has a great visuals design and lots of creativity and it's a good looking utopia. We then have a girl named Casey finding a rare demo pin used to transport people to the titular world and now she is on the run with an angry George Clooney and little robot girl. Also, Hugh Laurie is the villain. Just saying.The concept is amazing and it's just plain sad to see it not used enough. Basically, the whole point of the movie is to show that we are coming to the point in history where the world will turn into a dystopia. But we can change that if we all can come together. That's Great! I love the concept because I totally agree. But instead, the whole movie is done so poorly that it is too busy doing it's biggest flaw.The flaw of Asking Questions. I know people need to get information out of people to make the plot go on. It's necessary. But when you're making a movie, you have to ask questions once in a while when something big happens or when something is about to be revealed. NOT EVERY 10 FREAKING SECONDS! The problem also is that they are unnecessary! Very! But they keep asking them anyways and it gets really annoying! The movie's climax is awful. The whole battle scene that ends the movie takes place in an empty deserted place with two big robots, one laser gun and a teleporter that leads back to Earth. WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA!? Why not some place more lively?! Jesus Christ, I mean, this was really the best you could come up with? I'm sad and angry that this film doesn't succeed in what it's trying to tell us even though it is clear. I'm not surprised at why this movie flopped. This is so far the worst film of the year. Stay away from this garbage. What was Brad Bird thinking?! Disney can do so much better.35/100 D",Tomorrowland

It is but a width of a hair away. Thank you to those who made this movie and thanks to each and every one who try their best to make the world a better place. Keep hope and hold on to the light that is inside of you.

Nice thinking in some parts of the script, but overall, in 2015 we should be able to produce real sci-fi films and not such kind of bull. George Clooney could have saved these hours of filming for a better movie. I watched the movie just for him and I wasted 2 full hours! Completely wasted.

143,Marta,Brad Bird let me down,3,24 May 2015,"Here is the perfect example of a film that is gorgeous to look at but completely empty. Far less experienced filmmakers have created simple, inexpensive films that develop the characters and allow the viewers to create a bond with them, thanks to a good script which is the cornerstone of a great movie. How I wish Brad Bird had put more of the money spent on this film toward a better script to help us care about his characters and their flashy CGI surroundings. Every bit of the budget is on the screen in this film, and it's virtually hollow emotionally. I had not one second of concern that anyone would be in any danger, and no character made me want to root for them. I can't even express how little this movie affected me. It was 130 minutes of boredom. I was yawning 20 minutes in and never really stopped, and I never fall asleep in a theatre. The viewer never has a clear picture of what the film is trying to say, and I don't think the filmmakers did either. They must have lost control of this film early in the process or never really had a clear story plot line, unless the studio interfered post-production. The first 2/3rds of the movie all we see is the main female character running around the country until she finds George Clooney. I am a Clooney fan, and when he comes into the picture there is a little more action, but really, there is too much larking about and not enough story development. The problems are not due to the acting. That is fairly decent, but actors can't compensate for a bad script.The Romper Room-inspired idea of sending robots out to coyly invite the ""new idea"" people to Tomorrowland is laughingly simplistic and done with all the solemnity of a graduation ceremony. During this scene (while I tried not to hoot in derision at the screen) I was reminded of some of the 1950s sci-fi films where the self-appointed best and brightest blasted off from a doomed planet to start life elsewhere, and leave the vulgar rabble back on Earth to die. The bone-headed writers were implying that only a select few could have an idea that might save mankind, when in reality some of the most truly innovative ideas can come from that ""vulgar rabble.""Another reviewer mentions the huge wind turbines that are shown through a portal near the end; the way the film presents this suggests fans are the answer to everything. The reviewer discusses the thousands of birds that get chewed up in them each year; my thoughts exactly as I watched. It's far too trite of a scene to be in a film predicated to be futuristic and worried about life on Earth. A film about Tomorrowland should be thinking beyond wind turbines. It should be cutting edge. The film just parrots the green technology of today without coming up with any new ideas. It's inexcusable the way the potential this film had was squandered. Thank I can't even summon up enough interest in the film to do a decent review, and it doesn't deserve it. Don't waste your money on it...I wish I could get mine back.",Tomorrowland

148,FilmMuscle,Brad Bird's First Misfire?,6,24 May 2015,"After the (commercial and/or critical) failures that were John Carter and The Lone Ranger, Disney's latest venture into original storytelling territory shows the involvement of impressive talent, including esteemed director Brad Bird, bonafide movie star George Clooney, and possibly the most divisive screenwriter in Damon Lindelof. This film shifts between two different dimensions throughout its runtime–that of our world and the one of the magical Tomorrowland, which features a population predominantly of kids. This is one of those transparently sci-fi cities that has been built to escape the ills of Earth and its consumptive, selfish inhabitants. When Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) receives the ultimate tease of an invite to this wondrous place through an unremarkably-branded pin, her elated scientific spirit naturally sends her on a Disney-caliber journey to find the entrance to this mysterious land.As you can expect, the absolutely alluring visuals effectively convey the sheer spectacle of this adventure in classic family storytelling; the contrast between the two different worlds is especially noticeable as the characters navigate from a very much modern and darkly-hued aesthetic to a totally glamorous, fairytale-like one. Newcomer actress Robertson successfully translates to the big screen, reminding audiences of that teenage naivete and defiant behavior we have identified with throughout Steven Spielberg's filmography. The most notable performance of all though comes from a little girl (Athena–played by Raffey Cassidy) who's sent from the future to help Casey out on this mission. Cassidy is just infused with so much surprising maturity and deadpan expression, ultimately unyielding in her purpose.Now, the picture itself seems to be quite optimistic about a society that clearly isn't doing anything to improve environmental conditions. It also certainly doesn't help when those people pan a movie with any environmental messages as ""heavy-handed"" or ""preachy."" So, you won't do anything to improve Earth's health and when someone reminds you that something must really be done about it, you write them off as annoying and preachy. It all sounds logical, doesn't it? Anyways, I found those thematic ideas substantially more compelling than the actual plot, which felt like it was only slightly progressing narratively from Point A to B to C to D and so on without any real necessity to the overall story. The characters reach one creatively-designed destination only for it to lead them to a further creatively-designed destination.The first time you see the city of Tomorrowland, of course you're astonished by its visual and architectural splendor, but the pleasure of the beautiful image wears off rather quickly. The pattern of this film largely comprises sequences that run on for far too long. For instance, the opening sequence that takes us back to Frank Walker's (Clooney) childhood–meant as an introduction to the miraculous setting– drags on and on, forcing you to continue waiting for the inexperienced, confused true protagonist (Britt Robertson) to finally show up. In addition, the premise is definitely not as original and memorable as Disney and Brad Bird promises it to be.The film is obviously wrapped up with so much optimism, kiddy delight , and overall lightness that it occasionally feels like nothing more than an expensive commercial for Disneyland and, more specifically, one of its attractions with the same name: Tomorrowland. Even when contemplating its environmental themes that are never afraid to discuss the frailty of the future and the frequent ignorance of humanity, it's never pushed to that final honest conclusion because the real hard truth-tellers in the movie, who unwind a whole rant on how pathetic apocalyptic fiction and the human acceptance of the planet's imminent collapse is, blatantly turn out to be exaggerated villains that need to be defeated for ""real hope"" to win the day.Some of these elements can be forgiven because it is a very family- friendly feature at the end of the day, but many other parts of it end up being deeply frustrating because of how terribly trustful the movie is in humanity after vividly displaying plenty of footage that underlines their severe mistakes. Last year's original science-fiction exhibition of brilliance, Interstellar, stunningly managed to balance the cynicism with more convincing optimism–it will take a lot of loss to eventually continue the human race because Earth is frankly hopeless at this point, but the species of scientists and engineers have always discovered an answer in the darkest of times. Tomorrowland's one suggestion for a solution to all these daunting predicaments seems to be ""just believe!"" Classic Disney mottos.",Tomorrowland
149,lucasversantvoort,"Fun, but poor narrative structure",6,16 June 2015,"It's always interesting to see a director, known primarily for his animated fare, to direct a live-action film. Granted, this isn't his first rodeo; he'd already directed Mission impossible: Ghost Protocol. Tomorrowland, in a nutshell, is a film about hope, specifically about hope for the future. As Frank Walker (George Clooney) tells us in his opening monologue, back in his day, the future was different; everyone looked at the future with optimistic glee. And yet, at some point, optimism turned to pessimism and the future turned bleak. Tomorrowland then is Brad Bird's way of saying, 'let's put away Orwell's 1984 and make a brighter future for ourselves.' A nice sentiment for sure. Unfortunately, the film attached to this sentiment has some fatal flaws.We start our journey with young Frank Walker showing his unfinished jet pack at a science fair. It's rejected but a young girl, Athena, sees something in him and tells him to follow her group through the theme park using a special pin. He sneaks on a ferry, enters a tunnel and due to the pin ends up in Tomorrowland. We then cut to the present to a new character, a girl called Casey Newton (played by Britt Robertson, aka I-can't-believe-it's-not Jennifer Lawrence). Like the young Walker, she shares an enthusiasm for the future, outer space in particular. She eventually finds a similar pin like the one Walker was given in her belongings. When she touches it, she's instantly transported to Tomorrowland. But the pin has a limited amount of power and so, Case has to find another way of getting there and it isn't long before she crosses paths with Athena, an older Frank Walker and a gang of killer robots seeking to prevent them from going to Tomorrowland at all costs.I'll start with the bad: the plot is a bit of a mess. This isn't so much due to poor writing as a poor narrative structure. But then again, since one of the film's writers also wrote and created Lost, I can't say I'm surprised. I mean, we first follow young Walker who we then leave behind to follow Casey who then stumbles from scene to scene before finally meeting Athena and old Frank Walker and only then are the film's villain and the main goal slowly revealed. Mind you, at this point we've only got about 20-30 minutes to go. This means that there's only two things that keep you interested: Casey's desire to go to Tomorrowland and the action set pieces. The film does a good job of first introducing you to Tomorrowland and then taking it away, leaving you to share Casey's desire to return. As for the action, it's pretty inventive and fun. If you've seen the trailer, you'll probably know what to expect: lots of lasers, time warps and so on. The enemy robots are a funny bunch too, particularly the leader, Dave Clark (Matthew MacCaull) who has this robotic grin on his face that just cracks me up. It's like Schwarzenegger's Terminator smile, only funny. I like some of the in-jokes as well. There's a fight in what looks like a comic book store with all kinds of memorabilia strewn about, referencing Planet of the Apes, Star Wars, etc. When the fight breaks out, composer Michael Giacchino makes musical references to those films' scores. It's pretty neat if you can spot them.So there's a lot to like: inventive action, humor, the works. But it's the lacking sense of structure that drags the experience down. You can only share Casey's desire to travel to Tomorrowland for so long before you start questioning the point of it all.",Tomorrowland

Movie feels quite old fashion but in a good way. Story's incoherence is it's biggest weakness, but it's cleverness helps a lot. It feels little bit like old Steven Spielberg movies back eighties. Visually it is beautiful to watch. Even the cliché at the end of movie won't make it bad. George Clooney and Britt Robertson are good choice their roles. Movie is full of clever surprises that hold the story solid. It is rare that movie with younger target audience is clever enough to satisfy adult audience, but Tomorrowland is just like that. Clever and interesting enough. Hopefully Disney will hold that with upcoming Star Wars movie. This kind of clever movies are enjoyable to watch.",Tomorrowland

It is much better than that.Tomorowland combines humour, action, great adventure, sharp script, thoughtfulness and social commentary in a thoroughly enjoyable package. And robots. Robots are always good. Especially killer robots with, 'have a nice day,' smiles.So when the preaching arrives about the sorry state of our society you won't mind. It's damning truth is balanced by our hero's desire and ability to do something about it.A memory that I took away from this movie is the story of the two wolves. I forget the exact words but one is despair and the other is hope. They are always fighting. Which one wins? The one that you feed!

That will have you believing in ingenuity and discovery and voting for cooperation with all mankind. At least that's what they would have you believe. What they attempted to do. But Tomorrowland is not this grand adventure. In fact, it's something of a snooze fest.The lead character, played by Britt Robertson, is supposed to be a bright young lady who has it in her to save the world. But throughout the two hour romp through CGI, you never actually get to see this. All you see is a tenacious young woman who talks a good game but never really gets the chance to put her money where her mouth is. George Clooney, her predecessor, is a languid old man who has lost the will to fight and who effectively sucks all of the cinematic tension out of the story. He deflated the importance of their race to survival so much so that you don't realize when the film is at its climax.However, the saving grace of this movie is Raffey Cassidy who gives her android character myriad emotions and a complexity that puts her co stars to shame. She alone isn't afraid to explore the script handed to her and you believe her when she says she believes that they three can save the world.But the acting wasn't the only bad thing here. The viewer never really gets to learn about Tommorowland. They tip toe around it the entire time speaking only of Earth and its problems. You wonder why its called Tomorrowland in the first place. The villains are also so two dimensional they you forget to hate them or root for their demise. The bland monotonous way in which they want to destroy the world is so uninspired or wicked that you are confused as to why they want to destroy it. The stupid smiling robots who chase our heroes are also quite asinine and fail to bring the quirk that they were intended for.I really can't see this movie being entertaining for anyone.

George Clooney does well on his role and I love Raffrey Cassidy, she's a great aspiring actress.Tomorrowland was released at a terrible time though, it was released the same year as the Star Wars The Force Awakens, and Disney was aggressively advertising that film.

154,vistheindian,Even the greatest fumble,6,25 May 2015,"Quickie Review:In a world where pessimism is so easy to succumb to, Casey (Britt Robertson) remains hopeful and optimistic. When she glimpses a futuristic world by the touch of a pin, she feels destined to revisit that world. An ex boy-genius turned disgruntled old man Frank (George Clooney) and Casey work together to journey back to Tomorrowland. There is a lot to like about Tomorrowland, mainly the characters and the world building. There's a great sense of adventure for most of the movie but the last act of the film ended up being a disappointing destination to an stimulating journey. The themes and message of the movie is hammered over the head, draining out all of the fun. While not a complete disaster, the movie leaves much to be desired.Full Review:I am a huge fan of director Brad Bird's work, The Incredibles, Iron Giant, Ratatouille, and Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol. With such an impressive filmography, it's hard not to be excited for his latest project.While it is visually spectacular especially with the depiction of Tomorrowland, this movie is completely character driven. I've seen Britt Robertson in her TV and movie works where she was certainly serviceable, but as the lead in this movie she really gets into her stride. We are experiencing this adventure through her so it was important that she got us to mirror her emotion. She definitely achieved that with ease because I was just as curious and thrilled to visit Tomorrowland. It's no surprise that George Clooney was good in this movie, but what is surprising is the character he plays. He is cranky about everything but with very few scenes he was able to show us believably that his cynical nature is just an outer shell he has built up over time. So, the character differences between Casey and Frank do lead to some funny back and forth dialogue. However, the secret weapon of Tomorrowland is Athena played by Raffey Cassidy. Normally I'm cautious of child actors, but Cassidy held her own even with George Clooney. She completely stole the show, the biggest redeemable aspect of a somewhat mediocre movie.I wouldn't be surprised if some people complained that there wasn't enough of Tomorrowland. Though a valid complaint that honestly is not the biggest problem, because the characters were so likable that whatever they did you enjoy the journey with them. The main issue I have is with the last 20-30mins of the movie where the message of the movie is spelled out for us. It's more the execution of conveying that message I have a problem with. I like movies when they are thought-provoking. The key word here being provoking, not spoon-feeding. Instead I felt like I was being lectured and schooled on morality during what was supposed to be entertainment. There was no subtlety in it and felt like the audience was being treated like a child. It's unfortunate that just the ending alone brought down the whole movie, but that really is the case.I must stress though, I didn't hate the movie, but there were some obvious areas the movie could've improved upon. Luckily following the quest of the main characters was entertaining due to good development of their personalities. I can recommend checking the movie out when it's out on VOD, and yet if it weren't for my cinema membership I don't know if I'd pay full price for this.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Tomorrowland
155,WisdomsHammer,Live action sci-fi cartoon that treats you like you're stupid,3,13 May 2016,"This is a story about hope that is spoon-fed to the audience and isn't meant to be taken seriously. To set the tone, both of the main characters should have died 5 times in the first several minutes of each of their introductory stories, so this is basically a live- action cartoon filled with slapstick humor that, for me, falls flat. Lots of inane banter, playing in traffic, crashing into things, funny noises, and getting hit in the head, all supposedly hilarious. Sure, maybe for a toddler. I also found it irritating that the movie was filled with exposition. Sometimes they told you when they could have shown you, and sometimes they showed you and then explained it to you anyway because apparently we as the audience aren't smart enough to understand what's going on. The characters acted inconsistently, the story kept interrupting itself, and the actors, understandably, seemed bored to tears through most of it. The characters were constantly doing things that didn't make sense then acting surprised when things happened that actually did make sense. I don't want to believe that Brad Bird ruined this movie, but his name is all over it. It really is too bad. Things I did like about this film: The opening and ending credit sequences were great, the overall production design was fantastic and fun, and Michael Giacchino's soundtrack was wonderful. Raffey Cassidy's performance outshone everyone else's, which unfortunately isn't saying much. But I did think she was excellent. For those reviewers who think the rest of us didn't understand the movie - this movie was made for you. I'm glad you enjoyed it.",Tomorrowland
156,Equalizer16,"'A World Beyond', well not so beyond if touching one pin can take you there.",5,31 May 2015,"Disney have attempted to get their audiences thinking about the future, and what to do to make the world better. However I must say I don't think that they've been very successful. Tomorrowland more like Rotten Tomatoland.Although the idea of land that tries to advance in the human imagination is an interesting and attracting story, I don't think Disney has done well with it, and could have made it more affecting to the audience, to make them think. They have also tried to confuse the audience to the end, but could have chosen something more vital to story to get the audience confused about.As usual in most family films, it's always up to the young people to save the world, which is fine, but why can't some old people go on an emotional journey and be the special person. Granted though, the film does roughly try to inspire people to be special and have creative thoughts from other people. However apparently only a number of people have creative thoughts. I think Clooney brought an enjoyable old aged actor performance to the film, along with Hugh Laurie who we could see part of Gregory House in Laurie's character. However, I was not keen on Britt Robertson's energetic and curious character as she is constantly going on without any sleep.I give the film a 5/10, and suggest for people with high hopes for the film not to expect a mind changing experience. I did into watch this film because I wanted to, but I was curious, but to me the film was too Disney, and I think could have been better if made in a much thoughtful, and fascinating way, then it could have made a lasting impact to the audience.",Tomorrowland
157,Man99204,Major Disappointment,4,20 April 2016,"This should have been an amazing movie. Sadly, it was not.Most of the problems can all be attributed to a seriously flawed script. It makes absolutely no sense at times. Even in a fantasy movie there has to be some sort of logic in the script. The last few scenes fall totally apart when ""political statement"" becomes more important than ""entertainment""I am a major fan of George Clooney. I have been for years. But he is hopelessly miscast in this role. As is Britt Robertson as the female lead. She appears to be highly medicated in most of her scenes. She has basically one response to any situation - a blank ""cow like stare"". It is not ""cute"", it just becomes incredibly annoying.The younger cast, Raffey Cassidy as Athena and Thomas Robinson playing a younger version of the Clooney character are wonderful. This would have been a far better movie if Clooney and Robertson had been ditched and the movie focused on the younger characters.Despite all its flaws, this is still a movie worth watching.

This film is not only about dreamers and believing, but it is also about propaganda. A idea of this movie was zapped into your head that was a lie, but just because it was a lie doesn't mean what you got still wasn't beautiful. This film has strong characters. There the best part of the film. There over the top tropes and fun acting make the film a lot stronger. The acting is also a plus in this film that helps make the characters stronger as they develop. The film falls a bit on the way it executed its story. While the story is good it could have been handled better. The second halve of this film just feels too messy and disjointed. And while there are some iconic memorable lines that help us understand the purpose of this film, and tells us what the message is some actions just don't match upHonestly if this was animated this film would probably be a lot more beloved. the story presented here doesn't work well on a live action base which is were the film took the biggest nose diveStill like Interstellar this is still worth a watch",Tomorrowland
160,byson5186,Such Imagination,7,3 November 2015,"Before I start to talk about this movie, I want to mention another topic that will relate to this movie. We all know that whenever we put on a movie on disk or even videotape that before the movie starts or even previews we always see these FBI Warnings about video piracy. A familiar scene we remember from when we were kids. The problem with video piracy, is movies are expensive to make and if they don't earn all the money they deserve, they can lose a lot of money. That could keep the studio from even making sequels, because they haven't earned enough money.I brought this up, because this movie did not earn a lot of money at the box-office. It was it's own original story, and was a box-office flop. I'm asking myself, if movies really need to have such expensive budgets? If a movie has a high budget, they probably think it will be a success, but not always. Like, Prince Of Persia Sands Of Time was supposed to be the new Pirates Of The Caribbean, but it didn't earn enough money, so we can scratch a sequel from that movie.But, even some low budget movies/productions at times seem to be well-done and really good. A few examples, let's think it's almost the Holiday Season so a lot of us will want to see Home Alone. That movie was the highest grossing movie of 1990. They originally had plans for other scenes like the nutcrackers coming to life in Kevin's dream. But, that was too expensive for the budget. It's still a great movie, and possibly even better without those scenes. Other recent low budget movies I liked: The Way Way Back, Earth To Echo, and Paper Towns. My favorite movie is a low budget movie and independent Canadian film called Junior High Spy. It had some bad acting, but still a well-thought out movie that entertains me more than any other movie. The kid actors in that movie also seem cooler than the kid actors we'd see in a Hollywood movie.Even with special effects, I watched Power Rangers as a kid which was using it's footage from Zyuranger. I'm watching Zyuranger years later, and hear it was a low budget production. But, I'd think it would have a higher budget, especially more than Power Rangers as the special effects came from that show. Also, they filmed in more public places in that show, including amusement parks. Zyuranger is a better series than Power Rangers.So, where have I been going? It's just I feel like movie studios could write the same kind of stories, but have easy ways on cutting back costs which could save them money, and still make an entertaining movie.I haven't heard that much about TomorrowLand. I did see trailers, and finally rented it from RedBox. While seeing it, I couldn't help but think wow. This will be like the most imaginative movie you'll ever see. It kept me entertained, I really enjoyed it and laughed at certain parts. It was definitely an entertaining movie. Some of the movie looked like Star Wars, and I thought the action in it was like action in Spy Kids. What were some ways the movie went wrong where it wasn't as good as it could have been? I felt like the movie started out pretty cool, at least when the adventure started. But, after the adventure starts, the movie seems to take us in a different direction and we don't see as much as Casey's Dad and brother as we should have. I also felt that the movie plot was hard to understand. Still, the movie left us with a good message that the future is up to us. The special effects from this movie are totally astounding. They might make you think differently about this world. In all, it had amazing special effects, but could have been a better story. The second half seems to focus more on the action and special effects than story. But, I'm sure this movie will keep you entertained the whole way through. I give it a 7/10.",Tomorrowland
161,valen060,"Simple, Flawed Story with Valuable Morals",8,23 May 2015,"First of all, I'd like to take this moment in commemorating the 60th anniversary of a particular ""land"" that opened along with Disneyland back in 1955. Now for my review, director Brad Bird has helmed a few interesting movies over the years for his latest film aptly titled Tomorrowland; it provides what appears to be an insight on the tomorrow that almost came to be specifically in Walt Disney World's EPCOT (as well as other parts of the world) of now. Uncle Walt himself once said, ""It's something that will never be finished. Something that will keep developing."" His words basically opened the doors for future generations to make and contribute for years to come and Tomorrowland is one of those results.Star George Clooney portrays former boy genius Francis ""Frank"" Walker, who as a kid dreamed big in letting his inventions become useful in society. Despite being turned away by superiors at a young age, he somehow finds an opportunity by being transported into a flourishing utopia where science has greatly advanced beyond the imagination. Years have passed since that day, and Frank has found an unlikely protégé in troubled, yet clever youth Casey, who stumbled upon the very place he once discovered as a kid courtesy of a mysterious pin.For starters, the utopian setting and visuals are certainly eye-catching as though you've been raptured into a dazzling futuristic landscape. Whereas the two lead characters, to me personally, feel relatable to people I knew in life. One notable scene that left me amazed and further curious was how the film crew blended some of Walt Disney's real-life innovations used in his theme parks as facades to a much more hidden agenda (provided slyly by Bird and writer Damon Lindelof). Admittedly, the story does lose itself among all the robust, well-crafted visuals, but I felt it could've pushed farther. The fairly new, Raffey Cassidy as recruiter Athena has a few moments that actually stood out amusingly for her young age with both wit and intellect, while former 'House' star Hugh Laurie portrays the villain Nix who plots to use his own knowledge for something far much more, though I wouldn't consider him a major threat compared to menacing ones shown frequently in Marvel films these days.Despite a story that proves difficult, but intriguing to follow for a running time of over two hours, Bird's trail of animated hits and his transition to live-action with the thrilling 'Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol' all lead up gradually to yet another interesting follow-up worth pondering over. With Britt Robertson's Casey Newton tagging along for the ride, both she and Frank learn that they're not so different and what they discover in this utopia is more than a revelation, but finding themselves on what they were missing in their lives: enlightenment and proper motivation. To close, while young kids may easily point out obvious references to Disneyland or its fellow sister parks, grown-ups will be left bewildered and curious on how such a society may come-to-be depending on the follies of human beings and the dire consequences that follow from it.",Tomorrowland
162,margulanabutrlov,Tomorrowland Review,8,25 March 2019,"Given a badge that takes her to an alternative world, Casey (Robertson) looks for an explanation.
There are two ways to view the use of theme-park rides as inspiration for movies. The first, held by many, is it represents a dearth of ideas and a grab for anything with a smidge of brand recognition and, therefore, a small leg-up at the box office. But there is another, less cynical view and it's embodied by Brad Bird's sugared-up, awestruck adventure: if you start with something that fires kids' imaginations, but has no inherent plot, you have no limits. The lack of defined story makes the plot possibilities endless, and there is nothing more exciting than an unfettered mind.
A vague brief means freedom. Tomorrowland is technically not even based on a ride; it's based on an entire theme-park zone. Walt Disney made Tomorrowland part of the original Disneyland in 1955 to represent a future crackling with potential. He believed that the next day would always be better, more thrilling and more full of blinking lights and beepy robots than the last. So why, asks Bird, has the future become something we fear? When did it stop making us dream of wearing jumpsuits on the moon and start making us look for a place to hide when the end comes?
Bird's story is told via Casey (Britt Robertson) and Frank (George Clooney). Frank was a child brimming with the wonder of science. A visit to the 1964 New York World Fair to show off the jetpack he invented, which almost worked, introduced him to a shady Steve Jobs/Walt Disney character (Laurie) and, somehow, a hidden futuristic world. Then, for reasons not initially revealed, he grew into a right old grump - going into hiding and depriving the world of his brain. Casey has what Frank lost. She believes that anything is possible, what's broken can be fixed and that the best-case scenario is no less likely than the worst. Given a mysterious pin that transports her to the alternative world Frank once knew, she determines to find out what, where and when it is.
This is all in about the first 20 minutes and we'll leave the set-up there. Tomorrowland is a film that benefits from little knowledge before you buckle in, which is good, because trying to explain its plot would take up the rest of this review. If that sounds like a negative, it is not. Bird and screenwriting partner Damon Lindelof (co-creator of Lost) have constructed a story in which you really don't know what's going to happen next. It's a rare thrill. In so many family action films the best you can hope for is a multiple-choice option - will the hero beat the villain now or in around 25 minutes? Yet here there is constant surprise, interesting ideas, and Bird's enthusiasm as a director never lets up.
Bird has always directed with a natural wonder and curiosity. He's the sort of filmmaker who grabs your hand, gasps, ""You'll never believe what's over here!"" and then drags you there, running and breathless. He's like a very clever little boy who needs to get everything out of his head before he bursts. Half the shots in the film seem to be pointed upwards to reinforce that sense of childish amazement. There is one sequence, in which Frank's heavily booby-trapped house is attacked by evil, grinning robots, that crams in so many mad, exuberant moments of invention that you immediately want to go back and watch again to catch the detail you missed. Bird revels in his world.
Despite all the futuristic business, there is a retro tone. Tomorrowland harks back to a time before the prevailing cinematic mood was one of darkness and grit. Here are flavours of Back To The Future, The Goonies, The Rocketeer, and non-specific Spielberginess. If there's such a thing as 'an '80s feel' then this has it, and if it's possible to define it, then it's the belief that kids are the ones who best understand the world and all its potential weirdness, and adults who have become foolish through loss of curiosity.
Uncharacteristically for Bird, the relationships don't stick together as well as they might. This has always been one of Bird's strengths as a filmmaker: he made a giant robot a curious little brother in The Iron Giant; he detailed the struggles of a marriage through superpowers in The Incredibles; he gave a rat daddy issues in Ratatouille. But there isn't that depth and lightness of touch here. Casey's relationship with her dad is much more discussed than shown, and the bruised friendship between Frank and the little girl (Raffey Cassidy) who brought him to Tomorrowland feels in need of a few more scenes to cement it - though their final exchange offers the best, most resonant line of the movie.
All the cast are on spirited form. We haven't seen Clooney in this kind of summer blockbuster since (whisper it) Batman & Robin, and he appears to be having a much better time here, bringing hints of Everett McGill's madcap nature in O Brother, Where Are Thou? - only in a worse mood and not nearly so dim. Britt Robertson is an equal treat, finding the sweet spot between confidence and confusion and showing strong comic timing. Cassidy works well as the de facto adult, despite being pre-teen.
It may be incredibly mean to criticise a movie so packed with ideas for not having enough, but the rocket runs out of fuel towards the end. Lindelof has always been great at set-ups, but less so with conclusions. He and Bird settle on an ending that's by no means poor, but it doesn't delight like everything it follows and slips onto the rails it's avoided for so long. Still, Tomorrowland lands its message well and sends you on your way, head fizzing with exhilaration and what-ifs. And, in that sense, it's done exactly what it planned to.",Tomorrowland
163,christophershobris,Not What I Expected,5,30 May 2015,"When I went into this I had mediocre expectations. Mainly the partial excitement came from seeing that Brad Bird was directing. So of course I thought this had to have potential. All I can say is, exactly what the title says. However the highlight was surely the stunning visual effects which I think deserves an Oscar nomination. The background shots were jaw dropping. Also the acting was up to par, but the real performance came from not George Clooney, but Britt Robertson. She was funny but serious when the occasion called for it. And I didn't feel like her character was terribly forced. As for everyone else, they could have been played by anybody. Another problem is I'm not sure if this is a kids film or an adult film. Some elements seemed kid friendly like some silly humorous scenes, while others had cussing and some violent fight scenes. Yet somehow it got a PG rating. Come on it's Disney of course I'd expect a kid friendly film. This one not so much.

I have got to appreciate the visual elements of Tomorrowland which were top quality and what is probably expected when you throw $200 million into a film. However I felt the story was a bit disjointed and the acting like it had come straight from the Disney channel.The main female lead seemed like she had ADHD (which might have been true) I get that she had to be the optimistic character but you don't have to act like you have taken a hit of cocaine to look optimistic.Clooney did a good job as a grumpy old man....oh wait he is one already....so he did not have to really act on this film. And the longing look between Clooney and that robot girl were a little creepy at times.I think the story at the end went over my head and I am sure it will go over any children heads Visually top notch but the story and acting could have done with a little work.Also at the end I felt like I was watch an old Captain Planet episode when they were giving out the badges....oh look someone is planting a tree lets give him a badge....oh look some one looking after elephants lets give him a badge.....and when their powers combine GOOOOOO CAPTAIN PLANET!!!,Tomorrowland

The ""plot"" makes not a grain of sense. Clooney and Hugh Laurie phone in their performances, and Britt Robertson needs to go back to acting class. But for the quirky, engaging performance of Raffey Cassidy, this steaming heap of bad sci-fi clichés and cheesy CGI would barely rate a 1. I honestly don't know how Ms. Cassidy was able to hypnotize herself into performing as if in a worthwhile cinematic enterprise. In any case, please think twice before taking a child to this piece of... entertainment. The film is ferociously loud -- loud enough, I think, to damage young eardrums.

166,tjgoalie13,"Interesting Premise, Weak Narrative",6,27 May 2015,"As we all expected Tomorrowland was original, but it suffered from an identity crisis. By that I mean tonally and narratively the film tried to be too many things all at once. The film had great special effects, good action sequences, and pretty good acting, but squanders that on a weak narrative and a lack of clarification in general. Let me clarify what I mean, if you watch this movie in a theater you can enjoy yourself, but after you leave the theater and think about the film it won't make much sense. The lack of explanation leads to the film having a weak narrative, weak villains, and an overly complex premise, and a bunch of characters we see but don't understand. That being said the film is still enjoyable, and is loaded with good humor.

It's not a movie for adults, I would say that its audience is just pre-teen. I did enjoy a lot of the special effects - they kept me amused! I also liked the concept of the movie even though there were times that I struggled to understand what was happening. It is essentially a movie for optimists and dreamers - and there's nothing wrong with that in my book. There are a lot of negative reviews around this movie and I do appreciate where they are coming from. I was lucky enough to see it for free because of taking a young man with learning difficulties. He seemed to enjoy it, so that was a good thing! Think Disney meets Sci-Fi and you get the gist. Don't go out of your way to see it, but at the same time, there's no need to avoid it like the plague.

The film starts out well but gets slow and sluggish until about an hour in. Could have done without all the cat and Mouse chasing and just had more Hugh Laurie because you can NEVER have too much Hugh Laurie. Also you never really understood the conflict. So the world was letting itself fall apart? So what? Why do other planets care? I think that's what makes this film hard to follow and thus the critics and masses couldn't get into it. Bird and Lindelof suffered from muddled plot points but still a visually stunning, fun ride to watch.",Tomorrowland
169,kdavies-69347,"Empty and contrite, but hey... it's Brad Bird.",5,29 September 2015,"First off, I should mention what a huge Brad Bird fan I am. I've been watching his career since 'The Iron Giant' and have raved about his works in the past. That being said, well... this movie was a woe to watch to say the least.Sure there are a lot of positive messages in the film. Don't give up... You can change the world... All is not lost... but it's done so in such a way that ignores the rhetoric of such messages. Seriously, I felt like I was hit over the head repeatedly with so many empty ideals that I thought my eyes were going to implode at the cinema.Let's look at the plot. Smart girl, who never really expresses her intelligence directly but rather more in generalities, travels to another dimension to save mankind from destroying itself because we are being hypnotized by a bad guy from across space and time... or something like that. It's a fairly abstract description of the end of days here. Girl grabs a pin that magically transports only her consciousness to another dimension, but her body stays here in our silly world. She walks into things that are really there in our world, but she can't see them in the other dimension (see trailer). Yet somehow she can jump on a train in the other dimension and float through the planet without bumping into a tree or rock or Semi-truck on the highway. But hey, I don't really understand trans-dimensional consciousness journeys. I took acid once, but I'm not actually a scientist.The idea is that we are being mind-controlled into destroying our planet by someone or something, and that it's actually not OUR fault for destroying the only planet that has any hope of sustaining our lives.Smart girl tries to save the world from nuclear war, religious riots, global warming, famine, pestilence, and obesity, all with the push of a button with no real science or application of her ideals. 3 cops die along the way. No really, 3 police officers die in this movie with no real lead up to that level of violence. Just... POOF! Gone baby.The characters themselves don't really mesh. It's a little creepy watching Clooney swoon and cry over a preteen girl-bot. The main character herself is more emotional than intellectual. She comes from a single parent family (insert teen-angst here), whose only parent is also a NASA engineer and is now out of a job (because times are tight for even scientists in America). She owns a ducati, commits federal crimes, runs away from home without telling her father, and is responsible for at least 1 death in this movie. AND of course has the appropriate attitude of a girl of her age and experience.She does a very good job of showing the audience that she is ""REALLY REALLY GOOD AT ACTING NEXT TO GEORGE CLOONEY"" in the first 5 minutes, and she also complains a lot. When she complains however, she increases the chance of saving the world... go figure.Hugh Laurie holds his own as Governor Nix, a man trying not to save mankind, but trying to prevent his world from sharing in their destruction. Fair argument. He has all of 30 minutes screen time, pity they didn't use him more.The emotional level of this film is what you would expect from previous Disney fanfare. It's not that it excels at giving you 'the feels' but it does have its moments. Notably, this film could be summarized as more of a emotion film than a plot film... seeing as it is a sci-fi. The message that we can indeed save our planet is an important one, however the movie fails to instill the viewer with any possible understanding of how to change society for the better. The movie goes about it in a fairly off key manner by beating the viewer senseless with images of global problems, but never really delves into them. Nor are there any solutions offered to any of these issues.As you approach the end of the film, prepare a whopping crescendo of emotional turmoil, as sacrifices have to be made on a personal level from one of the characters. I won't say which one, but it certainly isn't one made by the main character. She does absolutely nothing to save the world, besides whine a lot... and pretend to be smart.Sorry to say, but I guess I just hate hate films with teenagers telling me that the problems of the world can be solved with a little attitude, some inter-dimensional travel and a whole planet advanced technology. Those problems were here long before I was born, and will continue long after I'm dead and gone. And yes I recycle thank you very much.So here is to 'Tomorrowland', a romp through Disney's 1960 glory days with a modern look... and don't forget the new Star Wars licensing of course.",Tomorrowland

It was cool to see the power of imagination and how a simple thought could become something much bigger.Frank Walker, played by George Clooney, was recognized by his limitless imaginative capability. It was going to one day change the world as it is. He was able to do just that. Walker was a genius scientist who made a certain discovery about Tomorrowland that would hold the key to changing the world. With the help from Casey Newton, played by Britt Robertson, Walker was able to travel to the city and unravel what he had discovered so long ago.This movie has a simple story, and it is ideal for those with a creative and innovative imagination.",Tomorrowland
171,LiquidPoetry1921,'Tomorrowland' is a fun and entertaining fantasy-flick!,7,24 February 2017,"I don't get all the negative reviews this film has garnered. I found it to be a very entertaining movie with INCREDIBLE special effects. Quite frankly, if Walt Disney Pictures had produced Ayn Rand's 'Atlas Shrugged', I would have expected to see a film similar to this one. As well, there were a lot of social implications addressed in this movie.Aside from the typical good vs. evil and super heroes vs. villains we see in a lot films these days, 'Tomorrowland' addressed that there would BE no tomorrow unless certain things change now ~ that these exciting inventions and scenarios we saw in the film might not take place unless significant things are altered that are occurring in our world today, i.e., war, global warming, poverty, etc. It didn't hurt that two of my favorite actors were in this movie ~ George Clooney and Hugh Laurie...who, incidentally, are both strong advocates for social change so it's no surprise they were involved with this film. Putting those things aside, 'Tomorrowland' turned out to be a very enjoyable break from ordinary, repetitive sci-fi flicks, and a great way to spend two hours! 7* out of 10.",Tomorrowland
172,moviescoundrel,A trip worth taking,8,28 May 2015,"The narrative here is decent and primary objective pretty simple. Newton wants to get away from the people chasing her and find this land. This is entertaining and fun to watch, as is her initial interaction with Walker. Once they finally do get to Tomorrowland however, plausibility, if that exists in a movie like this, gets stretched a bit. There are a few holes in the plot, and the motivation of the antagonist and everything to do with earth's doom and it's salvation is a bit unbelievable. Maybe it is because this problem is only hinted at throughout the film and we don't get it until the end, or maybe because Nix (Laurie) is only briefly in the film until the very end so his selfish, anti-human nature are not really believed here.There is just a bit too much going on here at the end that Bird wishes to wrap up. Maybe the film needed a bit longer of a running time to make everything mesh well. The conflicts that exist here are too numerous to even mention. It all is wrapped up and resolved rather quickly and some things are short changed and don't quite fit because of it. All in all, it is a fun film, a different kind of movie, and a trip worth taking.",Tomorrowland
173,pefrss,Tomorrow is in a large genetically modified wheat field,2,27 May 2015,"There was a time in my life, decades ago, that I had to visit Disneyland and Disneyworld on a regular basis. I did not really mind and some of the attractions never lost their charm and magic. When I saw the promotions for Tomorrowland I tried to remember the attraction and could not. As forgettable is this film. I am for sure not the target audience, but there were Disney movies in the past which could hold my attention. This one put me to sleep and only the fact that the theater people cranked up the ac to the freezing point kept me awake.I do not get it. I do not get the message of the movie. I did not understand why the girl wanted to destroy the NASA facility, but to ensure her father's employment. I did not see why the Tomorrowland portrayed would be something to strive for. Given, we saw very little of it. The wheat fields with the towers in the distance did not tell us anything about the future but maybe that we will eat more gmo food in the future and the short visits of the various kids showed us nothing but some people walking around in costumes and public transportation systems which exist basically everywhere but in the States. It looked like a commercial for the attraction, not something anybody would want to live in.If I would have had any idea that most of the movie would be stupid fights with toy robots on steroids and a lot of explosions I would not have spent a dollar to see it. Somehow I was hoping for some kind of intelligent message which would tell our children to take care of our world to preserve it for tomorrow. I did not see it.The original Disneyland was a good idea and has survived for decades and enchanted millions. Somebody dragged me into one of the Pirates of the Caribbeans movies at the time and I did not like it either. Sometimes you just cannot improve on something good. As for George Clooney. Boy, he looks old in this movie and he still cannot act. I hope he only made this movie to make enough money to buy new clothes for his wife, not because he is planning to become a father. He is too old for that.",Tomorrowland
174,nmholland,"Fun To Be Had, But Somewhat Disappointing",7,26 April 2016,"Tomorrowland is directed by Brad Bird, director of greats such as The Incredibles (2004) and The Iron Giant (1999), and is the complicated story of a girl named Casey (Britt Robertson) that comes across a pin one day. She finds that when she touches the pin, it transports her to a futuristic place called Tomorrowland (hence the name). However, the pin has an expiration date: 2 minutes. Once the pin expires, and ultimately stops working, she searches for a man named Frank Walker (George Clooney) who knows how to get her back to Tomorrowland. Once she finds Frank, they must work together to save both Tomorrowland, and the world.I was actually looking forward to Tomorrowland. Brad Bird has done some amazing films before, like listed above, and has even done a critically acclaimed live action film as well; Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol (2011). Tomorrowland looked promising, and had a lot of potential. I sadly say, it disappointed. This movie does have some fun things in it, as well as some good acting and direction. However, the film's script jumps around so much, and provides so many coincidences that Tomorrowland really starts to drag down.The absolute best thing about Tomorrowland is the direction by Brad Bird. Just like his prior films, Bird does amazing behind the camera, and makes Tomorrowland look beautiful in every way, especially in the actual place of Tomorrowland. All of the wondrous aspects of a futuristic world is pulled off in a great way, and shows some jaw dropping shots, mixed with wide, long takes of the splendid setting.Another good thing that Tomorrowland has in its corner is the acting. George Clooney does pretty good, although he could've done better with the talent he has. Britt Robertson does pretty well, and highlighted most of this movie. Her character, Casey, although useless at times, is a pretty likable character. However, the fact that Robertson's hair color changed multiple times really got annoying. However, the best performance was definitely given by a little girl named Raffey Cassidy. She gives a great performance that was well beyond her years, and impressed me on every level.On the flip side, the worst aspect of Tomorrowland is the third act. Almost everything in the last act disappointed me, and had so many clichés it wasn't funny at all. The reveal of the villain is brushed over, and the ultimate message of the film is beaten over the head of the audience, and is shoved into a film that doesn't fit the theme. The cheap theme and lacking villain add for a pretty bad final act, that completely derailed the wondrous enjoyment that was the early portion of the movie.The last positive that lies with Tomorrowland is a simple one that makes all of the difference. The originality. So many people complain about unoriginal films nowadays, but Tomorrowland is a completely original idea, and I respect it for that. This movie isn't based off of a comic book, or novel, or short story, or even another film. Tomorrowland is an original idea, and it pulls it off neatly.The last point I'll cover is the coincidences. I'm 99% sure the writers were writing the script as the film was being made. After almost every scene, all of the characters are in a ""what now"" situation, and another force pops up to help them. After escaping the bad guys, they conveniently find an easy way out. After losing a specific item, they conveniently don't need it anymore; they have a different item that matches the same application. Many of these coincidences purpose themselves throughout the entirety of Tomorrowland, and drag the movie down a lot.Overall, there is fun to be had in Tomorrowland, but a few different aspects of it just take so much away from the enjoyment that is purposed through the marketing and trailers. I'd recommend Tomorrowland to anyone that enjoys Brad Bird's other films, and originality. However, be wary of the third act; it's a mess.",Tomorrowland

176,J-bot6,See this movie!,8,16 April 2016,"Who would have thought that one of the most imaginative films of the last five years would be a film targeted at children? Tomorrowland was a pleasant surprise. There were a ton of really amazing scenes and a grand sense of scale. The cast is magnificent. George Clooney is great as always. However, it must be mentioned that Raffey Cassidy almost steals the show. She is definitely one to watch and as long as she avoids the pitfalls that go with fame, she is pretty much guaranteed a very bright future in the acting business.The story is compelling and has a good message -- without sounding preachy. Lots of great classic science fiction homages in here, plus plenty of very cool modern ideas. It was great to see three generations of future aesthetic in the same film.In general, the pacing is pretty good. There are a few parts where it drags a bit. It makes up for it in spades in the last half of the film. Editing was expertly done with plenty of quick reaction cuts between actors to thread things together neatly. As usual, Disney's shot choices are very good (very textbook actually) and the score suits the film nicely.Be sure to treat the kid(s) in your life (your children, nieces, nephews) and or course, yourself to this movie. It's one of the few modern family films that's actually genuinely enjoyable for all ages. Plus, you'll get to see some of Santiago Calatrava's more extravagant architecture.",Tomorrowland
177,RileyOnFilm,A Great Movie Apart from Disney Coat Tails,7,30 June 2015,"Disney has been writing new stories with Disneyland as a back story for years now. The worst that comes to mind is the Haunted Mansion. Tomorrowland falls into the ""back story of Disneyland"" category. The trouble here is that people don't share a concept for Tomorrowland. Instead of pushing it aside and making a movie disconnected from the ""land"" at Disney, to the right at the end of Main Street, They've attempted to tell us all the back story that never was. I think it's that common insult to Disneyland fans that derails the bus to best picture. They've also had mixed success with remakes in the past 2 decades. Having said that, if you can get beyond their puny rationale for what the real life Tomorrowland is, there is a pretty great story here to be enjoyed. So far, the reviews I've seen have not been kind to this movie. I have a different take, it's a pretty great movie. The lofty ideal of hope in movies springs eternal. One of the reasons I love movies is because they often make me feel hopeful.Tomorrowland gives you a good feeling about the past, present and future. There's also a personal charge to decide your own fate. These are just a few of the positive messages in the film. If you're like most people, you've read the nasty reviews and seen the low ratings. Don't pay them any mind. This is a movie for the future citizens of the world. They may have lost points by trying to tie it so closely to Disneyland. It's slow at times and the characterization is not as good as say: Escape to Witch Mountain. Still, there is a fun ""ride"" here in the form of a movie. Because they tied it to Disneyland in title and theme, it lost points with me. Never tell a church going person what church is. At the same time, the legions of moviegoers with expired, yellowed Disney passes in their wallets are too strongly connected to the real land. This is one director's vision and we are all directors. If you can set that aside and see it as its own movie, it's pretty good. Not excellent but pretty darn good.",Tomorrowland

Damon Lindelhof, though more hit and miss, has participated in some of the most impactful (scifi) work of recent years. And yes, the trailers were actually really cool. Also, maybe it was more aimed at children that I expected / wanted it to be. However this doesn't excuse two major faults in this movie: 1) pacing is incredibly slow. Nothing really ever actually happens. It's just 'there' the whole time and is quite remarkably boring at times. 2) It's quite idiotic in its moral. Yes the world is going to hell blablabla but, even if aimed at 6 year olds, there are better & more subtle ways to get the point across. So yes, very disappointed.

181,kieranbattams,Not perfect.. but a World Beyond enjoyable,7,28 May 2015,"I am honestly surprised this film didn't come out sooner. Since the release of Pirates of the Caribbean and how successful that franchise has become I imagined Disney would jump straight onto the theme park attraction based cash cow. Sure we had the Haunted Mansion which was never a good idea for an Eddie Murphy film but i don't feel like Disney have milked that idea. Here we are 14 years or so after the release of Pirates.. with Tomorrowland. Popular Disneyland attraction? Check. A-list star in the lead role? Check. But how does it hold up?The plot of this film is actually quite hard to explain to you without spoilers so i will be as vague as possible considering the trailers didn't actually give a lot away at all except for the basic premise. The story follows a teenage girl called Casey Newton played by Britt Robertson.. who could honestly be Jennifer Lawrence's doppleganger. She finds a pin badge seemingly by chance which, when touched by her, takes her to an amazing place in the future. With the help of former boy genius Frank Walker (George Clooney) they attempt to find Tomorrowland in a journey which, whilst slow at times and not perfect, is a lot of fun and definitely not the worst way to spend 2 hours at the cinema.So first off i want to say that the cast here is clearly having a blast and are actually on board with this film for more than a simple paycheck. George Clooney does a great job as the lead character, he starts out as a character we are not sure we are on board with and like but we grow to accept as being a good person. Having a huge star such as Clooney would usually draw the audience away but Britt Robertson and surprisingly newcomer Raffey Cassidy, whose role i will not spoil as it is a pleasant surprise, hold their own against him and could even carry the film if he didn't happen to be there. Plus Hugh Laurie is clearly having a great time in a role we don't usually see him in. The visuals also look stunning, Tomrrowland itself really looks amazing and whilst the characters spend a good chunk of the film away from it, when we arrive with them in Tomorrowland it really pays off as a result.The film does have flaws, parts feel very slow, the beginning of the film took a while to get going for me which took me out of it for the first 10 minutes or so and the plot sort of wraps up a bit too quickly, i feel if some of the scenes from the beginning were shorter we would have a much more satisfying ending. At the end of the day though, i had a blast with Tomorrowland and really enjoyed the journey leading up to finding Tomorrowland, i liked the characters and loved the overall feel. This is the sort of film Jupiter Ascending tried to be and failed and overall felt like a lot of heart was put into it.I give Tomorrowland a 7.5/10",Tomorrowland
182,russellingreviews,Welcome to a hopeless future,4,20 May 2015,"You got me monologuing! Syndrome - The IncrediblesPopcorn and a large drink, roll the film... George Clooney lately has not inspired me to go to the theatres, but the director Brad Bird does excite the inner child in me. Can his exceptional run of great films continue?Cinematic rating: 2.25 stars Reel Dialogue Rating: 2.5 starsA robot from the future comes to enlist the services of a juvenile delinquent for the purposes of saving the present and future worlds. They must stay one step ahead of futuristic law enforcement officers. Ultimately the robot and the teen must choose to save the world and determine how much they are willing to sacrifice. Add in an environmentalist message and a Disney-like setting and it sound like the a new spin for the Terminator franchise, but it is not, it is the basic premise for Tomorrowland. Which is the return to the director's chair for Brad Bird (The Incredibles, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol). He is telling this familiar story line with the optimistic Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) as the lead. She is chosen by her robotic recruiter, Athena (Raffey Cassidy), because she is a brilliant dreamer. Casy's role is to become the saviour of the future. She and Athena must enlist the help of Frank Walker (George Clooney), whose history with Athena and the world of Tomorrowland has left him a bitter and reclusive man. Their journey leads them to the harsh realities of trying to find Utopia and attempting to fix the world in which they live. Can they reach Tomorrowland, bring hope to the future and the present day worlds? In Brad Bird's future, it must be a world of monologuing. Interestingly, it was the warning for villains in The Incredibles that long-winded speeches would lead to their downfall. This hilarious realisation in the 2004 animated gem must have been lost on Bird, as the writer and director of Tomorrowland. The cinematic exercise seemed to be piecing together a film between one arduous monologue after another. After awhile, the feeling was that George Clooney and Hugh Laurie (House) were applying for a Presidential nomination. The beginning of the film offered some hope for the story. The historical epilogue of Frank Walker's life was an optimistic, creative and hope-filled adventure to Tomorrowland that offered enjoyable intrigue for the rest of the story, but unfortunately never lifts beyond this opening segment. The story is slow, boring and only allows for glimpses of the originality that we have come to expect from Brad Bird. In the end the message becomes a heavy handed environmentalist message that was connected together by an unoriginal story. The portions that were meant to be humorous were merely creepy and for a supposedly optimistic film, the message becomes empty and joyless. There were some good special effects and the use of the Eiffel Tower was a brief glimpse of creativity, but if those are the key highlights, Tomorrowland fails to deliver. The language and violence are mild and it earns the PG rating, but just because children could go see it does not mean they should. When it comes to opening up some of the life's bigger questions, Tomorrowland offers many veins of discussion. The need of a saviour, mankind's role in the universe and what does the future hold for this world are considered, but the answers are unfulfilling and empty. Bird seems to forget that there is a spiritual element to the human condition. God is the missing character in the equation on how to fix the world. It did show that without God in the mix for the answers of this world's problems, the answers are hopeless and we are left to find the solutions ourselves; solutions that will inevitably fail. But God does not leave us without hopeful solutions for the future, but understanding the answers can only be found in God. Leaving the cinema... Maybe the expectations for Tomorrowland were too high, but it is one of the biggest disappointments of 2015. Brad Bird has had a great track record up to this point in his career, but he failed to deliver. A heavy-handed environmentalist message disguised as a children's adventure. The message of the film could be forgivable if it was a well executed film, but it was not. Hope and optimism are essential for mankind to exist, but Tomorrowland's message is poorly executed and hopeless. We can only hope Brad Bird can get back to his original form with The Incredibles 2.

183,bob-rutzel-239-525430,A Visually Good Movie,9,14 October 2015,"Athena (Raffey Cassidy) is a robot from the future, and she befriends a young inventor, Frank Walker (Thomas Robinson), who is given more than a glimpse of Tomorrowland. Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) touches a token from the 1964 NY World's Fair and sees glimpses of the future and wants to know more. But to get more that involves recruiting adult Frank Walker (George Clooney) who was banished from Tomorrowland by Governor Nix (Hugh Laurie).The visuals and overall cinematography are spectacular. The acting among: Cassidy as Athena, Robertson as Casey, Robinson as young Frank and Clooney as adult Frank is spot on. Good chemistry here all around. Hugh Laurie as Gov Nix does a good job too. The stunts and CGI throughout are most impressive. Humor is injected at times mostly in the form of complaints. The thing I like most about George Clooney is that when he gets angry, he has the ability to convey that there is no other way out, all is lost, nothing more to do, give up, that's it, done. Then silence. Then he conveys he sees something only he can see and there is a way out. A lot actors can do this, but Clooney does it the best of all. Pure Gold. Casey comes upon a most grumpy Frank, who comes to believe Athena who says Casey can save the Earth. Later on we learn that Nix wants the Earth destroyed because the people do nothing to help themselves when disasters and wars break out and don't deserve to continue. Since Frank didn't believe this, he was banished. We don't spend much time in Tomorrowland. This is all about the journey to Tomorrowland and saving the Earth. We do see that Gov Nix doesn't age on Tomorrowland. He's the same when he sees young Frank back in the day and when he meets adult Frank in Tomorrowland. In the beginning we see Casey's young brother who looks almost exactly like young Frank. They are two different people and why the director would allow a sameness comparison to be in the story is beyond us. (maybe to confuse us?)Although Britt Robertson as Casey, in the story, is a teenager we sometimes see that she may be older than a teenager. A moot point but it was noticed. Notable: Tim McGraw as Casey's father. Overall a visually good movie. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",Tomorrowland

185,slayerjmk95,A Visually Stunning and Heartfelt Sci-fi Adventure,9,20 May 2015,"Tomorrowland is truly Brad Bird's baby, full of intense action, emotional heft and imaginative creativity that only Disney could create. Not the company, but Walt Disney himself, as Tomorrowland is Disney's invention. The film, though, takes the ""ride"" to unbelievable heights, and I'm curious as to why there's so much hate surrounding the film.Frank Walker (Clooney), a boy genius, must help a persistent and trouble-making teenager (Robertson) save the world by going to a place called Tomorrowland, where the greatest inventors and creators came together to envision a better world. Brad Bird's direction and writing (with Damon Lindelof) is superb, using some traditional Disney fun, but also by implementing his style in full-form; stylish action, smooth fast-paced sequences and genuine heart, which is shown not through Britt Robinson's Casey Newton, but through Clooney's Walker, but I won't spoil his story; it helps to forward the film. The visuals are absolutely breath-taking, Michael Giacchino's score is one of his best as it compliments each scene with sincerity, and the acting is great from all ends. But, the biggest complaint I've seen so far is the way the film depicts its story. I can understand some criticisms, but to say the film is crap or one of the biggest disappointments ever is just sad. Like the idea of the place, the film doesn't focus on resolution. No, it focuses on tomorrow, what comes after. So, if you think the second act of the film drags quite a bit, it's because you're watching it as a traditional movie with traditional story-telling. This isn't that at all.I feel the marketing for the film didn't help what the movie was going for, but because of Bird's direction, the heart of the story and strong performances, this film is extremely memorable, even if it isn't ground-breaking. I just hope it's at least successful, since the reviews aren't helping its arrival to theaters, because it really is one to see on the big screen. And looking at how my review is being negatively received, I just pity anyone and everyone who calls themselves a film buff or movie-goer, because Tomorrowland was and is one of the most original films ever made. I'd like to see anyone who downvoted my review to make a bold, original film with important themes and messages.",Tomorrowland

There were needless killings of humans and dismemberment of robots. It seemed like it would be disturbing to small children. Also, the parts with kids steeling things seemed out of place for kids. It really took a dive when it began using time travel as part of the plot. From there on, the ""sci-fi"" ideas in the movie were in a downward spiral. Some social ideas presented in the movie had merit but were completely cancelled out by the low quality sci-fi story elements.Two areas which I want to emphatically state that I believe are overused. One is time travel. It often seems like a cheap plot device used to skip segments of story. And it's a sketchy concept often portrayed in silly ways. All that is in play in this movie. The other thing is the misuse of historical characters. This is especially bad in kids movies who may not ever get a real sense of the people portrayed in false ways.",Tomorrowland
187,trescia-1,Smart People are Magic,6,25 July 2015,"So disappointing. I'm giving it a six out of ten because I like the special effects and it is, in fact, a well-made film. But I almost hit it with a five because there are some deep, deep problems here that no optimistic indigo child from a southern state is going to be able to fix, no matter how often they repeat ""I think I can"" to their little brother.Actually, this movie reminded me of a whole bunch of weird films made back in the eighties. In one of them, a kid saves the world from nuclear war, in another a kid saves a robot with AI, in another a kid becomes a space fighter pilot, in another a kid gets time machine and saves the world, etc. I have a feeling this script was floating around Hollywood for thirty years or so before it got made. The thing that was weird about those old movies was that they portrayed ""smart"" as ""magical."" Well, Arthur Clarke said that technology looks like magic to dummies (or something like that) so it's not surprising that Hollywood portrays it that way.Or maybe it is. Why should Hollywood have trouble understanding smart people? Hollywood is where smart people go to make millions. Why do they portray other smart people in this stupid way? 'Tis a mystery. This film just provides another example of dumb portrayals of smart people. It's like somebody said ""We need smart people to fix the world! Optimistic smart people!"" Then they said ""Let's make a movie where the cool, good looking, socially adept smart people are optimistic and fix the world!"" Yeah! THAT'S how it works! Did anybody ask WHY most smart people are not optimistic? Could it be a the never ending ""transmission"" that smart is not cool and nerds are creeps? I dunno... maybe we need a smart person to figure it out. Anyway, ""the girl"" does things that look smart to dumb people. She demands to know if problems can be fixed, like a moron CEO demanding ""answers."" I dunno, Boss. You're in charge. Don't you have answers? Smart people don't look optimistically to the future. They fix stuff here and now. And endure endless truckloads of garbage, dumped on them by stuff like this movie, which implies that what we REALLY need are some cool, sexy, fun smart people. If only we could find them--get robots to find them--but it's SO DARN HARD with all these geeks and nerds in the way. SHEESH!",Tomorrowland
188,captainmike-michael,A Pointless Wasteland Despite Visuals Popping and Entertaining Cast Performance,5,22 May 2015,"At its first glance, the creation of this visual popping utopia community full of futuristic illusions, advanced technology and gadgets might lead audiences to a high expectation that the adventure to explore this brand new world would be extremely exciting. However, it's a huge let down that despite the efforts, creativity and imagination of Brad Bird and his team, it's still hard to understand the reason to focus large portion on the earth rather than in the futuristic world they've crafted. At Disney's level, the idea of the plot is ambitious but sadly it starts to lost its direction at the very beginning and the tone as the story develops seems to be uneven, even the final act of the villain himself is wasted without proper addressing of intention and ended up in a disappointing formulaic way. Performances of Brittany Robertson and Raffey Cassidy are charming and entertaining together with the presence of George Clooney though his appearance seems to be involved in some lame action scenes, the musics from Michael Giacchino are beautiful and full of dreams but all of these are unable to save the flaws of this pointless story telling about the importance of being hopeful, optimistic and inspirational.",Tomorrowland
189,Lost_In_Translation_,"Fantastically directed movie, squandered by the writing cancer that is Damon Lindelof",5,10 June 2019,"This movie was at the top of my most looked forward to for 2015. Brad Bird had just come off revamping Mission Impossible with arguably the best movie the series had seen. He also made two of Pixar's most perfect films with The Incredibles and Ratatouille.I was ready for Bird to take us on a fun mystery of a story with writing as good as those past three movies of his. But then, the screenplay found itself with a cancerous mass attached to it that called itself Damon Lindelof. He took the whimsical story that Bird had made, and brought it down to an unintelligible mess of a movie. With his other movies like Star Trek Into Darkness, Prometheus, and Cowboys & Aliens, Tomorrowland became just another in long line of uneven storytelling that thought it was smarter than everyone else in the world.A lot about this movie is great. The performances are fantastic, the cinematography is really cool and the retro aspects to it make it visually fun to watch. At the heart, you can see the Brad Bird creativeness breaking through the cracks of the mess of a Lindelof screenplay that this movie is crumbling into. But Bird's directing isn't able to overcome the mess that Lindelof made of the screenplay.As with every Lindelof project, the ending is so lackluster and anti-climactic. This guy does not know how to end stuff! Fans of Lost know that all too well.Brad Bird should have been the sole writer on this. We would have gotten another retro inspired world like The Incredibles, movie full of whimsical charm like Ratatouille, with some great action set pieces like Ghost Protocol. But instead we got Brad Bird filtered through the crap spewing machine that is Damon Lindelof.Please, any spectacular film makers, DO NOT work with Lindelof at all. Its plain to see he is a cancer who ruins productions. Brad Bird escaped the Lindelof disease and came back with The Incredibles 2 which is arguably better than the first!I'd love to see this concept and creativity happen again without the pitiful excuse of a screen writer, but it seems like Disney isn't gonna do any live-action stuff that isn't Marvel, Star Wars or re-makes. Damon Lindelof singlehandedly ruined us ever getting a Tron 3 for the foreseeable future. Thanks Dumbass Lindelof!",Tomorrowland
190,pressboard,It's a small world after all,7,25 May 2015,"I was entertained. It felt like a Disney movie from the 60's but with more/and more sophisticated special effects. The story was so threadbare as to be almost non-existent. I recognized Hugh Laurie, does anybody else? I recognized and enjoyed Keegan-Michael Key. The android/robot characters reminded me of Spy Kids. What was the story again? I liked George Clooney's younger self better than his older real self. Did I miss something in the storyline - was there a storyline? Britt Robertson played a very strong and interesting protagonist and her story I think overlapped with the other story thing. Was this made for children or adults? Was a writer hired as part of the production or just not paid enough? Hmmm, shiny orbs just like Tomorrowland....oh. I would recommend it if I could just figure out what it was about.",Tomorrowland
191,kalibeans,Sadly not for children under 14,4,24 May 2015,"Anything connected with Walt Disney himself - well there is a level of expectancy. This movie fell far short of that. As someone who was under 15 and there the first year Walt Disney World opened, I remember the anxious rushing to get to Tomorrowland. I had grown up with The Wonderful World of Disney and Uncle Walt every Sunday night. There was a literal vibration of excited anticipation to actually BE IN Tomorrowland. Perhaps that makes my age group the hardest to please regarding this story. The problem was not with Clooney or the young actors, nor was it the beautiful sets. It was the STORY. It very early on became bogged down and never recovered. It lacked the innocent educational value of the Disney stories - it shoved it down your throat. There was far too much violence, never mind how brilliantly executed and filmed the fight scenes were. They were not Disney-ISH. Sadly I cannot possibly recommend this movie to any parent of a child under 14. You would have thought the prime audience for this movies would be the 8-14 year old audience. To make them dream of the wonder of Tomorrowland. There was FAR too much violence. The writers, director, etc. perhaps did not spend enough time watching all the old Disney movies and Wonderful World of Disney, or perhaps it is simply impossible for anyone under 56-60 to understand that kind of innocent world. Where there was always a lesson, but it was more sagely and gently imparted. Walt would be very disappointed.",Tomorrowland

This film could not possibly be any clunkier and over-the-top convoluted melodrama, and Walt Disney himself would have shuddered at the outrageously ridiculous and twisted plot. No spoilers here, simply a warning: this movie is more pretentious, contrived and far-fetched than Oliver Stone's mildly entertaining movie ""JFK"", to which this movie is similar in trying to wrangle as many out-there and somewhat hair-brained theories as possible of a future world, including at it's core a conspiracy theory. George Clooney cannot save this disaster of an intelligent or articulate sic-fi fantasy, but the naive and confused might be drawn into thinking this is somehow, some way a meaningful or good movie. And did I mention that it is laboriously, almost painfully to long? Or, as a Disney movie, too graphically violent for kids...even though Tomorrowland at Disneyland was always intended as, and still remains, friendly to youngsters? Yech! Which rhymes perfectly with what this movie is: Dreck.",Tomorrowland
193,blufrog49,Wonderful!,8,1 June 2015,"I loved this movie! The people who wrote such negative reviews are exactly the type of some of the people portrayed in this film, which just proves the whole point.I saw the previews for Tomorrowland more than once, and can safely say that they don't give away too much of the movie, as many trailers do these days. You ain't seen nuthin' yet! I'll admit, most movie-goers will not experience the sheer joy I felt during the opening scenes, because I was at the World's Fair in 1964, although a few years older than Frank. It was the highlight of my life up until then and for several years afterward. So yeah, I started on a high.But the film never let me down. It is full of surprises although I DID wonder if it was going to be too long, as some of the haters commented. It seemed like it took a long time to get to what I expected would be the inevitable conclusion, which I also expected to take a while. But again, the wrap-up was over unexpectedly fast, because it was, well, unexpected! Of course there are many special effects, but they do not overshadow the message or upstage the terrific acting. I can't imagine anyone other than George Clooney in the title role. The young actors are also exceptionally good.Oh, and did I mention GIRRRRL power? Very refreshing!Humor is generously and subtly spread throughout the film without minimizing the message. This is a great film for all ages, and those of us boomers can really appreciate the graphics in the credits at the end (as well as the ""antique"" store). In my opinion, you will come away not only having enjoyed a film, but hopefully with a deeper conviction to work towards a better tomorrow.",Tomorrowland
194,thomas-w15,Left wanting something more...,5,30 May 2015,"Tomorrowland: The last time I saw a film based off of a Disney theme park was Pirates of the Caribbean and it's sequels. The original Pirates of the Caribbean film I hold at high regard. I knew that Tomorrowland would not be as good as the Pirates' films but I still had above- average expectations. The movie was maybe slightly above average at best, but I did not by all means walk away in awe as I did after seeing Pirates of the Caribbean. Although George Clooney and Hugh Laurie give their all, with meager script-writing and a less than climatic ending, the audience cannot help but walk away seeking someone more. As seen upon in the trailer, the place known as ""Tomorrowland"" is the future. It is a place where all of the geniuses in Earth's history came together to try to change the world for the better. People like Shakespeare, Newton, Edison, Einstein, the list goes on. This should be the main attraction and should be given a large majority of the screen time of the movie. Unfortunately, this is not the case. They spend too much of there time trying to get to ""Tomorrowland"" and not enough time actually being there. When they finally get there, there is not much more climatic actions happening than those that have already happened. It feels as if they kind of lost energy towards the end of the screenplay and just said whatever it will be decent. They wrapped up the end nicely and were able to bring up some actually pressing issues in our world today without overcomplicated itself. To put it simply, the movie's first half is above average but the second half is not. The effort in the acting by the cast was well-appreciated and might have been part-savior for the movie. George Clooney did an incredible job in each scene he was in and we have all grown to expect nothing less from him. Hugh Laurie carries the helm of the respectable villain, a role we can all easily see him playing and one he does well. The real surprise came from the main actress of the movie, Brittany Robertson. She gave the best performance of the movie and stole each scene she was in even in spite of such veteran actors such as Clooney or Laurie. Do not come in expecting too much and you might be able to leave feeling satisfied enough not to feel as if you wasted your money. I recommend you see Tomorrowland in theaters or on DVD.

197,jpkwolf,Maybe a bit childish but enjoyable sci-fi tale none the less.,8,22 June 2015,A bit uneven and too long (It takes the movie about 30 minutes to really kick into gear). Otherwise I enjoyed the plot of slowly figuring out what is Tomorrowland and what's the purpose behind it all. So it's not a perfect film but a long way from the failure it's made out to be. Brad Bird doesn't disappoint.I have read quite a lot of negative comments about this movie and even its message and I find that to be slightly odd. From saying science should only concentrate on inventions instead of research to being annoyingly preachy. God forbid if a movie has a message these days and despite it having an agenda I thought the movie was fun and entertaining.I personally found the message of the movie to be pro-science and to fight the cynicism and apathy that makes it seem it's impossible to save the world from the direction we're going in.

199,wgeddings,Smug and preachy,1,1 June 2015,"George Clooney cannot resist being smug and preachy apparently. The basic premise is good and there are pretty good performances from the younger cast but Clooney is like a flat edge on a car tire. Whenever he is on screen, things go askew. It is really sad and disappointing because I could see a good movie in it but instead they opted for whiny and preachy. A big surprise too because Brad Bird's other films were good. I can only assume Clooney insisted on changes. The girl who plays Athena does really good and I will bet we hear a lot more from her. The actor playing the young version of Frank was also impressive. Something that really bothers me was reading that Disney scrapped plans for Tron 3 because this movie flopped.

200,vav-61764,Flaws in The Script Destroy The Possibility of The Movie Be Taken More Seriously,6,10 June 2015,"As I entered the movie theater I knew almost nothing about the film. I had some expectation towards it. The movie has it flaws, but there are some good aspects in it too. The message it wants to transmit and some lines about human actions or lack of it are really thought provoking.Britt Robertson alongside George Clooney give two great performances. Her character is so likable with such an optimism towards everything, that is hard to not be captivated by her. But who really steals the show is the little Raffey Cassidy, she makes a good and solid performance.The scenes which take place in Tomorrowland are fantastic, the work to create habitants clothing, sci-fi gadgets, buildings landscapes and a lot more is well done, and it's incredible to see in the screens. Unfortunately, these scenes are just glimpses, because they're so few in the whole film. And when the characters arrive in Tomorrowland, the scenarios are so misused.But to me the main issue is the final act of the film, the way they explain to the audience the cause of the ultimate problem is so badly thought. It so poorly-explained and it is simply thrown in our faces in a abruptly way that is hard to accept it and until now I still didn't get it.",Tomorrowland
201,pinkled5,Unfocused Storytelling Mars Great Concept,6,26 May 2015,"Clooney and company put on a great performance, but unfortunately, there wasn't a lot of substance to hold them all together.The story starts with Clooney as a child and we spend the first 20 minutes watching what is essentially an unnecessary prologue (if you need a prologue to tell your story then you're probably telling it wrong). It's quite a while before we get introduced to our main character and the initial/inciting incident doesn't even occur until after we're thirty minutes into the movie. All signs of poor storytelling.A more focused form of storytelling would have been nice, where we have a protagonist with a clear goal struggling against an antagonistic force we understand. But this movie does little to define these until the end, and we're still left scratching our heads. The ""bad guy"", after all, isn't even really that bad.It's an above average flick which the kids will be sure to love, but it falls far short from becoming anything remotely related to a Disney classic.",Tomorrowland

And we need that belief more than ever in our depressing modern society.Tomorrowland is about the power of believing. It's not a blueprint for how to change the world - because the point of the story is that there is no blueprint. It's up to us to believe in the future.

Yet, the omnipresent Disney philosophy that the whole world can be healed by a good heart is spoiling it for me. The first two thirds of the movie are great fun, one should try to not think about the technical problems or ignorance of natural laws presented, the movie works better if you try to see it with a child's eyes, take the stuff you see as magic. The Kacey girl sometimes stretches it a bit, there are moments when here awe looks more like drug induced than natural.The worst part is the end, trying half-heartedly to explain the time/dimensional over-lapsing interferences with stupid ideas. It becomes a mess. What's even worse is that Disney once again is trying to hammer their fundamental world view into your head - if you believe, you can do anything. And for sure, the major sympathy character has to die, as always, to make the ending overly dramatic.If it weren't for the beautiful pictures, the sympathetic actors and the quite funny dialogues I would have rated it a 4. It still get's a 7 from but I must admit than Disney stands for brainwashed cuddly wishful-thinking reality for me.

208,agblum,A Wonderful Movie!,9,30 May 2015,"""Tomorrowland"", Co-Written and Directed by Brad Bird, was conceived based on the futuristic themed land at Disney theme parks. The movie has co-protagonists of Frank Walker, portrayed as an adult by George Clooney, and Casey Newton, portrayed by Britt Roberston. The movie starts by flashing back to 1964, where Frank as boy, it is revealed early on, likes to invent, visits the World's Fair in New York. Without spoiling any of the major plot, he ends up in Tomorrowland, a furtristic looking world. Flash ahead to present day, Casey is the daughter of a NASA Engineer, who is about to be out of job, as the launch pad in Cape Canaveral is about to be demolished, in a nod to recent stat of NASA. Casey like her Dad, and Frank, as is shown is quite smart, creative and talented herself. Long story short – I found the film quite entertaining, often magical, and can't recommend it enough. Britt Roberston is outstanding, and is Clooney and pretty much the rest of the cast. The visuals are more than good enough for the most part. Fellow Sci-Fans should get a kick of out the references to Science and Science Fiction in the film. The first say 15-20 minutes, may be slow, but then it picks up, and is a fun ride. I realize this movie has been getting some bad reviews, and while the movie isn't perfect, I think it is undeserved. One reason I heard is people are not sure what's it's about.

Maybe we have (sadly) lost all HOPE?I will admit to being something of a dreamer...of a better world and of better things to come (it really is strange that we do have obesity in parts of the world and famine and hunger in others...SUCH A MAD, CRAZY WORLD) and if ""TOMORROWLAND"" gives just one special person that push to perhaps persevere and change our world for the better then why not?I give credit to everyone involved, actors (special mention must go to Raffey Cassidy as robot Athena), director, writers, special effects artists and producers...Mr Clooney lends gravitas to the movie (an anchor that is much needed)It's not an all-action film (perhaps that's why it failed at the box office? maybe people want death and destruction movies only? and have forgotten to embrace films of hope) that said there are some fun set pieces here, the shop run by robots, the Eiffel tower in Paris scene, the film even starts off with a slow piece to camera (unusual but it works) The ending is both sad & uplifting with an emotional punch.I liked it & I hope you will too.

The critics and audiences made me think it was terrible. like very. And now that i saw it...I liked it a lot, but cant say i loved it as i was hoping. Now i don't totally agree with people about this film, because it its magical. But yes i have to agree with many things. The first 2 acts, are incredibly strong, and sure it takes its time but the whole film has a very original narrative, the one i was expecting from Damon L. I love this kind of narrative, which has its similarities with Lost. There were one or two scenes that could have been smaller but its 2 acts that i loved. Saddly the third act pales in comparison...Is like a very different film, and one that is so worried about transmitting the message they want that comes out as an on your nose message instead of a film. They could have taken the story where the premise promised to take, which would have been a lot more exciting. I loved the ending though. I cant say nothing specific because it would ruin the twists, but i loved a lot of the ideas in the film, they felt magical, Tomorrowland itself is incredible, a magical world, my biggest problem with this film is that we should have passed a lot more time there. This is also not a film for children, at first yes, but as it goes, no. It is very complex for children, and it feels like they wanted to catch the parents so they could give them this message.The cast is amazing, everyone, from children to adults. The production design, the visual effects, the sound, the cinematography, are all top notch. The score its very good, but also the usual.There's little action,but when there is, it's very exciting. Its a shame there isn't more.This is a film that has 2 incredible first acts, but disappoints with the third, affecting sadly the whole experience, because you start to think of how many things different you could do with this premise. One of them would be exploring Tomorrowland itself, a lot more and make this a more exciting adventure. There's a lot of great and inventive ideas, and there's a lot of fun, sadly the film goes in the wrong direction with the story just to pass a message, that while a good one, could be passed in a more subtle and fun way.",Tomorrowland

I cannot complain about having seen it, in the end I enjoyed watching it but it does take too much time for the story to pick up; it takes too many puzzling steps that don't really add up, and when one gets the feeling that if someone erased the first half of the movie it would still make sense (or would make it a better one) it means that this isn't a great movie and it will be forgotten rather quickly.5 out of 10",Tomorrowland
212,PrashunChakraborty,The highs and lows of Tomorrowland,6,27 May 2015,"I think the best way to describe Tomorrowland is that it's the Disney's version of Atlas Shrugged. Group of scientists, creators and artists form their own utopia in a different dimension where they are free to pursue their dreams without Government and litigation. Tomorrowland is indeed an ode to Ayn Rand it doesn't explore the possibility of trouble brewing in such a paradise, it's too busy looking at innovations and dreams to focus on substance. Our story's foundations are laid in the 60's when a young 11 year old boy Frank is recruited to Tomorrowland by a girl android robot, Athena of the same age. Over the years, Frank becomes a prominent scientist in Tomorrowland and falls in love with Athena and dabbles in some forbidden doomsday technology. Athena's rejection coupled with his exile from Tomorrowland has made Frank an older bitter man (George Clooney). However they are not the main protagonist of this film, it's Casey an intelligent, talented, optimistic young girl (even more Atlas Shrugged inspirations here). Casey and Frank team up with Athena to stop the doomsday clock and save their future and Tomorrowland is the key. Brad Bird creates a visually impressive movie with almost near perfect pacing, the movie has excellent editing, every scene has a purpose, no scenes lag or are slow, movie is mysterious and it slowly but never frustratingly builds up and builds up well.....and then it flushes everything down the toilet.The final underlying message of the movie is quite dumb, and when all is said and done the movie is about philosophies it shouldn't need any action scenes but since this is a summer blockbuster film there are some unnecessary action scenes, there is no clear explanation why the villain wants them dead but is more than willing to just talk about the problems they have. The philosophy of the film is also quite juvenile, however in it's defense Tomorrowland does feel like a film for kids but not in a good way like Toy Story series was. There are some beautiful scenes in Tomorrowland which are filled with childlike wonder and amazement, there are times you can't help but feel like a kid and while these are great it's not enough to overlook the glaring flaws of this film. All the actors do a decent job but nothing home to write about. My favorite aspect of the film is the treatment of romance between Frank and Athena, it's decently done and even the most conservative people won't mind the 40 year (physical) age gap, since Frank ages but Athena doesn't, she is old too just not physically.Overall, still my second favorite movie this summer blockbuster season (Mad Max: FR is number one), at least it took some risks and is an original unique film not a usual action movie/superhero sequel, this is original screenplay people, and it's the kind of movie that doesn't usually come out in summer, it has variety going for itself, even if the payoff feels stupid. Still recommend everyone to watch this movie, it will be a disappointment but at least it's novel, that still holds a lot of weightage in my books.",Tomorrowland
213,peedur,Terrific film!!! (Ignore those who didn't get it),10,29 May 2015,"I loved this film! It's an earnest, hard-working story; it attempts the lofty goal of expecting the audience to WANT TO think beyond the film-going experience!I believe that for Brad Bird, films are not the end-product but a worthy vehicle for grand ideas. Ideas change people - lives are bigger and more important than any film. This is true of all the films he's made (MI excluded). The ideas of this film are ambitious and difficult to spoon-feed. An audience expecting summer blockbuster fare like the Avengers, Furious 7, Thor or any other ""tentpole product"" from a studio are bound to be left wanting. Those films are pretty and amusing, but they are not attempting to make you think about what you as a viewer of a film are actually bringing to the world. I believe that this exactly the point of the film. Some call it preachy, yet I suspect that those who do so were wanting the film to serve up the hoped-for spectacle and inconsequential emotional cadences audiences expect. I feel the profound yearning in this film to affect change in the viewer. That is a testament to how much Brad Bird believes in his audience. There is a brilliant irony in the snarky disappointment some reviewers articulate - they are actually represented in the film!",Tomorrowland

It had humor, good sci-fi, and an overall rounded plot awaiting an action packed and awesome conclusion. Well did it get it?

217,kxok630,The worst use of the word tomorrow since that grating song from Annie,1,19 June 2015,"Remember when you were a kid and you went to a Disney Park for the first time? And you got to experience space rides and other stuff that they're going to do in the future courtesy of Walt Disney and his Imagineers? Well, forget all that; this movie may have the name Tomorrowland, but has nothing to do with the entertainment, imagination, thrills, creativity, or wonder of its amusement park namesake.There are a few impressive visuals, but no story of any substance to give those visuals a reason to exist. The plot is paper thin and lumbers along as it goes nowhere. Even the cast seems to be bored, and have little to do of consequence. Not much happens, and from what little does happen, nothing ever clicks as innovative or interesting. It's puzzling what this movie's makers were shooting for. There are some random and disturbing scenes that are bizarre and out of place, and these only add to the audience's confusion. George Clooney mugs and annoys the audience with his arrogant approach to his lead role. His line reads usually consist of long winded soap box sermons, usually to the tune of global warming. He mocks the audience with his attitude that everybody except him is stupid. The title is deceptive and this movie has no right using it. None of the fun, family friendly atmosphere, or creativity suggested by the title is here. Save your money.",Tomorrowland
218,shadowyx12,"Just as we learnt with Pixar's 'infalliable' record, we learn the same with Bird's 'impeccable' filmography",5,30 May 2015,"Brad Bird's latest offering is based off of one of Disney's most popular attractions - just like the Pirates of the Caribbean films. The main portion of the story starts off in present-day Cape Canaveral - where, after getting out of jail, teenage whizkid Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) is mysteriously given a pin which transports her to a futuristic utopia built by geniuses. Captivated by the world before her eyes, Casey sets out to find a way to return to Tomorrowland and (wait for it)... ultimately gets caught up in a plot to save both Tomorrowland and her world.I'll start off by saying that Bird's first three films (The Iron Giant, The Incredibles, and Ratatouille) are all highly regarded in the field of animation. Not only are all three films well-written and deeply touching, they also explore themes and ideas that aren't normally touched on in other children-oriented films. His fourth film, MI: Ghost Protocol, is by no means a masterpiece, but a fun-filled, action- packed popcorn flick that delivered far more than its predecessors. With this being in my mind as I watched the trailer for Tomorrowland, I could not have been more excited for Brad Bird's latest film. It's not everyday that you see a brilliant writer/director tackle a (somewhat) original concept and bring it to life with a massive budget.But boy, was I ever disappointed. After watching the movie (and the end credits), I felt INDIFFERENT. I wasn't excited, thrilled, or even left with a sense of wonderment. If anything, I might have cringed at the thought that Bird's impeccable filmography may have finally been tainted (at least for me)! I sat there in my seat, picking my brain, and thinking, ""Wait... that's it? Oh. Okay...""Don't get me wrong - the movie itself surprised right from the very beginning. The plot did get rather predictable (and ludicrous) as the film progressed, but the film started off very promisingly. Furthermore, the film was very heavy-handed in preaching its main message (it's as if the writers have forgotten that audiences can figure out and make their own interpretations of what a movie is trying to say). I'm just wondering what the potential might have been if Bird wrote the script himself.Britt Robertson and George Clooney both give convincing performances, but have almost no believable on-screen chemistry. They are both A LOT better either in their own scenes, or with the real star of the movie, Raffey Cassidy (as the enigmatic, yet jaw- dropping Athena).Raffey Cassidy in her role as Athena is who I consider to be the saving grace of this movie. Without her excellent performance, I would have given Tomorrowland an even lower rating. She steals most if not every scene she's in. She's also quite humorous in more ways you wouldn't expect. And if you think this actress (being her age and all) is unable to pull off the more emotional moments in the movie, you'd be wrong. If you do decide to see this movie, just make sure to look out for her. And expect to see her in more things.Another thing that I shouldn't have to mention, but feel the need to are the film's VFX. It might have something to do with me watching this movie shortly after watching both Avengers: AoU and Mad Max: Fury Road, but the VFX/CGI work in this film did not look as great as those two other films. Most of the work looked like it was done by a bunch of grad students working on their final VFX project of the year - not by professionals who have been doing it for several years (the robots in the film are really distracting). Despite this, Tomorrowland itself (the city within the movie) is still breathtaking and incredibly vivid.Tomorrowland is layered and thought-provoking, but might prove challenging to sit through with its uninspired and uneven plot. Though others may enjoy the film for the message it sends out (how we must all set aside our differences and work together toward a better tomorrow), others will dislike it as it serves as an example of bad filmmaking. This is by far Brad Bird's worst film to date.",Tomorrowland
219,jramza-1,I wanted to like this movie. Really I did...,3,21 May 2016,"I found the characters so unbelievably irritating, I couldn't get behind them. I found the story so slow, I fought the urge to fast forward through the majority of the movie. My 15 year old son fell asleep (twice). It was an interesting premise, that just never seemed credible (even within the laws of its own universe). The responses of the characters so often were just plain illogical - if you learn a fact about another character, then it makes no sense to be startled or pretend you didn't learn that fact, 2 minutes later. This happens in the film - a LOT. The worst problem is the acting delivery itself- this is a story about ""promising"" individuals - geniuses in their own fields. Yet at no time did I feel the actors presented a believably exceptional individual. In the end - dull and unbelievable (and I love Star Wars and Star Trek - I'm not usually stumped on the believability factor).",Tomorrowland
220,gogarrett,"Enjoyable movie, with something lacking in the story writing",7,14 March 2016,"I had been wanting to see this movie for awhile after viewing the trailers long ago. In some ways it was better than I thought it would be. The acting and filming was superb, and I think the director did a good job, although I saw there were nitpickers complaining about things not being exactly right here and there. That does not ruin a movie for me. There were some fun action sequences and I really enjoyed the unexpected addition of the little girl, Athena, who was not in the trailers. Putting children in pivotal lead roles really worked for me in a movie showing us a future world and I thought Clooney and Laurie worked well with the unusual cast set up. I think the two areas that fell flat for me was something lacking in the story writing and the lack of a clearly defined evil or villain. What was lacking in the story? I am not sure, but without it, this movie will not be that memorable except that I will remember those two talented young actresses, that part of the movie took place in Disneyland and that Clooney and Laurie were in the movie, which indeed did help me want to see it in the first place.",Tomorrowland

222,chriskylie,"Stylish, inventive caper hindered by heavy handed preaching.",7,14 August 2020,"Tomorrowland was given a hard time by the critics. Two thirds of the way through I couldn't see why. It's a fun, family movie with an interesting original premise. There's plenty of action, a surprising amount of comedy and an engaging cast (Robertson really shines here and proves herself a very capable physical comedian!). Plus the whole film looks stunning. A glorious production design presents a future that feels tangibly modern yet simultaneously retro, presenting playful nods to the 1950s vision of the future Disney built in its theme parks. Plus there's a potent, positive message at the heart of it. What's your problem? And then we get into the third act. Pacing issues start to creep in, the underlying conspiracy at the heart of the story becomes a little confusing and then the environmental message is delivered full force straight between the eyes. It's a shame. If Bird had deftly delivered the moral core of Tomorrowland the film could have been both a powerful and enjoyable mainstream movie. Yet it's didactic final tone is so heavy handed it makes even the most liberal minded viewer (like me) feel a little awkward. However up until then Tomorrowland is fresh and fun. I guess if it does sacrifice that in the end by trying to galvanise us to save the world, there's worse cinematic crimes.",Tomorrowland

224,carlcasso,Good Family Movie,8,23 May 2015,"First off I wouldn't be Clooney's Biggest Fan. I find him very hit and miss with some right Stinkers in his back catalogue. No other Actor has ever been forgiven as much as George.This however is Clooney at his finest. For some reason he works best with young Female Leads. Shailene Woodley In The Decendants, Anna Kendrick in Up In The Air and Now Britt Robertson and Raffey Cassidy in this fine Disney Action Adventure Film. The relationship on screen is once again magic between the two girls and Clooney. The Father Figure seems to bring out the best in Clooney.The Movie starts slow but kicks into gear once Clooney shows up.Hugh Laurie phones this one in and any Actor could have done as well in his role. But that doesn't take away from the flow of this movie. Once it takes off it doesn't stop. We find that we care about the 3 Main Characters. The two young ladies are superb and Young Raffey puts in an astounding performance and we forget that she's only 13 years old so many times during this movie.Britt more than holds her own against Clooney during the Movie.This is a good family movie, with a good positive message and lots of highs and lows.You cant go wrong with this one.",Tomorrowland
225,mrshev,Solid Sci-Fi suitable for kids,7,20 March 2016,"The plot of Tomorrowland is probably it's weakest link. Yet the film seems to sacrifice just about everything else (tension, editing and some continuity) to it - which is a shame because the acting from Britt Robertson and George Clooney is very good (even if Athena is pretty awful) and the visual effects are excellent and the sci-fi elements are well imagined and well thought through.I think why the film got so much stick from the critics is that it has a cavernous 2nd act slump that is a real head-scratcher after the roller-coaster ride of the 1st act - which is fun and raises lots of questions but then the film goes into a long phase of exposition that my kids got a bit bored of. They got the plot but wanted a bit more action.Overall though, I enjoyed it and Clooney is always hugely watchable and in Britt Robertson I think we have a future star in the making.",Tomorrowland
226,Dusan_Indjic-Luigi,Great popcorn movie for younger!,7,5 June 2015,"Even though I'm 42, I often like to turn off my Thinker and just enjoy and have fun. It's truth that the storyline could be more dense. Design (icl. CGI) more thorough (robot guns/arms were really bad even for retro approach, but hey I liked the futuristic male fashion/dress style.) Also, it coped with Time Paradox quite well, unlike many recent movies that mingle with it. Esp. for the youngest goal audience that do not get into the science aspect much. Oh yes, interesting idea of putting the utopia/dystopia ""tachyon causality parallel"" (phrase to joke a bit with science)! For the people who like to put off the chain the kid in them - quite nice! Generally, expected Disney fun stuff. Colorful and dynamical with a measured dose of humor, etc. Acting was also cool, I think lead by Clooney and the girl. Conclusively, I think it's a great cinema/popcorn fun movie for weekend rest. With fresh dose of optimism in it.",Tomorrowland
227,PandoraProductions4,well done,8,16 August 2015,"I like Tomorrowland very much. I think it's one of the best films of the year. It feels like a throwback to the adventure/sci-fi films of the 80's like Back to the Future. It's optimism and naivete are very endearing qualities in a time where most of the good films are pretty dark. Sure, there's a lot of light entertainment out there nowadays, but light as in lightweight. Tomorrowland manages to be light without being shallow or superficial. I like how it's unique. It's not based off of anything (besides sharing the name with a Disney ride). It's not a sequel, prequel, remake, reboot, it's not adapted from a book or a video game or a television show. It's completely someone's idea taken to the big screen. For a blockbuster, this is rare. I mean, really rare. I can't even remember a blockbuster that wasn't based off something or connected to existing franchise in recent memory (besides the disaster ""Jupiter Ascending"") So, I've got to give it points for that. Another positive thing about the movie are the visuals. Brad Bird is a wonderful visual director, his films just look great and this one is no exception. The realization of Tomorrowland itself is brilliant. I wanted to spend more time there. I love the characters and the performances, Britt Robertson is really good, George Clooney is great, The robot girl, relative newcomer Raffey Cassidy, is fantastic as well. The road trip aspects really work. There are a lot of great moments there. I thought the message was great, how the folks chosen for Tomorrowland weren't necessarily the smartest or most talented individuals, simply good people who try their best. The weakest link in the film is the climax and the part leading up to it, where Hugh Laurie descends into a monologue that is a little preachy....well, a lot actually. Tomorrowland serves as a good tonic to Interstellar, which I also liked a lot. They may have different takes, but they're both fascinating. They are both films about saving humanity and personally, I prefer Tomorrowland's way!",Tomorrowland
228,schak23,underrated! Entertaining and thought provoking.,10,17 March 2017,"I couldn't agree more with the users stating that Tomorrowland is hugely underrated. 10 out of 10 is probably a bit high but I simply want to react to negative ratings. Yes, the film follows some of the well known blockbuster paths and yes, there might be better films out there. But: Surely a fantastic cast, great laughs, exciting, bursting with ideas, and, this is the reason for my judgment, a brilliant reflection on social media and the negative hypes it creates in this world. I am not techno- or media-phobic in any way but the true sense of the film just hits the nail on its head regarding how media content affects what people think. I guess it should remind us of the thought that communication might be about saying what we think but it is equally important to remember that our thinking is being shaped by what we say and is being said. Especially out there on FB, Instagram and all these other channels where paranoid and negative scare- and warmongers want to take over control.

231,ice ruby red,Like Assembly-line Fast Food,6,27 May 2015,"** SPOILER ALERT **I'm easy to please when it comes to movies, but this one did nothing for me. It was as if someone wrote out the screenplay on a piece of scrap paper while running to catch a bus. There was never a story or even a scene that pulled you in. Not even at the end when the whole premise for grown up Clooney's cranky attitude was his unrequited boyhood love for Athena – and now, when emotions should have been intense, it was as if his love interest was no more than a book he had finished reading!The CGI action was too rapid and too frequent for my comfort, and the constant bickering annoyed the cr@p out of me. It was great – until it wasn't!I went to this film because it involved going to the future, and I love time travel stories. But there was precious little of the future in this movie. Or story. Basically, it was a venue for CGI action ... and product placement for Coca Cola! It also stretched the boundaries of common sense. I get that the Clooney character was a brilliant inventor, but c'mon... how do you build a rocket, all by yourself, unseen by other humans – down the center of the Eiffel Tower?!There were so many opportunities for making this a good film, but none of them were employed. And nothing ever happened that wasn't totally predictable. In short, it was disappointing from start to finish!",Tomorrowland
232,trepessa,"Fantasy, overcome obstacles for a better future.",8,10 June 2015,"People are writing the ""worst movie I ever saw."" How many of these worst movies can exist? Tomorrowland is not the worst movie ever made in fact it is a very good fantasy movie. Yes, it is science fiction but more towards the fantasy end of things. I think Disney spent too much on the movie. Movies will succeed with far less special effects but in the case of this one in particular I don't believe that idea holds up. I'm not going to do what has become so cliché by those who write reviews, compare it to any other movies as far as storyline, because it's not like any other movie I have ever seen and I have seen hundreds. There were nostalgic bits I really liked reminiscent of first going to Disneyland after it opened. That would enhance it for anyone who is a baby boomer.This movie is being highly underrated. The number one thing wrong with it was casting George Clooney. He's a very lowkey actor and not suited to action and looking old and haggard. Maybe that's how they wanted him to look, I don't know. They needed a mature actor but one with more life in him. He is hardly the best looking older actor and not that popular among the younger set which this movie was set to appeal to. I was turned off as soon as I saw he was starring in the movie. He needs to be cast in movies far from those that have a lot of action and if he wants to remain in the forefront of things keep himself up.The fact a company doesn't make back all the money they spent initially doesn't mean the movie bombed. They'll make it all back eventually in sales of the movie. The premise was fine and if people didn't appreciate the storyline then it is on them. If Hugo could be nominated for an academy award in best picture and it was awful, this one far exceeds that movie.Anyone who went to see this movie and saw the trailer knew this was geared for kids. I like these types of Disney movies. Out of the Woods did well but I hated it. This one I liked so those who are saying this is an awful movie, all I have to say to everyone else is this movie is more akin to a Jules Verne type of movie in my opinion...old school. If you don't like the older style of scifi movies, I guess you won't like this one. It doesn't matter if other movies have had jetpacks or anything else. What matters is how it is used in this story and it was used well. It's long but so are many movies these days. I'm beginning to think many people are jaded by the blood and guts movies they have been watching. There have been too many zombie movies and people keep rushing into see mindless movies; chase, fear, gore and endless trying to find a safe haven or cure the problem. They are all pretty much alike except the actors. It's like Jupiter Ascending, lots of special effects and the number one problem is casting the lead role. Mila Kunis is a good actress and a cutie but she was wrong for that movie. They need to do the casting with common sense and not with who happens to be popular and will draw in a huge audience. If they are miscast it will stick out like a sore thumb and George Clooney was miscast for his part. I liked this movie and the other one despite the casting. People should realize it is not the theaters fault if they don't like a movie. No one should be asking for their money back. Do a little research before taking the kids but you know parents might not like the movie and the kids love it. Bear that in mind before making a choice that affects everyone including the profits of both the theater and Disney because the movie was good despite all the scathing reviews.I'm not going to give a blow by blow but essentially it's about a man who was taken to a place when he was a child, who has been exiled. He is an inventor from an early age and builds a jetpack that doesn't work quite right as a kid. He's trying to get back to Tomorrowland with the help of a robotic female child and another female child both young teens. Tomorrowland is located in another dimension and with the help of the girl he brings along he believes she holds the key to saving the Earth from doomsday. There of course is much more to the story but this gives one an idea. I liked it and would recommend this movie to anyone with children. Let them decide if they like the movie.",Tomorrowland

Well, I like to think of myself as a reasonably upbeat, positive person; the reason I didn't like this movie was simply that it made no sense whatsoever, and had none of the elements that I think make a film watchable.Yeah, I get the message. Stop with the message already. But what about the _plot_? What above character development? What about a narrative that isn't full of stupid logical inconsistencies? To be fair, the film is well-made, and visually spectacular. The acting isn't bad; Hugh Laurie in particular makes as good a job as can reasonably be expected of putting some life into his totally wooden character. It's engaging, in an in-your-face, Star Wars kind of way. It's unlikely to frighten children.But... there has to be more than scenery, explosions, and moralizing to make a decent movie, doesn't there?

The film stumps for the kind of thinking that goes well beyond the bounds of conventional reality. It asks audience to move to another dimension, to accept the possibility of simply fixing things by rejecting the inevitability of our own destruction. The movie that surrounds this thinking has an oddly shaped narrative, and is at times slowed down by its long storytelling. But Tomorrowland's theme has a message to the audience, and that's what the movie is trying to tell us. And it becomes a huge impression.The plot gets messy. It even takes long until they get to Tomorrowland. And because you only get to see them in Tomorrowland for a short time, it becomes a letdown because the movie takes most of the time showing them getting to Tomorrowland. But the movie is still good. The unique story about making the world a better place, about global warming, and about not giving up. The film gets into an awkward rhythm as it preaches this particular thought, but it thrives when it shows us the alternative. The script does feel like the characters are mixed up with modern and medieval times, and sadly, only few of the cast did good. Britt Robertson and George Clooney who plays the main characters suits them well. Raffey Cassidy's accent feels like it's for a medieval times and doesn't sound like it was real. And unfortunately, even Hugh Laurie's acting was terrible, and his character development was lacking a lot. But that's not to say the movie is awful. Aside from their acting, the soundtrack playing in the movie was also a huge surprise. Brad Bird's choice of directing this one was a perfect choice. Without this movie, there wouldn't be a more unique storytelling from Disney.Again, the story is unique, and without this movie, there wouldn't be a more unique movie coming from Disney. The plot gets messy. One acting gets bad. Hugh Laurie's character lacks a lot of character development. Those makes the movie sound like it was rushed, but that's not the point of the movie. The reason why Disney made this movie was because they wanted to tell you a story that everyone can make the world a better place. People gives up in what they are doing, and nobody seems like they care for the earth anymore. But dreamers can make our world a better place. The movie is not saying the future will not be like that. They used Tomorrowland as an example of a better place. And that's a unique storytelling from Disney.9/10P.S. I recommend it to ages 7 and up because the violence may scare younger children like hand, head, and self-destruction from robots disguising as humans (children younger than 7 will think they aren't robots. And there are some language.",Tomorrowland
241,IanAJohnson,"This film was original, but fell flat.",5,8 June 2015,"Tommorowland is the story of a young woman and her journey to find a futuristic city where anything is possible. This desire comes from a mysterious pin that somehow came into her possession. This pin creates a hologram-like projection of this city when she alone touches it. There are a lot of positives to this film. All of the acting was quite good; even the children gave good performances. There are a lot of original concepts shown in the city of Tomorrowland, though at times the C.G.I. became incredibly noticeable. The cinematography was quite impressive at times, too. Clearly a lot of talented people were involved in the making this film. Unfortunately there are a few large problems that brought the experience down. First of all, there is the plot. The first two-thirds of the film are quite good. It's kind of a mystery plot that slowly exposes the details to keep you guessing and invested. The problem is that the mysteries are often quite obvious and you can guess most of them immediately. This is a kids' movie, though, so I'll kind of let that slide. On the other hand, the final act of the movie completely fell flat and became VERY preachy. While I enjoyed the monologue given by the villain a lot, it isn't related much to the previous parts of the film. There also appears to be a problem with the city of Tommorowland, but that problem is unclear and never explained. If you are the kind of person that notices small imperfections in continuity, you will go nuts watching this. There are small errors everywhere, especially in the latter half. Initially tachyons allow people to see the past, and then just a few minutes later they allow people to see the future. The rules of reality alter themselves to justify the plot. This movie gives me the feeling that a director had some good ideas and a solid plot, but the Disney studio got their hands in the project so he had to add some forced lesson to teach children and lots of product placement. I've been to Disneyland before and have been in the Tommorowland section of the theme park. It has a couple of rides that seem to have fallen out of the times. This movie is clearly a commercial to reinvigorate that section of the park. I don't use the word commercial lightly. Inside the city of Tommorowland you can find Space Mountain and other structures found in the happiest place on earth. Not only that but there a scene that takes place in a sci-fi hobby shop with enough Star Wars memorabilia to choke a Sarlacc. This is disgustingly lazy advertising. While these are large and annoying issues, the core film is still pretty good and a lot of heart went into it. I don't expect it to be a classic, but the film is alright.On a side note, let me mention the advertising campaign. I really liked how little it showed us about the plot. More production companies need to advertise more like this; but, there is a slight problem that I had with it that I feel could have been easily fixed. The marketing campaign asked consumers the question, ""What is Tomorrowland?"" I feel like it should have asked, ""How do you get to Tomorrowland?"" The actual location that is Tomorrowland is not very important or expanded upon, but the story behind it and the path to get there was. By having he audience try to answer the wrong questions, it might make some people disappointed that their questions are not answered. Other than that small nitpick, I really enjoyed how this film was advertised. It showed as little as possible and kept the big moments in the theater.",Tomorrowland
242,hamass-mujadid,Exquisite Imagination; Poor Communication. Idea of a Genius; Execution of a Retard.,5,23 May 2015,"He's no ordinary man—Brad Bird. Guy knows how to provoke immaculate visions, how to provoke the delicacy of human genome—the ability to visualize, conspire, and project our wonderland-concepts. Tomorrowland narrates badly a vision that's unlikely to be thought of before, with the exception of Brad Bird himself.The story is about a young, cat-eyed girl, who likes to see, to poke into everything that comes around. And in doing so, she is assisted by a magical pin, which was just she needed to further multiply her curiosity. But it comes with a price: her experience is incomplete, and she looks for the guy (George Clooney)—who turns out to be a scientific-genius, isolated, stress-free freak—to get some answers. So starts the epic journey into the mystical Tomorrowland whose set is pretty similar to the annual musical saga—Tomorrowland. They make enemies (like every other movie, but here, it's not a ""hero v villain"" tragedy; it's suiting to the stakes of progressing,) and prospective audience feel a thrust into the challenging world of Tomorrowland. As colorful, funny-looking, Finding Neverland-like, and almost exactly like Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy's Xander it is, bloomers, typicality, and re-counting of the chronicle are as bland and featureless.There's an amusing touch to the futuristic element of the movie. It's pretty congenial to audiences' personal venture into the crazy, mindful concept of algorithmic fantasy, and Space-like odyssey into the land of the future, where everything is so bizarrely familiar (we are getting used to uncanny points now.) Time warp, household gadgets (pretty modern for a simple-looking home,) awesome strategic sense, unorthodox and impending world—but this adventure comes with slip-ups, and lame drags. It's one of the classiest depiction Disney has yet made (non-animation,) with as much feel of supernatural, superhero milieu, as the child-like, having-fun-nothing-else predicament.Yet with everything Tomorrowland has to offer, it lacks severely in story-telling. It radically fails to engage audience, and the only parts good are the ones vividly open to visuals. Except that, it's nothing but waiting-for-the-hours-to-freaking-end situation. It's like somebody with great imagination but poor language skills is taking the SATs—get it? Bird's latest invention comes with extreme loopholes, but they might tear your expectations up, so I won't disclose them. See them for yourself in the ""goofs."" And for all I know, this might have been amazingly beyond an action/adventure/drama trio if they had worked on the storyline, for nothing gets rated well for their moderate grasp at display, and behind-the-finish-line song-and-distance. That song-and-distance is utterly lacking. This isn't a much appreciable Disney-work. But it's something that Disney-people have become for quite a while now—mundane, ordinary, tacky, ill-at-ease. Into The Woods is a latest example. They're half-hearted, ready to sell at a moment's notice. And it's costing them loads from opinionated, and factual feedback.With everything good, bad, and ugly about the movie, it's still a thrilling cinematic experience. At the end of it all, however, the experience fades away instantly. You crack your fingers, neck, pandiculate, and move on.",Tomorrowland

Cons: Story is not intriguing & you get bored from the first 10 minutes. story does not suite Clooney character. There are a bunch of inconsistencies in the film. scenes fail to give us a futuristic feel. The boy who plays inventor genius does not know how act and should go back to school.

Female lead. Spunk. Good effects. Good villain.Two things I wondered: could it have been 15 minutes shorter and had that much more POP to it? I think so, yes. Doing this would have crammed the action into a smaller time frame and upped the excitement factor.Secondly, though I followed the story, I don't see how any kid under 10 could do that same. Really. Not that it should be dummed down, just maybe mess with it long enough that there's a simpler way to explain the plot machinations.Otherwise, I liked it. Sadly, because it's not doing very well at B.O. ,that could doom other films like this from coming out. And that would be a shame.",Tomorrowland

Add in an extremely annoying lead female character (you will care more about a robot) and I can see why critics panned this.Clooney etc is good as always, as is the girl playing the recruiter, and it did have some nice set pieces, but its more a cartoon than a live action movie.

246,Joe-146,A paean to optimism,8,3 November 2015,"I hope this isn't a spoiler, but this is a message movie. And the message is 'Pessimism is a self fulfilling prophecy. Don't give up'. Not a bad message. Yeah, the goofy naive optimism it celebrates is kind of anachronistic, still I'd root for the dreamer over the person with apocalyptic nightmares every time. It's a sweet film with a constructive message. If we don't at least try for a positive outcome, we condemn ourselves to failure. Brad Bird and company may not have crafted a Hollywood blockbuster, but they made a film they should be proud of. It's a fun film with an important message. It may never be another Citizen Kane or Casablanca, but I really enjoyed Tomorrowland and its message, and it instantly earned a place on my rather small list list of favorite films. Clearly, it's not for everyone, but I personally loved it. Check it out. You may too.",Tomorrowland
247,MovieCriticDave,Bizarre sci-fi roller coaster is really a broad Disney metaphor,5,25 May 2015,"I wasn't sure exactly what to expect going into Tomorrowland, and I'm even less sure what I saw coming out of it. Brad Bird's intensely promoted, George Clooney-led vehicle is sold rather transparently as an advertisement for Disney's not-so-ironically named areas of its famous theme parks. To be sure, there are plenty of fairly plain allusions to Disneyworld and Disneyland elements throughout ""Tommorowland."" Yet the frenetic and often uneven pacing makes it hard to know exactly where the viewer is supposed to jump on board in this curious if feint morality tale pitting optimism versus pessimism in a blender-like mixture of sci-fi, time travel, cyborgs, and general absurdity. If ""Blade Runner"", ""Star Wars"", and ""Star Trek"" crossed with ""Back To the Future"" and crash-landed in Orlando, ""Tormorrowland"" would surely be in the merged wreckage. Ultimately, however, ""Tomorrowland"" plays less like a commentary on a avoiding an inevitably dystopian human future than an introspective view of the current state of Disney itself; a utopian notion gone awry without its visionary to guide it. Amid its fantastic visuals and caffeinated storytelling is a much simpler notion - that someone recognizes Disney, itself, is a little bit broken, replacing its simple stories and animations for explosions and grand effects, and aspiring to recruit contemporary visionaries to help it regain its lost way.Can humanity regain its lost way? Can Disney? In its own, heartfelt and sincere, IMAX-inspired way, ""Tomorrowland"" aspires to put the question out there. Ultimately, it provides no answer; it offers only the hope of one, and an uncomfortable one at that.",Tomorrowland
248,salviolog,Offensively shallow,1,14 June 2015,"Aside from a horribly rushed plot, the irritating know-it-all unnatural teenage genius who doesn't ever say anything smart or what would at least sound like her own thoughts, aside from the rape of Isaac Asimov's story - as if someone had read just the beginning and the end of it without getting the message - as a Ukrainian, I am highly offended that the movie had used the actual footage from the mass protests which took place in Kiev in 2014. Many people had died that day at the Independence Square in Kiev, defending their freedom of assembly and democracy in Ukraine. Many police officers who had been thrown by the illegitimate government to battle their own people at the streets had fallen that day too. Our country is still torn because of the tragic events of 2013/2014, the community is an open wound. When I have seen these events crammed into a sappy disaster montage, I was not only shocked, I almost felt like I have had a flashback to a year before, which had left me with a sour taste for the rest of the movie. And then the creators of this schlock have the nerve to tell us that the reason for all human violence is a sci-fi techno babble antennae, that ""projects bad vibes""?! This movie is heinous.",Tomorrowland
249,kshirad,Watch it with your own perspective.,9,22 May 2015,"Tomorrowland begins on how the future will be like for us humans as we pass through time. Everyone most likely think it will only be scary and tragic, much like the end of the world scenario. But, there are some possibilities that humans can make and changes to be done in order to save the planet from the upcoming doom. That's the theme the movie tries to tackle.Tomorrowland, as the trailer provides, is a place where all imaginations come to life. It's the place where all people can make everything they can possibly imagine, where all people are safe from corruption or conflict and all the negativity. You can call it as a utopia. Then, one day, an optimistic young girl (who is terribly interested in science) found a pin that can lead her to that place. This summer where it's flooded with blockbusters that shows violence, profanity, etc., there's one movie that's very earnest in showing the audience where optimism can lead us. And this is it. You can say that it's very typical Disney and that it's only marketed to young kids. But, you can't always judge the book by its' cover.Shortly speaking, this movie is very fun and enjoyable to watch. Sure some scenes a bit dragged here and there, but what keeps it from being dull is how the plot unfolds and the action scenes that qualifies any other action movies, and of course, the actors. George Clooney, as always, never disappoints. The newcomer Britt Robertson really surprised me with her comic timing. She showed her enthusiasms without getting annoying and painful to watch. She is very fun to watch.There are some things that are problematic to the plot, like how the third act was not really surprising or not as strong as the scenes precedes it. Yet, it does end nicely. That is why it won't be much of a problem because it's very amusing to watch. Courtesy of Brad Bird. His direction really payed off and keeps the movie clean and tight.Not so different to any other summer blockbusters, but this one will make you feel like riding a roller coaster for the first time. Some will say it's ""same old, same old"", but hey, don't let them spoil your view.",Tomorrowland

251,cinemabon,Exploitation of another Disney ride,5,22 May 2015,"Tomorrowland – directed by Brad BirdDisney's capitalization of its theme parks goes from the Haunted Mansion to Pirates of the Caribbean and now Tomorrowland. Unfortunately, the previews – which exploited the few ""wow"" special effects shots – have set the audience up for a major let down. We've been led to believe this film is about going to such a grand visionary utopia. It isn't. This movie tends to wallow in the pulpit of doomsday far too long and pontificated by too many characters. When it is an adventure movie, it tends to be exciting, such as during the opening scene or in Clooney's house of inventive traps. But the film is not an adventure story, it's Hollywood preaching a message we all know too well. The film soon devolves into a chase movie with the bad guy robots after the all-too-perfect young girl on the run - yawn. Too bad. I would have loved to stay in Tomorrowland – Syd Mead's creation of the future. I've been an admirer of his for over forty years. Between Tomorrowland and Elysium – his other visionary creation – filmmakers have abused Mead's futuristic settings rather than infuse their settings into a cohesive plot. We can't have our cake and eat it, too. There must be doom and gloom for mankind. No fun there.Enter George Clooney (Frank Walker) – the narrator who opens the movie. This is where Bird made his first mistake. Clooney is a brilliant actor and I like him very much. But he is horribly miscast in this film. His father figure is very weak – part recluse, part mad scientist – a boring cliché. I'd sooner see a paid politician standing on a stage preaching the evils in the world than wasting Clooney on speeches such as the inane simplified ones that open and close the film. He violates the fourth wall, addressing the camera as ""I'm about to tell you this really cool story that happened to me."" Already that method of storytelling cheapens the plot. We know his fate. Further, Clooney's emotions run the gambit scale from A to A sharp – no Oscar nomination here.Next, we have the completely miscast weak villain of Huge Laurie (Nix) – again, a great actor but about as threatening as a bathtub full of tepid water. Nix first appears as a guide leading a pack of dignitaries into Tomorrowland. No more threatening than some city manager with too much efficiency on the brain. When we see Mr. No again, he first brags about not aging and throws this in Clooney's face as if this was the ultimate insult – I suppose from one vain actor to another. His ""British"" take on his evil character is to be stern – very forgettable.The other person in this triad of miscasting is the protagonist teenager Casey Newton played by Britt Robertson. One thing we know from the start – she knows how to scream. That much is certain. Her reaction to most things is to scream. She's either extremely excitable or this is her direction from Bird. Either way, as the film's lead, I found her performance unbelievable from the start. I had no sympathy for her and didn't feel any yearning for her to fulfill her quest to visit Tomorrowland.The only people with any meat in their parts are Thomas Robinson as young Frank and Raffey Cassidy as Athena. Their friendship is apparent from the start as these two actors fit their parts perfectly. They make us believe in them and why they're attracted to each other – Athena for her beauty and Frank for his ingenuity. When Athena makes it possible for Frank to enter Tomorrowland, we get the first glimpse of a world where everything is possible. They're able to convey the feeling of innocence and discovery, something lacking in the other characters.Tomorrowland's message wants to be one of hope. At every turn, Disney wants to squash that feeling of buoyancy flat by injecting a world of despondency. Rather than an inventive film, the movie boils down to a few long speeches by George Clooney and Hugh Laurie about disappointment and failure. By the time Bird injects his message of hope it arrives too late to bring this film up out of its doldrums. No matter how uplifting the music in the final shot, I just wanted the movie to end. And what a shame. I loved Bird's work on The Incredibles and Up. He brought great enthusiasm and inventiveness to Pixar. Like Elysium, I kept hoping the film would take the high ground and bring about the world of Tomorrow. It never happens. I would call Tomorrowland a vision that can never be, because, as Hugh Laurie puts it – ""the world is full of greedy people, arguing politicians, and natural disasters, a world from which mankind will never awaken. We drive toward the end as if longing for it."" That's how I felt about the film, too.Recommended for its fabulous Sid Mead vision of the future but little else.",Tomorrowland

There is humor which is corny and kinda childish. We then get to see a vision of a hidden world! Is it the future?! What a vision! The daughter of a rocket scientist gets a coin that allows her to go there. She gets a glimpse of the future. Very exciting in its portrayal. Then the movie devolves into the most boring chase movie you can imagine. You like robot fights? You're going to love this movie! Do you like scenes where someone just misses being killed by an eyelash, REPEATEDLY? Do you like a soundtrack where every time someone is hit or falls, there is an explosion of sound? This one's for you. Although I liked the heroine and protector from the future, I did not care about the plot. The emotional payoff scene at the end was unmoving.

253,rdnyscott,Excellent and timely message,10,6 June 2015,"Hollywood often tells us to deny our true emotions and find some way to pretend that bad news is good, encouraging us to sit on the Titanic and cheer the upcoming iceberg. According to Hollywood, THAT is the definition of optimism and a positive attitude. Of course, this is not what anyone who has ever made history has ever done, and most people have always known that such an approach to our fate is stupid, but we've kind-of been brainwashed into apathy. This film was far different. It reminds us that, if we don't like what we see ahead, we have the option to CHANGE COURSE, to DO something about it. This movie's definition of optimism is refreshing in that it reminds us that we can control our destiny, rather than the message we are used to from the media: that we are supposed to happily accept a prechosen destiny for us, and try to see that preselected destiny through rose colored glasses. This was one of those movies that I had to watch more than once before I could truly see what a clever and timely masterpiece it is. I'd had that experience before with the movies Thor and God's Not Dead. Movies that initially seem simplistic but are actually deep in meaning seem to be the new thing, but I appreciate the mental exercise. This is one of those movies that will instantly appeal to kids, but people over 35 may need to see it a few times. It will appeal to you too, if you give it a chance and honestly try to follow the message. Frankly, it may be a better message for older folks, since they currently have more power to change things than kids do. Right now, what we do impacts their future.",Tomorrowland

First and foremost, the film is misleading ultimately promising that we will be indulged with a story of the future and the wonderful gadgets and technological advances that will be found within Tomorrowland. While we see but a glimpse of these wonders, like the Protagonist, we are ultimately deceived as the futuristic advances are merely a faked ""advertisement"" to recruit creative minds. While there was more time spent in ""today-land"" than Tomorrowland which is ultimately a rundown parallel universe overlaid on the current ""Earth"" yet in a different temporal sphere or plane. Tons of CGI effects and poor quality blue screen are really what you get. That and a forever ""child"" robot person who can't come up with an idea on her own - yet is able to recruit for the now largely defunct Tomorrowland.

Sounds similar to the notion of 'Ultron' and is too, in a way. It is a weird balance to have, in my opinion; if you live in a condition of utter bliss being impractically optimistic and miss counteracting the negatives, things are doomed but if you keep propagating bad news all the time, even though with a good intent to draw people's attention to fixing the negatives, you might unknowingly spread more negativity causing things to be doomed too!

These bad vibes are being transmitted across inter-dimensions and to our world by Tomorrowland never mind it's supposed to be fun, exciting, imaginative and a happy place. Never explaining what changed, they're doing this to our world and lamenting about how bad our world is. So...maybe...turn the darn thing off? Maybe if you weren't projecting bad vibes over then things would improve? Just say'n.As I said it's never explained so far as I can tell how Tomorrowland went from a place of fun, excitement, imaginative to a dark desolate place. The actress Britt Robertson in her first feature length blockbuster movie is just wasted as what should've been a tag team effort between her character and Frank Walker, as played by George Clooney, Robertson quickly devolves into sidekick status and the tag team effort is between Walker (Clooney) and Athena (Cassidy). Athena isn't actually a cute smitten little girl but a robot that could give a terminator a run for its fighting money which is not at all believable. She knows where Frank lives in exile but needs someone like Casey (Robertson) to jump start Frank's desire to set things right? What went wrong to begin with? It's never explained fully... And did no one ever notice a rocket ship being built UNDER the Eifel Tower which transforms into its launch platform?I've been wanting to see Tomorrowland for a while, because I'm a fan of Britt Robertson.

Years later, a teenager named Casey Newton, the daughter of a NASA engineer, gets a similar invitation. These invitations have unexpected consequences which lead to them both on a quest to fix the future while being pursued by mysterious men dressed in black (definitely not the MiB).There were some decent special effects, however one was overused in two different transport types.

260,svetlana-petrosyan-2001,Loved the movie and the cast !!!,10,24 February 2019,"Really liked this movie. I have watched this movie when it was just lended to the theatre. The posters and the trailer appealed me so much that the second it was dropped in the theatre, I went and watched it. My expectations were very high and fortunately, the movie matched them. It was well directed, the actors played their roles very well and the storyline and the idea were unique and interesting. Overall, I liked it vey much and will be happy if in the future the directors create the second part of this movie.",Tomorrowland
261,mhol111964-754-567942,A spectacular Disney sci-fi thrill ride,9,10 July 2015,"I went and saw this with an open mind because of the mixed response, and I must say I had a blast.The story is unique, creative and quite compelling. It is original science fiction which we do not get too often. The film is inspired by the Disney park, but at the same time, it's more of it's own thing.It is well acted and the characters are quite likable and believable. Frank Walker is interesting, entertaining and has a sense of humor. Casey is also an interesting character. I think George Clooney and Britt Robertson portrayed their leading roles very well.The film is also quite funny at times. During this film, I think I may have laughed more than I usually do at the movies, which is saying something.I think Brad Bird did a very goo job directing. The visuals are stunning and the special effects, while mostly CGI, are impressive. The action scenes are neat and intense. There is not a single moment where I was bored with the film. It also pays a nice homage to the Sci-fi genre.The one problem I had with this film is that I was expecting a little more of the ""Tomorrowland"" place and that the story needed a little more work.Overall, this was a great film and I highly recommend it to fans of science fiction. Plus, I think it totally puts ""The Haunted Mansion"" (2003) to shame.In the end, ""Tomorowland"" may not fully realize it's potential, but it should be satisfying as a fun and intriguing Disney family sci-fi/adventure comedy thrill ride.",Tomorrowland

263,paulwaidelich,Positive Characters and Great Visuals,8,28 September 2015,"I read a bunch of negative reviews and almost didn't view this movie. That would have been my loss. It's almost like the negative reviewers were talking about themselves and their own lives in their harshly negative assessment of Tomorrowland. It's fun, positive, fast-paced and visually very pleasing. I'm an old man, and was actually at the 1964 World's Fair whose theme was ""Peace Through Understanding"". It was a time of limitless possibilities. It was a time just before space exploration and all the inventions that came from that technical effort; calculators, cell technology and of course computers. Everything seemed possible. The movie starts there, where George Clooney's younger self comes into contact with a type of Cold War scientist. The movie explores the possibility of what would have happened if the free spirited positive thinkers had taken control of America, not the Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon ""Peace through War"" types. The children of the people who supported the death of the ideals in 1964 are now the a**holes writing negative reviews. What's so bad about a movie fantasy where the good guys win, and build a better world with positive values and cool technology?",Tomorrowland
264,kevcoop7,Tomorrowland awaits,8,14 January 2019,"Tomorrowland is an excellent movie! I love how the movie was not based on any one existing Disney property, but an entire part of their parks. Tomorrowland was fascinating, it was enjoyable, it was all around a great film! Ehy do people not like this film?Casey is a great lead character who reminds me of myself when I was younger, and Frank Walker is one of those characters who comes off as rude and a jerk beforehand, but slowly cHnges throughout the course of the film.I didnt think this film dragged on too long, and I dont think it was preachy in the slightest, and i thought the idea of tomorrowland having four famous inventors find it and build it in another dimension was interesting.Hugh Laurie was amazing as the villain of the movie and I live the homage of his most famous character, Gregory House, when I piece of Tomorrowland crushed his leg in the climax.Tomorrowland should get more praise than what it does. It is one of the most underrated gems I've seen in a while",Tomorrowland
265,jmichael3387,"Seriously, this was the worst movie I've ever seen.",1,25 May 2015,"I was in the theatre, with my girlfriend and my popcorn....so I actually stayed until the very end. Believe me, if I was watching this on video, I'd have stopped it early. It is UNBELIEVABLY BAD. As if they didn't even try to make a decent movie. The writing was atrocious. The CGI was terrible. Even if the movie is geared toward small children, you'd think they'd put something in it to keep an adult at least slightly interested. But nope, nothing.Let me give you an idea on the writing. First off, all of the crazy gadgets and 'future' stuff - it all happens completely at random. For instance, you want to get away from 10 machines attacking you with lasers? Well just hop into a bathtub and push a button....and it will convert into a rocket and launch you 50 miles in the air and into the lake. And it will even deploy lifejackets and a full meal will appear in front of you. And all this happens in 5 seconds! How marvelous, the world of tomorrow. And how wondrous it is to see the city of the future. Right in the center, covering 10 city blocks, we see a triple-decker swimming pool thing, where a guy jumps about 40 stories through 3 magically suspended swimming pools, and then he reverses and shoots right back up again - all without even moving his arms or legs. The CGI is so bad it looks like a watercolor painting. And how about 50 robots attacking 2 little kids (our heroes), but they destroy all the robots easily by jumping in the air, doing Karate....destroying all the robots in 20 seconds. Marvelous! How about the fact that Einstein and Tesla built a hidden rocket that all you do is jump in, push a button, and in 20 seconds it transports you through other dimensions? How spectacular! Seriously though, the CGI is so completely lazy and awful - it's no better graphics than watching a cartoon on television.I know my paragraph structure is not the best here, but man, it's hard to list the awful points of this movie separately, because they all mesh together. As for dialog....how about this for giving us a sense of 'wonder'? We see the 'city of the future' for the first time. How do we know things are different and spectacular? Well we overhear a young girl talking to her parents. ""Please write us""....""Awww Dad, it's only 20 light years away"". This was one of about 20 times where I just had to put my head in my palm and just shake my head and try to laugh lol. And oh, the close-up of children's faces as the narrator gushes on poetically about having hope for the future, feeding our good thoughts and not our bad thoughts, all the poetry....it makes anyone over the age of 12 want to puke.Oh one thing I forgot to ad. The 'hero' kids are really smart. How do we know that they are smart? Well for instance, this girl's dad is a NASA engineer, and he's designing a new circuit. But it's not working. So he's sitting there studying it. And then the girl just passes through the room....but she takes literally 2 seconds to lean over his shoulder and adjust the wires to get the circuit working. Wow, how wondrous!! My hero!!I could go on, but trust me on this. They didn't even try to make a good movie.",Tomorrowland
266,Chris12955,Feed the Wolf,6,26 May 2015,"Tomorrowland has an underlying theme of nurturing the future, or as it the film puts it, you can choose to feed the wolf of defeat and darkness, or the wolf of hope and light. Unfortunately the film is feeding both wolves, in writer Damon Lindelof(who cannot compose a good script if his life depended on it) and director Brad Bird(who is a master craftsman with visuals.) The core concept of beautiful dreams versus bitter reality is interwoven throughout the film, and in better hands this script could have been more compelling. The theme of dreams turning dark is awkwardly approached and truly fumbled at the end with a cursory ""villain"" getting his comeuppance, instead of continuing the theme of shining a light on the dark by even attempting to redeem him. It is sad when a story espousing optimism and redemption cannot muster any compassion for a man who had his heart in the right place, but got lost along the way. Fortunately Mr. Bird got his hands into the final draft enough to change most of the cringe worthy dialogue and wandering narrative that saddles Mr. Lindelof's scripts. Still, the story is a mess(narratively and thematically.) It holds together, but needs serious work. Visually this is well conceived and dynamic, drawing you into the world and it's characters. The designs are stunning and Tomorrowland itself looks beautiful. One wonders how the soon to be released Star Wars the Force Awakens would have looked had Mr. Bird taken that project instead.The Story: Hopeless Dreamer Casey Newton discovers a pin that shows her glimpses of a utopian place called Tomorrowland. In her search to find this place she encounters a strange girl called Athena, who takes her to the one man who can get her there. Along the way danger awaits, and the fate of the world lies in their hands.",Tomorrowland

However, we stuck with it and we ended up really enjoying it! I suggest you do the same, if you are initially puzzled. In terms of minor parts of the film, it was a little bit predictable. None of the major plot nor important features were, it was just minor things in a few scenes. There was quite a bit of swearing but it wasn't too bad. However, at the end, there is one strong word. The actors involved are all very good and overall, the film is VERY well done! There is quite a lot of violence but it is all unrealistic so is quite comedic. If you are a star wars fan, I highly suggest this film! Although it is nothing to do with Star Wars, in a few of the scenes there are some references that are fun to spot. It promotes dreaming and optimism. Two very good messages! The film also surrounds the topic of saving the world and the problems at the moment - A very relevant subject!In conclusion, I think this film is something that should be on your watchlist!",Tomorrowland
269,dunfincin,Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,6,22 October 2015,"This is the sort of film I usually enjoy a lot.Intelligent sci-fi,good special effects and a thought-provoking storyline.However after half an hour the whole thing felt decidedly flat and I couldn't work out why.By the end I had completely lost interest.I left it a week and started to watch it again and all became clear;it was the casting. I normally enjoy George Clooney's films but I realised that I wasn't buying into the character he was playing here;there was no character,it was Gorgeous George himself.The debonair man from the coffee ad,the man constantly in the news for one reason or another- ""Je suis Jacques"" and all that.The man getting married (seemingly for weeks on end) in Venice in the full glare of the world media.In short,I can't take him seriously as an actor anymore.Maybe that's my problem or maybe he has allowed himself to become so over-exposed as George that he can't really be anyone else.Maybe I'm just jealous. The other problem for me was Hugh Laurie.I'm not sure how many people outside the UK will know that Hugh is best(and probably only)known here as a comedy actor in a long-running and very popular TV series called ""Blackadder"" where he plays a witless aristocratic buffoon.Whenever I see him,I can only think of a very funny scene where he is being repeatedly kicked in the derrière by an irate Duke of Wellington for being late with the tea.I'm sorry,but I can never see him as anything else.I expect that he went to work in the USA because he was hopelessly typecast in the UK, so asking him to play a serious character in an internationally released film is a bit hard to understand.I'm sorry if you think this review is a little too subjective but I have tried to be as objective as I can by giving the film a 6.",Tomorrowland
270,beeblebrox-2,Far from a 10 but still enjoyable.,6,25 April 2016,"Ignore the ""10"" star votes. Do reviewers think that Tomorrowland is on par with Inception, Minority Report, Interstellar, or Back to the Future?Hardly. But it's not as bad as Star Trek V either though some evidently think it is.Tomorrowland is an enjoyable film on several levels and only really fails in a couple of ways related to thee internal logic of the science in this movie. *** SPOILERS BELOW ***The good:Visually, this movie is stunning. One never gets the sense that the environments are CGI. They usually look like practical sets. The acting is good. I bought most of the performances except for Britt Robertson who plays the young female brainiac. She doesn't quite convince us that she's The One®. Clooney does a decent curmudgeon and Laurie does what he needs to do in a role that is a bit thankless due to a lack of character development.The plot is thin but the script is mostly free of clichés except when Laurie's character, Nix, does a monologue about how people of the earth don't care about things like global warming. Furthermore, the character is expected to explain the entire underlying premise of the movie in just a few minutes. Ugh.Michael Giacchino, who I normally enjoy immensely, phones in the score and Bird's directing was lively as usual.The High Concept was intriguing. But the execution was muddled. The notion of a parallel world and one that is in a different time domain is a familiar one but the idea that the way people THINK about the future can affect the present is an interesting twist.The bad:Execution of the High Concept. Given that this story is aimed at younger audiences Lindelof, Bird, and Jensen are too clever by half with the mish-mash of 1st person narrative (opening scenes), flashbacks, alternate perspectives, and moves between worlds. The science. In all science fiction we are expected to suspend disbelief. Some, like The Martian or Apollo 13 don't force us to suspend too much. Others, like the Matrix, expect us to really suspend. For Tomorrowland, we're someplace in between. What I never like though, is when the science concepts laid out in the world of a film script are internally incoherent. Herewith the main spoilers:The virtual reality pin that ""transports"" one to Tomorrowland is an entirely impractical invention. When glimpsing Tomorrowland while touching the pin, one apparently is not actually physically in that world, it's virtual - so one assumes it should just be a mental experience alone.But no.To actually explore that other world, you have to walk around blind in your own world! So you can be walking through a field in your virtual journey but be bumping into walls or falling down stairs in your own reality because you literally have no idea where you are in the real world. You could be walking along a sidewalk in Tomorrowland, enjoying the amazing sites but in your world you're stepping off a cliff, walking into traffic, or being impaled by some sharp object that you would normally just walk around. So if you think about it for just a second this VR pin is one of the most dangerous inventions ever. What's more, at the end of the movie, these death trap VR pins are handed out to random artists and scientists, most of whom will probably kill themselves the first time they use it. Further to this point, the idea of the VR traveller's proximity to Tomorrowland when first touching the VR pin is nonsensical. At the end of the movie, all these artists and scientists end up in the same wheat field (how are they seeing each of the other VR travelers BTW?). But what makes no sense is that earlier in the film we see the female lead figure out that she's too far from Tomorrowland to walk there from the field. She figures out she needs to ride her bike a fair distance in the real world (in the correct direction) and then when she thinks she's gone far enough, touch the pin and end up in the Tomorrowland city itself. At first I thought that the reason she always ended up in the wheat field was that she was in a location in the real world that was near to, but not quite in the extra dimensional Tomorrowland city. But no, ALL the artists and scientists who take their virtual journey end up in this same wheat field no matter where on the globe they started. Further confusing this issue, how do those people get from the field to the distant Tomorrowland city if say, they live in a place they can't ride a car or their bike for dozens of miles to get to Tomorrowland? One would think that the VR pin would at least drop them in the Tomorrowland city in some safe lobby or better yet, write the science so that they are virtually seeing AND walking rather than moving at all in the real world.Finally, related to this rant, at one point in the movie, our heroine takes a monorail to a different part of Tomorrowland during her virtual experience. How does this work in her real world? We know that one is moving in 3D space the same in both worlds so if you're on a high speed train then are you not also traveling at a high speed in your real world too? That is obvious suicide. (What would people see in our world as our heroine speed by up in the air going 100 mph toward the side of a building?)As for other science in the movie, it was largely treknobabble, even including those mysterious tachyon particles popularized in Star Trek.Solid 6 for fun quasi-SciFi.",Tomorrowland

The trailer looked quite promising.It was truly a relief to watch a non-dystopian movie. I love the Hunger Games but a lot of the best fiction lately has been dystopian; it's hard to get away from this kind of story.Some of the plot points were too subtle, so the story ended up being confusing. I was glad to finally see a movie with two important girl characters who seemed, throughout the whole movie, to never once give a thought to their appearance.

273,wildwesth,Tomorrowland is still tomorrow,6,23 May 2015,"*** WARNING THERE ARE SPOILERS BELOW ****The premise of the film is the dilemma that when optimism becomes unpopular, problems go unsolved. And they become a self-fulfilling future of unsolvable proportions. Is that a pandemic issue? I think the folks at Apple, Google, Tesla Motors and IBM might beg to differ. It wasn't so for Walt or WED Engineering. Nothing stopped Kennedy from promising a man on the moon or America from achieving it. Nothing stopped Steve Jobs or Stephen Hawking. And nothing stopped Walt from bringing the Monorail to America.WED Engineering, who designed most of the futuristic exhibits at the 1964 World's fair. Predicting the future of technology with spot on vision. Nothing to do with movies. Everything to do with future technology and the humanitarian use of it. The vision of Tomorrowland given to Casey, via the pin, is the most wonderful thing about this film. And it is jaw dropping, stunning, and awe inspiring. I nearly cried when I saw those shots. Fabulous.I watched it again yesterday and now, months later, I really see the basic flaws in the rest of the film.They stem from plot and directorial decisions.First, all efforts at character development are set aside in the interest of action and moving to the goal of getting to Tomorrowland. Our expectations are climbing with each quick cut scene, each lost moment.Second, unfortunately, the actual Tomorrowland we finally arrive at is a little post-apocalyptic itself. Big letdown to everyone. Who made that decision?Third, related to the issue above, putting the film's villain into the role of leader behind Tomorrowland! Don't get me wrong, Hugh Laurie is a great villain, and his speech is really incredible and hits right on target. But he cannot be the power behind Tomorrowland. Disney was the power behind WED Engineering. So where is our Shangri-La Abbott, where is our Obi Wan with words to inspire?Fourth, the film tries to show what happens when we lose our love for progress and our faith in it. But it doesn't walk the talk. No one but Casey actually believes anything can be done differently. Walker begins to believe, but is unsure. Not exactly a confident older brother. A better writer would have made sure Casey had allies who understood, supported, and had the wisdom and strength to do so. Allies who, although on the sidelines, were rooting for her. It takes a village, and that is part of the solution to the problem the film poses for society: Mentors.There is no Obi Wan Kenobi in this film. Casey's dad is compassionate, but largely useless. So, where is her role model? And where is the audience's? If she is the only person on planet earth who can solve this problem, that's not inspiring, it's scary. Again, bad story choices.Fifth, if you hold up a glowing image of utopia, don't dismantle it and expect anyone to believe in it. When we discover that Tomorrowland is largely a sham, it destroys the entire motivation of the film to get there.If you show a shiny diamond, don't turn it into cheap glass and expect anyone to find that an inspiration.Sixth, the movie claims to be inspiring, but Casey never reaches her goal. She never takes that trip on the Rocketship so close to her.While that is reality for some, many people do get to do what they love.A better film would have had a different ending.In fact, Mr. Bird, if you are out there, here is my humble submission for the final scene in the ""Director's Cut"" that can, singlehandedly turn around the missteps of this film and turn it into the classic it almost is.Proposed ""Final Scene"":When we see the field of new candidates for Tomorrowland, we hear Casey's voice, a little older, completing the narrative:""And so that's how it began. Sometimes you have to take a step back and start over. Sometimes one generation gets stuck and can't complete the dream, and it's left to us to do it...""The scene fades into the Tomorrowland we saw originally: bright and bustling. A monorail like tram opens and several pilots exit, walk down to their rocket, laughing and talking. A slightly older Casey is among them, outfitted and ready for flight.We see them from behind walking up to their mighty gleaming ship on a perfect cloudless day. Cut to the flight cabin. Casey and her colleagues are talking, making jokes, strapping themselves in.Just before Casey pulls down her visor, she breaks the forth wall and looks directly into the camera, smiles and says..""See you tomorrow..""She pulls the visor down.Cut to the rocket blasting loudly into the sky, and following it into the stars, and into the dark night of just stars, and fade to black.Then, the final credit music but here the only visuals are blue line draft plans for the vehicles and buildings of the film's Tomorrowland, each fades to the actual, final reality: Plan to reality, over and over again, including storyboard scenes...Then a shot of Walt Disney in the Disneyland Monorail..Fade to Disney standing proudly before a huge topographic map of the Epcot ""flower"" and fade to black..THEN credits...",Tomorrowland
274,michaelsharples96,"Visually stunning and deliriously entertaining. Uneven storytelling, and a disappointing final act",7,25 May 2015,"Tomorrowland is a the new Disney adventure movie brought to you by Director Brad Bird (The Incredibles). Starring Britt Robertson (Under the Dome), George Clooney (Oceans Trilogy), Hugh Lorrie (House) and Raffey Cassidy (Dark Shadows)You know when you get that game and it's just stupid and violent fun. And for the first 2 days of owning it all you do is just mess about on free roam and kill people and have a ton of fun? Instead of actually doing something meaningful?Well that's kind of like the first 50 minutes of this movie. It doesn't really do anything. It's just the main character having fun and exploring this new place and doing crazy stuff outside of this place. There wasn't any character development in the first act, but it wasn't relevant, the beginning of this movie was more like an explorer type thing. The first act was more about exploring the environment that Bird had created, rather than jumping straight into its story. Which is something I really admire. It only really starts to get into any detail after the hour mark. Up until the point that it really starts to try and develop its story it's interesting, quite original and very entertaining. But after that it kind of starts to all a little flat for me.I wouldn't say this was a hilarious movie. It's not a comedy, it's not supposed to be. They did muddle a few comedic scenarios and sentence into the movie which for the most part is pretty hit, for me at least. There weren't really any times that I laughed out loud (except for at 1 joke, but I was the only person in the theater laughing) but there were lots of moments that made me chuckle and grin, which kind of add to the lightheartedness of the movie. At the end of the day this is a family movie which both kids and adults can enjoy.This movie is visually stunning I will say. Brad Bird's vision is unparalleled, but... The story just isn't all there for me. This is the type of movie that in my opinion needs to have a detailed and developed in the story. It felt uneven at times. Like it was taking place in two different movies. And I don't just mean the transition from Tomorrowland to Earth. I mean even in the places just set on earth. It's tone is jumbled at parts and when it tries to mix it's heartfelt message with humor it doesn't really resonate with me (maybe because don't have a soul). The humor itself resonates, but when it transitions from humor to gut wrenching it doesn't really do it.Not only is this movie brilliantly directed but acted as well. Britt Robertson had to pretty much lead the movie for most of it and she did a very good job at doing so. George Clooney's presence on screen is as ever demanding as he was in his earlier movies. But the real star for me is Athena, played by Raffey Cassidy. This is probably one of the finest performances from a child actor I have ever seen, and there have been great ones in the past. She was so mature in her ability and her presence was as if she's been acting for years. She spoke like an adult, with conviction and her connection with Clooney was like watching a bickering married couple (that sentence sounds less creepy if you watch the movie) and she pulled it off perfectly.The 3rd act of this movie was extremely disappointing to me. This movie is more about the journey of getting to Tomorrowland rather than it being about life on there. When they do get there and the movies villain is revealed it felt very underwhelming. I mean you talk about lack of development in villains. But this one had no development whatsoever, none that I noticed anyhow. Like, really? You're the bad guy in all of this? How did that happen. You didn't explain at all as to why he felt this way leading up to the reveal. They did however basically just look straight to the audience and tell you why. But there wasn't really any motivation behind it. It just happened. The last 20-30 minutes of the film also succumbed to many of the tropes you're likely to see from a Disney movie, which I was hoping Bird could avoid. I wasn't extremely bothered by that but it did kind of take me out of the movie a little bit.The journey to Tomorrowland was well told, it was unique, lighthearted, funny and charming. But when they finally got there it just felt like a completely different movie. Kids will love it, adults will love it and it's a great movie for a family day out.",Tomorrowland
275,mcgregorrowland,Great film with a great flaw,7,26 May 2015,So me and a couple of my buds went to go to see this and we were expecting a mediocre Disney movie. What we got exceed our expectations regarding action and acting. This movie also had other spectacular things including cgi and the storyline of the movie.But there was one thing that caught my attention after watching this film. The WHOLE movie is just trying to figure out what the hell is going on. It takes forever to find out what is happening and why it is happening. The climax does not even begin until the last 30 minutes of the film. This really bugged me as i wanted to have more action in the actual Tomorrowland.Like I said this movie had many positive things but it also had one big negative thing. I would recommend this movie for kids that love sci-fi and science. I hope you can look past the flaw and enjoy the other the spectacular components that were in this movie.Also I would like to give Britt Robertson a round of applause as she did some great acting in this film and I hope to see her in many more films in the future.,Tomorrowland
276,josiahliljequist,disappointing,6,27 June 2015,"I had an early screening of this movie and was expecting a riveting action movie. What I got was a glorified road trip with underwhelming action. Almost all the good action sequences are all in the trailer, which is better than the movie. The beginning is very slow and the film doesn't get to the main storyline until a good half hour or so into the movie. One of the positives in the movie, the place ""Tomorrowland"" is not shown or explored nearly as much as it should have. The storytelling is confusing and the ending is rushed and anti-climatic.I was really hoping to like this film but I came out of the theater with a sour taste in my mouth.5.5/10",Tomorrowland

278,rnorwood1,Terrible Film That Takes Forever To Get Going,1,7 June 2019,"Can't believe people liked this but, if gadgets, effects thrill you it's okay. This film takes forever to get moving. A story needs a Beginning, a Middle, and an End. This one stays in first gear through a series of scenes that are little more than misadventures laced with gadgets, an annoying, difficult, argumentative protagonist in Britt Robertson as Casey who argues relentlessly against anyone trying to help. She's a very annoying character. Raffey Cassidy as the young girl Athena is the only thing that keeps the film alive. Her character adds intrigue, gets you wondering plus you genuinely like her - she's not annoying. Okay, so the film and cast stumble along through one huge beginning of predictable action scenes, mishaps, and the usual screaming. The film has no real Middle just a long disappointing End. I mean really, all that to get to ""that"". It wasn't even a clever film, just a lot of Disney style antics and effects",Tomorrowland
279,tristandetwiler,Do not listen to all the idiots who call this film a snooze-fest.,10,23 May 2015,"I don't get what modern movie-goers problems are. It seems nobody has any suspension of disbelief or patience when watching a movie. It's the same thing that happened with Godzilla (2014) where people complained we didn't see enough of Godzilla himself. Hasn't anyone from this generation heard of build-up or the idea of holding back? Of course not, because we've all been over showered with non-stop exposure to that kind of content with over the top action cheese fests like The Avengers. People need to realize that less is more. I've been going around online after seeing Tomorrowland (2015) and reading reviews. To be honest, I'm shocked at some of these people's reactions. As of Saturday May 23rd, the film holds a 49% on rottentomatoes, which to me, is pitiful. Now, with the case of Tomorrowland and what people should realize, it's not all about the world of Tomorrowland itself, but instead, the idea of Tomorrowland. *SPOILER* The pin that she receives is not actually a gateway to the land of tomorrow, but instead, turns out to be a teaser or commercial for Tomorrowland. The creators send out the pins to creative and imaginative people as invitations, asking them if they want to go to help evolve the world of tomorrow. The moral of the story is one that's actually true and very important, not preachy as some overly-sensitive people are making it out to be. It's telling people to go ahead and create what you want to see rather than just waiting around from someone else to do it. Who knows? You may be extremely talented in that area. You'll never know until you try. It's up to us to create the world of tomorrow and that's what the movie is more or less about. Besides that, it's a very well-paced action film with amazing performances from George Clooney and Britt Robertson. It's constantly moving around from location to location as more and more information about Tomorrowland is revealed. It's a tightly and perfectly executed script that doesn't reveal too much all at once, or drags out information for too long. The timing is perfect, the acting is superb, the visuals are impressive, and the idea is captivating and one that a lot of people should follow. So, in short, please do not listen to those online complaining about it being a boring film or anything like that. Just keep in mind the movie isn't really all about Tomorrowland, but the idea of it and how we can get there. It's there for a few minutes, but it's just a teaser. Go check it out!~",Tomorrowland
280,seannasuti,Do not listen to the critics on this one! A vastly under-appreciated tale of promise and hope.,10,20 August 2015,"This film deserved so much more than what it got, both critically and commercially, when it debuted back in May, where unfortunately it ended up becoming one of the year's biggest box-office bombs. From the mind of one of today's greatest directors, Brad Bird, the same great filmmaker that gave us some of the best animated films of all-time like 'The Iron Giant' and 'The Incredibles' and the best 'Mission Impossible' film to date in 'Ghost Protocol', 'Tomorrowland' is an inspiring original story that above all promotes the two things that have been lacking in today's cynical society; hope and the promise of a bright future.Some have accused this film of being preachy for promoting these exact morals. But if you ask me, that just makes this film even stronger as a result in how it boldly goes against the cynical mindset that you see a lot of nowadays in favor of an optimistic vision of a better tomorrow.Bird and co-writer Damon Lindelof make the right decision to not over-rely too much on the world of Tomorrowland. This film may be centered around a fantastic utopia where anything is possible but it's more about the journey to Tomorrowland than the place itself and the build-up leading into the film's finale is second to none. Ultimately though it was the finale of the film that made it such a polarizing flick amongst critics. But contrary to popular opinion, I thought it was suitable for what the story demanded. In a year where characters like Furiosa are being regarded as some of the greatest film characters of their time, this film features two of the best female leads of the year, played perfectly by Britt Robertson and Raffey Cassidy, respectively. As lead Casey, Robertson perfectly conveys the character's optimistic outlook without coming off as annoying while Cassidy shines in the role of the totally bad-ass robot Athena. George Clooney is also excellent in the role of an inventor named Frank who, compared to Casey, is much more pessimistic about the future but gradually regains his faith over the course of the film. Don't let this film become one of those forgotten box-office bombs just because it dared to critique the cynicism of today's society. With brilliant performances and visuals and messages that resonate more than ever nowadays, 'Tomorrowland' is easily the most underrated film of 2015 and another masterpiece from director Brad Bird.",Tomorrowland
281,omorg-pub,in many ways i understand,7,21 June 2015,"i get why people are not reviewing this movie highly. it's high in production values. the script, on the other hand, pans off as highhanded. it doesn't have the grit of michael collins, or the sheer sass of oceans eleven. all the same for myself... and maybe i'm a dreamer... it speaks to me. because all my life, i have been in fear of the future. because i have lived in fear of nuclear war, of environmental catastrophe, of peak oil. and those are real, and damning concerns. at the same time... in recent years, i have had to face more immediate dangers. i have lived at the hands of a violent psychopath. i have lost everything and been homeless. most of my worst fears have come true. and i learned something. i learned that i have to stop telling myself that the worst may happen. i learned that i have to start cheering for the future. i have to start telling myself that i will figure it out, that i can cope, that things are going to be okay. i'm not talking about hiding my head in the sand; i'm talking about believing. and on some level, i think that is what this movie is about. it's about not psyching ourselves into believing that Armageddon is about to happen, not because it couldn't, not because things don't look that way, but because we have hope. simple hope. because when it comes down to it, today, you do want to do something to make things different. when it comes down to the wire, you won't want to lay down your life just because it's easier. and when it comes to watching a movie for entertainment, this one may not get it for you fully. but the message is real, and it's important. we have to stop telling ourselves that the end is inevitable... tomorrow. otherwise tomorrow will become today. i have become an optimist, not out of idealism, but out of necessity. i'ts imperative we start thinking of solutions and believing in our future. the truth is, we have everything we need at hand to solve all our problems. we simply lack the will and motivation. and sooner or later that will shift. would you rather be part of the problem or the solution? in the end it may not matter, because dreamers will continue to dream up solutions. in the end, as with any cinema, you may simply have to come to terms with the role you decided to play.",Tomorrowland
282,jelstudio,A thoroughly enjoyable movie :),8,1 December 2017,"No doubt this movie has a political statement to make. But it's completely honest about it. Very refreshing, even if you agree, or not, with its mission.Technically the movie is where you would expect a modern day blockbuster to be. Good image, good sound, no goofs. Well made in every way.Acting is really good. The casting is spot on. The flow is good, so even though the movie may appear to be long, with a 130 minute run-time, it never feels like it's dragging along.The level of fun and action, AND seriousness, is pretty well balanced. It's a feel-good mood film, that does actually allow some drama to enter at just the perfect dosage (So it's not overdone and becomes cliché-like, but is all the more effective)It did remind me a bit of Cameron's The Abyss (Another cool movie)It made me laugh (I'm just going to say CocaCola, been there done that LOL) It made me cry (Who knew you could miss ones and zeros, but this film makes it possible)If you prefer dark themes (Like that of the low-budget crime-shows all the cheap TV-channels show 24/7) you'll not like this film. If you're not a fan of the super-hero hype, all the Marvel stuff, then you're in luck; this movie doesn't have those (But if you ARE a fan, then you still won't go home completely empty-handed; there ARE scenes that will appeal to you even if they aren't exactly like iron-man) If you like the 60s, you're in luck. If you like scifi, you're in luck. If you like 'normal' life-styles, you're in luck. If you like Paris, you're in luck. The list is long :)A thoroughly enjoyable movie. No less.",Tomorrowland
283,philipmagnier,"Entertaining, Not for Everyone Though",5,5 June 2015,"I enjoyed this but it could have been much better is my overall conclusion here. Any film with Damon Lindhof as a writer will have interesting themes and plot lines but it seems to have been directed by several different people. And aimed at several different target audiences.The elements are there, three good actors with presence in George and the two girls, good effects to bring wonder at what's happening, a plot that moves along nicely but...ultimately I think the director, Brad Bird, lost sight of what he was doing.P.S. It's not a film for children: I don't think anyone under say 11 would really get it.",Tomorrowland
284,nox09,"Boring and clichés , clichés everywhere",5,28 May 2015,"the movie was more about journey to Tomorrowland than actual Tomorrowland . and even there i can't say it was a successful adventure Fci-Fi movie . IT starts very promising but than falls apart the jokes are flat one-liners that must make you laugh are not working , action looks good but there is only 1-2 action scene in the entire movie. the storytelling is dull and there is not enough plot so you feel bored, we never really get to know this future sci- fi world . and the whole third act of the movie can be described with one word ""Cliche"" . Hugh Laurie is a bad guy just because the movie needs villain , and his motivations are just so clichéd and seen so many times before that it makes you roll your eyes....... the massage of the movie is there and it's pretty good , but reminding about it 100 times during the movie did not work for me . Clooney gives solid performance and the ending looked like in sequel we gonna get more of actual Tomorrowland . overall movie can be enjoyable as a family sci-fi adventure movie but it lacked on comedy , action and TOMORROWLAND",Tomorrowland
285,bcr43,Pipe dream exhibit: Utopia,5,4 August 2016,"Continuous encounters with authors who think negatively of readers— and people—whose imagination, not fancy, is wanting and limited has a serious implication than the mere joy of condescension, disregard for exertion among others. To demonstrate the significance of this scenario, a mightily compelling situation is unveiled. The more captivating the better.It is not a secret that the future is sh*t. But what future when is already here—a linear time-line based on the drone attack to the NASA premises. The vanguard of routine are started by insinuations that explain an external presence in a harmonious world. Confirmation of such advancements at the expense of all upheld as non-confound-able rights is met with articulated fate. Today it is in various forms— the biggest, bureaucracy. There are others, but the weightiest of future-world books detailing—mostly society's failures—the unfolding predicaments have been aligned with an optimist idea of the innings around fixing.Not much will rely on the version of existence one wants to dwell on; feeding the dark descent or propelling the hindsight-fully hopeful— in a time when the rules of robotics have since been long surpassed. Perhaps the fourth rule would have fallen in place to account for ""omnidirection""; morally, compass-wise, all else. We may want to think of anything alien as what exists beyond this world, technically rending other dimensions thus to the current world. A world less in harmony with itself is far more unhinged to idealize with a different envisioning of itself. Engagingly, almost paradoxically—nullified by countless timeliness—manipulating a future to change the past offers the film's closure and glimpses of redemption.Meager is when a few of the best suited converge to create a better world. There may have been Arcadias, but Utopia is only a human idealization. It can never be realized. Every approach has its failings, with nothing but to follow the most convenient. Tommorrowland will only always be a ""tachyon"", the vehicle by which to see either side—past and future—as the basis for manufacturing destiny. Not a specific future.",Tomorrowland
286,just_for_movies,"A very inventive and original film, but not without its flaws",7,9 June 2015,"Tomorrowland is a bright sic-fi movie that boasts great visuals, good acting, and solid directing. There were some disappointing aspects to the movie but overall it was very fun movie.Story/plot are absolutely essential in this movie as there are so many directions the story could take. It is original material so the writers didn't have to follow any previously established material which gave them a lot more freedom. The movie starts off with the viewer getting a glimpse of the world of Tomorrowland and it's so magnificent and beautiful that you are ready to stay in Tomorrowland forever. Shortly after that, we get another scene in Tomorrowland and it's just as amazing as the first. It makes you want to discover a place like Tomorrowland and actually live there. After those two scenes however, we're back to reality on our planet Earth and the movie doesn't return to Tomorrowland until the end. That was disappointing because they established this awesome world and then they don't ""use"" it. It's always a presence in the movie but not a physical presence. The end is where we see Tomorrowland again but it's lost it's magic from before and besides, we don't get to see as much as before. I was ready to go on an adventure in Tomorrowland but it turned out to be more an adventure on ""boring"" old Earth. Another problem with the general plot was that the first two thirds of the movie are very enjoyable and fun, but the last third is very ""meh"". It gets a little clichéd and surprisingly preachy. The end is also quite anti-climactic which was a letdown. I just wasn't very impressed with how things ended because the movie had POTENTIAL and then it sort of fell flat in the third act. On the brighter side, the world of Tomorrowland was incredibly intricate and beautiful. It was essentially the definition of futuristic. The inventions and the technology were incredible and the imagery was fantastic. The level of detail that went into the creation of Tomorrowland is indescribable. The acting in this movie is very good as well. George Clooney is good and Britt Robertson is also surprisingly good in the lead role. Raffey Cassidy is a very young actress and often child actors are very bad. But in her case, she was very good which can only spell a successful future for her. Brad Bird did some very impressive stuff behind the camera. His style of action was fun and unique and he certainly can make his characters believable. In the end, Tomorrowland had some good aspects and some bad aspects. The movie didn't stay long in Tomorrowland which was disappointing because it was so inspiring and pristine that it would have been fine of they had spent the whole movie there. The third act was also disappointing and anti-climactic. On the plus side, Tomorrowland itself was one of the best fantasy worlds brought to the big screen and the CGI was very good. The actors did a great job portraying their roles and Brad Bird was the right guy to direct this movie. Though it had some letdowns, Tomorrowland was a fun and inventive summer movie.",Tomorrowland
287,edyngrn,very very good,9,15 November 2015,"I did not expect it to be very good. I did not listen to the reviews, but I knew how awful they said it was. I am surprised about their reviews because it is based off what Disney envisioned. Everyone loves Disney and the innovation he had. Tomorrowland was made into a story, how it came to be was made into a story.I like movies like this because it makes one think. We know about tomorrowland, but how did it begin? I remember riding space mountain as a child with my parents in Disney world and going to epcot center and mgm when it first opened.the people that write bad reviews, have they ever been to Tomorrowland or was it just because of Clooney? Sometimes it can be just about the actor.",Tomorrowland
288,voranimmer,Come all ye dreamers,7,25 May 2017,"This movie is hard to rate. It is full of drawbacks as well as wonders. There'll be some spoilersFirst -the wonders. Always good to see Hugh Laurie, especially in his House MD style) Charming fellow, Hugh Laurie, lights up every movie he's in. Athena is also very bright and brings the famous AI theme into the movie. Some Terminator II inspired scenes, namely the car chase, Spielberg-like AI dramatic finale - the finale was very touching, although I would prefer her to stay with the team. All interesting and strong scenes are actually the second part of the screen time so if you give it a chance, it goes better with every minute, and the last 20 minutes are particularly good.And the drawbacks... Britt Robertson screams a lot. Starting with an independent headstrong rebel clad in leather on a motorbike - sexy style) She was made into somewhat too hysterical then, Rebel turned into the kid in distress? Not a good idea. Retro scenes were too cartoonish and candy-like. The grandeur of the City of Science was completely undeveloped - the only ideas were flying trains and multi-storey swimming pools. Overall the movie had sort of a personality disorder, trying to be kids movie and a sci-fi drama. Yet it developed into quite an interesting show with the deep meaning underneath - which reminds me of earlier Disney movies of 80s and 90s. Good Disney movie definitely worth of watching) Feed the right wolf, as they've used to say in it))",Tomorrowland
289,Biodigital_Jazzman,A brutal Tomorrowland,6,6 June 2015,"I really wanted to like this movie more. The performances were good. The visual design was interesting. And it actually tried to say something profound at the end. But it reminded me of my reaction to Blade Runner: the five minute message at the end couldn't make up for two hours of violence. I was very surprised this got a PG rating; there were some fairly brutal scenes. And the relentless violence diluted the film's message of a hopeful tomorrow. It's as if the only hope for the future is to kill and blow things up.I was really puzzled as to why the writers chose Audio Animatronics as the assassins. That's a specifically Disney term. I can imagine that no child viewing this movie would ever again be comfortable in A Small World, Pirates of the Caribbean or the Hall of Presidents; in the back of their minds, those children will now think that previously charming robots could at any moment blast them to smithereens.The visual design of Tomorrowland was frozen in the 1960s. Considering the opening scenes at the 1964 World's Fair, I can understand where the inspiration came from. But the future ended up looking a lot like the past, with the addition of some transformer-like robots and touch-screen interfaces. At no point in the movie did I think, ""Wow! That looks amazing!"" It looked more like visions of the future frozen in the 1960s. I'd seen it all before. Probably a bigger part of the problem was that the movie focused solely on the architecture and technology of Tomorrowland. Outside of some teens recklessly zooming around with jet packs, there was no mention of the quality of life. We didn't get to know any of the citizens from Tomorrowland. They were just anonymous almost robotic people hopping onto various transportation devices, heading to places unknown for purposes unknown. The technology seemed to govern their lives. That gave Tomorrowland a sterile unwelcoming feeling. Everything was clean and shiny, but in an antiseptic emotionless way. Probably the best outcome from this movie is that it kept Brad Bird from directing Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Bird has done some good work with Pixar. But Tomorrowland, for all its attempt at dazzling visuals and hasty moralizing, doesn't have a heart to go along with it -- the very problems with the last Star Wars trilogy. Bird has talent, as he's proved in the past. Hopefully he'll have a better tomorrow.",Tomorrowland

291,HenbaineAccount2,On the fence with this one,5,4 October 2015,"I normally right detailed reviews but this will be more a basic summary.The good: Stunning visuals. The female lead characters (especially Raffety Cassidy's Athena) are very believable. Hugh Laurie making a comeback was charming. A good, original storyline with a very uplifting quite inspiring ending. Some good action sequences and some good humour adults and older kids/teens will enjoy.A gritty female child character,who I honestly feel outshone the seasoned verterans more often than not. For a little girl she was very edgy and kicked serious ass but had a sweeter more relatable side in the end.The not so good: The plot was needlessly confusing and did drone on. This is a Disney movie so you really would not expect complication on this level. A grown adult, I was lost for half the movie before I finally grasped where it was going. Too much talk on earth and not enough of ""Tomorrowland"" itself till the very end, they could have gone more into such a well imagined and stunning world. A shame. Constant plot shifts made keeping up a bit difficult and several characters not really explained.A word of caution to parents: This is NOT suitable for young children. There is swearing such as ""B*****ks"" reference to being on drugs, a lot of violence (robots and humans die, get shot at,exploded under globe and run over.(Disney shows more robot violence, worryingly as if this is somehow more acceptable as still violence) Pretty tense action scenes and dialogue in parts. The plot, although with sweet Disney-esque moments, is really not the usual and much more mature and in places would be a bit too dull and complicated for children.There is a hard message delivered by Laurie regarding our social, global and economic state and how we all view life and the world.. good moral message but again a tad dark for the younger viewers.",Tomorrowland
292,tochukwu-83206,"Could have been better, but is brought down by propaganda!",6,6 February 2016,"Firstly, the film is too campy, slightly cartoonish in its presentation of utopia. Utopia: Ideally perfect state; especially in its social and political and moral aspects. Tomorrow land is that utopia. Despite the beauty of that world created by Brad Bird, less is said about or how it comes into existence. Not proper, since such a big deal is made about it and how it is perfect. If the world of this film is to be real, then Tomorrow land will be their heaven: a place people will wish to go after death-for the Christians anyway. But the secrecy shrouded around it might be a ploy to keep the audience's attention on the main characters: in this case, three. Annoying because the film shares the same title with this place- and oh, how much I waited to be visually immersed in this fantasy environs created by the special effects department of this film. More frustrating also because the start of the film transports itself from earth in 1964 to this place implying that events of the film majorly might take place, giving rise to plot devices and exhibition of its cast talent- no matter how long I decide to be patient, the satisfaction of visually exploring this world, planet or whatever name you choose to call it eluded me. Their fault, not mine!Even though the film doesn't present Tomorrow land to the time lengths which we would have wanted, some praise should still go to the director for this colourful-technological-perfectness albeit childlike globe, where everyone is happy and is filled with Big Hero 5 esque robots - physically charming with its metal parts. Though the director decides not to give too much attention to the film's title, but there are still dangling sub-plots and threads scattered over in which we see zero attempts to explore. I kept wondering what happened to Frank Walker between 1964 and the present. I also wanted to know what triggered his exile from Tomorrow land. More so, the audience would have liked to know all about Governor Nix's robots and why they kept going after Frank and basically any person in possession of that T-pin. The list goes on and on giving rise to a film that raises more questions that it can answer. This highlights the incoherency in the storyline and screenplay of the film, if you care to see past the execution on screen, which gives the feeling of a film being tightly knit.But the above two paragraphs are not enough reasons to avoid this flick. Here is a good enough one! Summarily, Tomorrow land is one of the most self-righteous, propaganda-filled, moralistic-motivated film that fuels previous predictions of doomsday theory. (2012) did that! And even with all its massive scale destruction of human life and property due to earth changing cataclysmic events, it didn't come off as advocating for a cause. Tomorrow land does that: boastfully, unabashedly, proudly and in a shameful way too. The underlying propaganda of the film is that: ""humans are destroying the earth and time will come when all life will be wiped out"". Fortunately, for the preacher of this sermon, I mean, he has Tomorrow land to take solace in-unwilling to invite anyone in if his prophecy comes true: that three minutes speech in the third act says so. The most important thing to look out for here is not how true or untrue this message is. But how arrogantly the film propagates this propaganda-so much that it thinks it is impervious to counter- propaganda or counter-arguments which could turn its strong point to sand that blows with the wind. Truth is I don't have a problem with the film's message. I only feel that it could have being a little bit humble trying to convince us to fight for its cause.However, you should see this film because of the lengths it goes to show that characters are not willing to sit down and watch the world burn to ashes.",Tomorrowland

It's very much a Disney movie, with clear references to the Tomorrowland concept, but without hammering the idea. The science fiction is a bit vague, but uses well known concepts in interesting ways, borrowing from much that is past while creating a unique story that kept my interest throughout. The casting is great, both for new comers and well established actors; having the brother be the Humanex from Extant was a nice touch. The final solution is also a bit vague, but promotes the concept of hope and perseverance, which is a welcome change from most contemporary science fiction films. A good story well told that captured my attention.",Tomorrowland
297,Veteransson,"This movie didn't work for me, at all",5,4 January 2017,"Tomorrowland is the second live action feature by Brad Bird after his successful debut with Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol. The movie follows Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) who tries to enter a new, mysterious world with the help of inventor Frank Walker (George Clooney). The overall marketing campaign behind the movie was quite mysterious about the plot of the movie, which is a good and rare thing these days. Lately, you don't get to see a movie very often without knowing what it's about. Unfortunately, figuring out what the movie was about during watching it was perhaps the sole aspect of the movie that kept me interested. This Disney family movie didn't work for me, at all. Tomorrowland sets up and explores a new, original world and luckily the visuals were good enough to make this world look appealing. This should have been beneficial to my interest in this world, but almost every aspect of the movie, besides the visuals, made sure that I wouldn't get invested in the movie. Alright, it's a kid's movie and therefore the acting is sometimes silly because that's how kids like it. The dialogue is simple and very expositional, so kids can understand the movie. But that's no excuse for the dialogue to be this awful and the acting to be this bad. You can make things simple without making the bad. Take 'Back to the Future' for example, where the dialogue and acting are quite silly, but unlike in 'Tomorrowland', it actually works. In the case of 'Back to the Future', director Robert Zemeckis and actors Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd played a pivotal role in the success of the movie. It takes great actors with an understanding of comedy to deliver this kind of silly dialogue, and it takes a competent director to set the right tone for the movie to make this kind of acting and dialogue work. Brad Bird and Britt Robertson failed at what the cast of 'Back to the Future' succeeded. George Clooney gave a decent performance.Tomorrowland will not become a classic Family movie, but will be forgotten shortly after watching it. Which is a shame, because the movie did set up an original world.",Tomorrowland
298,jackgradis,Tomorrowland is boringly underwhelming,6,24 May 2015,"Tomorrowland is directed by Brad Bird, one of my favorite directors working today. It also stars George Clooney, one of the best actors working today. And it is a Disney film, so what could possibly go wrong? Well, that's what this review is for.My major issue with Tomorrowland is we don't spend much time at ALL actually on Tomorrowland. And when we finally get their, it's nothing like we saw in the trailers. If you've seen any trailer for this film, you have seen all of the cool parts of the place called ""Tomorrowland"". Instead we get non-stop pointless dialogue, exhilarating walking sequences, and even more mesmerizing monologues. I get this wasn't supposed to be an action movie, but come on. Give me something cool going down on Tomorrowland.Another issue I have is the message of the film. It is the same message we have seen so many times before, the optimists versus the pessimists, but this time it is so ruthlessly beat over our heads I had to keep checking to see if my head was still attached. Brad Bird is an amazing director, but the dude was handed a boring and meandering script and got little opportunity to put his skills to use. Instead he is finding all the ways he can to tell is that dreamers are the key to our future. For 2 hours.Now there are some redeeming qualities about Tomorrowland. Mainly the performance given by Britt Robertson and Raffey Cassidy. They both are trying really hard to not sound repetitive and clichéd despite the writing. Another positive is when Bird is actually given a chance to display his ability with visuals, they are amazing. This film is beautiful when it is trying to be.Overall, Tomorrowland is a big disappointment considering the cast, director, and studio it is associated with. We spend to much time on earth explaining things, and an unoriginal message is beat into us constantly. While Tomorrowland isn't a bad movie, it's disappointing how mediocre it is.",Tomorrowland
299,sanwit,We are dreamers!,6,24 May 2015,"This is one of those movies which will put a smile on your face within 5 minutes of the beginning, and it will make you think about it long after it ends. Tomorrowland is an exhibit of a world without politics, red tape...bureaucracy. It is a land where anything is possible, and it looks amazing. Britt Robertson in the lead is quite good, but Raffey Cassidy as Athena steals the show, shining even in scenes with veteran Clooney. The sequences of Casey catching glimpses of Tomorrowland when she touches the pin are brilliantly executed and they are awesome(my 2nd fav place right now after Hogwarts (: )! But it is a letdown that there isn't much more of that later. The movie falls abruptly into storytelling mode after that and keeps explaining stuff till the end! I mean, yeah, tachyons are pretty nifty things, but we fell in love with Tomorrowland because of the gleaming skyscrapers, gravity-defying trains, jetpacks, and I really did miss that in the second half.

The movie does fumbles along the way, losing the tempo and going a tad too much into summarizing the problems which this world faces: climate, pollution, global warming, depression, political unrest, greed, and laziness. But aided with stunning visuals and portrayal of some futuristic possibilities, the movie ends up being a perfect family entertainer. The movie is based on a scenario where there exists a secret society, a cult of creative thinkers, science wizards, mathematic heroes, imaginative children, and sharp scientists, who wish to create a future which is environment friendly, people oriented and so much advanced that we create a global, connected Earth where everyone is happy.They recruit such intelligent and creative humans, and train them to continue the legend. George Clooney as Frank Walker is good, but not great; maybe he wasn't exactly suited for this role. I liked the acting of Britt Robertson as Casey Newton, who represents the optimistic, positive point of view of the whole situation. Frank is brilliant, intelligent, but Casey is more alive.Disney has turned no stone unturned to include some high quality special effects and visualization of a future which seems pretty interesting. Being a new franchise, and a new plot, I was not disappointed.The movie lacks comedy, and some wit. Humor is almost absent, although there are some space-time related dad jokes in between. Overall, a good family entertainer, a movie which kids will love. The tradition at Disney continues!",Tomorrowland
301,wcpom,Started out OK then just went on and on,6,11 January 2020,"I thought Tomorrowland started out quite entraining, funny and exciting. I liked the early sixties theme park parts, the futuristic parts and particularly like the battle with the bots in the comic book store, or whatever that was. But after that it just seemed to go on and on. It wasn't a bad film by any stretch, it had good acting, it looked good and there were some good ideas. But it was far too long and maybe should have been limited to just a few of those ideas.",Tomorrowland
302,melaniealison2,Think positive. Drink Coke.,2,21 May 2015,"I'll admit it. I watch a lot of movies and I sometimes fall asleep during movies. Usually during the ""O No, we're never going to succeed"" part - followed by the crunch time predictable action scenes. This was one of those movies. Briefly. But, seriously, this is just another 'drown the cat' movie (pun on the standard 'save the cat' movie writing software used by Hollywood - no animal harm intended). It had all the right action scenes in all the right places with the standard Disney message free of charge: Smile. Be positive. Dare to dream. The main character is Emotion, her robot girlfriend is Reason and Emotion is there to save all the men in her life from her father to her little brother to the disgruntled man 'down the street'. The theme is clearly 'never lose hope'. Thing is: It's full of not so subliminal messages on how to behave in a model Disney citizen way. Like the scene in which the heroine has low blood sugar and pulls out two coca cola's from grumpy man's fridge and drinks them both. Whew, that was hard work. Love, peace and happiness. Drink a Coke. Or two. And then there's the scene where the little robots of the future are all dressed up nicely in Mexx world citizen clothing and set out - boys first of course - to save our future world. No, please, not mine. You will be assimilated. I made the mistake with this movie that Disney was trying to be intelligent. They weren't. At least, I hope they weren't.",Tomorrowland
303,confrank,"The Future is Bright, Despite Some Annoyances",6,28 May 2015,"Tomorrowland, starring George Clooney and Britt Robertson, is the latest release by the titan of the movieverse, Disney. While based on a theme park ride, I still count this as an original idea, being one of those rare times when we see a screenplay not based as a sequel/prequel/reboot receive a huge budget and get the opportunity to stand on its own. For the most part, it was a worthy investment.The director of Tomorrowland, Brad Bird, is currently on an enviable streak with smash hit after hit like Ratatouille, The Incredibles, and Mission Impossible 4. His latest outing demonstrates his command behind the camera again, taking (an honestly) unremarkable script and stretching it far past its potential using visual finesse to keep the plot moving at a bracingly energetic pace.I think a better title for this movie would have been something resembling ""Journey to Tomorrowland"", because very little time is actually spent in Tomorrowland. Maybe it just made more sense for the script, or maybe they realized their CGI budget would have been catastrophically high, either way it's a tad misleading. When we are in Tomorrowland however, it's everything we could have hoped for creatively. My guess is whoever designed this place must be somewhere between a lego master builder, or one of the greatest minecraft players of all time, because this place is monumental, and littered with little brilliant inventions; my favourite being the multi-level swimming pool. It's the small things like these I can appreciate that show the people involved really do care about every tiny aspect of the film-goer experience.I suppose the key problem with the film would have to be, well, Disney. It was very obvious at times where the narrative direction and certain plot points were constricted by the Disney-esque formula most of their movies adhere to. This was most apparent in the final act because of the way the movie felt rushed into resolving its conflict neatly and quickly, making for an ending which felt a bit too clean. We're also subjected to a fairly preachy expositionfest, with a theme that was WAY too on the nose. Some subtlety wouldn't necessarily be a bad thingFinally, we also get to witness two star making performances. While Clooney is predictably solid, he's often outshone by his younger co- stars. One being Britt Robertson, who should see many more lead roles come her way in the future. The other, being the very young Raffey Cassidy, who plays a character that would sound extremely irritating on paper, but is played with a dominant presence well beyond the actress's years.FINAL VERDICT: While it hits a few too many familiar points and beats you over the head with its moral, Tomorrowland is still a well directed adventure whose mystery is a pleasure to unravel until a convoluted end.",Tomorrowland

So, having already seen the first 20 min, the movie does a complete change hard to follow seems like the script is being written as it goes and its all about a dude who's hot for an underaged kid? Moveover, the entire plot is confusing. With the exception of the Athena character and the special effects, the movie is a complete flop. Saw it with a bunch of people from work. Nobody liked it. Instead of whatever the movie was trying to accomplish, they could have figured out how to get wasted time back.

What I got was more like a warm breeze. I still ultimately enjoyed the message the movie tries to convey - specifically Hugh Laurie's little diatribe during the climax of the film. But that wasn't enough to redeem an ultimately disappointing film.There are little things that seemed really out of place, like the Terminator copycat scene where Athena chases after a car and causes you to laugh out loud for the wrong reasons. Also, a little background as to why these robots are so willing to kill innocent humans would be nice. Where this movie really struggles though is the the dialogue. It is horrendous and reaches a peak when Athena and Casey first meet - their entire conversation amounts to a scripted Q&A session with no natural flow whatsoever.Not a terrible way to spend a rainy afternoon, but there are probably better choices out there for the family to see.",Tomorrowland
309,tye1138,Disney spoils another great story,7,23 May 2015,"Brad Bird has always amazed me with his unique and realistic stories which not only entertain, but also have a soul like very few other films. Sure, he did a Mission Impossible film recently, but that was simply for fun. When he writes, produces and directs his own work, that's when you've gotta perk your ear up and listening. Tomorrowland is in my opinion, his first real forte into live action filmmaking. It's a story which would work great for Pixar and in a lot of ways, works very good as a live-action film. Unfortunately, being connected to Disney potentially squashed much of what could have been. Tomorrowland works on so many levels, from female to female interactions between two lead characters, the attention to detail, cinematography, art direction and even music. This is actually a well-made film, something that was actually unexpected due to the trailers which don't do the film justice. The marketing dwell's too much on Tomorrowland and not enough on the actual adventure. Brad Bird himself says the film is simply an adventure movie, which has little to do with the actual place Tomorrowland. The unfortunate part is that Tomorrowland holds the excitement of the story and it's a bitter letdown because the filmmakers choose to omit critical information which COULD make the film much more interesting. The film has some great moments with good laughs, some dark scenes which play very well and of course a great cast. It's message is a bit heavy handed, something you expect from the very beginning of the film, but is a bit over-done for adults. Clearly the film's intention was to grab the youth audience, which is fine, but they're becoming smarter and smarter, so there wasn't any need to slam home the message over and over again. In fact, had they spent more time on the science and explanation of how Tomorrowland even exists, it would have been a far better movie. However, the filmmakers gloss over much of the interesting science and replace it with less interesting banter which seems to never answer any questions. Unlike reviewers who panned this film, I understand Bird's intention and constraints within the Hollywood system. Had the film been a brainiac science piece, it wouldn't have done well at the box office. So Bird resorted to making something a lot simpler, which works very well, but is toned down. Had he made a darker film, it would have been A LOT better and more interesting, but alas this was his opportunity and I think he did a pretty darn good job over-all. It's not the caliber I expect of Bird, but it's absolutely a fantasy of his childhood and it works for all audiences.",Tomorrowland
310,j-lindsay-sens,Strong Message,8,25 May 2015,"I was exciting for this movie, until i saw the reviews coming in. There was a mix, but most of the reviews were negative about a lack of a proper plot and hard to follow story. However i did not find this at all.The main character, an opportunistic, stumbles onto a ""magical"" pin, as seen in the trailer, and somehow gets transported to a futuristic world that has none of the problems in today's world. She teams up with a young girl and a man who has given up all hope, to make sure this world stays the future.The acting was extremely well done in my opinion and all the main characters were spot on. The action was little, but when it was done, it was average with scenes that did not make much sense. And since the bad guys were robots, as seen in the trailer, ripping heads off is OK, which made for some pretty cool scenes. The story was very meaningful and the only people who are going to not like the story are people who don't believe in climate change and/or are pro-war. The whole basis of the plot is that the world is destroying itself, from climate change, protests, homelessness, to war, and the possible future that the pin shows is in jeopardy. So the main character must bring hope back to modern day society, hope that the world can change for the better and that giving up is never the answer.Overall i thought the movie was fantastic, not perfect. It had strong performances, a very strong and important message, and had its funny moments....All though, i would have liked to see less product placement, which was a distraction for me the entire movie.... ""Theres a coke in a fridge""..which happens to be in their classic glass bottle....",Tomorrowland

312,Krusader_Donkey,"DHKR: Tomorrowland- ""A Hollow, Idealist Film with Zero Ideas""",5,27 May 2015,"Tomorrowland was ALMOST great. It has a director with a great track record, it has a great cast of actors like George Clooney and Hugh Laurie, and the CGI presentation is the definitive proof that it can work well enough to craft creatively made sets and worlds. It's message is nearly perfect for today's youth, preaching on using your brain to promote creativity as well as practicality, without having to bastardize anything to a pompous extreme.So why does this film feel...less than what it should be like? Like it feels restrained or held back? Perhaps because underneath the pretty candy coating of A-Listers, CGI, and a great filming director, the core of the film feels rather lacking in terms of story, both in inherent build and in execution. Tomorrowland feels burdened by it's supposed moral and idealism, that it ends up conflicting with the bigger message, if there even is one that is. The film starts off with an argument between our lead and George Clooney, playing the role of Frank Walker. It's a futile attempt at comedy, and it doesn't go anywhere. Think of this as a giveaway that you just threw away a couple extra dollars than you should've. Even the most of the introduction, while visually breathtaking, is nothing more than just padding before the story begins to go in motion.When we do finally meet Walker, a mere 35 minutes into the film, then finally does a story come to life. We see that the world is destroying itself due to modern indulgences. People who chase the rabbit simply complain on how Earth is going straight to hell, but no one is at all trying to come up with a solution. Cynics like Walker accept the evils of the world, and seclude themselves away into their homes, keeping their creativity to themselves. Other cynics wish to use their creativity to help themselves when the actual apocalypse comes, like Governor David Nix(played by the massively talented Hugh Laurie), who continues to rule Tomorrowland as a de facto tyrant and keeps a steady supply of android henchmen coming from inside and out of the future. The film presents the world to be horribly cynical, outnumbering them so much that it seems that only our lead Cassie and the rogue AI ""Athena"" seem to be the only optimist and idealist, which in the world I live in ain't the bloody case. What was once a message that could be generally given to all is now narrowed into a certain group mostly composed of teen liberals who rebel against the ""man"" and government. Weirdly, Nix's own plans on preventing the apocalypse with a special observatory that knows exactly when any disaster event will occur is actually quite understandable. Why risk trying to fix something that's set in stone? He can see when everything horrible is about to happen, and it can urge everyone to prepare to endure and embrace the apocalypse. And he's evil because...he's cynical?Also, for a movie claiming ""creativity"", the film's storyline was actually very much generic and predictable. I actually could tell exactly what would happen, when it would, and how it would. Does the heroine magically change the mind of the cynical Walker? Check. Do they but heads with Nix while he tries to show her the apocalypse? Check. Forced romantic subplot? It does, and kinda awkwardly when it's between Walker and Athena, not only slightly pedophilloic, but cyberphilloic as well. Constantly, the story feels like it's going to put a new spin on the story, but then goes back to the normal generic story part, like Brad Bird is afraid to make that leap into creativity.Long story short, Athena dies to destroy the supposed Doomsday Machine, Nix is crushed by it after uttering the funniest line in the film, and soon everything is all better in the end. More pins are made, and are all exclusively given to Liberal Youths. Yup. Only the most creative can't be of any other side of the spectrum, it's all exclusively to the super happy lefty-wingies. That idea that anyone can be creative? Have original ideas to help everyone? Does that still apply?NOPE! If your a blooming cynic, you'll just hold us back! You're no better than Governor Nix, and we all know that creative politicians trying to protect the creative people are nothing but despicable tyrants! Yeah, that's the moral of the story!Tomorrowland might be a hollow film, but it at least looks very breathtaking, and almost every A-Lister actors is phenomenal. Brad Bird is still a great director, still worthy of being ""The Director of The Incredibles"", as this film shouldn't go on his track record and ruin his validity as a director. However, the film is anchored down by a generic story, lead actors that sound loud and annoyingly preachy with a moral that feels nonexistent, and confusing the viewer by preaching that all should come together but then only painting one side as good and the other as bad. If you want a breathtaking, gorgeous film, then go ahead. Just try not to think about the story too much.3-Stars, C-Ranking",Tomorrowland

A real jewel, and not only without a glitch, but with funny moments and action at every minute, or even, some of them, very touching.The bad: ... It's supposed to need to write something? OK: nothing at all.The worst: All the bad appreciation of critics which really have no good taste for art. A lot of people does not understand that the movie is not just about Tomorrowland, but about a journey inside the heart and will of the people... and with this, as if that was a small achievement, an odyssey.If you want to see a good exponent of the 7th art, don't hesitate to see this movie. If not, just listen some critics. ;)Additional comments: Some people say the movie has technical failures, but believe me, there are none, and the reason is because this movie returns to the most pure essence of Sci-Fi. Maybe some people does not liked because it touch sensible fibers about a very common and well known message, or maybe because they believe that it was only to promote a Disney attraction, but even if that was true, doesn't diminish the quality of the movie. A little childish, OK, the movie was intended for all the audience, and this is not a bad thing, in fact, is an incredible and amazing way about how to show the essence of something really beautiful.

317,Movie Steve,"Magical Visuals, Marred by Violence, Plot Holes & Absurdities",6,8 June 2015,"(This does indeed contain MAJOR Spoilers)In Disney's Tomorrowland, three police officers are shot and killed in cold blood. The fact that it's done by robots (and death rays, which vaporizes them) doesn't make it any more acceptable.Which is sad, because I'd been VERY MUCH looking forward to this film for weeks, and it disappointed. Some good first: The young actresses here are wonderful. We'll be seeing a lot more of both Britt Robertson (Casey Newton) and Raffey Cassidy (Athena.) My opinion of Hugh Laurie (David Nix) is colored by his amazing role as the lead character on House, MD, but in truth his acting was only fair, and I believe any actor – known or unknown – could have better played Frank Walker, portrayed by George Clooney, who was wooden and whose role was poorly written. The first act is magical, and spectacular. The discovery of the pin and the wonderful place it exposes is amazing. The visuals are captivating – and this is what appeared in the previews. The nostalgic and accurate-feeling 1964 World's Fair was beautifully rendered and Frank's youthful wonder (played sufficiently by Thomas Robinson) pours forth from the screen. And then the film goes haywire.For starters, the film's science is absurd, and the way they eventually get to Tomorrowland is even more absurd (no, it's not a bathtub, as hinted at in the TV ads, nor the devise that takes them to Paris, which could have simply beamed them to Tomorrowland!) Instead, we get numerous plot holes and absurdities that destroy even the internal logic of the film. Just a few of the mind-numbing number of unanswered questions and plot holes:For WHOM is the negative/realistic Frank Walker and the optimistic Casey recording the video in the opener? And why is he so negative? Clearly he can't be negative after the events of the film have unfolded, because everything seemingly worked out and new animatronic children are being sent out to revive Tomorrowland. But if it's filmed beforehand, why is he recording a video at all, and again, FOR WHOM? What has Tomorrowland ever done for the world? That seriously is never addressed. That's why I thought we were getting this movie. It never materialized. We learn instead that a rather bleak looking Tomorrowland now exists, and probably existed like that when Frank was expelled when he was a teenager (in the early 1970s?) So what has it ever done for humanity to warrant its existence?If, in 1964, a friendly robot device existed that could create bridges in the sky (and fix Frank's jet pack early in the film) why wasn't such a device sent to earth to repair and build roads and sky-bridges HERE? The sad answer lies in the same depressing conclusion: Tomorrowland has helped no one. Ever.Why have the robots kill ANYONE if the world was ending in a month or so, anyway? Didn't they get the memo?If Gov. Nix could have expelled Frank to a deserted island (where he would have died in a few years) using that transporter device, then why didn't he do that years ago, instead of putting him in a house and using the threat of killer robots to pacify him?Tomorrowland was clearly being built in the 1960s. So HOW and WHY was the Eifel Tower being constructed in the 1880s as an inter- dimensional ship? And WHERE was it going, exactly? This ship's very existence is completely illogical and seemingly exists only to insert a bit of cool-looking Steampunk into the film.If Nix could see the future, surely he could have seen his own demise, and Frank's return? The moment when Casey has the revelation, standing in front of the portal to the island, I thought INSTANTLY that this film would make a wonderful U-turn, giving Nix and Tomorrowland a chance to redeem themselves. If spreading gloom and doom about humanity's problems doesn't work (and we see it NOT WORKING all around us) why don't they simply change the message of what's being sent out to the earth? But ""destroy the array"" is the answer, leading to two deaths almost instantly. What a way to end the film on a downer, making the later 'new army' of robot recruiters a poor ""Plan B.""Finally, how did the 30-odd-day ""end of the world"" get fixed, by Casey wishing it away? By her positive energy? That's magic, not science. That someone has Midichlorians that can affect the universe is from another franchise, even if Disney DOES now own it.Overall, the film's second and third acts are a huge disappointment, marred by unnecessary violence and numerous absurdities. Which is a shame, since the film could have shown the world being positively affected by those working together in harmony to build a better future. THAT was Disney's vision, after all, not just one more stupid movie-themed ride at the parks' Tomorrowlands.",Tomorrowland
318,ahmad_hgh,A great movie!,9,26 September 2015,"I think this movie was fantastic. You should know what you are watching and who is the target audience and have the right mindset. For example if you are watching any of the Aliens you are looking for a bit of horror, thrill and some brutality; and if you are watching Avatar you are looking a hardcore mystery and thrill. I think Brad Bird did an amazing job for its target audience. When I watched it I was not expecting brutality, hardcore action or deep mystery, I was expecting good quality soft Sci-Fi. I think it did great to keep me extremely interested throughout the movie and the message of the film and its delivery was beautiful. Talking to and reading the reviews of those who didn't like it, I think they were expecting a Sci-Fi like Aliens, or Terminator which is like eating Coffee and Cookies for lunch! You'll not enjoy it because you have the wrong expectations! It's the problem of the consumer not the product.

319,coleman601-504-844864,I Don't Get the Bad Reviews At All,9,8 June 2015,"To my surprise the overall reception of Tomorrowland is quite mixed. This baffles my mind because I enjoyed this movie so much. I left the cinema with a big grin on my face.Many reviews and criticisms of this movie are so nitpicky and juvenile it makes me sick because there is so much good in this movie. The story is interesting and the ride it takes you on is just such a great adventure from beginning to end with brilliantly inventive set pieces and fantastical visuals. The world created is a great combination of sci-fi gold and retro space age awesome which is both familiar but also very refreshing in the midst of so many copy cat movies of other franchises. But what makes this movie so enjoyable is the cast. All members are a joy to watch with fantastic chemistry and a really humorous script for them to work with. But what also makes them great is the characters they play. Our new lead played by Britt Robertson is frankly delightful on screen. No more bland, empty shell protagonists that audience members can project onto, this character has a defined and upbeat personality which is a welcome change from all the teen angst brooding. George Clooney is great as ever, but playing more of a disgruntled older man works surprisingly well for him. Hugh Laurie is also great but then again he always is but I want to talk about a real new comer by the name of Raffey Cassidy. When I saw a little girl character getting more screen time I was a little nervous because the quality of usual child actors but wow was I wrong. Cassidy is amazing in her role, evoking charisma and a strong presence to her part. I really hope to see her go far.The decisive element for reviewers seems to be the movie's message. Many many people have mistaken it for a simple environmental message but there's more to it than that. This movie encourages viewers to do something many people today have forgotten how to do - BE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE. Time and time again we've seen apocalypse after apocalypse whether it be zombie or nukes. This film gives us a sense of fun and tells us that we should be hopeful of a brighter future. Sure there's challenges but this movie says, ""We can overcome those challenges"". That's the true moral of this film - ""be positive"" not ""buy a recycling bin"" although that is also a good idea. I suppose because one character uttered the words ""global warming"" everyone just made up their minds without listening to the rest of the sentence. Tomorrowland is inventive, funny, thrilling, with great characters and actors to play them and a truly relevant message behind it.GO SEE IT",Tomorrowland

Special mention of Raffey Cassidy who played Athena and of course Britt Robertson who played Casey.Direction and special effects were great but something was lacking the in the writing. There was no 3D but it wouldn't have added much. You got the moral but had it preached to you: A better written film and it would have been crystal clear and you could have had a better ending. In short, it's a great idea and technically very good but as a complete story it could have been so much better.I'd say wait to rent the video.",Tomorrowland
321,AGfox16,A boring movie with no story,2,19 October 2015,"First of all, the action and ooh-aah scenes seen in the trailer are the only of their kind in the movie, just included so the trailer would look nice, thus drawing people in.Casey (Britt Robertson) is the protagonist. She was chosen by Athena because she was a ""dreamer"". In my opinion she is an annoying, spoiled, brat. It made no sense that she snuck out of the house at least three times to cause problems at a NASA launch platform just so her dad could keep his job a bit longer, before she needed to sneak out again to disturb the project. Is risking jail time and prosecution by DHS not enough to deter you from committing such offenses? In Casey's mind, no. Which brings me back to, why was she so much better than everyone else (other than because she asked her teacher how the world's problems could be fixed).Frank (George Clooney) is just a grumpy old man for about all of the film, and his relationship with the non-aging child-robot Athena (Raffey Cassidy) (Who Frank met when he was around 9 years old, which is around how old she has always appeared to be) is just strange.The story is just confusing, talking about the apocalypse that may be coming because of a machine that's creating a self-fulfilling prophecy and how they can prevent it. And the reason for Casey being brought to Tomorrowland (besides the ""she can fix it"" non- explanation) is not said until two thirds of the way through.Please, don't waste your time and money, skip seeing Tomorrowland.",Tomorrowland

Well, not any more.I must admit the move was aesthetically pleasing due to it's huge budget; but that's about it. There was nothing new that we all haven't seem in other movies.My biggest criticism is that nothing happened in this 2hr movie. We just have 3 characters jumping around between dimensions and time, all the while not accomplishing anything except conveying a continued sense of hope... I guess.The casting was odd as well. Do you think Walt(who wouldn't let Annette wear a bikini) would approve of a leading woman who's previous movie was about a disturbed underage girl who has sex(full nudity) with older men?

325,lindsncal,The planet is in enormous danger..,9,17 December 2018,"I was blown away by this movie and was incredibly impressed by those who made it.
The planet is in enormous danger and this is one of a few movies that warns us of what will happen if we don't pay attention.. Others were 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' (original version) and ""How it Ends'.
I haven't seen it but 'Mother' did the same thing but most didn't understand what it was about. It was an entire metaphor.
'Tomorrowland' did it in an entertaining way with characters we liked but the message wasn't realized until the very end. When some say they didn't like the end, it's because it was so simple, just like the end of ""How it Ends'.....we didn't listen and it's now too late.
It's difficult to make a movie that entertains everybody but is actually a warning of what's to come. This movie and the ones listed above did good jobs of doing that. However, most people still aren't getting it.",Tomorrowland
326,Zeta-One,"There was so much potential, but Disney failed to execute it.",3,24 May 2015,"This review may contain spoilers.Frankly speaking, I'm disappointed with Tomorrowland.I watched this movie due to the fact that I recently went to Disneyland's Tomorrowland, and the cast itself. The trailer portrayed a world where nothing was impossible, and the beauty of the place was stunning. There was also over-the-top action, with brilliant effects.Thinking that the movie will be the same, I walked into the theater with high expectations, believing that it would be an amazing movie, which might be on par with Avengers: Age of Ultron.It was not.It had its good moments, but it had a lot of cons.Let's start with the pros- First off, the movie's effects were brilliant. You could really see the beauty of Tomorrowland, and how it was a place where the world's smartest minds could meet up and do everything they can think of. It was a brilliant idea.Another idea that was simply amazing was the fact that there was a rocket that could come out from the Eiffel Tower, which I thought was amazing. The effects were good, and I was really captivated by the scene.Lastly, the acting was OK, some of the actors made the scenes believable, primarily Raffey Cassidy as Athena.Now to the cons- The movie felt very...hollow. It had holes in its plot, and the whole idea of the film was not exactly developed well. The film's villain, Nix, didn't appeal to me as a very menacing and dangerous villain, instead, he felt like he was just there to create a monitor and tell the world that it will die.Next, the action in this movie wasn't what I imagined it'd be. Judging from the trailer, I was expecting a futuristic action film by Disney, but that wasn't the case. All the film used was guns that were OP, and self-destructing ""robots"".The story wasn't the best either. Like the name suggests, Tomorrowland appears in the film for a short scene with young Frank Walker and Athena. Then, for about 80% of the rest of the film, Tomorrowland was no where to be seen, only in small glimpses when Casey touches the pin. After Athena, Casey, and Frank actually go to Tomorrowland, we no longer get to see the beauty of it, and instead see a world that is practically destroyed and abandoned. The ending was primarily interesting either, with Athena's ""death"" or ""self-destruction"", which lead to Frank and Casey destroying Nix's monitor and saving the world. There wasn't any action there, besides the explosion Athena makes, and the bomb used to close the door, leaving Nix and Frank out on Earth. Nix was practically useless, after a pillar dropped on him. All he did was create a monitor and shoot Athena, which would lead to her self-destructing and saving the world.When the movie ended, I sat there for a while through the credits feeling quite disappointed, mostly because of the high expectations I had for it. I actually felt as though there was something missing. Tomorrowland had a lot of potential, but it failed to execute it. The effects were good, and the acting was OK. The villain, as I said before, wasn't exactly menacing, but I suppose it works for a PG movie.In the end? This movie is great for families with kids that are 7+. However, despite that and the stunning visual effects, it is a movie you can definitely pass on.",Tomorrowland
327,MrHomerJay,Great build up to a disappointing climax.,5,20 May 2015,"The movie starts out slow establishing our protagonists and supporting characters. Before too long the adventure begins, following our protagonist as she discovers Tomorrowland and the amazing events on earth as was shown in the trailers. This is the best part of the movie. The effects are well done, the acting is good and there are good comedic moments that made me laugh. The best part is the mystery build up. Things aren't spoon fed to you, you are just thrown into this fantasy world and it fills you with eagerness to discover what's actually going on.Unfortunately this is where it all falls apart. The movie fails to explain much of the mysteries it raises in the build up. What is Tomorrowland, its relationship to our world, the motivation for interacting with us, how their technology works, who are the people of Tomorrowland etc. none of these questions are addressed. But what really killed it for me was the lack of any motivation for our antagonist. An under developed character to begin with he offers a 10 second nonsensical speech for a motive that can be summarized as ""humans bad"".A good analogy for this is the series Lost. Imagine if Lost never explained any of the mysterious events happening on the island. The reason for these specific characters to be there, the relationships between them past and future, and no motivation for the antagonists. That is Tomorrowland in a nutshell.",Tomorrowland
328,lbk99-geo,"A fun movie that is sort of ""anti-dystopian""",9,31 December 2015,"Dystopian movies that predict or are set in a future that is dangerous and bleak, filled with hopelessness are common. Blade Runner, the Mad Max, and Terminator movies are all good examples, some well done, and enjoyed by many, including at times myself. Tomorrowland stands in marked contrast to these movies, with the prospect of the destruction of civilization very present in the movie, yet approached quite differently.The movie starts with a narration by Frank Walker (George Clooney) and Casey Newton (Britt Robertson). A long flashback sequence involves a young Frank Walker at the 1964 Worlds Fair in Queens, NYC, in which he tries to get a prize for inventing an ""almost working"" jet pack. The judge, David Nix (later known as Governor Nix, played by Hugh Laurie), is dismissal of Frank. However, a young associate of Nix named Athena (Raffey Cassidy) meets with Frank, and gives him a ""Tomorrowland"" pin, and tells him to follow her and Nix into the ""It's a Small World"" ride. The ride ends up transporting all of them to another dimension where the futuristic city of Tomorrowland exists.The above sequence ends with little details on the fate of Frank, and picks up shortly thereafter in the present with a teen-aged Casey Newton covertly entering a NASA launch area to sabotage cranes that were going to tear it down the next day. The next day her father, Eddie Newton (Tim McGraw), a NASA engineer, remarks that he heard of the cranes malfunctioning, but new ones are due to be flown in, and that following the launch area's destruction he will lose his job. In high school that day each of Casey's classes involve teachers predicting the doom for our civilization for various reasons, with Casey objecting that they should instead focus on finding a way to avoid that fate. That night she attempts to sabotage the cranes again, is caught, and also ends up being given a ""Tomorrowland"" pin, which gives her a stunningly realistic view of Tomorrowland.The rest of the movie follows Casey as she seeks to discover what Tomorrowland is and how to get there, meets both Athena and Frank (who is now middle aged), and faces dangerous adversaries. It involves some really nicely done action sequences, human form robots (as you can see in the trailer of the movie), and a fair amount of humor. There is a strong dose of optimism, largely voiced by Casey, that the world can be changed for the better, regardless of how hopeless things appear.All of the actors playing the main characters, Clooney, Robertson, Cassidy, and Laurie, do a good job with their roles. However, the standout is Raffey Cassidy, a teen-aged actor who does an amazing job of bringing the unusual character of Athena to life with a mix of smooth humor and at times pathos that is nicely done. Some have criticized the evident ""crush"" that an older Frank Walker has on this young character, but in the context of the movie (this is science fiction after all), it really does make sense, and the relationship itself is as platonic and chaste as you want.Some critics have said that this movie has pacing issues and while filled with great ideas does not follow through as well as it could. In contrast I found the pacing was generally not bad at all, with the excitement of the story giving a nice sense of movement as the story unfolds. In fact one or two of the extended scenes, available on the Blu-ray release, could have likely been left in without harming the pace. My one criticism in this area is the part of the movie following the climax, which perhaps could have been handled better.For parents who might be concerned about their children watching this movie, I can say that I watched it with my 12 year old daughter and had no issues with it. Younger children however could potentially be frightened by some occasional violence that while bloodless might still be upsetting to the very young. I do not recall any foul language or humor, and there is no nudity or sexual content at all, as expected with a Disney movie of this type.Overall I found this a fun and satisfying movie to watch, and expect to come back to it often in the future!",Tomorrowland

As dystopia as ""1984"" with its Socialism message was, ""Tomorrowland"" is full of optimism and promise of a near Utopian Capitalism future.

That basically is what this film is about in a nutshell, its made to inspire hope from the creative among us who are not living our potential due largely to the multitude of negativity, conflict and selfishness the human race seem to have become comfortable in wallowing in.If this film had been released 20 years ago, I might have never given up my previous profession of drawing comics for a living.

But this is fantasy, sci-fi and action at its best. It reminds me a lot of old 80s adventure films like Daryl, Flight of the Navigator, War Games etc. but more complex, modern effects and a wonderful cast.I hope this deserves a cult following or becomes a lesser known rare gem.

335,arrfan30,'Tomorrowland' should've been 'Yesterland',6,27 September 2015,"This film is about a parallel existence of earth which comprises of Intelligent people and their inventions. Recently, I saw this film named ""Coherence"" which dealt with the existence of Parallel universe and it took me by storm. This film did exactly the opposite. Disney does not concentrate on making quality films but it just pins its hope on entertaining. This film does exactly that. This film is just another entertainer with all the usual Sci-Fi elements and fancy gadgets, plainly this film has NOTHING which you haven't already seen. Brad Bird had done great work in entertainment before with films such as Ghost Protocol and The Incredibles but doesn't live up to their standards in this film. I was shocked to see George Clooney cast in this film whose role could've been done by any upcoming actor, I mean ""Clooney !!!!! But Why !!!"". The film does not kick off well and it immensely fails to keep the viewers hooked up till the end. This could've been easily under looked by almost everybody if not for Clooney,Disney and Brad Bird.The imagination of the writers can be appreciated for they have done a decent job and Disney spares no expense at the visual effects, it looks all right in all aspects. The Anti-Robots from Tomorrowland were definitely lame but if the film was projected as something that was made for kids then the Anti-Robots could have got its credits, guess this film is too childish for grown ups. Or I think so. Hugh Laurie does not give us an extraordinary acting but sticks to his usual light acting and it goes by. I, an amateur reviewer , am giving a rating of 6 because of the lack of something new in this film but this does entertain people who just wants to catch another fantasy movie. Well, at least it partially entertained me. There's that.",Tomorrowland
336,joshuaiyer,An experience worth giving a try.,7,28 June 2015,"I was a little late in seeing this film, but it's been one I wanted to see since I saw the trailer for it, and seeing it was a lot of fun. Based on the Disney theme park ride, but adding a unique backstory for it, the film opened with a really intense opening that reminded me a lot of Hugo, with a really nice-looking visual with Frank Walker's jet pack sequence. After that (with the opening commentary by the two main characters), we open into Casey Newton's ""science- geek"" life, with a little too much exposition for my taste. When she finally finds the pin, she makes her way to a comic book store and some action truly finally begins and we begin meeting Athena, a young girl who Frank met and who gave Casey the pin, and the older Frank Walker, played by George Clooney, who did a great job in this film. Raffey Cassidy, who played Athena, and who had multiple screen tests in both London and the US, really stole the show for the majority of her scenes. Not only her various stunts with fighting the robots, but also her acting much more grown-up than she is for basically the whole film (and even the touching scene at the end of the film) made me forget during it that she's a kid actress, which was really cool. Eventually we meet the robots who chase Casey as Athena takes her to Frank's house, and with some persuading (and a really cool and creative use of the Eiffel Tower as a secret entrance with reference to Mr. Thomas Edison), they make it to the future, but it's not as it should be because people don't believe in it. The ""leader"" of the evil band of robots, I guess you could say, gave a speech about how we need to make more of the future, which was well-written, I think, and that would be a scene I think I could watch again in the future to give me inspiration I needed to tell me I have to keep going forward on whatever work I'm doing, because the future doesn't just happen, and if I just put things off the future will also be put off, for example. (Brad Bird even said, on the scenes where shooting was difficult because of special effects or stunts, that those days are temporary, and the films live forever.) Overall, I really did like the story. I enjoyed the build-up, and how there was lots of adventure from Casey's journey to the comic store leading up to them finding the entrance to the future and everything, but they overcompensated the build-up. There were supposedly 57(ish) days to the world's end, and they just solved the problem within two minutes (yes, it was a touching scene, but still), and that felt very anticlimactic to me. If Casey had found the pin maybe twenty minutes before, they would have more room to add a little bit more of an epic final battle with the robots, and maybe they could explore the ruins of the land a bit more or something. But I did love the very end of the film, when it showed all the creative people in the world getting pins to help build things without the distraction of economy or politics. (So I could head there with the pin I have and just compose music without any distractions! Excellent!)Speaking of music (and you know how all of my reviews must have some reference to music!), Michael Giacchino (who did things like Up, Ratatouille, and the more recent Star Trek films) did the score for this one. I wasn't completely paying attention to the score the whole time, but there were plenty of cues I recognized and enjoyed. The main theme for Tomorrowland had some cool high piano stuff, coupled by majestic brass. Once I noticed a unique string- writing with high glissandos when Casey was sneaking into Frank's house at one point (I think). Giacchino said that he usually starts from the beginning and composes to the end of the film, so he can develop the score better that way. And it really does a great job of following the movie, with the action scenes having quite intense orchestration with large brass hits at the necessary points, and a very majestic return of the main theme ending the film, showing it's now up to us to build our future as it blacks to the credits. It's a score with unique harmonic progression which I like, and is one I think I could enjoy listening to as background music and really picking apart during a second or third watch of the film.Overall, I enjoyed my experience with this movie. There was plenty of comedy to create that family-friendly Disney feel, and plenty of adventure, which I really like, in store for Casey and the others. I didn't really like the climax of the film, but otherwise I think the messages in the movie were fine and will hopefully be inspiring to anyone watching it. As it's probably out of theatres (soon) by now, I would recommend anyone getting it on DVD and giving it a go.",Tomorrowland
337,jandsm5321,"Had potential, but ended up disappointing.",6,24 January 2018,"The trailers looked cool... but it turned out a very different story. I was expecting a cool sci-fi adventure of amazing innovation, etc. Instead it felt to me like just propaganda, promoting Disney and preaching their opinions.The main character felt shallow, claimed to be smart but sure didn't act smart. It was disappointing how often they had her just acting in dumb slapstick comedy styles. She seemed to just act on how she felt in a very impulsive manner rather than actually reasoning, in standard Disney hypocrisy, claiming to be empowering girls but still belittling them in how they cast them.They entire time they're pushing how terrible and mindless humanity is, and how we're going to destroy ourselves so nothing matters anyway. I can't call a movie hopeful or uplifting when it spends the entire time being negative then has a brief positive message at the end.Also, how is taking all the most innovative citizens to live in a different world going to help save Earth? Doesn't the world kind of need those people to help it rather than just sending them to live in a mini-utopia if they're privileged enough?The last straw for me was the the 50 year old guy being in love with a 10 year old girl... but shes a robot so it's okay...?

Once the main character goes to a different land from touching the pin (as shown in the trailer) it got me hooked to keep watching it. That was about the peak of the film and goes flat and falls down from there. The ending was very weak and left me wondering if they had set it up to be a sequel which they didn't and didn't have plans to.

It's truly a shame that the efforts of countless little people were wasted on such a poor movie.

I was deeply impressed with the 60's recreation of the world's fair- was it going to be a 'gritty' or a 'family fun' movie? I suspected and feared the latter after the cringe-worthy opening scenes where Clooney jousts with a woman about his reminiscences of the past and I could see that this was going to be more 'Goonies' than anything else. Lots of strange inconsistencies like the very convincing girl android who is hard to tell being artificial yet the 'ever toothy grinning' robot pursuers are obviously not human yet apparently likely much newer models given 'she' has apparently been around for decades. Visuals are top notch if more than a little silly at times but the film totally abandons all sense of proportion and semi-reality when the Eifel tower splits in two and launches a rocket. I'm still a little confused about the whole plot and where 'Tomorrowland' actually is (5th dimension?!?). With a bit of cleaning up and 'desillyfiying' this could have been a rollicking great movie but instead we get a visual confusion which leaves you thinking 'What?????'

345,Shortreviews,Totally misunderstood,9,26 September 2015,"I can't believe the bad reviews. I also can't believe that nobody understood what they accomplished with this film. It's Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged! They managed to take that book and bring it up to date while making it accessible to all ages. That is a fantastic feat in and of itself. To also make it really entertaining is extraordinary. Cerebral and action packed, it holds the attention of the young right to the end. And the end? The film was the pin that showed the audience what could be if only we don't give up and just make things better. Atlas Shrugged and then asked for help. Everybody should see this film. Now. Oh, ignore the comments about continuity. Does it really matter? Artistic licence anyone?

346,alfapagal,Childish and ill conceived,4,17 September 2021,"The movie had some nice visuals and a good sci-fi fantasy setup to be a good fit for all age groups. However I got the feeling that the movie was focusing solely on the teen age group. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it could have been done so much better.One observation was that of the main character being special by virtue of just being herself and not because of some character growth that we could observe left us wanting for more depth. Her character was overall unlikeable because of her selfish behaviours often reinforced by her actions which made it difficult for us to root for her.The movie also turned out to be very preachy and patronising by the end as it solved all of the major problems in the world by optimism and positive thinking. Which is again a very over simplistic notion but it is portrayed as something profound.Overall the movie was good in some parts but mostly shallow and ill conceived.",Tomorrowland

But not the first incarnation of the timeless tale of time travel: If we could go back...or forward, would we be able to change the inevitable? By and all this is ""Stargate"" on steroids.Not wanting to provide any spoilers, this is certainly destined to be an epic by virtue of its technology and a brilliant director. It also features solid performances by a seasoned cast and crew.A big surprise was the young ""Athena"" who is destined for greater things to come.My only note of mild disappointment is that I am a great fan of Britt Robertson and have been waiting for a breakout role for her to be portrayed as an adult, which she is. References to her in this film a ""the kid"" will not move her out of the realm of teenager portrayals.All that said I hope you enjoy this epic ride as I did.",Tomorrowland
348,white-37,The Fall of a Giant...,3,23 May 2015,"Let me explain something real fast...The Iron Giant props is tops. Hands up... cause there's laser gun action; the best thing in the movie is the very unsubtle, very overdone shout-out to a movie that's meant so much to so many people. Myself included.But... there's something wrong here. See, I used to look for clues to what the fate of The Iron Giant might have been had there been a sequel, of who remembers the movie, etc. But, the thing that this movie taught me is this: Holding onto something for so long, long after you've learned what you must, is detrimental.It's detrimental to us, it's detrimental to Mr. Clooney, Laurie and Bird's career.I take this as a sign that maybe it's time to turn our attentions back to animation. Instead of expending his remaining time and energy on Live Action, it *may* be time to go back to a movie that is more open to a sequel.Tomorrowland is a brave movie, brave not just in message but in the idea of originality. However, a darker, more taut script would have benefited this movie greatly. I'm sure Mr. Bird's intentions and heart were in the right place, but I'm also sure the 50 percent on RT isn't because people wanted to see this movie fail.New ideas and believing in yourself is never a bad thing.But The Fall of a Giant may be what we're witnessing.",Tomorrowland
349,sheldonchorta,Why do people hate this movie?,7,3 July 2015,"Don't listen to the haters giving this movie ones and twos, because this movie is phenomenal! This was my favorite Disney movie before Inside Out came out (then it became my number two favorite). The characters are nice and fun with just enough screen time and character development to make them likable. The story: Brad Bird's GREATEST PREMISE since a Superhero family! The world is going to end because someone has implanted that idea into everyone's heads. So it is up to a girl with a great imagination and determination to save it. But the twist is the bad guy in this movie isn't George Clooney for making the device, or the Audio-Animatronic girl, or even Hugh Laurie. It's US. Because we didn't know any better, we didn't try to fight the idea of the end of the world. So, in a way, WE are the reason that this movie exists. I guess the only reason people hate on this movie is because of the continuity errors and the fact that they are the bad guys. Speaking of, this movie does have it's faults, but who cares when you have a great story and characters AND amazing special effects. And, yeah, the effects in this movie are beyond amazing. When I saw Tomorrowland for the first time, and the rocket in the Eiffel Tower, I was blown away! I saw the trailers and the effects made me gravitate towards this movie! And the trailer is probably another reason why people don't like this movie. The trailer made it look like an early preview for Star Wars 7. I was also expecting that, but when I saw the actual movie, the trailer didn't matter. So what if you didn't get a dumb action sci-Fi flick. You have a new original idea acted well, directed well, written well, and made at the right time that this movie should have been a hit!

351,wpedmonson,"You'll feel cheated, much like you would if you thought optimism will solve the world's problems.",5,21 May 2015,"Global warming! Political unrest! Corruption! Despair! Sadness! These are the ailments of the story of Tomorrowland, and the proposed solutions to them are as heavy-handed as they appear above. The story is about a teenage girl, Casey (Britt Robertson), who holds herself to be fearless, ambitious, and incredibly bright. She is one of the few optimists left in a world (much like ours today) that is wallowing in despair over dystopian nightmares being realized and where the melting of the ice caps is both figurative and literal. And what's worse, she's the only one to think that there is a solution to all the world's ailments. She is ""recruited"" by a young girl from Tomorrowland, who shows her a glimpse of an alternate dimension where the best and brightest of the world gather and build a utopian society, or so they think. The problem is that they stopped recruiting when they saw that the world will end using technology they created that could predict the future, or at least see one version of it. In other words, they've given up hope in fixing our world. Frank (George Clooney) was one of their citizens that spoke out against this policy and was banished. He is put together with Casey and they travel to Tomorrowland to stop the world from ending in a matter of months, told by Frank's homemade doomsday clock. Tomorrowland is a movie that runs on nostalgia and underlying it is a bankrupt moral philosophy on solving the world's problems. Imagine the philosophy underlying TED talks (technology, engineering, and design will solve the world's problems) making a movie for children to watch and be inspired to adopt their meta solution to the world's ailments. The solution is that we don't have enough ""dreamers"" working together building innovative and well-designed inventions. People don't believe they're special enough, and they give in to their sadness and don't believe in themselves. What's painfully missing from Tomorrowland is any conscience. Even tonight before I saw the movie I had a conversation with a friend over ""Jurassic World"" coming out this summer and my fears on what they might do to the story. In the worst case, they make the movie about dinosaurs. In the best case, they carry the theme of the relationship of science and morality that upheld the first movie so well and showed the terror that innovation without a conscience (that word even means ""with science"" though I know it wasn't coined with that in mind per se) brings. The only vices in our world, according to Tomorrowland, is being uninventive and a pessimist. Ironically, the movie revels in cliché after cliché, hoping we'll be wowed by the mediocre spectacles that are references to older future-chic tropes. The theme that runs throughout the movie and eventually shows its own superficiality and impotence is the value of raw optimism. I'll contrast this to the virtue of grit which is the far more superior trait to hold. Optimism is simply being positive where grit is more akin to courage. One is a formation of outlook, the other is drive. Certainly Casey is optimistic, but where the movie gets it wrong is saying that's all we need. Also there's the assumption that raw talent is what we have as the resource to tap for solving the world's problem. And with this view it shows that there are the gifted dreamers, then there's everyone else. Where the movie is misleading is in how it tells young viewers that believing in yourself and being special is all you need to solve these age-old problems the world is fraught with. Our time is terrible and we need optimists. What Casey never does in the movie, and what any inventor or great thinker will tell you about genius is that it takes a lot of work. They fail. They fail a lot, and they get up and they edit their work. They learn from their mistakes and they build a better invention next time. They learn when to scrap a project, and when to stick with it. Learning that virtue will serve our young people better than mere optimism. Certainly optimism is a part of it, though it's only one facet to a complex set of character traits. The problem is that Casey never fails in the movie. If anything she waltzes into every situation and seems to know more than everyone else, and she never has to work at anything. You never seen any of her inventions (though she does have a cool security camera disrupting drone she uses), you never see her take a crack at something and it not work. She just bulldozes into situations with overconfidence that smacks of arrogance and somehow the inept adults in the story never thought of incredibly obvious solutions to problems in the story. In the end, Tomorrowland falls too short to be called anything worth watching. The story has too many uninteresting characters with a plot that doesn't pick up and when it finally does you ask yourself, ""Is that it?"" You'll feel cheated, much like you would if you thought optimism will solve the world's problems.",Tomorrowland

It brings about many emotions and ideas, that are somehow always on the surface, but not enough recognized. It is an eye opener so to say. I highly recommend the movie, not only for the enjoyment of watching it but for the message it sends out. My 7.5yr old son enjoyed this movie, for a different reason than I did, but goes to show u, it is a movie for both children and adults alike.

353,digiscript34,"Unique, Fascinating and Wild",5,30 May 2015,"If you're in the mood for Sci-Fi fare and what to see something out of the ordinary and unique this movie might be for you.However some of the scenes in this film might be rather frightening or intense for younger children, despite the Disney name and the familiar and popular Tomorrowland name, commemorative of the famous themed lands of the Disneyland and Walt Disney World Magic Kingdom parks, so concerned parents should be forewarned when deciding whether this time of film would be right for their younger children to see.The imagery and action in this film is indeed amazing and first-time viewers are likely to be in awe of the imaginative spectacle of the Future scenes in this movie. Tomorrowland plays out very surreal and dreamlike.Despite that, I found that the plot and dialogue was at many times off- kilter and even some of it didn't make sense but again, Tomorrowland is a Fantasy film with a Sci-Fi theming. Anything can happen in the movies but these days people want more realistic and logical.Although the plot is pretty wild, I found that the acting is outstanding and I'm willing to speculate that the actors had quite a time dealing with certain areas of the script so that they would be able to give the director what he wanted for the takes in each scene.Because of the above I give Tomorrowland a 5-out-of-10 rating. A must-see for Sci-Fi fans and mature moviegoers who would like to experience something very unique and unusual, coming from Disney. I do not recommend this movie for younger moviegoers because of some rather disturbing and very violent scenes within this film.",Tomorrowland
354,lsterk,Worst big budget movie ever - skip it and btw its not for young kids,3,18 June 2015,"Proof that sometimes the money has to override the director's ego and get some real writers involved.

I agree with so many other reviewers that the violence towards characters human or not should not be shown to children.I'll just cite one bit of writing nonsense. There is a ""bomb"" that causes time to pause within its blast radius. But wears off at a rate slow enough for a character to extract her hand and jump out of the way before wave energy blast hits her.It's winding down at theaters and let it just disappear. If I could shoot the movie through its heart with a Tomorrowland ray gun I would.Don't go to it at a discount theater, don't rent from a box machine, don't pay for a cable viewing, don't buy the DVD even from a discount bin, and, most importantly, write a letter to your library objecting ahead of time in case it would buy a DVD or two.",Tomorrowland

There are many wonderful themes that are explored by this movie, but the movie didn't quite expand on them enough in my opinion. There are decent performances from Clooney, Laurie, and Robertson, and there are some funny on screen moments with them. Their overall chemistry just added to the fun displayed on screen. I feel one of the biggest weaknesses, is that the movie wasn't fully developed within its 2 hour timeline. Another problem is that the villain had weak character development and motivations.

It starts out in rip roaring fashion, with our hero (genre veteran George Cloonney) watching an out of control man rip the bodice from a struggling girl from an alternate dimension called Tomorrowland. Incensed by this brutality and no doubt offended by the film's one and only true PG- 13 scene, she rams her fist through a brick wall and kills the man with mannikin magic!. Enter the film's male hero, a reclusive inventor and a relentlessly curious teen, who scolds his sister for opening the portal on this deadly and forbidden realm. The story then commences in earnest, as these clowns end up protecting a poor orphan girl who has a valuable future object that a nefarious criminal syndicate is desperate to obtain. Much mayhem ensues, though the film remains chaste and relatively bloodless after its promising beginning. Like most Disby cheapies, the film lifts musical cues from the studio's legendary past--most notably in this case, Disby Land itself ! Disby video also includes some rather unique features, including a copyright notice plastered across the opening 30 seconds of the feature, and a narrated copyright warning after the film is over!",Tomorrowland

It was the scene at Frank's house, which gave me the goonie bumps. Couldn't wait for tomorrow...Fast forward to today, seen the movie, let it cool down. The feeling now is quite the opposite. I was in for the adventure, not for the overbearing message. In short, it's the American dream packaged in a Disney vessel, ergo my summary.I tried to look beyond it, see the adventure, be 10 again and dream...The acting isn't great, a bit flat on character. Clooney tries, almost get's there. Britt Robertson is an adequate rebellious youth but sometimes irritating by being too good.Although 'Frank' gives a subtle remark regarding Edison's presence, just leave him out please. I know his mannequin is there, but stop crediting this man, stop using this false history, it reminds me of the adage 'history is written by the victors'... But I'm too old and cynical I guess. I probably will not be invited to Tomorrowland. Which could be a good thing, considering the other analogy you could make about being selected for the promised land.Grievances aside, there are good parts like the house scene, the Eiffel tower connection and Athena.I go to movies to be taken away to that other place, this one didn't take off, sadly.",Tomorrowland

Tomorrowland is like walking into EPCOT and Magic Kingdom. Some of the reviews have been harsh. This movie tells a story about hope and positive change, much like the messages of some of the Disney rides and attractions. The cast does a good job of carrying the story that takes some time to tell. There is enough action and one-liner laughs to entertain most 10+ year olds, not to mention a little Disney Magic. This movie won't be for everyone, but it is not a bad movie. If we didn't have a 17 and 14 year old, my wife and I would not have been in this theater.

360,jertrav33,Yesterdayland,2,2 June 2015,"How could Clooney have signed on for his role in Disney's Tomorrowland? What was he thinking? When he sees himself in this stinker, what does he see, how does he react? I can't believe he'd do anything but hold his nose. Where is the guy I loved in Up in the Air and Gravity? Instead, I see a grizzled old man who looks like he'd rather be in Yesterdayland than in this land of tomorrow. I checked the response to this movie on Rotten Tomatoes and was amazed—no, dumbfounded—to see that 49% of critics and 59% of viewers were positive. What are they seeing that I and the rest of my audience members didn't see? Here's what one reviewer, Ken Hanke, had to say: ""Tomorrowland—vaguely based on the Disney theme park attraction—is a mess. Structurally, it's a nightmare. Dramatically, it only occasionally comes to life. Technically, it's sometimes impressive and sometimes a thing of 1930s-level matte paintings and CGI that's so cartoonish it's hard to remember it isn't an animated film. Thematically, it's such a bizarre farrago of mismatched ""philosophies"" and ideas that it's hard to tell what it's supposed to be. I'd like to call it a ""noble failure,"" but I'm not at all sure that it's noble. I am sure, on the other hand, that so far as I'm concerned, it's certainly a failure."" I spoke with a number of my senior neighbors who saw it. A few walked out, a few thought about walking out, most suffered through to the end. I was one of the ""thought about"" walkers. I stayed to the end even though I dozed off in a few places. There were quite a few youngsters from five to ten there, not making a sound—not a chuckle of amusement, not a gasp of excitement. Just dead silence. I remember children's responses to The Wizard of Oz, my own in particular when I first saw it in 1939. It was a wonderful story with wonderful characters set in an imaginary wonderful place called Oz. When Casey (Brittany Robertson) first touches the token that zips her away from reality to this land of the future, she ends up in a yellow wheat field with a view of the futuristic spires of Tomorrowland in the distance, almost laughably similar to Dorothy's first view of the Emerald City. And now these children are seeing a confusing story with plenty of confusing flashbacks and location switches with far too many shootings and killings and blowups and ridiculous ninja fighting. Hugh Lawrie as David Nix made an able villain in a wicked-witch-of-the-north way. He was exactly the curmudgeon we got used to in House. Apparently the film's message was that we'd better do something about the state of the world now or we'll never realize the wonders of Tomorrowland. Casey asks the riddle: There are two wolves who are always fighting. One is darkness and despair. The other is light and hope. The question is: which wolf wins? The answer: The one you feed. There, children in the audience, what do you make of that? A confusing message for all ages. I'm an adult, an old adult, and I'm not sure what was intended. Sorry, Walt. Sorry, Brad Bird and your sorry directing and writing. Tomorrowland just doesn't cut it. And shame on you, George Clooney, for lowering yourself to this stinkbomb's level.",Tomorrowland
361,tsoderlu,Misunderstood,9,22 July 2015,"This movie is misunderstood, I'm writing my first review with the hope to increase understanding and appreciation of it. Lose your expectations and watch it as it is, an adventure. Think about the things you see, analyze them. Don't expect to be on the edge of your seat all the time from exciting action, it takes a back seat after the beginning.. which the trailer seems to mostly contain and make a false picture of the film. My opinion.. I try and keep this spoiler free.While perhaps expecting a little more awe scenes, action and insight into the ""tomorrowland"" society the movie has some very nice scenes. 2/3 into the film it somehow got a bit boring.. but it gets better. Could perhaps have been cut on a place or too, but the scenes were visually pleasing instead. A few confusing aspects here and there like the transition at the end, but who cares? No one has seemed to bother analyzing the philosophical aspects of pre-determination, alternate realities and concepts like our consciousness creating our reality as an reflection of our collective state of mind. The message is a fine one and something to think about our outlook on life.Does all the negativity really serve us? What's the content of news? Only negative stories. Do they encourage you to go out and make a difference or make you depressed and go on with business as usual it is all going to h*ll anyways? But it sells and is a money making mechanism.. It is a bit humorous the extent the level of fear the society in the movie are in and project unto the children and society, connections to our western society can be made too.If you notice these things you will appreciate the hints at secret societies and connections to the ""Club 33"" in Disneyland too and other goodies like the rivalry between Nikola Tesla and Edison. Nothing too profound or divulging from my understanding but it's there too, Tesla is an under appreciated figure in our history who deserves a lot more recognition.These are the things I brought with me from this movie, and I'm a sucker for scifi, which was what initially attracted me to the film, but it turned out to just be eye candy to boot :) not the main thing about the film.",Tomorrowland

I liked the opening flashback, the way the It's a Small World ride opened up to a portal to Tomorrowland, the way the pin was actually only a type of type of 'promo film' and didn't teleport you anywhere, the robot girl, the 'bad guy.' I liked the father and brother in the film. The trailer kind of makes the dad seem like a jerk but he's actually a cool engineer dude.

365,genslen,A hopeful vision of tomorrow,7,19 October 2018,"I went into this movie expecting to hate it. Based on what I'd heard, I was planning for a clunker with bad effects. I'm happy to say I was pleasantly surprised. The visuals are amazing, and the plot is hopeful and interesting, centered mostly around a negative ""self-fulfilling prophecy"" playing out in our reality. Without getting into spoilers, there's a good reason for our current obsessions with negativity and dystopia and apocalyptic zombie movies. We're being told the world is going to hell, and we're buying into it.I can understand some of the negative criticism. There are too many CGI robots, enough to make action scenes feel boring. A weird tonal shift happens early on, amping up the violence and throwing viewers for a loop. And many of the action scenes feel hurried and overworked. The ten-minute house invasion section was so rushed, a dozen nifty inventions are thrown at the viewer so quickly, they can't be appreciated. Plot holes and ""wait, what?"" moments abound, as they do in most big films nowadays. I hate being asked to not only suspend my disbelief but ignore things like physics. When a huge metal ball explodes over your head, you run away. When the film shows it crashing onto a platform where your character was standing, the viewer thinks: ""oh, my, is she dead?"" Of course not. She's fine, and it's not explained. People fall in water and are dry in the next moment. Humans are vaporized by mean robots and nobody cares or notices. It feels like a great fourth draft of a script that needed a little more polishing.Unfortunately, the movie feels 20% too preachy, hitting us over the head with dangers like global warming and obesity and famine. But it takes a hopeful view, assuming that, if we work together, we can solve these problems and others. It's a hopeful message, something akin to the 1950s and 60s when the world was recovering from a devastating world war and anything seemed possible and we were landing people on the moon and making strides on social issues like civil rights and the prevention of global conflicts. Clooney and the other actors are good, although the lead actress seemed a little overwhelmed, and you can't base a huge movie like this on essentially four characters. They needed more people and more character arcs to make it have an impact.But, in the end, this hopeful film asks us to believe that progress is a good thing, but only if that progress is in the service of good. This movie trades in a different message: hope, and hopefulness, and using our combined smarts to figure out solutions to problems. That's not something you hear a lot any more, and it was refreshing to see, especially in a big Hollywood blockbuster. It harkens back to that old Einstein saying, which is highlighted in once scene: ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" And that's not a bad thing.",Tomorrowland

I know I did and for that reason this film was fun to watch and was entertaining. However, I had to overlook a few things to make it so. One glaring issue to me was Britt Robertson. Her character reminded me of when I watched The 70's show on TV and anytime the actress playing Donna made an appearance, I would say to myself ""she not a high school student, she's a college girl"". And so, the same was for Britt. She does not look like a teenager in this at all even though she plays one. BUT, I was able to suspend my disbelief to get through a very good performance and a happy story. The other thing that played a role in all this is George Clooney who makes no secret of his political views. I enjoyed his performance a lot and I believe he was cast perfectly for this role BUT I was sure that there was a ""message"" that this movie had since he was in it. There it was toward the end of the film - the same bs we keep hearing from the Lamestream Media and the presstitutes they employ. Finally, as another reviewer pointed out, once again parents and adults are portrayed as less intelligent than teenagers. This is a continuing trend in entertainment that began a long time ago. It has become so prevalent that one can easily overlook that fact when watching product made in Hollywood. Aside from these observations, the movie was paced well, had some great special effects, catered to my childhood dream of a fantastic world that was possible and did not have gratuitous sex or violence.",Tomorrowland

This movie had some pretty good action fight scenes about 3/4 way into the film as the our young protagonist, Casey, tries to investigate the mysterious pin and the futuristic Bladerunner city she encounters.But near the end it becomes preachy about the environment, global warming, and nuclear holocaust as I predicted from liberal director Brad Bird. Then we see a ""I like to buy the world a coke"" moment in the end which I thought was pretty lame. This is probably what other people who watched the film are probably complaining about. Not because you need to have some kind of high intelligence to understand this film.In the end it's a pretty good original sci-fi action film to take your date to watch. It is indeed an original sci-fi film. But I didn't think it was a thought provoking sci-fi film that I got from other great original sci-fi films such as The Matrix, Prometheus, Total Recall, Blade Runner, Tron, Alien 1979 film, and Aliens 1986 sequel.",Tomorrowland
368,tywoolworth,Brilliant and Imaginative!,10,28 May 2015,"Inspiring and full of wonder. This is not for people who like to have their movies explained in monologues, or for movie watchers who want to see destruction, bleak imaginings, or pessimistic scenarios (such as every futuristic and post-apocalyptic movie out there). If you are comparing this to Mad Max, then you have completely misses the point of the movie... I saw Ex Machina the other day, which although was a brilliant movie until the final act, played on my (completely human) sense of doom and gloom. I am finding this overdone story formula to be getting quite tired. I am a big fan of science fiction, but find them more and more trying to be intellectual by pandering to the audience's fear of the unknown,rather than wonder of the unknown. They constantly devolve into a fight for survival against the machines, bombs, aliens, etc that are really only out to get them. I absolutely loved Athena's character in the movie, as it was full of hope and possibilities rather than most movie versions of that type of technology. Brad Bird has done it again, the movie filled me with child-like wonder, and got to me imagine fantastic possibilities. As another poster pointed out, if you didn't ""get"" this movie, or found it boring, no worries - but this movie was clearly not for you. Please be content watching your bleak sci-fi movies. Maybe I'm an old-school millennial, but this movie brought back everything I used to love about movies growing up, the ones that got my imagination going with the sense that anything was possible.I would definitely recommend this movie, but please go see it with an open mind.",Tomorrowland

Somewhat entertaining.,5,14 November 2015,"It is one of the many TV shows and films that look like a preparation for a future with an omnipresent Artificial Intelligence. Propagandist messaging is otherwise mild, tolerable. Interactions with robots were somewhat unhealthy, with elements of brainwashing. On line, we already interact with robots a lot, without knowing it. For many, robots are the only type of interaction in the future. Therefore, be cautious about it, on line, and in the real world.The film is somewhat entertaining. There are well done action scenes. The movie is a bit too long.

Whilst projecting it I also got to see the film and was surprised as to how similar the film is to Spy Kids. I actually thought when watching it did Robert Rodriguez have something to do with this, but thought it's strange as this is a Disney movie, and Robert Rodriguez does Spy Kids under the Troublemaker Studios brands.As I can see from the credits it certainly doesn't have anything to do with Robert Rodriguez, but I'm quite sure if you enjoy any of the Spy Kids films this will be right up your street. It does have a number of differences that make it different from Spy Kids, but it certainly does incorporate much of the tech and I could have sworn two of the main kids in the film look so similar to Carmen and Juni Cortez too even though they are different actors.",Tomorrowland

We could all do with a little more hope...For me this movie was fun and carried a poignant message, about doing something with our future. It is very easy to sit back, be cynical and do nothing. We are told that the future is going to be awful for all of us, global warming, over population etc... Back in the 50s and 60s the message was different, why has the message changed? Back then it was known about over population and the need for change. Do we need to believe the message that we are told, if we don't agree why can't we do something to change it? Maybe this would have an positive effect on the numbers of people today having to take anti-depressants. Any way enough of that, glad to get that off my chest... :-) The movie doesn't take itself seriously. I particularly liked that the use of the word ""bollocks"" towards the end, very unDisney like. There are some great effects, although they didn't go overboard. I liked the cameo appearances (teachers preaching disaster) by the two actors who played scientists in Stargate Atlantis. Also Kathryn Hahn as the one of the owners of the Scifi store.I particularly liked the conversation between Casey and her father: Casey Newton: There are two wolves who are always fighting. One is darkness and despair. The other is light and hope. The question is... which wolf wins? Eddie Newton: The one you feed.Spoiler alert! We're feeding the wrong one...So that was my 2 cents...",Tomorrowland

Written By Older people who watch maybe 1 or 2 movies a month they complained about the Improbability and Unlikelyhood of many things that you will see in this movie. But in the end - I guess that is what really makes it a - FANTASY am I right ;) ... The 2nd reason for the bad reviews was because they saw the trailer for this movie and decided to go and watch it in the cinema. Now, because they paid to watch it, they expected way too much of it , and in the end got disappointed. Anyway, watching this movie was great fun for me and I hope that I will see more movies like this one. I just love this genre. Unlike those people who wrote the bad reviews I am someone who watches Lots and Lots of movies and series and I can tell when a movie is worth to watch or not and this one IS... I didn't pay to watch it so I wasn't disappointed at all and I will watch it again as soon as I find better quality version of it... In short - Kids and Teens will love it, also some more open-minded adults ;) It is excellent Family watch... Just close your eyes and say - Anything is possible - and you will like this movie too, it isn't a scientific documentary, it is a FANTASY movie !!!",Tomorrowland
376,laszlo-janszky,It's unique in this decade,10,20 November 2015,"This movie is made for kids, so if you expect something realistic or dead people in piles, this movie is not for you. If you can watch it as if you were a kid, then it can be something enjoyable. According to others you should not compare it to the book either, but I did not read the book, so I cannot confirm that.I can't even remember the last time I watched a film with such a strong positive message. Actually I could rarely find a movie in the last 2 decades with any useful meaning at all. Let's check some movies/series: 300 - kill people who attack your country, join to the military! Terminator - kill bad robots to prevent the judgment day. It follows - be afraid of creeps, they will kill you if you let them close to you. Game of thrones - killing people in sadistic disgusting ways is cool. Vikings - slaughtering Christians is cool. LotR - save the world by delivering the nuke, I mean ring (I really liked the battle scenes). The hobbit - do insane things for money. Prometheus - aliens kill you. Jurassic - dinosaurs kill you. 2012 - there is no hope to save the world, but you can survive on ships (the effects are cool). Interstellar - still no hope to save the world, but you can survive on ships, I mean spaceships (the effects are cool here either). Armageddon - Bruce Willis can save the world (I assume Bruce is too old now, that's why we cannot save the world since '98), Die hard - kill the terrorists if you are a cop (actually that makes sense). As you can see it is really hard to find something supportive you could agree with or something which could have a positive effect on you. So I think this movie is unique in this way and it is worth to watch. It's a shame that it is not made for adults many people could have learned from it.",Tomorrowland

So why someone would be hung up on the girl using her gloved hands to operate a touch screen or the lack of explanation of the second truck they drove, is unexplainable. Overall this was a fantastic story and a wonderful film. The hope and the inspiration that is built into this story is great, I just wish that the world could see it instead of being so negative. I have to fill in some space here so I am going to say that I liked this film just in case the people reading this are to stupid to understand that in less than 10 lines. I sure hope they are not.

Also has some good dialog among the characters...at times. But if you are like most Americans, the message will fly right over your head and Tomorrowland will cease to be even a dream. Well, this website requires ten lines of text so I will go on, hopefully not giving anything away in detail. The basic situation is that, like today, civilization is on its way towards ending the ability for life on Earth to continue as we know it...or perhaps the Earth is reacting by getting ready to cleanse itself of its infection by the end of the century. This is not the tomorrow that many thought would take place in a world where people would be hopeful, creative, and invest in the future. What is the reaction to the cranky inventor and rare older teen with a clue getting together and maybe making a difference? I think that sets the stage without giving away anything.

379,hiramolivera,A positive movie,9,17 November 2015,"I was not expecting much of Tomorrowland because of its low score in IMDb, however, I decided to give it a try and was very pleasantly surprised. Perhaps it may never become a classic, but I find it engaging, funny and with a positive message. For me it is an 8 but I'm giving it 10 to compensate for the undeserved bad scores. It is a kids movie and have to be seen with an open mind and just enjoy the concepts, the visuals, the non-stop action and the clean jokes. The plot is deeply discussed in other reviews so I will skip on it to avoid spoilers.Things I liked was the very natural behavior of the characters in the situations presented (It was not like other movies where ordinary people, confronted with a dangerous situation, instantly became martial arts experts, hyper accurate shooters, and/or Olympic class athletes able to outrun a tyrannosaur wearing high heels. In Tomorrowland, the only unusual thing they were able to do was withstand some hits and falls, with a lot less damage than normal people); the clean jokes; the nice special effects (even with some errors noticed elsewhere) and the general tone of the movie.In conclusion, if you do not expect to see the most impressive exponent of 2015 cinematography, but want to have a 130 minutes experience of clean, nice fun, with a positive, optimistic message, I recommend watching Tomorrowland.",Tomorrowland
380,neilbenammar,"Emotionally astute, optimistic and forward thinking.",9,12 June 2015,"""A world where only dreamers can live and co-exist"". This is the pretty straightforward plot line envisaged for the IMAX experience that is - Tomorrowland. Brad Bird is establishing himself as the next science-fiction maestro helming this visually exhilarating and beautiful film adventure.George Clooney and Britt Robertson are cast in this sci-fi epic, where the collapse of human civilization is imminent AND inevitable!. Yes you have seen this before- however; you should still pay the price of admission.The task of fixing this incredibly cliché scenario falls on young inventor and optimist Casey Newton; no relationship to Isaac Newton, as the name implies. After committing a petty crime trying to keep her beloved Dad employed, Casey is given an emblematic pin by Athena, a peculiar young girl played by the captivating Raffey Cassidy- (who gives a breakthrough performance). This gives Casey a glimpse into a universe of infinite creativity and imagination, these attributes are possessed by the inhabitants of futuristic Tomorrowland in spades.Naturally, after Casey is shown the city she has been waiting her whole life for; she pursues a lead to find out who manufactures this mystery pin. In brief, she eventually meets fellow science enthusiast Frank Walker; both trying desperately hard to find a way into Tomorrowland- (Frank had been previously exiled after he invented a doomsday device).The second-act of Tomorrowland really holds its own. You have to understand something before thinking of seeing this movie: The plot is really about the journey TO Tomorrowland, the majority of the scenes in fact, do not actually take place there. Our three protagonists find themselves in trouble when they find out governor ""Nicks""- the leader or creator of this magical place, has forbidden re-entry into Tomorrowland by blocking out any portal to the other dimension (from earth).Let us stop summarizing the story, to prevent any spoilers. I can honestly say: this movie was fun. If you expect something other than a feel-good flick, this one isn't for you. We finally get a movie that understands what it's trying to do. 99% of films get lost in their overly complicated plot holes or by trying to accomplish something extraordinary out of ordinary scripts. This is not the case with Tomorrowland. The movie understands exactly what it's going for. That's of paramount importance in an era where films are marketed to the masses. People expect to be entertained in the 2 hours-or so break they have from the real world. Britt Robertson is perfectly fine as Casey; she has that typical girl-next-door persona we often see in American movies of this genre. On the other hand, sparky newcomer Raffey Cassidy is far from boring. She gives one of the most mesmerizing performances of all-time (for a young actor of course). YES, I did indeed say of ALL-TIME! Between her quirky looks and her unfathomable and almost effortless on-screen presence, she asserts herself as the most promising young talent in the industry. I am glad to have witnessed this, as I was starting to despair looking at the recent casting choices in Hollywood. This is in no way an exaggeration, go watch the movie and see for yourselves. She steals every scene in the movie by a mile. Britt Robertson becomes background noise, settling only for the measly 3rd lead on the call-sheet by the film's ending.Conclusively, Tomorrowland is imaginative, visually daring, thematically bold and relentlessly upbeat; on top of that, the film has stellar performances. What more could you ask for (from) an early-summer Disney release? As far as Disney films go, this one is at the very top of the list. Congratulations, Brad Bird! (It is only fair that I end this review with positive thinking).",Tomorrowland
381,carterbennett,"Tomorrowland is a shiny silver box that is entertaining to look at but, you will be hard-pressed to find anything of worth in that box!",6,24 May 2015,"Tomorrowland- PG, 2015, Rotten Tomatoes: 50% ➡️Let me preface this review by saying that ""Tomorrowland"" was one of my most anticipated films of the year due to the director, Brad Bird, and his impeccable pedigree as a filmmaker so take what I say with a grain of salt. Tomorrowland is an original concept (something very rare in Hollywood for summer blockbusters) that wears the influences of Walt Disney and his dreams for the future on it's sleeves. This is a film that, in the beginning, steamrolls itself into the audience's heart and plays on our desire to reach for a better tomorrow in every facet of life. Sadly, this film tapers off toward the end due to uneven tone and pacing, a lack of any true antagonists, and a 3rd act that destroys almost all of the goodwill set up by the first 2 acts. Tomorrowland bases it's main theme in hope but I found myself ironically ""hoping"" it would end once that 3rd act rolled around. This is by no means a bad film, and I do recognize that the viewing experience for me might have been hindered because of my sky-high expectations but, I came out feeling distant from the film and it's themes. This is in no doubt due to the writing and not the performances, which were excellent, especially the one given by Raffi Cassidy. She plays a young girl with a big secret and acts as the heart to the film. George Clooney is his usual charming self and Britt Robertson shines in her role as the main character, Casey. The visuals and world-building are jaw-droppingly gorgeous and worth the price of admission alone. Ultimately though, The film lost me and never managed to reel me back in barring one emotional scene towards the end. The pros definitely outweigh the cons in ""Tomorrowland"" and I love that there are still directors and studios that will take risks on properties with little-to-no name recognition but the risks simply didn't pay off here. I do believe that this is an enjoyable watch for the whole family and, for a few breathtaking sequences, deserves to be seen on the big screen.

383,artscommented,Disappointing...,4,6 June 2015,"Would you like to see a fun Tomorrowland? Go to a Disney Park! I guarantee it will be ten times more entertaining than the movie with the same name. Inspired by a section of Disney's Park Magic Kindgom, ""Tomorrowland,"" directed by Brad Bird (who also directed ""The Incredibles""), was extremely disappointing.The movie tells the story of Casey Newton (Britt Robertson), a teenage girl who has a lot of curiosity for anything related to science, and Frank Walker (George Clooney), who used to be considered a genius when he was only a boy (his younger version is played by Thomas Robinson). Their destinies are intertwined when Casey is given a pin that mysteriously transports her to a different world every time she touches it (it doesn't work when anybody else tries). Intrigued by the pin's power, she is led by Athena (Raffey Cassidy), a little girl whose intentions are unknown, until they find Frank and understand what the pin is (as it turns out, the pin is only given to selected people who have a very specific quality – I can't tell more without spoiling it).If the summary seems confusing, it's because the movie is confusing. It takes a long time for the plot to be completely clear to the audience. If you've seen the trailer or read the official synopsis released by Disney, you probably know what I'm talking about: neither explains what the movie is really about. I went into the theater thinking that I would see a film set in Tomorrowland, but that's not what happens. It really is a huge flashback to show why Tomorrowland didn't work. Therefore, it's basically set in the present.The visual spectacle I was expecting after having seen the trailer almost doesn't happen. We only get a few glimpses of Tomorrowland and its beautiful buildings and landscapes. One of the buildings even resembles Space Mountain and it made me wish I was riding it instead of watching the movieThe final message of the movie is interesting, but I wish they had done something else to transmit that message to us. I don't know if Walt Disney would be entirely happy about this movie, but I do know he approved the park.

It was just such a fresh take on sci if and I was loving how it looked, but then we do go to Tomorrowland and it sucks. That's when things are confusing, and don't really excite as much as the first 60-70 minutes. I'm not saying removing the arrival to Tomorrowland would've made a more interesting movie, the movie just needed to make the Tomorrowland segment more interesting.

386,a-papke,Dumb but Gorgeous,4,1 October 2015,"A gorgeous over-the-top CGI spectacle with cute actors delivering empty performances in the service of Disney shamelessly self-promoting its own corporate brand. Without a doubt, Brad Bird got ""studio'ed."" THE GOOD: The special effects are amazing. The scenes of the future city are marvelous. The art direction is pitch perfect. The design of the city, the retro-50's future meets millennial technology fused with art deco and steam punk elements is absolute eye candy of the finest cinematic order. The cartoon action sequences recall a sort of bloodless-yet-hyperviolent Jetsons episode that are fun to watch if you put yourself in the mind of a child. The film makes an attempt to deliver a strong moral message of encouraging science and creativity and art in order to save the future of the humanity. Finally, the little girl playing Athena is adorable as hell. THE BAD: There is no character depth whatsoever. We are repeatedly told that the lead girl is an engineering genius, but she doesn't ever do or say anything that would indicate she has any science education past the 5th grade. For a sci-fi movie, this is an unforgivable sin. She overacts the entire movie, screeching and howling like she's trapped in a broad slapstick comedy. It gets annoying. Clooney looks bored and has no chemistry with the lead. In fact the story is supported solely by the sheer power of his charisma and the warm (yet a little creepy) connection he has with Athena (who is really charming). The titular city is supposedly an Atlas Shrugged like Utopia for ex-patriated genius, yet the only person living there is Hugh Laurie with his army of robots. The movie is almost entirely humorless, and what few attempted moments of levity are ruined by obvious heavy handed product endorsements, which constantly takes us out of the story in order to remind us we are watching a Disney tent-pole extravaganza. This is corporate product, not art. This film is a hodge-podge of other superior films, most notably ""Meet the Hendersons,"" which was far, far more entertaining on every level. THE UGLY: The acting is horrible. There was never a single moment where I was ""transported."" More than anything, I watched this movie because I wanted to be swept away into a magical world of childlike wonder and imagination where all things were possible and blah, blah, blah. But the cardboard characters and the complete lack of human connection these actors had to their story kept me at arm's length so I never experienced a single emotion other than ""wow, that was cool CGI."" Every problem in the story was solved with violence. The moralizing is insultingly simple. The world's problems are complex and very real. To simply say that we are heading into doom because of an antennae from another dimension is insulting to the real sacrifices real people make everyday by opposing real greed, injustice and oppression. Disney is making a political statement but sanitizing it of all politics, religion, reason or judgment of any kind; so it's left with a hollow, shallow, politically correct piece of trite. Sci-fi is for intelligent audiences. This movie is really dumb. I mean, really, really dumb.",Tomorrowland

It isn't supposed to cure cancer or create world peace, just entertain and maybe get people to think about the future. When one remembers that going into a movie, than sit back and appreciate the efforts of crew. Acting was very well done by all; artwork, graphics, scenes, and lighting were spot on; music kept things moving along; the story flowed from start to finish, had humor, serious, sadness, heart, love, shame, pride, intelligence, and clearly ended on a good note.

Is there anything including saving the world that she cannot do? Is there anything that would make you think this is a human girl?No, no and no.If Athena had been the main character, if Casey had been killed half an hour into the movie, and if social commentary had been used as a spice rather than the main dish, this could have been a really good movie.

389,bryce-wiseman94,What ever happened to fun movies?,6,22 May 2015,"So, the world of Tomorrow is here today! Disney's next big outing for 2015 aims to gather audiences of all ages and backgrounds for a large scale science fiction film based off of the Disney Land ride of the same name. This is a strategy that has worked in the past (Pirates of the Caribbean) and has flopped as well (The Haunted Mansion). So how does this movie fare?To be honest, I left the theater underwhelmed, but with a few notable good things to say about the movie.First of all, you'll notice that for a movie called Tomorrowland, there's not a whole lot of Tomorrowland in it. It is introduced in the opening scene, in what is admittedly a breathtaking flying shot of the futuristic city, but is then put on the kibosh until the latter third of the movie. Now, for what we see of the city, it is beautiful and imaginative. I've gotten to a point where CGI needs to be absolutely phenomenal to impress me, and I can honestly say that this movie's visuals were beyond impressive.The designs for the inhabitants and technology were also wonderful to look at, perfectly encapsulating all the charm of the original attraction and more. It's just really too bad that they are not expanded or focused on for the majority of the movie.The plot is honestly very convoluted and difficult to summarize, but there is one positive thing about it: It will keep you guessing as to what comes next the entire time. Only towards the end does it fall to some of the science fiction tropes and clichés. Up to that point, the twists and turns will make older viewers wonder what is going to happen, although children may get a bit confused.So what's not that great about it? Well, the ending is what mostly gave me that empty feeling as I walked out. It's not satisfying, and is really as predictable as endings for Disney Movies get. Which is really such a darn shame, because everything before that seemed to be taking us in a very interesting direction. It's a whole lot of setup that never really pays off.Secondly, the environmentalist message. Why? Just why? Why can't we go to the movies anymore to just have a good time? Why does every single film, even Disney films, need these dramatic situations and dire circumstances? We even get a bit of the ""Chosen one"" cliché (they never say it out loud, but they don't really need to).Third, the action and violence. Wasn't this supposed to be a kid's movie? Quite a few people are blasted into dust, there are sequences of a little girl using martial arts on robotic henchmen, and one character is even crushed by a gigantic flaming metal orb. Jesus, guys. It's not that I necessarily have a problem with violence perse, but this movie absolutely did NOT need it. At all. It just felt ridiculously out of placeSo overall, Tomorrowland was more of a disappointment than a success in my book. Beautiful imagery and an interesting plot that ultimately led to a lame ending with a heavy handed message that we've all heard a thousand times. A majority of the action, while not terrible out of context, was absolutely out of place here. I suppose that the age of Disney making fun movies for the sake of making fun movies is over; if this source material couldn't give us a simple, fun, whimsical adventure, I don't know what else can.",Tomorrowland
390,deep_hz,tomorrowland will come tomorrow,5,25 May 2015,"1st of all from the title of the film and the trailer, i had certain expectations with regard to the theme of the movie. but after watching the movie, i felt the main thrills expected from the movie came a little late and also it was not that impressive. secondly the story itself was problematic. the movie opens quite nicely and it seems the plot and visual effects etc will be quite thrilling. but by he middle of the movie it seems to have hit the brakes. i felt as if the writers were getting good ideas for the story at starting. then by the middle, they stopped getting ideas and finished the rest of the story in a haphazard way. lastly the climax itself. it seemed to me that the writers completely forgot about the climax until the movie shootings had begun. then they suddenly remembered about it and created something sort of a climax and forced it into the movie. the climax felt out of place. it didn't seem to have any connection with the movie plot. it was as if the climax appears out of nowhere and then vanishes equally fast- without contributing anything to the story. i think it would have been better if they didn't include the climax at all. the movie would have ended abruptly, but that wouldn't have been so different than the actual movie.",Tomorrowland
391,flagmichael,Unexpectedly complex,8,25 May 2015,"I still don't know if I like this movie a lot or a little. The plot does not have twists; it has phases and the movie is in the last half hour or so before the story actually comes out. There is plenty of action and in the end it makes sense, but there is a long period of what seems to be wandering - bad guys but no obvious reason for their existence. I think my 5 year old grandson tolerated the movie more than he enjoyed it, especially when we kept shushing his questions. I don't particularly recommend it to younger than mid-teens.Add this movie to the list of Disney movies (like Oz, the Great and Powerful) that openly promote Walt Disney's ideas. I don't disagree with what Walt has said, but it makes me feel like I'm reading Ayn Rand. The philosophy gets in the way of entertainment even when the entertainment is good. I felt the same way when they were going through the feminist and environmentalist times. If the ideas are good, include them... but be a bit more subtle, please.",Tomorrowland
392,jgstclair,Preachy,2,26 May 2015,"Some in Hollywood seem to think the ills of the world should be laid squarely at the feet of humanity. Humanity is, by its nature, followers. Our leaders are the ones who shoulder the responsibilities that come with their fat paychecks and status in society. They lead the rabble. Like Avatar before it, this movie degenerated into being unnecessarily preachy to the masses. Who follow. They don't lead. Tell it to our leaders! I get it already and almost walked out the of theater because I don't pay good money to be preached to on this level. Tell it to the correct audience. We're not dumb, but we can only do just so much. As for the movie itself, it was fun until the end, where the overt preaching began. This is ""What The Bleep Do We Know"" on CGI steroids -a fine film which took complicated subjects and brought them down to a level where most common folk could comprehend. Until our leaders develop a more protective, forward-thinking and doing attitude, nothing will change.",Tomorrowland
393,drewthedude,"Tomorrowland is coming? Yeah, I'll wait.",6,4 July 2015,"So far, Tomorrowland is probably one of the more underwhelming films I've seen this year. It seemed like it had some potential, but it ended up falling flat. That is a shame considering the fact that Brad Bird was behind this film and he has usually made some great films in the past like The Iron Giant, The Incredibles and Ratatouille. However, I guess not every film he makes can be amazing. Anyway, I was excited for this film considering that I am a fan of the actual Tomorrowland areas in Disney parks, but this film is a totally different thing and not in all that great of a way. Now this was not an awful film, it did have some good moment. In fact, I was enjoying the first 2/3 of the film a bit, but the ending is really where things went a bit haywire. Here's my two cents.So as for good things, there are a lot action scenes and they are pretty entertaining. A lot of those scenes involve robots and cool futuristic gadgets and that's really where the film was shining the most. As for the actual Tomorrowland itself, it's pretty epic with all its futuristic technology and large buildings. This film also has a lot of references to geek culture, like there is one scene where the main character goes into a geek shop and you'll see tons of references to things like past Brad Bird films, Pixar films and even Star Wars. You may also see some actual Tomorrowland attractions from the theme parks hidden in the background, so keep your eyes peeled for that.So what's bad about this film. First off, the plot is confusing! I may have been enjoying the first 2/3 of the film, but in the back of my mind I was still like ""What is going on? I don't understand any of this!"" It seemed like none of the characters were giving any clue of the story's situation, they just kept on making vague statements that didn't make much sense. Then there was the ending which felt like a complete mess because it involved a certain issue going on with ""the real world"" and not Tomorrowland, and they don't even give very good clues on why these bad things are happening. We the audiences just need to apparently accept that these bad things are happening for no good reason! Finally, the ending has a pretty cliché moral to it and the film ends just like that leaving a bad taste in your mouth.Overall, Tomorrowland was a let down. It has some entertaining moments, some cool pop culture references and great visuals, but it couldn't hide the fact that this film is being weighed down by a confusing plot and a ""been there, done that"" moral. I would say to only see this film if you're curious, maybe rent it or something. But at the end of the day, if you pass on this film you really won't be missing much.",Tomorrowland
394,Lap-Kit,Learned the Wolf's story,6,17 October 2015,"Wow, it was a not bad Sci-Fi Disney movie! The performance of the actors and actresses are great! Bravo~ I think the entire film is really good, just that may be some of the part may need to be speed up a little bit? make it more heart pumping? or may be it just need to suits for the children? haha~ but I quite enjoy It though...Just personally feel that the ending still not so satisfied, may be it could have been better? the first half is really good. It attracted you the way it tell the stories....made you really want to know more what's happening.But from the entire film, I like the most is the quote from the father and daughter, and I really learned that ""idea"" from them. It's about the wolf's story. Darkness and despair or light and hope? Which will win? Actually is the one you feed. :) That's a really wise quote!",Tomorrowland
395,thechriscloud,Why the bad reviews? Victim of bad marketing? No spoilers here.,9,27 May 2015,"Whether we like the movie or not, we should be supporting movies that are original and creative. Brad Bird is a beast. He hasn't made a bad movie yet. I don't understand everyone's bad reviews. This movie was creative and directed amazingly. Not only that, but it had a message that really hits home. I am thinking maybe that's why people (especially the critics) don't like it. It seems when something is really creative or has things never seen before, people either LOVE it or HATE it. They usually only LOVE the movies that are creative and raunchy. If you are ultra creative but still tell a good story with a positive message, then apparently your movie is ""boring"" and ""doesn't make sense"". I don't get it. Same thing happened to Interstellar. Could it be bad marketing? People wanting to see a sic fi film, and getting a great adventure film? Anyway, if you haven't seen this, I hope you go see it and support good, actually creative art. Not mainstream crap or movies that are ""creative"" just cause they go all out on an insane demoralizing concept. Thanks for reading!",Tomorrowland
396,JediKnightNi,Where is the positive buzz to this great movie?,10,5 June 2015,"What a great family movie that is intelligent, inspiring to kids, well thought out and exciting. I know family movies are not the money maker studio's want and it appears audiences are content swallowing plot less action flicks, but Tomorrowland is a nice diversion from garbage spit into the cinema world like smoke from a factory pipe. Clooney is perfect for this part more than I have seen him since The Descendents. The kids are great, and don't take that for granted look at Hayden Christiansen or Andrew Garfield. The environmental tone was a bit soap boxy but still was well placed in the story and relevant, very much like Mr. Andersen's speech to Morpheus in the Matrix. A few slow moments on the road trip but it had nice moments.Overall a real great film for kids to step into a larger story movie that has good characters, plot, and action without the wanton destruction, foul language, sexual innuendo, or forced comic relief. One of the best family movies I seen since the Incredibles, nice repeat Bird.",Tomorrowland

I absolutely loved the cast and I am glad that I got to see it for that reason alone but it was way too far fetched. I love a good Sci-fi book or movie but it has to tip closer to the science and less on the fiction and this story was way more fiction. Literally when the movie ended I was like meh and shrugged my shoulders... It left something to be desired. Though I would love to have one of those blaster guns they were pretty cool.

Or we are just walking towards our inevitable destruction? I wandered into tomorrowland when I was feeling very down and tired, but I am so glad I have ""touched the badge"". I think Mr Brad Bird still has the heart of a child, and it takes the heart and eyes of a child to understand the message of the movie.

Sometimes we forget to dream, we forget to believe.We have forgotten that in order to have a future, a tomorrow, we ourselves have to believe, and to step forward to make a difference When the movie had ended, the sky had already darkened. I step outside and the skyline was obstructed by skyscrapers and neon lights. But in the midst of all these, I am glad that I can still see a few stars shining brightly, refusing to submit to the darkness.

Does it air on the preachy side? Yes to all of those.But...This movie was not only entertaining from start to finish, but climaxes with a very important message which deeply resonated with me. Though it may be one of the most violent family movies I've ever seen (which kids will love), the visceral encouragement the movie provides would render it important to show my unborn children.

I was more than a little confused and I'm an adult, isn't this meant to be a Disney film that targets the younger audience?Also, the acting is just horrible. Like, horrendous. George Clooney and Britt Robertson are clearly good actors/actresses outside this movie, as seen through The Longest Ride and Oceans 11, so I don't know whether it's the lack of chemistry or the lack of sleep that got to them in this film, but it was disappointing.",Tomorrowland

Disney's Tomorrowland​ is surprisingly(to me) a very good film. Delivering a strong but subtle message rooted in our reality while giving us visuals and concepts that don't disappoint. As with anything sci-fi, go with an open mind. That's what you did with every new experience as a child and this story certainly tugs at that little curious kid you once knew inside. Disney does what it does best but director Brad and writer Lindelof definitely had the freedom to explore the world they created. I feel that in terms of acting range, Hugh Laurie​ was underused. But having said that, his character fits well with the tone of the film and he does have some of the most important lines in the story. Excellent performances by Britt Robertson​ and Raffey Cassidy​, a wonderful age appropriate character played by George Clooney​, relationships that stand out for their innocence and a moral to our future. Inspiring, fun and a treat to the eyes. I wouldn't mind watching this one again.",Tomorrowland

404,Lingstar7,A solid modern Disney film,8,15 June 2015,"In a sea of terrible reviews, I think what most people are forgetting is that this is a Disney film. It isn't meant to be the next big sci-fi movie, it isn't meant to be completely scientifically accurate and it IS meant to put a smile on your face.Go into the cinema open to the feeling of wonder you get the first time you enter Discoveryland at any Disney park and you will enjoy it. Keep your mind open, it can be a little ridiculous and unrealistic but isn't that all part of the magic? Tomorrowland wasn't the best film I've ever seen but it made me smile and made me forget the outside world for a couple of hours and in reality, that is what most of us go to the cinema for in the first place.Britt Robertson looks like a star in the making and I imagine we will see her leading the big screen in the next few years. Clooney looked like he was having fun and again that added to the enjoyment. The young actors in this film also looked like they were really immersed in the world of Tomorrowland.In classic Disney style, they opted for an English villain casting Hugh Laurie as the big bad. He seems to naturally fall into this role and explains the premise of the film towards the end. Mankind has become so at ease with the fact they are destroying the world that they've lost all hope of fixing it. This is where Casey (Robertson) and Frank (Clooney) are the exceptions.In short, don't watch this film before you see some of the bigger films at the box office but if you have a few hours spare and want to forget the world around you, open your mind and enjoy what you see. Personally I wouldn't recommend taking younger children due to some person on robot violence but 10+ could probably cope with it.",Tomorrowland

This movie can run an 1 hour and you will find yourself looking for a plot. In fact you can cut out the first hour and you will have missed nothing. You can sit and ask yourself when is this movie going to start? It's a pie cut 24 ways, all of the slices are completely different in taste.

408,Defender_of_the-Faith,No review gets it: It's a love story,7,27 May 2018,"I loved this movie. What it's actually about is unrequited love and reconciliation. The relationship between the 60 something man (Clooney) and the 12 year old in appearance android (Cassidy), is about love in its deepest sense. The main plot is about a brilliant boy who never earns praise from his father. In consequence, he eventually expresses his unconscious disappointment and rage in the creation of machine that nearly destroys the world by amplifying the same negativity in the entire human race.While still a boy, he falls in the love with the android. This turns the Pygmalion story on its head as it is her emotional support that enables him to develop his true intellectual power.When he discovers that she is a machine, he is bitterly disappointing that she cannot love him back in the way he imagines. He believes he is betrayed by her just as he felt betrayed by his father. The android sends him an prophetess, who like Moses, discovers her true purpose almost by accident--she helps him save humanity from their own self-destruction. At the end, his true love sacrifices herself to save him. Only then is he freed from the past and is redeemed, and the android embraces her humanity--the Pinocchio theme.Note that the structure of the narrative follows the Odyssey. It is epic.I would work on this review a bit to make it a bit clearer, but you get the idea. Think on it. I know it is correct because the actors caught the emotions perfectly. No wonder it was a failure. Too subtle. And, perhaps not Politically Correct either even though there was no hint of sexuality.",Tomorrowland
409,PippyMusings,How can nothing happen in a 2 hour 10 minute movie?,4,8 June 2015,"After walking out of the cinema with three of my children, my six-year-old son summed up our reaction to ""Tomorrowland"" by turning to me and innocently asking, ""What was that??"". Yes, indeed. What was that Disney? It's been a while since I've seen a film where you can watch it but nothing really happens in it. This is brought home even more in ""Tomorrowland"" when you realise the budget of the film. You can see that money spent up on the screen but when you don't have a decent, coherent storyline with decent direction, then all the money in the world won't bring in the crowds.It's also been a while since I saw a film that takes so long to get to its point (I still don't think it got there). A family film should be child-friendly and understand children's attention spans. If it takes well over an hour to even give you some kind of idea of what on earth is happening then it needs to go back into the editing suite.After an enormously sluggish start, the middle part is full of supposedly thrilling chase sequences and rocket blasts. None of this is exciting. It is like watching a blank screen. And finally, after looking at my watch numerous times to work out how much longer this drivel was going to go on for, we finally get to Tomorrowland. Now, I ask you Disney, what is the point of calling your film ""Tomorrowland"" if you spend the majority of the film away from ""Tommorowland"" dealing with teenage, over-acting angst? It is this section that really highlights the poor direction and writing. You really had no idea what was going on. Scenes were shot confusingly and unclearly. What makes it worse is that you simply don't care. All the characters could have been sucked through a black hole at that point and I would have been quite content.There are some pluses in the film I guess. It looks pretty at times and Tomorrowland looks interesting in its glory days but it's nothing new (oh, except for the inexplicable three-storey swimming pools. Why would there be such a thing? In all seriousness, why would that be a big thing in the future??). All the acting was pretty standard to sub-par, but Raffey Cassidy, while being wooden at times, has something resembling charisma on screen (as you can tell I'm grasping at straws here to say something nice about this cast). And, please casting directors, why would you cast two young boys that look so similar in two different roles that had no relation with one another at all?. The boy that played the young Frank (Thomas Robinson)and the boy that played Casey's brother Nate (Pierce Gagnon) looked like brothers. If this was done on purpose, it just causes further confusion for the audience when that was the last thing that was needed.So, four stars from me. Why such a high rating when I could have given it just one? Well, there were four of us that saw it, so one star each. Plus, I have to give some kudos for the attempt at something original in a sea of superhero movies and remakes and reboots. It's a pity it simply did not work. It's quite obvious the film was in dire need of a few more script drafts before it was even remotely ready to go before the camera.We can all be thankful for small mercies though - it's failure means no sequel!!!",Tomorrowland

412,tijmenwartenberg,"Not as good as I hoped, but not bad either",6,25 May 2015,"I saw this movie this afternoon with the title 'Project T' (due to copyright issues here in the Benelux) which is actually more fitting than 'Tomorrowland', as we do not see much of that place. The story is nothing special. In the opening part we see how a very young Frank discovers Tomorrowland in the sixties, during his pursuit of the young girl Athena (Raffey Cassidy) after his invention got rejected in the theme park. After that, we switch back to the current age and are introduced to Casey Newton (Britt Robertson), a young, bright and optimistic young adolescent, who wants to chase her dreams of exploring the universe. However, we soon learn that the world is in bad shape and that she is'chosen' by a non-aging Athena to save Earth from the nearing apocalypse. Frank, who had been expelled from the community of Tomorrowland, joins them a bit later and together they travel to the place to see how Athena can save Earth.The prologue with young Frank was really pleasant to watch, especially for children. However, as soon as he enters Tomorrowland, the story shifts back to Casey and we unfortunately do not really observe how Frank and Athena bond. We see a short glimpse of the visually stunning Tomorrowland, as if the directors had no idea what to do with the beautiful setting. Casey only walks through the place for a few minutes. Most of the slow-pacing story takes place on Earth where the protagonists try to escape dangerous robots. Eventually, Casey learns about the existence of Tomorrowland and the upcoming apocalypse. The part of Roberston ( already in her mid-twenties) lacked credibility for me. Her presence was fresh, but I thought that she was sometimes trying to hard too sound and act like a teenager. Clooney's performance as the cranky Frank was solid, but he did not carry the movie. Cassidy's performance on the other hand, was flawless and her bond with Frank was something special to see. I do not agree with those folks that Regard Frank as a pedophile, that is nonsense. Lastly, the villain (governour Nix), portrayed by Hugh Laurie, was pretty bland and his explanation during the 'big reveal' was not impressive. His character should have had more depth. The music was good and synced well with the atmosphere of Tomorrowland in the Disneypark. The introduction and the voice-over of the main protagonists at the beginning and end of the movie was not necessary in my opinion. Most of what they told was explained later along the way anyway. Then I had another problem with the target audience. Some scenes seemed like they were targeted for young children, while some action scenes/ dialogues were more appropriate/understandable for teenagers. I conclusion, I would recommend this movie for age 9 and up.Overall, Tomorrowland does have its moments and has a nice message, but it is not the science-fiction movie for the family I had hoped to see. That is a pity, because the concept of this movie had much potential to appeal to a large audience. 6.5/10",Tomorrowland
413,theresistancerises,Another Brad Bird film that soars high with ambition and creativity.,8,23 May 2015,"I think most people didn't really know what ""Tomorrowland"" was. The trailers never gave us a full picture of the film's plot so we were left to wonder what it was going to be about. But we knew a few facts before going to see the film. Okay, Brad Bird, who's done nothing but great work, is directing... Good. He's co-writing the screenplay with Damon Lindelof... Again, good. George Clooney is starring in the film... Once again, good. So now that the film is out, does it measure up to our expectations?Off the bat, Brad Bird continues to be a great visual director. Like most of his other films, ""Tomorrowland"" has a compelling visual narrative with characters you grow to love instantly.Speaking of its interesting characters, let's start with George Clooney as an old, grizzled inventor named Frank Walker. It was kind of fresh to see Clooney play a non-playboy, non- cool type of character for once. I was, at first, frightened that Clooney would go back to the usual cool-guy shtick that he usually does, especially because this was a Disney film, but I was pleasantly surprised with his performance here. He was stubborn, old, cranky man that didn't take orders from anybody. But underneath his cold exterior was something lying underneath that was, as the audience, had to figure out throughout the film, making him a more complex character. Clooney gave a lot of depth to the role and shined brightly as the star of the film.But no matter how much Clooney shined, this was Britt Robertson's film. Although Clooney got top billing, it was Robertson who had to carry the entire weight of the film on her shoulders and, boy, did she deliver. Robertson, as Casey Newman, was able to balance the drama, humor and action in the film flawlessly and was one of the film's highlights. She was a quirky, tough, rule-breaking, relatable visionary who's positivity made her such an endearing presence in the film. Her quick remarks and clever banter against the cranky Clooney was definitely fun to watch. She was also able to handle the emotional moments in the film beautifully. This is definitely a star-making movie for Robertson.Yes, Robertson was outstanding and Clooney is good as always, but by far, the one single actor that stole the entire movie was newcomer Raffey Cassidy as Athena. This is a future star right here. Like Robertson, ""Tomorrowland"" is a star-making movie for her and will propel her miles ahead in her career. Her charm, wit and beauty won the entire audience over and provided us with some of the best moments in the film. It's hard to have a child actor be one of the major characters in the film, having around equal screen-time as Clooney, but not once was Cassidy annoying or tiresome throughout the entire picture. She was simply outstanding. Hollywood's next young star. I can't really say much about her character because it would definitely be a spoiler for the film but I will say that Cassidy will be getting a lot more calls from other directors after they see ""Tomorrowland"".Brad Bird never shies away from intense action scenes and ""Tomorrowland"" is no different. The action is handled expertly and is thrilling to watch in IMAX. There is a particular scene set in Walker's house that I found very creative. It is clear from the first action sequence that Bird clearly knows what he is doing and understands how to create an engaging and thrilling action set piece. Not once in the film was I bored or rolled my eyes. I sat in my seat at the theater in awe of what I was experiencing. The imagination and creativity in ""Tomorrowland"" are something only a director like Bird and the magic of Disney could bring us. The screenplay by Lindelof and Bird is very original and is very impressive in a time where every blockbuster film is either a sequel, remake or an adaptation. The only thing remade here are ideas and themes, not exact stories. It is very loosely connected to Walt Disney's vision of future communities like EPCOT but ""Tomorrowland"" is an entirely new property (although there is a park in Disney World called Tomorrowland).Bird and Lindelof's ambition and creativity are so good and so praise worthy, that I can forgive and overlook some of the problems the film has. Despite having an extremely strong 1st and 2nd Act, I found the 3rd Act to be, not mediocre, but subpar compared to the rest of the film. The message in the film's climax is one we have heard to death in previous stories but is one I strangely never get sick of. I think it is an important message for people of all ages and, seeing as this is a Disney film, felt appropriate.""Tomorrowland"" is another Disney live-action that soars high beyond what we had expected and delivers great action, great performances and great directing throughout. Brad Bird continues to be one of my favorite directors of this new generation and, even though this film has its flaws, I found myself enjoying ""Tomorrowland"" for its visuals, its cast, and its ambition. I give the film a solid 8 out of 10.",Tomorrowland
414,kvs-07465,"Imaginative, dazzling , and great performances",9,19 June 2015,"I went into this with somewhat low expectations, do to the poor box office. I was more than pleasantly surprised. It was visually amazing. The cinematography was so well done. A perfect combination of CGI and interesting set locations. Acting and casting was superb. Britt Robertson is one of the most compelling young actresses. She has brought her A game to the big screen. If you can get around the global warming nonsense that creeps into almost every film these days, Sort of like the cold war and Nuclear proliferation were in all of the films of the 60's and 70's., the plot is actually clever. I really enjoyed this picture and wish I had seen it in 3d. I think it may have a cult following in the future",Tomorrowland
415,dinoluigivercotti,Classic Occult Gnosticism from Disney,7,1 February 2016,"As much as I disagree with its message and especially its age rating, this movie is an excellent example of the original purpose of cinema as a message delivery platform.""Feed the right wolf"" is the message of this movie. This is occult Gnosticism - literally a wolf in shepherd's clothing. Of course there is no such thing as a ""right wolf"". A wolf is just a wolf, all of them parasitic predators, wanting only to feed on the flock. Characterizing hope as a wolf is mere sophistry, and makes for a poor fable on which to base a children's story.The CG sleight-of-hand is very convincing, but also abusive (children hit by speeding cars, children smashing the skulls of adults, etc), and represents most of this movie's budget. This is Disney culture at its most manipulative, aggressively and successfully pandering to our innate narcissism - our inner child is kept firmly on the edge of the seat.The classic rambling monologue of the bad guy is excellent but full of Gnostic doublespeak. His statement that belief in the end of the world (that time itself is limited) somehow makes people lazy rather than motivated, is particularly mysterious. Again, brilliant delivery of a weak message.The closing scene is plagiarized from the Bible, with clear signs of Gnostic tampering. An Antichrist (Clooney, as the ""right wolf"") defeats the Church (the ""dark building"" which teaches an end of the world) and finally looms over a flock of tiny humans. It is the most believable part of the movie. This stolen shroud of legitimacy is the crux of its successful message delivery.I gave it a 7 because it objectively succeeds as cinema in delivering its message. Points off only for the message itself, and its age rating. Influence this subtle requires an adult mind to filter.Indeed, this review took a long time to write and the conclusions it arrived at were surprising. I genuinely felt I liked this movie after watching it, but it seems feelings can be manipulated.",Tomorrowland
416,jeff-41910,Making propaganda leads to bad movies,2,2 April 2016,"This is the first time I have felt the need to write a review. This movie is financially underwater (production costs + advertising cost) for Disney and with good reason. The movie is political propaganda that they tried to create a story around. As usual the propaganda took priority over a good script. Movie folks would be well advised to remember two quotes...Movie producer Samuel Goldwyn: ""Just write me the comedy. Messages are for Western Union""Playwright Moss Hart: ""If you've got a message, call Western Union."" This is not the first George Clooney bomb caused by trying to disguise propaganda as a movie - you think Hollywood would learn...",Tomorrowland
417,davidlo-21805,God-Awful Main Character,5,14 May 2016,"Basically, the film mistakes the difference from being an optimist to being an insane, overzealous idealist who isn't afraid to trample on others for no logical reason.She is a character who is so oversaturated by her idealism that she comes off as an arrogant prick who is really out to satisfy her vanity first before serving for the greater good.The story attempts to balance her by creating Frank, who is supposed to be the exact opposite of the main character. Frank, the 'pessimist' actually comes out as gray. Even if he is this bitter, grumpy old man, he has actual experience and logic to back it up and not to mention that he doesn't come off all that pessimistic but that might be due to Clooney's very average performance in this movie.The actress performing Casey Newton is great, the character was not. There comes a point when a person's naivety rubs off too strongly and the fact that Casey's character does not mature one bit from the beginning to the end makes it a whole lot worse.Frank actually becomes less pessimistic by the end so in some sense, the character transformed from that grumpy mean old man who hates kids to a character that somewhat resembles a gentle grandfather a bit closer.Casey starts out being obnoxiously zealous about her idealistic beliefs and ends not changing her zealousness one bit (because she ended up doing something good right?).I don't think adopting a pessimistic view of the world is right but to think that everything can be made right is not only naive but downright obnoxious. Its like eating raw sugar: a little bit of sweetness (optimism and naivety) is great but eat a mouthful and its grainy and vomit-inducing.",Tomorrowland

There are what seem to be large plot holes, or things that either aren't explained or don't make sense.SPOILER ALERT What was it exactly that George Clooney's character did that got him exiled from Tomorrowland? I must have missed it. Why are there killer robots on earth? Are they just after Athena? Why don't they want anyone to know about Tomorrowland or to get a pin? I mean, it's not like anyone can just travel there, so why is it so important that they kill people with abandon? And why isn't Tomorrowland like it is in the pin ""advertisement""? It's not explained what happened to it. Based on the killer robots on earth hunting and killing people, I expected the evil governor (Hugh Laurie) to immediately execute Clooney and Athena, but nothing of the sort happened.

Begins promising but as the movie goes on, you have that terrible feeling that is not going to deliver.The plot... well is bad, I mean really bad. The special effects are great, probably that is what makes me feel so frustrated.The movie ended and I was like ""this is it? really?"".

421,gmgrubb,They Got One Thing Right,5,2 August 2015,"I agree with what many people said about the ending being overly long, complicated, preachy, and confusing. But I think the root message that the Governor Nix character was trying to say had a lot of merit. He said that he gave the planet a negative view of the future to try to scare its population into changing from its destructive path, and it had the opposite effect; people ran to it. When you get down to it, the book of Revelation in the Bible paints a bleak picture of the end for the wicked. Although the real Armageddon is an unalterable future event, individuals can save themselves through repentance. But instead of repenting, the world as a whole seems to be rushing towards God's wrath. There have always been films warning of what the future might look like if society keeps being greedy, wasteful, etc, but something changed-the stakes were raised- in my lifetime. Beginning with films like Blade Runner, circa. 1980 (another example, not of life imitating art, but rather of ""art"" prophesying a lifestyle), decent people left the theater wanting to take a bath, but others seemed hellbent to fulfill it. Being one of the former, I think, Why would people WANT a world like that? On the other hand, since the devil basically runs Hollywood, I think maybe he's is flooding the market, and hence people's minds, with end-time fantasy so that they will brush aside God's real warning.",Tomorrowland

That's how disillusioned I have become with the ""products"" of the whole industry.But this one is most certainly different.Original enough so as not to be lost in formulaic action-burdened story telling. Magnificent actors - both old and young. Hillariously entertaining story transitions. Beautiful imagery yet no overdone CGI stuff. OK, the ending was a bit message-laden but I can live with that. Watch it!",Tomorrowland
423,chrill94,What a pleasant surprise.,8,1 December 2015,"I watched the trailer for this and it seemed like way to many things were happening in this movie. This meant that when i had the time to sit down and relax to watch it, i changed my mind and watched Maze Runner - Scorch Trials instead. This is a mistake that should not be made as that was so bad i can barely describe it.Anyways i decided i would watch it even though the trailer was a mess, and what a pleasant surprise. It was not messy in any way and it got me hooked from very early on. It has amazing visuals, great casting and a very meaningful story. Rafael Cassidy (Athena) did an amazing job. At such a young age to pull off such a performance is rarely seen, and given the right chances she could be worth to follow through her career. Clooney is good but not spectacular as his character is not great in the beginning. He catches up though. Britt Robertson (Casey) also does great and is another one to watch in the future.The story is actually very timely and is something i reflected on after watching the movie. It heads off with some background story before nicely introducing us to the characters. I was hooked all the way as we follow Casey around though thick and thin. Great movie and a bit low rated in my opinion. I would place it at 7.5 and therefore i give it the benefit of the limits with an 8.",Tomorrowland
424,niall-roche,A fantastic sci-fi experience,10,19 September 2015,"I very rarely write reviews for movies, but after watching Tomorrowland I've never seen a movie that's been so unfairly maligned by negative reviews,especially considering that this movie was an absolute joy from beginning to end. After watching it, and reading truly horrible, reviews I'm starting to think that somebody hired a few live bodies to slate this movie for their own specific reasons. The script, actors and directors captured the feeling of endless possibilities perfectly. The FX were fantastic, there were no lulls in the plot, George Clooney did his thing perfectly, the child actors were incredible, and there were just enough twists and turns to maintain the pace.Please, please watch this movie and make your own mind up - the negative reviews almost put me off, but I'm so glad I actually took the chance. Actually there's one proviso here - and is probably something consistent with most of the negative reviews: If you lack imagination, or the yearning for a better world, then you'll hate this movie. Or you want to raise kids who aspire to be nothing more than reality TV actors. Or if you're a reality TV actor. Or your kids can't read or write because you don't think it's important. Or if you think science is dumb. Or if you can't embrace hope.As for me...I loved it.

425,futurilla,In five years we'll all be hailing it as a classic,10,6 June 2015,"(Minor spoilers). This smart and optimistic movie was made for clever girls age 9-16, and for over-50 males who fondly remember growing up during the Space Race and the optimism of the 1960s and early 70s. That's it. It was made for no-one else, as far as I can tell from several viewings. Which is great. I find that perfectly fine - and it makes Tomorrowland an even more unique and beautiful movie, on top of the glorious ensemble acting, perfect framing, glorious music, and all the sheer fun of it. But even if you are in the intended audience demographic then, to fully 'get' some of Tomorrowland's deep themes and emotional resonances, it helps to know some of the deliciously deep back-story. Because Tomorrowland is a deep trans-media work of story-telling, as well as being a simple character-led summer popcorn movie. To quickly drill down to the back-story I'd suggest that you: visit the official interactive back-story website 'Take Me To Tomorrowland'; read the gripping prequel novel 'Before Tomorrowland'; read the 'Secret History' comic-book; see the second 'Paris' half of the deleted Pixar back-story scene on YouTube (which will at least clue you in on why our heroes pop up in Paris). After the movie, maybe even read the official novel version, which expands on the movie's story and also has a fuller and different ending. Knowing some real-world history can also aid enjoyment (for instance, if you know the date Kennedy was assassinated, and the name of the first U.S. missile command super-computer from 1957, then there are a few very sweet moments in this movie for you). So, yes, this movie requires some work to fully come alive on its many deeper levels. It's worth the effort. Finally, I'd like to say to all the haters that it's just amazing that this deep and optimistic movie has made it to the big screen at all - with $200m and Disney behind it, with not one but two smart girl leads, with no moms or annoying cute-boys in sight, with no real villain, and with a sensitively-handled and very different 'love interest'. I'm pretty sure that everyone except the obsessive Clooney-haters will be calling Tomorrowland a classic in five years' time or less - and we'll be proud to say that we saw it at the cinema when it was first released.",Tomorrowland

When looking for a film that is both family friendly, and educating Tomorrowland is definitely the one to watch. It teaches everyone to never stop believing in themselves, and to always keep dreaming, Walt Disney says that ""... This whole thing started with a dream and a mouse."" The future part in the movie comes with a bit of a surprise but opens your eyes due to the fact that it makes you realize that the future really is in your hands. It teaches you that you have the power to change it and that the time to take action in now, after all the future is tomorrow. With the glimpse of what it could be through the eyes of an optimist, it also looks through the pessimistic point of view, showing you the good and the bad and how it matters when you take charge.",Tomorrowland
429,dtocila,"There are two wolves inside each of us - Despair and Darkness, Light and Hope. Which will you feed?",7,23 May 2015,"This film is visually spectacular, heartwarming, and motivating. The locations are beautiful to explore with the eyes, the acting is all- around enjoyable, and the message throughout the film is a refreshingly optimistic one despite the many negative things that are happening in this world today.Tomorrowland is a metaphor for the possibilities that exist if we would only apply ourselves towards reaching for them. Rather than feed the despair and darkness inside of ourselves by resigning to a grim fate and a lost planet, we can accept the film's encouragement to feed the light and hope that is accessible to each person. Even though the main characters face many difficulties and many naysayers on their journey towards completing an impossible task, they press forward with a confidence that is unshakable. Some have considered this a fault of the film, being that one of the main characters is almost too optimistic. This criticism is not warranted, and it seems that it's more a product of the wave of negativity gripping films and society in general, rather than objectivity. Yes, she is absolutely driven to making a difference in the world and fixing the problems around here regardless of what it takes. And yet, this is not an unreasonable quality for anyone today to possess, and the message is an overwhelmingly positive one. Just as she strives to fix things around her and to think of solutions to the insurmountable problems in the world, Tomorrowland encourages the audience to be optimistic about our ability to engineer and encourage powerful change.Tomorrowland is not unbiased in its presentation of the optimistic heroine, though, and that is one of its strengths. The other main character trends towards the more pessimistic side of the coin and provides an interesting balance to the setting. It cannot be said that the film is overly gung-ho, being that negative perspectives are expressed during the main characters' interaction with one another. In the end, the film did a great job of exploring the negative attitudes we as a society will face whenever we want to strive for something greater than ourselves. There will always be the naysayers, the Debbie Downers, the Negative Nancys. They will always maintain that your aspiration is impossible and that you should resign yourself to failure. It is in this pervasively common train of thought that Tomorrowland stands opposed. Tomorrowland represents what we can achieve if we collectively put our energy and aspirations to work. We can not only repair a dying planet, but we can build an entirely new one.It is here that the film loses some credibility, though. At one point it did feel that the film was a beautiful wrapper for a not- so- subtle attempt to force climate politics onto the viewer. Rather than telling the audience that the climate is set to destroy the earth, it would have been more productive to show the damage being done. Towards the end of the film, the constant telling became a tad preachy. Additionally, the conclusion as a whole felt substantially weaker than the first three-fourths of the film.All in all, the movie is a pleasure to look at, the acting is interesting, the action scenes are done very well, and the over-all message is a positive and empowering one. Regardless of what people say, strive for your dream until you see for yourself what you can realize. Even if there is no hope, there are times when someone has to do something. Instead of waiting for someone else to do what you're waiting for, Tomorrowland encourages you to be the one who makes that difference in the world. Feed the right wolf. Feed Light and Hope, because enough people feed Despair and Darkness!",Tomorrowland

A great message about how positive and forward thinking can influence our futures and the futures of generations to come. The movie brought me back to my younger days when my imagination would make exciting dreams and made me think that anything was possible. The characters were great and the scenery and colours were spectacular. I have never written a review before on this site, but after watching this movie I was inspired and felt impelled to give my comments, if only to encourage others to watch it. I remember watching Star Trek as a child and how imaginative it was with all the communication gadgets, most of which actually exist today. I wonder if many of the items seen in this movie will one day become reality as well, perhaps not in my lifetime, but with the advancement of technology and the imaginations of the creative people at Disney, who knows!

It was neat watching Frank Walker's (George Clooney) house as it is full of surprises but then that's just that.

Extremely long, unfocused, and childish are a few words that come to mind. Now, many of you will say, ""But this is a children's movie, of course it's going to be childish"". No, this movie talks down to children and all audience members as if they're idiots. For instance, half of the dialogue is cut short right before an obvious curse word would be said. How charming. None of the jokes were funny, except for maybe two jokes. The central theme of the movie was apparent from the very first moment, and then the next, and the next, and the next . .. . and okay we get it! The kid next to me who wouldn't stop narrating what was going on in the movie also got it.The acting was awful as well. Robertson was constantly over the top and was basically a walking stereotype of a teenage girl. The character depth in this film is the biggest joke. The robots in the film are so clichéd, of course during high stress moments the robots begin to blink strangely and make weird noises. Even in Tomorrowland they haven't been able to fix that problem. The story is devoid of humor, fun, and mostly Tomorrowland. We get quick glimpses of it and then wait 80% of the film to see it. Perhaps there's a point to this, but i stopped caring 79% of the way through the film. Oh, by the way, the child Clooney in this film was written to act like a weird alien or something.

437,meganrmcgowan,Nice effects...but boring movie.,5,28 May 2015,"I went to see this with two friends yesterday without really knowing what it was about. I'd seen a few parts of trailers but other than that I hadn't a clue. Both friends are MASSIVE Disney fans, and so I felt slightly obliged to go along with them. It seemed to take almost an hour to actually get started. The flashbacks of George Clooney's character were kind of sweet, and liked the idea that it was his character talking from the future, if you know what I mean. However I found the 'Casey' (that is her name, isn't it?) an incredibly tedious, predictable character. Actually, the only characters that I genuinely liked were those of Hugh Laurie (who was the best bit of the entire film) and Athena, the weird English robot girl. Don't get me wrong- the idea is a great one. It's sad that Disney failed to execute it properly. It felt sloppy and slow, to the point where I was regularly checking my phone (don't kill me) to what the time was. I actually had to pretend that I needed the toilet on a few occasions just so I could escape the dull exchanges and OTT special effects. The effects were brilliant, I'll admit, but it all felt a bit Hobbit-y, if you get my meaning. Too much CGI and not enough real substance. This film is far too long. I thought it would be a quick hour and a half job. Instead I was stuck in there for two hours and ten minutes. I fell asleep. Twice. Maybe it's just because I'm not big on the preachy, ever-so-slightly-cheesy ""believe in your dreams"" crap Disney usually produce. I just couldn't connect with ""Tomorrowland"" whatsoever. I'm not even sure I still understand it! My friends and I sat in the theatre for about ten minutes after the film had ended trying to work out what exactly was going on. One of those friends, who has seen it TWICE, actually admitted that a lot of the film didn't make huge amounts of sense to her either. Maybe we're just a bit thick, I don't know. Either way, this is a film full of amazing effects and tons of fantasy, but fails to keep the attention of the audience. I'm sure it'll suffice for the younger audiences, but beyond that it's nothing but a bore. Finally, can I just add that, in my opinion, the best line in the entire film was ""Oh b******ks"". I feel like I have to commend Hugh Laurie for being awesome (as usual). He was one of the few redeeming qualities of this film!",Tomorrowland
438,mizpikasso,It was okay....,7,7 June 2015,"Honestly not what I was expecting. The movie was okay. It could have been better. I suppose it fits the usual Disney movie. George Clooney was his usual handsome and charismatic self, but his contribution didn't make the movie any better, nor did it improve the quality or lack of an interesting enough character development. I understand why there weren't many well known actors. I won't say it wasn't entertaining, but it wasn't the best by far. The visuals were nice, and so were the special effects, though not very many. I can't honestly say I know what age group it would be best to share this movie with, as it seemed to lack many characteristics to hold younger age groups focus, and the overall feel was somewhat slow so not enough to really entertain an adult crowd. Again, it wasn't a horrible movie, just not one of the best, and not on my top recommended list.",Tomorrowland
439,silverfin-56793,I'm 49...and its my all time favourite film,10,4 April 2020,"This is my first review. The only reason im doing this is because for some bizarre reason this film isnt appreciated as it should be. Some of my all time favourite movie scenes are in this movie (the Police Station and Frank's House scenes are hilarious). Its inventive, imaginative, funny, exciting, tender and I wish it had been around when I was a kid.As for some reviewers and critics saying that the film was preachy at the end. Did this film have a message? Yes. Was it hard to hear some of the Hugh Laurie speech? Maybe. Why? The truth hurts sometimes. This film is about hope though and always leaves me with a feeling of just that.It gets an extra star for the best natural screen burp. Seriously hilarious",Tomorrowland
440,stefanborke,This is *also* the future. Or maybe not.,10,30 December 2015,"Spoiler button clicked? Sweet! I always like to click it in case a wuss is out there reading the comments, waiting for their life to be ruined by information pertaining to major plot points. I find it ironic that the preview for this movie uses a lot of footage from the preview in the movie, and a lot of people react to it like George Clooney's character by first being really excited about it, then getting there, being disappointed, and living the rest of their lives in misery in a shack in the middle of nowhere guarded by a holographic dog and a force field whilst monitoring the end of the world. Or trashing the movie on message boards, which is the exact same thing. In any case, the movie wasn't exactly what I expected (or maybe it was and I forgot what I expected going in). Basically I saw it at the library and thought, ""I wanted to see that; it looked like it would be pretty cool!"" And then it turned out to be pretty cool, just as the clam predicted. The movie kind of has a slow burn, and not a lot is revealed going in. This, in a way, is what I consider to be a bit annoying, as the movie begins with the protagonists arguing over who gets to tell the story, and how. I didn't find it quite as funny as I think it was meant to be, perhaps. The whole story is built around the idea that the ills of the world are primarily brought about by our masochistic revelling in anguish, and if we had a more positive outlook on life, things would be better. Or the apocalypse won't happen; that sort of thing. I'm not sure I entirely agree with the movie, but I don't entirely disagree, and I'm not going to get into why or why not here. Point of that is that the protagonists are telling a bunch of robots their story, and as a backdrop that seems a little forced. If you watch it, you might see what I mean. Anyway, that's what I didn't like, and I don't think it's deserving of removing points. Normally, when I read, I have a movie playing in my head, with various actors and actresses playing appropriate parts. The pacing in this reminded me of reading a well-written YA book or something in that general age range, and I have this burning niggling that I've read this before somewhere. I'm certainly not complaining if they ripped it off someone; if they did, this is perhaps the best novel-to-screen adaptation I have ever seen. If not, it is still the best novel-to-screen adaptation I have ever seen. Has its faults, like any movie, but I don't see any reason to be disappointed. Try it; see if you like it. As with anything, your cup of tea isn't the same as mine.",Tomorrowland
441,MikeGJennings,"Family Movies Can Be Smart, Too",9,31 December 2015,"Not sure why this one has gotten such mediocre reviews. The acting is good, both girls did a great job, very believable. Clooney too, but this was an easy one for him I think. The effects are good, and so is the sound. There are a few clumsy edits, but I don't think most people would be bothered by them. The plot is clever. The unpredictable parts are unpredictable because of the complex nature of the science it's tackling, making it an honest-to-God science fiction family film. The plot developments are usually smart and clever. It's really entertaining without pandering or over-explaining. The subtext about humanity's drive toward its own apocalypse is totally legit, the real science bits make sense, the alternate history is almost plausible (complete with a taking into account historical personalities like Edison and Tesla). And it's pretty funny. It also bears multiple viewings.",Tomorrowland
442,davidbowers-62033,Family movie that hits the right spot.,7,21 March 2017,Terrific and well cast. Good family movie as profanity free..! Engaging and entertaining great special effects and a real surprise find. Slick action and fast paced it tells a story that you can only enjoy from the onset.(spoiler alert) Hugh Laurie pulls it off as the villain of the piece. Mr Clooney smooth as ever with just enough gusto not to steal the show but draw you in nether less. Lots to like not much to dislike.A well rounded movie.,Tomorrowland
443,steeplechase,Could've been a 9/10. But then there was endless preaching.,6,30 March 2018,"In this movie the reason for the entire conflict remains in the dark until the very end, which is a very daring idea. I thought it was pulled off kinda nicely, although it did somewhat frustrate me, but not too much, because it helped me relate to the main protagonist. I thought that was neat.
The story was great, the character arcs were solid, the acting was decent, the visuals were good. The only thing I didn't like was that I was sometimes confused about why the focus was on this or that character. I got the impression that some quite important scenes got cut.At one point - I'm guessing 75-80% into the movie - I was prepared to give a 9/10 rating or even higher. This is very rare for me. I can probably count the movies that I rate higher than 8.5/10 on two hands.But then something terrible happened...
The preaching began. And it didn't end. It went on and on. It just didn't end. Even the final moments were all about the preaching. I got so annoyed that I started cursing.
So when I was done watching, my rating dropped a whole three points. You can probably tell, I don't like preachy movies. I don't like them at all. Can you tell? I bet you can tell.How could this awesome movie get screwed up so badly by unneccessary, relentless, unbearable preaching? Who made this terrible decision?
So close. So damn close. I'm so unbelievably disappointed. It could've been one of my all-time favorite movies, it had everything. But they just had to mess it up. They just couldn't help themselves...",Tomorrowland

I had great expectations from what i saw in the movie trailer but i was i little bit suspicious because this movie had a lot bad reviews here. I ve been some times before in the same situation where i had doubts and most of them the movie was total disaster. Like today in a way of speaking. Unfortunately i went to my local cinema and i regret every minute that i lost watching this foolness. I give 2/10 only for some great effects and a little bit for George clooney's acting. Stay away. You will thank me for that advice!,Tomorrowland

449,hal9341,Nostalgic fun,7,26 May 2015,"This film is by no means perfect, but it was much better than I expected it to be. It has a distinctly nostalgic feel, that reminded me of a 50's B movie. The world is going to self destruct, but somehow nothing really dreadful, gory or violent ever takes place. There is no real menace in the movie. The storyline is one of hope and the power of the ""anything is possible"" youthful, idealistic dream. It's great to see the world saved by girls for a change. Both leads, but especially Raffey Cassidy, are great. She will surely go on to great things. Having read a ton of reviews I can see that the CGI generation (especially young men) are very disappointed with it. Conversely, I see that lots of older (40+) people appreciate the films old school, simple charms. We don't need (or want) tons of realistic violence in a film that we understand is meant to be a flight of fancy. Yes, there are plot holes in the story, but that doesn't matter. It's meant to be a fun, light hearted romp where the viewer suspends disbelief. In my opinion it achieves what it sets out to be.",Tomorrowland

And yes it needs this, because that's about it, ideas of another future. It's not only about thinking positive and than everything changes, it is about to start DOING something.It is not a ""real"" science-fiction movie, it is more a fantasy movie to start your imagination. And you have to allow this. A movie about a young girl who asks questions. Who wants to understand it. Who brings adults out of their lethargy, who have given up long ago.Who doesn't see the story of Greta and Fridays for Future made four years before this all started? A prediction of what comes and yeah that is than also pure science fiction. Look carefully at the last scenes of the movie, when it spreads.On the other side it is pretty good entertainment. Humor, emotions, action, future stuff without end, good actors, sometimes unbelievable high pace, a movie like a roller coaster. Fresh, new, different. Absolutely underrated. I love it.",Tomorrowland

I didn't do my homework on this one and it's a good thing as I would have missed an amazingly good film. The first 20 minutes are quite confusing, which is good. I like a mystery. By the end of the movie all is explained. The Sci Fi angle is just right and everything works. The casting is perfect as is the chemistry between virtually all the actors. It is a thoughtful, emotionally rich movie that can be enjoyed by children at one level and adults at another. Don't miss this Disney gem.

There's no reason why she should be invited to Tomorrowland, or her brother - other for being family - in the ending scene. Apparently Tomorrowland is run by nepotism - no wonder it failed in the first place.Whiel the chase scenes involving the humanoid hunter robots are the best scenes in the movie, the fact that innocent bystanders are disintegrated into blue goe for our amusement leaves a bad taste. Even more so when all of them are cops or guards doing their job. Quite the questionable message the movie leaves there.",Tomorrowland

Not sure why people think it's the worst they've ever seen....The movie was well written. I felt it was a fairly smooth script, didn't jump around like others have mentioned. Was easy to follow, and I was never lost. The actors and actresses were great! all great choices, they all performed very well. The visual effects were just incredible, one of the most beautifully looking movie I've seen this year. The idea of the pins was awesome, and the way they showed it was great. There is only one thing I was a bit confounded with, was when she touches the pin to find the city, she completely forgets she is also still cemented in the real world... But besides that there aren't any stupid things the characters do. The ending was good, nothing spectacular, but the film is really carried in the first 2 acts, the 3rd isn't as good, but is still great. Hugh Laurie was a nice addition to the cast and played it perfectly. The film was funny, witty, but not over the top. Kept me in aw over what was going on. Well worth seeing it in the theaters. This movie, along with others he has done, has gotten me very excited for what he'll do for a Star Wars Anthology film!",Tomorrowland
455,MJSousa,"tells you what is wrong, then takes those who could make it right",5,2 October 2015,"Possible spoilers ahead. My 5 stars are for the CGI only. The movie sucks. The characters are uninteresting and there are too few of them. There are about a dozen actors in the whole movie - with speaking roles that is. If I count only those who have speaking roles throughout, then I can only remember 5, 6 if you count the little brother who has 5 minutes of dialogue in the beginning of the movie. The story line is full of holes and to me, doesn't tell a good story. Basically, this film tells us that the world can be fixed with optimism - pessimism is what will kill us all. Highly simplistic and unrealistic. Then in the end, the other dimension, which was being responsible for the end of earth to begin with, goes on to take all the people on earth who could fix earth's problems. The ending, more than anything else, made this movie a dud for me. Shame, because the CGI was really cool. And the smart girl?

It really made you feel like you were part of the movie, (and I'm not just saying this) because of the unique elements that captivated your senses. However, and I do want to point out as well that some of the recent Disney movies have had a lackluster in quality. Well I'm here to tell you now that Disney has redeemed itself with Tomorrow land, it is a remarkable story with well-chosen actors/actresses. Characters range from a variety of personalities, in which some develop throughout the whole movie, while other characters remain static.

It turns out to be a movie mostly set in present day with an environmental message.

I am a big Disney fan because they make cleaner movies that are family oriented so perhaps I am biased. I would recommend this move to anyone that can allow themselves to be immersed into a fiction and not critical of every little detail. The special effects were amazing, the script was good, and I left feeling motivated and not filled with negative, vulgar, and gratuitous content.I go to a movie to be taken away and be engrossed by the movie and that is exactly what I was able to do with this movie.",Tomorrowland

461,islambadran,"Had the potential of becoming an original movie, nothing major here just a Disney extravaganza!!",7,21 May 2015,"First of all, I had greater hopes by entering this movie that George Clooney was going to kill it in the Sci-Fi movie genre, unfortunately I was disappointed. He didn't seem to fit the role, I don't know why, honestly he seemed to be a little sloppy and unfit physically, plus his performance I can see that he tried his best, but his character did not just fill that major role in the movie. Maybe a more younger actor, would have fitted the role better and speaking of actors, the other two major roles in this movie depicted by Britt Robertson and Raffey Cassidy were top notch acting that I believe without them the movie would have failed drastically. Britt Robertson helped by her stunning good looks and performance, will be a major actor of Hollywood in the upcoming years, maybe the next Julia Roberts or Meryl Streep. The other young girl in this movie Raffey Cassidy, I have no words to describe her, she is very likable and just overloaded with cuteness, that at times I think my eyes teared up a little bit. Aside from the film's good looks and terrific graphics, it was heart capturing in the beginning, but then that all went to waist after the movie laked a compelling story and ending. In the mind of a nine year old, this movie will probably be embedded deep in his/her memory, no questions about that, but to anyone above their 20's or little bit younger, save your hardship of going through and watching this movie and go see a real life movie. It felt like torture to watch this movie expecting to be a major Sci-Fi flick of the year, and to end up experiencing a movie that feels like something of a Disney movie unfortunately. The movie was very forgettable even before the closing scene, it felt empty and lacking that drive that good directors put in a good movie.I had to mention the horrible wardrobe on George Clooney and Hugh Laurie's characters, I wanted to stab my eyes so badly, very poor choices, maybe a 10 year old would have had better ideas. Last but not least, it is very heartbreaking to see all the effort put in this movie like the amazing visual design and graphics and all the people behind the camera go to waste.",Tomorrowland

But the most important part for me is how a movie inspires people so much, This got an 8 from me because it really opens my mind so much I was so happy to watch it, I really get it why Disney made this movie. we need movies like this but with more logic and more marketing stuff because a good, inspiring movie is not enough really",Tomorrowland

It is good story telling for young and old people (adults) all together. It has been a very good and very pleasant feeling. It had some action in to it and smart, scientific comedy all together. Which we all could actually understand and laugh about! (sorry for those who doesn't, you are awesome too!)Now about the story: The story of this movie ""Tomorrowland"" was very unexpected. I would never thought someone with a mind like mine (sorry if this sounds selfish but I am trying not to) made a story like this and brought it on the big screen. It is actually a huge step to the truth the people should know from the story. especially, the message. It got me very exited. The reason why people mostly don't like movies like this is because of the message. I am not blaming you guys for it, and it is totally normal. You just may have experienced this in a movie for the first time. But in reality, you may have encountered the same explanation the movie is telling about. It has been great how the writers and Brad Bird have pulled it off.I would love some sequel to this movie and I am really looking forward to it in the near future. I might want to work on it together too. I would love to! Especially in movies like this or story telling. Great job on making this movie and having the courage to bring it on the big screen. It was my dream to do so. By the way, I am not having a great review writing because I like it myself.Note: It is fair reviewing and having some own opinions to it and explanation to those who don't understand. And if you still didn't, moral of the story: do you want to live in a great planet with peace, harmony and a future where we are all equals (as human beings)? Then don't just sit there and wait for it to happen before your eyes because the one that changes the world is you doing it. More working instead of sitting around. If you want to achieve something, you do something for it. Reading, working and having fun with those around you and an equal way. Because we are all human beings. We are all individuals with different characters who can support one another.That is the moral of the story. NEVER GIVE UP! It tries to wake you up from the hope you have giving up. Because if you look around you, you can see how big the universe is we are living in. There is plenty of hope. Come out the box or the dark room and explore the world you are born in. And never give up the hope on it and achieve your dreams as having peace with everyone.

So again this is a Disney feel good movie, expect nothing else and you will thoroughly enjoy this movie. Despite all of the negative reviews, I still want a tomorrow land pin.

The reviews implied I'd be wasting my time so I wasn't expecting much. They were WRONG! This is a delicious mix of sci-fi and fantasy which reunites you with the child inside and reminds you of the time when anything was possible. There is more than a hint of the work of Jules Verne here, but this film is very much of our time. It uses alternative dimensions and future possibilities to explore topical issues with a message of hope rather than hopelessness.Give it a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",Tomorrowland
469,ChoppedBrainCritic,Interstellar for Kids,7,23 May 2015,"I am from Ukraine and just learn English, sorry for mistakes guys) When I first looked trailer ""Future Earth"", I mistakenly thought that it would be a pretty serious movie, and probably could have guessed that the film from studio Disney, on the grounds of the attraction in the amusement park can not be so, but I thought about it already later .. The basic message is put into the beginning of the film - a parable, if a bit to simplify it, meaning that in every person there is a struggle, a struggle to match metaphorical two wolves, a wolf evil, the other wolf is good, well, the winner is the wolf that you ""feed.""  The visual component of one of the few pluses in the movie, despite the fact that I looked, unfortunately, not IMAX version and the picture is still pleasing to the eye. Itself the ""Land of the Future"" to do more in retro-futuristic style, that is the way people imagine the future 20-30 years ago, I reminded her a little of the city of Columbia BioShock Infinite) but alas, the main events of the film take place most of the time in our reality, and about how the future of the city, we almost did not report, plot holes the way, one of the main ""chip"" of the film, I think not even worth listing, a lot of them)  George Clooney played solidly, but not much else, for him this film, I think will soon be taking place, but Hugh Laurie in the role of the main villain does not open, as did not really understand the motives of actions of his character, Britt Robertson as Casey in my view unjustifiably paid the most attention, but really liked the Athena played by Raffi Cassidy, despite her age of 15, there is in it some zest and charisma. Interstellar get such children who want to be compared with the attraction that inspired and Damon Lindelof to create a film, if you have already come to the park with your family once you can ride, but to go a second time on the same ride would not want to.",Tomorrowland
470,quolik,The best one if you get it,10,24 May 2015,"It took me two viewings to really appreciate true value of the movie.First watching I liked its idea but not much the childiness of the story which looked a bit too naive and simple. After that I thought I wouldn't watch this movie soon.But something dragged me to it again few days later, some feeling that... I want more of this, despite all the children and awkwardly adulty Clooney... so I watched it again! What was that??The thing is, now I think, like a good song always creates certain state in your mind when you listen to it, some movies also have that property not only to tell a story and give emotions and thoughts and all, but to awake and support some very specific part of you and help it live and grow in your real life, even when the movie is over. The movie that helps you create ""you"" that you like and want to be.Paradox is, this feature of ""Tomorrowland"" is exactly what this movie is about. Does the outside world shape what is in your mind or your mind shapes the outside world?The movie contains some Ayn Rand'ian ideas crossreferenced with ""Think and Grow Rich""-like attitude to life and creating the Today by perseverant vision of the desired Tomorrow. All in very likable package of Disney action movie, with greatly lovable actors (especially girls, Casey and Athena) who during second viewing were already like family to me, which in turn made all storytelling, dialogs and everything, more warm and pleasant than the first time. And it will be so next time too, I'm sure.Allegedly, not everyone will perceive the movie this way. In ""Forbes"" review they wrote something like: ""the movie is terrific, but most people won't like it"". Why, is it because their minds are already possessed by wrong forces too much? Because message to ""dream and act"" is already too unrealistic in their reality? Too many obstacles are in the way to that vision? Far out of the comfort zone? ""It is not for me"" feeling? I don't know.But those who get it, will like it and then, maybe, love it, regardless of their age. Watch it twice to be sure.",Tomorrowland
471,leah_g461,So Disappointing,3,7 June 2015,"Uuuuuughhhhh. This movie was awful. And I really WANTED it to be good. I mean, Brad Bird, Disney, time travel, futuristic city, good family fun, right? NOOOO. Try gratuitous violence (albeit robot violence that looks conveniently, completely like actual human violence). I mean, it's like I can hear the writers now.""Hey, man, this movie doesn't have a lot going for it. We need some gratuitous violence to fill some time and stretch this thing out."" ""Nah, dude, this a family film. Violence like that'll get us a Restricted rating.""""Hold up. Let's just make them all robots!"" That scene from Clueless kept popping into my head where Cher's like - until mankind can stop being so violent, why should we take it out of shows that need it for entertainment value?And then there's the story. Or lack thereof. It went NO WHERE. My entire family left the theater early so we don't know how it ended, and I really think none of us even cared. And I really wanted it to be good. Thanks Disney.",Tomorrowland
472,tooth_chocolate,"not bad, but it could be better",5,1 September 2015,"This movie had potential. The concept was original and interesting. The cast was not bad. It was all very promising and the movie did also not bad, but it sure could have done better. There is not much to say about the good things in the movie. It was all not bad. stunning pictures, one interesting character, the idea (Spoilers) that thinking it could get worse let things get worse and intelligent and kind people, who wanted to help, but with the time, they just get to upset with the world and its stupidity that they lost their hope. All very interesting stuff and thoughts, but here comes the problem with the film.The movie wasn't good constructed. It didn't ""packed"" the story and its ideas well. For example (maybe spoiler), when the movie starts you can see George Clooney and Britt Robertson taking a video. They seemed to be in a really good mood. Then Clooney starts to tell the their story and the movie starts for real and that whole thing is a really big problem in this movie I think, because after this opening, no matter what danger they may have to face, you know they will get safely away, because in the end of the movie they will take this happy video. So we have already a pay off without even knowing the set up. It's just like, I don't know what the movie is about, but I already know it's going to be all good. It makes it way less exiting. The other thing that disturbed me a bit is the humour. It's to childish for my taste and somehow ridiculous especially the actors. They fall several times of the stairs, very funny... But that's maybe just a personal thing. The characters were not bad, the robot kid, who was played by Raffey Cassidy was even quite interesting, but in general the characters were a bit too stereotypical. My bottom line is that the movie was not bad but it wasn't good packed. There was no harmony between the story, characters and the message they wanted to send. In my opinion the film would be better as an animation. The world would be even more stunning, the action more spectacular and the humour and gags wouldn't seem so ridiculous.",Tomorrowland

However we choose to think positive or negative can affect the future. The future is not set, The future can be bright.The acting from Raffey Cassidy was Amazing, she can act. The way she carries out her expressions is on par with Actresses like Emma stone and Jennifer Laurence. I hope Disney makes more movies like this.

474,vstein-22288,a girl does not give up and saves the world,8,13 June 2015,"The movie is intended for middle-school students, with overwhelming special effects and George Clooney as the main attractions. The plot is very complicated, with many sudden shifts in space and time. A central character is a boy who loves science and engineering and then grows up and gets convinced by an evil force that the humans are doomed. The main hero is a girl who never gives up.The water shortage is mentioned as the first peril the humans face but a usual litany of other catastrophes is also mentioned. Clooney believes he knows when and how the world ends. The girl does not agree. You can guess who is right in the end of movie.The movie reminds me two other movies I saw recently. One is Interstellar. The main peril is shortage of food, and the main villain, Michael Mann inflates temperature at a remote planet. The second one is Kingsman The main villain, Valentine is fighting global warming by destroying humans. It is more funny than Tomorrowland but has graphic violence.The common features for all 3 movies are the abundance of spectacular futuristic effects and the overpopulation theory as the root of all perils. A nice trick in Tomorrowland is that no humans or animals are killed. So it has PG rating.Cloomy is great for his role. The girl (Britt Robertson) matches him well. Of course, it takes a second girl, Raffey Cassidy to natch him even better.",Tomorrowland
475,sanctuaryfan,"A good, enjoyable movie",9,7 June 2015,"I loved this movie. A good science fiction story, with humor, drama and action very well balanced. It's refreshing and somewhat different from typical SF movies due to the heroes of the story, their ages and status. I saw the trailer and had high expectations and the movie surprised me in the sense of not so much SF and special effects as I expected, but the story makes up for that on another level - interactions and possibilities. Of course there are some clichés like the end of the world, robots and some genius kids, but, come on that's such a probable future we are coming to... I recommend this movie and hope you enjoy it also.",Tomorrowland
476,bunkie-94657,An under-appreciated gem,9,31 May 2015,"First off, the movie does have some issues. The pacing and exposition set the viewer up to expect somewhat more in terms of seeing the future. Also, I'm not much of a George Clooney fan, I think he has very limited range.But having said that, this is a future classic. The best comparison I can make is to classic Frank Capra films. More than anything, this film has heart. As with Capra's best work, this movie requires something of its viewers. It leaves no room for cynicism or a passive need to simply be entertained. Perhaps that's asking a lot of a movie-going public looking for laser battles, apocalyptic wasteland scenes and lots of explosions. If you are a dreamer, if the thought of our retreat from an attitude that we can solve our problems and build a better world makes you cringe, this is the movie for you. Others have lauded George Miller for making a the latest Mad Max movie. That movie depressed me and, despite it's well-crafted scenes, I couldn't wait for it to end. I walked out saddened that seeing a miserable mess of of a world is considered great entertainment. Tomorrowland, on the other hand, is a call to action, a challenge to the souls who believe that a better world can be achieved and who are willing to work to make it so. I believe that the complaint that this isn't a proper Disney movie is completely off-base. From the very beginning, Walt himself saw a better future and the inclusion of Tomorrowland in his parks and his passion for EPCOT prove this. Walt would have loved this movie. That so many people shy away from the message speaks volumes. Capra was a dreamer, but he also understood that dreams become real only when people refuse to give up and he used film as way to inspire. Tomorrowland is a message, a call to arms for those of us tired of the negativity, those who can remember the future as a better place and who are willing to resist the darkness of the soul that separate us from a better tomorrow. Despite its flaws, I loved this movie more than anything I've seen in a very long time.",Tomorrowland

And this same group of people who find it ""boring"" are the ones who do not see the bigger picture and get that soul sinking feeling when at some point in the movie,you will feel it (like when you watch avatar). I get that visually the movie does portray what the world has become and what is happening to us humans and if you are not a dreamer, that is all you can see. Just machines,genius,world destruction,dimensions and a bunch of people talking crap. But for me, and i believe many others, the dreamers as the movie says, believe that the message is stronger than what you see. Watch it with an open heart. If you don't know how, think wall-e or avatar. Its a beautiful movie.",Tomorrowland

Then it started to get the feeling they were skipping character, plot etc details and trying to move the story on as fast as they could, and as things got faster and faster your connection with the characters got less and less. Only to be revived once in a while by a forced emotional scene. By the end either the writer either just gave up or they edited to ensure they fitted in to 4.3 seconds. The end left me thinking, well, what? what just happened?It could have been so much more, more time and detail needed to go into the characters and the story needed to evolve more naturally and not be pushed/rushed. Could have even split it up into 2 movies, allowing us to explore the characters worlds more and to connect with them better.A good watch despite what I've mentioned, just could have been so much more, like so many movies these days.",Tomorrowland
480,jdylan-99321,Best Film of the Year!,10,31 May 2015,"It's rare for me to walk into a theater and watch a film that I instantly love. Even more rare is when I get sucked into such a film, and loose my ""director's eye"" that exposes every angle, cut, and page from the script within my own mind. However, if there was such a director who's consistently done this, it's Brad Bird. The Iron Giant, The Incredibles, and Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol are some of my favorites films of all time, and greatly inspired me as a filmmaker.Yet, none of the previously mentioned films add up to how I feel about Tomorrowland! It is one of those films you watch, and are never the same afterwords. It takes a rather happy weekend and makes it even better. It uplifts you when you didn't realize that you were down, and perfectly stimulates your imagination! It enters your thoughts and will most likely be there, somewhere, in the back of your mind by the time you die. - It's a film you'll always remember.Perfectly blending Cyberpunk AND Steampunk to create a fictional world is no easy feat. I probably would have said it was impossible before seeing Tomorrowland, but, now, am convinced that the two sub-genres can perfectly work together in harmony! The visuals, jokes, pacing, action, and acting are all on par - a staple of Brad Bird's films. While I could see how some may pass up this film if they aren't ones for Back to the Future or The Rocketeer, everyone else will enjoy this film.I feel like this is almost an understatement, but, I put Tomorrowland as my 3rd favorite film of all time! It's perfect, in every sense of the word - maintaining a realistic image, while not taking itself too seriously. Tomorrowland has it all. I'm already fairly certain it'll be my favorite film of the year. I'd recommend that everyone go see it sometime. It doesn't have the hype of something like James Cameron's Avatar, but easily deserves it!",Tomorrowland
481,camerdude,Fun piece of a bigger puzzle,10,3 June 2015,"My review may be a little bias. I have been anticipating this movie for years. I played along with the alternate reality game, the Optimist, they did a couple of years ago about the concept. That was incredibly intriguing. I was at the D23 expo when they went through the ""dusty box"" of artifacts. The tomorrowland exhibit and app was by far the highlight of the expo. I also read the book ""Before Tomorrowland"" before watching the movie.Such a deep world that they created through other sources of media, well before the movie, sold me. It is such an ambitious and captivating project. And this was all years before the movie came out.Then the movie came out and I heard it was such a financial flop. I thought I was going to be disappointed after years of waiting based on some reviews. But I definitely was not. It added to this world that I already was sold on. It was fun and left me wanting to see it again.I realize that a vast, vast majority of those who see it will not have read the book, or tried to piece together the clues from the app. Asking that type of commitment is ambitious for the casual moviegoer and that probably made people walk away from the movie like they missed something (because they did). But I applaud this type of original concept, unique marketing, and positive story. I HIGHLY recommend seeing it. I also recommend doing you own exploration into Tomorrowland with the app or book. This type of creative ambition should be supported and does not deserve to be a flop.",Tomorrowland
482,nepalimac,Better than the reviews will have you believe.,9,5 June 2015,"A little bit of context is in order for this review. I had heard tons of reviews for this film before I saw it in the theater. People had continuously mentioned plot errors and complaints about the CGI. I went into this film expecting it to be mediocre at best. But I grossly misinformed about this film. Director Brad Bird has blown me away once again. Maybe I have such a high regard for this film because I expected it to be worse but I still stand by my opinion. So I would like to discuss things about the movie in both a Spoiler-free and spoiler filled segments. SPOILER FREE: The film is incredibly stunning in regards to the camera work. There is a long shot near the beginning of the movie that was done spectacularly. The acting is phenomenal. Clooney steps away from his Suave type-casting and plays a grumpy old man in a great, great way. The main actress is perfect for the role. Her sass, optimism, and overall presence on screen is captivating. For a film that has its plot based on a theme park ride, it dawns a script that creates interesting,human characters along with a narrative that feels fluid and realistic (as realistic as a kid's sci-fi movie can be). SPOILER ZONE: Most of this has to do with the complaints. Many were irritated at the villain's motivation. They said he didn't seem like much of a bad guy at all. If anything he was misunderstood. I agree and disagree with this statement. Yes, he was very misunderstood. But in context, how could a super genius who was given charge of creating this world be anything but misunderstood? It would seem ludicrous for someone of that position to be a complete psycho that has no motivation to do what he does. His writing makes sense in context and although that loses some of his villainy, it makes the story more well rounded. Complaints about the CGI have come from the same type of critics: people who prefer practical effects. Yes, practical is superior in many ways, but that does not mean CGI in today's film industry cannot be astounding like it is in this film. Nothing feels fake, only futuristic and glimmering. Some people confuse this with unrealistic. Again, the long shot used in the film utilizes many artificial moments that are still breathtaking and fun. (And to the reviewer who said Mad Max had better effects because of its reliance on practical over CGI, I recommend they re-watch the Sand storm scene in that film and tell me the CGI on that didn't make the movie a whole lot better). Lastly, people who were confused as to the premise of the film. Why would all the world's best and brightest be brought to a place away from the world where they are needed? This is a good point. One that I find difficult to argue. The point given in the movie is that they are surrounded by pessimists who hold the ""dreamers"" back from their true potential. It's not much of an explanation and the audience is just left to deal with the fact that this movie was based off a Disneyland ride. This is partially why i gave this film only 9 stars. END OF SPOILERS Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. And this movie is no exception. Some people hate the movie because it stretched the definition of a PG rating (If you're worried, then see it with your kid like the rating suggests). Some practical junkies are still furious because the jet packs in the film weren't puppets on strings. What they fail to notice is that this film is a humorous, well- acted, well photographed film that deserves to be watched. There's so much to this film that is enjoyable that it can't be ignored. Sure, it's not perfect. No film is, or ever will be. But the normal lover of movies knows that films aren't about being perfect but about having a good time watching. My opinion of this movie is that it deserves 9/10 stars. Sorry for the long post, but thanks for reading :)",Tomorrowland

I never imagine that a Disney movie was going to that, yes, Disney, known his previous productions, like Cinderella, Beverly Hills Chihuahua, and more.

To dream and build a better world, instead of accepting the way things are going bad, is very noble and important. I also think, that the lead characters did a good job and it was fun watching them acting together. But... the plot was not very good at all. It was just a poor standard plot with good guys and a bad guy and one that sacrifices himself. And in the end the ""problem solving"" of the movie was, to just blow it all up. Altogether the third act was a total mess. Another thing I disliked was the ""villain"". I think it was not necessary to even have one. Why not solve the problem together in the end!?!?! The People of ""Tomorrowland"" are the good guys, the dreamers after all. Solving the problem together would have been the stronger message. That the leader of the ""Tomorrowland"" wants to destroy mankind, destroys the message of the movie after all. In the end of the movie the people who should bring hope are the ones who have given up... and had to be killed. Another question is, why all the dreamers are taken away from earth!?!? Aren't they doing the same mistake...again!?!? After all the movie has a great strong message with an idea which has a lot of potential, but it was reduced to a simple good vs evil plot, instead of going into details with the really interesting issues like ""solving the problems"" and I mean the real problems of mankind... and wouldn't it had been great if they did it TOGETHER!!!!!",Tomorrowland

In plot no special turns, everything goes on as usual. The special effects are, well, for the good of Disney fairy tale level that the actual film is.

All the acting performances in this movie are wonderful and the humour is first rate. The soundtrack too is especially good. A great soundtrack improves a story enormously. I decided to turn on the subtitle channel on the DVD to follow all the dialogue and this also helps on the first viewing to follow the narrative better. I am supposed to type out a minimum of 10 lines according to the rules but to do this I would have to put some spoilers in and so therefore I am going to try and waffle for as long as possible to fill out because I do not wish to spoil anyone else's enjoyment of Tomorrowland.,Tomorrowland

But it was like 90% of the movie was setting it up and building the plot. 5% was the story and the rest of the 5% was a rushed ending that should have been where the story actually started. While watching we were really enjoying it until we realized it was already ending with no real plot to end with. The main female character also just magically jumps to all these conclusions to portray herself as really smart but it makes no sense. I wouldn't even have minded a 6 hour movie to accommodate their 90% long intro. It just seems like they started something great, got sick of it and just ended it as fast as possible.

492,jlclark-88700,Why all the hate?,9,7 September 2021,"I loved this movie.The pacing and storytelling was a bit off at the beginning of the movie. I could see my family getting a little restless during this point. But once the storytelling sorted itself out, they re-engaged. Give it a chance. This movie is not reinventing storytelling and it will not revolutionize how you look at film. The heart of this movie is what sold it for me.I think that the overall message of the future not being written yet and the optimism that can be found in trying to earnestly make the world better than you found it is captivating.Hugh Laurie's character declared that humanity doesn't want to take the effort today to save the future because it costs nothing to accept the darkness that is coming. The effort to make life better takes hard work and care today to make the future better. That can be evident how easily we all just accept the negative parts of life. I myself have been guilty of it. Being a grownup in the modern world can wear you down. You forget how powerful we can be and how we can all affect positive change.But the notion of the positive future we can build if we cast aside the greed of politics and the selfishness that can come from that is infectious. It made me want to sit down at my drawing table and just create when I was a more optimistic younger man. Sometimes that optimism is buried under the acceptance of what life is right now.I can certainly see some criticism for this movie and everyone is entitled to their opinion. It's not a perfect movie. But this simple story found a way to tap into that same powerful optimism inside us all. It's not often that a movie does that.Give it a chance. The absolutely hateful negative reviews that I have read just confuse me. It's not a top ten movie for me, but it's now in my ""happy to watch again"" list. I will gladly watch it again and plan to very soon.",Tomorrowland
493,gabrielohara,A rather misunderstood movie,9,23 March 2017,"I expected a movie by Disney to be one of spectacular design and appeal to viewers of all ages. Well in a way they did appeal to a certain group of people.... just not to the masses that watch the typical Disney film and milk as much money as they can from it. I would call this the successor to Tron (1982) in the graphical sense. It will eventually become a cult classic in oh say 30 years or so and maybe by then we can look back and say hey maybe the movie wasn't so bad or for all we know, we may have flying cars and floating swimming pools and unlimited energy by then.... Who knows?My hat is off for Brad Bird's extraordinary work of creating a world of which the best minds of our time set aside politics and their differences to make a better world for themselves and humanity. Come think of it, it isn't that hard to believe that such a feat is possible but hey we live in a world where we have poverty and obesity at the same time so I'm not sure where we stand yet.The world Brad created was indeed convincing to me (I convinced some of my friends that the events were real by Disney's marketing then showed them the movie and laughing my ass off). The problem this had was poor storytelling. The graphics are on point and I expect nothing less from a Disney film but the story well felt hollow and is like a prequel to something greater. Of which I want to point out that if the book that came out with the movie plot was used instead, man I would expect a sequel in development right now. So yes and no, the world created is good, CGI is amazing, the cast is perfect but story? Its missing something vital. I'll see you guys in 30 years or so when Disney quits playing safe and get out of the money pool they are in and once again experiment with movies that explore our future instead of dwelling on the past",Tomorrowland

This is every bit the most imaginative, epic, entertaining film you could ever hope to see in the theater. My wife and I (in our 40s) along with our two kids (age 9 and 12) all absolutely LOVED this film! For a film to equally excite and entertain all members of the family as this one did is truly something special.Add to that the wonderful and welcome positive messages of finding good in yourself and others and being the change you want to see in the world (among others). This was not only a visual treat, but a delight in every way from the acting to the storytelling. Look, I can be picky too, but those who are picking on this film must be the ones who didn't get a Tomorrowland pin. (You'll have to see the movie to find out what that means.) :-) ENJOY!P.S. This movie will not appeal to negative people. Those who are critical of it are showing their true colors, without even realizing it. If you consider yourself a positive person, a dreamer, or a visionary... go see this film and be inspired. Everyone else, just shut your trap... this obviously wasn't for you, and the world doesn't revolve around you. Sure, we're all entitled to our own opinions, but it saddens me to think that many people will not see this movie because of some very vocal naysayers.

501,Nymnn,What? Why didn't Tomorrowland receive higher reviews? It's a lovely adventure story of hope and imagination. It's a fairytale land for the curious.,9,5 February 2016,"What? Why didn't Tomorrowland receive higher reviews? It's a lovely adventure story of hope and imagination. It's a fairytale land for the curious.It's an innocent feel good film and reminiscent of Disney's 1997 Meet the Robinsons. The movie does leave you feeling something powerful. It does make you want to get up and do something. I love that it's so very uplifting.It's not a film that is going to blow your mind, it's not dark and gritty but give it a shot. I wouldn't even call it just a popcorn movie.",Tomorrowland
502,prateek-parekh19,Tomorrowland is a great movie for the kids but not without it's fair share of platitudes and clichés,7,21 May 2015,"Tomorrowland is visually very appealing. You can sense that a lot of attention has been given to details like the uniforms, people and technology of the future. It is pretty believable and makes you want to be a part of the story. Credits to the composer for the accompanying soundtrack. Even though you get the feeling that you have heard it in other movies before it goes well with the cinematography and the story line. The biggest strength of Tomorrowland is its unique and compelling plot. It's a very fresh idea and you're constantly engaged to know what will happen next. It is packed with a surprising amount of action sequences and something that you'd probably not expect from a PG movie targeted primarily at kids.Where the movie excels is instilling this idea in the audience that they are more than a mere participant in the future. No matter what problems engulf us (natural disasters, surveillance state, epidemics) they have the ability to fix it and create something better. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't have the universal appeal of movies like Toy Story or Wall-e which can be enjoyed regardless of your age. Tomorrowland is not without a lot of clichés and platitudes where it's not so subtle about the positive messages it's trying to impart to the audience. Instead, it keeps badgering us over and over on why it's important for us to be good. The main character does a decent job but can be annoying at times when the film is trying to portray how brilliant and special she is. You never really understand what her special ability is besides being optimistic and knowing ""how things work"". It's not convincing when she can easily solve problems that her scientist dad who works for NASA is grappling with. Overall, it's a good movie to watch with your family, but don't expect it to have the lasting impression that some of the other Disney/Pixar movies have.",Tomorrowland
503,amb-rose,"Entertaining movie, weird message",7,22 May 2015,"While this movie was very entertaining and fun, the message at the end of the movie confused me. As this movie is geared towards kids, I found it weird how they were basically trying to tell them, if the world ends, don't worry, we can work towards creating and fixing a new one. I found it interesting how there was really no message towards fixing the planet we currently have. I thought the entire time I was watching it, that the ""tomorrowland"" was the earth in the future, unless it was and I'm confused. This is what I'm saying, the message is confusing. Nevertheless, the CGI is impeccable, the story is very interesting and the actress who played Athena was incredible. I can see her going very far in her career (hopefully because I loved her That much!)",Tomorrowland
504,Damon016,Negative reviews? Really?,10,25 September 2015,"I do not review films, just because I watch so many and I am greatly disappointed by them. I think the people who have watched this and gave it 1 start simply are simple minded and don't understand the movie at all or what it's getting at. Sad really because it really is a fantastic flick for adults and for young ones alike (13+ due to maybe 2 bad words). I (unlike others) won't give away the movie nor express my thoughts on what you should or should not believe. That is what is so great about this movie. It touches on such a wide variety of topics and views that if 200,000 people watch the movie you would get 200,000 different points of view. I don't care for SciFi and don't really consider this to be as much a SciFi movie as many others. It's well written, the little boy, the young man that played the brother, and the two young ladies could all be leads here. They really immerse you into the movie and for 2 hours you really feel like you're in a better place. My disappointment came when the movie was over. I was wanting more. I guess the simple minded don't get that or lack that imagination.Definitely see this movie. I have watched it twice and it was better the second time around. Tomorrowland was a hit...",Tomorrowland
505,vexslasher2,Great Movie,10,12 July 2015,"It's a great movie if you like the futuristic type films this is must. Everyone in my family liked this movie it has a very creative flow to it. I dunno why so many are saying bad things about it, I'd see it again even and I'm 26 years old so it's great for adults and kids a like. I suggest you give this movie a chance and just ignore all the bad posts people have made. Don't let those other comments keep you from seeing this I really enjoyed it and am glad I went. A lot of people want either no violence or a lot of violence, this show does have some violence but it's not really like bloody violence at all. I think part of what people might have not liked about this show was a comment about fat people but it was the truth most of America is over weight it's not really our fault though it's the food industry they have created this problem and they don't care because they make more money the more food you eat, they put addictive additives on purpose and throw sugar in everything saying it makes it last longer, which sure that's true but it also help contribute to weight gain.",Tomorrowland
506,althotos,Had More Potential,8,1 June 2015,"I liked the movie and I thought it had a good story going for the majority of the movie. I thought Athena was endearing and maybe ironic that she was named after the Goddess of Wisdom. I'm just not sure what the point of the movie was and I'm not so sure about the ""trans- dimensional"" idea of a futuristic world of hope and possibility. If this movie was supposed to warn us about the ecological dangers of uncontrolled technology and human greed, I think there are much better movies out there that convey that message. This movie should have stuck to the hope and possibility track as it's main theme. Also,Hugh Laurie, one of my favorite actors, was severely underutilized in this movie. He should have had a much greater role. All in all it could have been better, but then again Damon Lindelof's name is attached to it, so it's more murky and muddled thinking like most of his other projects. I thought this movie had much more potential and was bit to explanatory, which tended to slow it down. I'll still add it to my movie library when it comes out on DVD.",Tomorrowland

I've read a number of the reviews posted here and it appears that many of the writers have never heard of ""suspension of disbelief"".

Most of the time the movie gave the vibe of one of those promo films that are often run while you are waiting in line of a amusement park attraction. We were waiting for the doors to swing open and to be instructed to enter the trolleys and fasten seat-belts. Pins are for sale for 3,75 $ at the exit.The only thing that didn't fit in was the length of the movie. A very thin storyline was dressed up with all kinds of side-steps extending the movie to over 2 hours. With the ultimate message being: Think Positive and all will be well. A message brought in such a childish way during the anti-climax of the movie that it got the feel of a teen movie.",Tomorrowland

We had a great discussion. Highly recommend. The strongest language used was ""hell"". This would be a great project for a homeschool group discussion, class discussion, teaching values, the importance of not complaining but actually giving to the community. How its not about us but about all the earth. I also liked the fact that the teenage stars were normal ""girl next door"" types -- not made up or Hollywood fancy, but natural beauty and determination in changing the world one person at a time, and caring about others.",Tomorrowland

Sure the World Fair in 1964 was white, that is historically acurate.But in the 'future' all are white (except the one diversity hire as the female astronaut, that does not count. Especially since they gave her (parents) an Indian accent while no one else has an accent).The whole population is white.

Those are high praises if you are actually expecting science from a science fiction. The basic gist is that something can be done and to just look for a solution rather than be defeatist. That is all the movie is supposed to represent. It does not advocate anything besides optimism which can go a long, long way. So great movie, truly. It does not provide answers other than whatever you produce personally will combine with everyone else efforts. So produce something good instead of being careless and producing something wasteful.",Tomorrowland

However, the writing is poor (with a lot of cliché), without interesting surprises. Moreover, the movie is very cold. It could have focused more on the beauty of the dreamer's dreams.

I haven't seen such a bad movie for ages as i constantly watch movies once or twice a week and really adore Disney movies in general. This was not Disney-like as i know it. Really not recommending. I think the film has only good marketing and George Clooney in it which makes it interesting for other people, but it is the first GC-movie which has really disappointed me.

Without giving anything away I will say the movie is very centered around this positive message of a good and bright future. Most people seemed offended by this idea and tear this movie apart. But really Brad Bird just wants people to get excited about the future again, which I agree is something we should be doing. But people instead say this movie is preachy and boring and sloppy and just rip apart Bird's goal for this movie. Most people expect a totally different movie going into it, which I think is part of the ""disappointment"" people are getting. I honestly think this movie is a great culmination of good storytelling and a good old ending that'll leave you inspired for the future... Or if your not me hating this movie to death. Go into it clean, don't expect anything or take anybody else's opinions into view and just enjoy Tomorrowland.",Tomorrowland

I thought the story, special effects and especially the message were ambitious and important. The plot was unpredictable and it was absolutely an original script. Maybe the movie moved too slow when when compared with the high-octane superhero movies that are so popular, but this is a great movie. Brad Bird is master, and I especially loved the acting of the kids in this movie. I loved the 1964 World Fair flashbacks, and everything seemed authentic and believable. Basing a movie after Disneyland was genius, and I hope to see more! Tomorrowland is a great family movie, with lots to talk about after the movie ended!

This movie was just so disappointing and bad.. I expected a nice sci-fi movie with a good plot and great story. However it turned out the opposite. An hour into the movie nothing had really happened, the story plot was still unclear. Hell, even when the movie ended great parts of the story were just plain silly. What can you expect from a Disney blockbuster I suppose. My advice: don't waste your time on this. I'm surprised they even got George Clooney to take part in this baloney movie.

518,angelicalin7,Disappointing Disney Production,3,21 June 2015,"I think a five out of ten is even higher than what they actually should get. I tend to rate higher. First, how dare they call this a sci-fi film? Yes, the VFX is pretty amazing, however, it doesn't make a movie good if it has a terrible script. The entire two hours looks like they are trying to set up for something huge, something exciting, but nope. At the end, I was wondering, this is it? Honestly, it just looks like a two-hour long trailer, can you tell me when will I be able to watch the actual movie? The trailer is way much better than the actual film. Disney has made some great blockbuster sci-fi films, the pirates of Caribbean series are awesome blockbuster movies, because they have valid scripts to support the movie, no matter how dumb the scripts are. However, Tomorrowland failed in that and that is what made this movie a total failure. But at least, a round of applause for the VFX team, I am no expert but I quite like the design of Tomorrowland.",Tomorrowland

It ignited a passion in wanting to fix problems instead of waiting for some miracle to occur. When I saw the name Brad Bird, I instantly thought of ""The Iron Giant"", a movie which told me as a child that I can be whatever I want to be. Yes, this movie may be seen as ""preachy"" and I felt that way too watching it, but why is that a bad thing. We all at times need these preachy messages to wake us up and hopefully inspire great things in us.

The CGI and slow build-up could have led to something truly spectacular and dare I say it, entertaining.I don't know if I should invoke spoiler alert because I walked out with 30 minutes before the end of the movie. The reason was instead of entertainment, Hugh Laurie's character started lecturing on,... wait for it... GLOBAL WARMING. Certainly the heroine or someone else found a marvelously trite solution to this problem by willing it so.When I pay $20 to see a movie, I guess I naively expect some level of intellectually stimulating entertainment rather than a lecture on how bad we minions are as ""custodians"" of our planet. Last time I checked, I've spent a fair portion of my life listening to lectures and rarely find them entertaining. In the vast majority of cases, parochial lectures as in this case are unabashedly shy of entertainment value. If I really wanted guilt, I still have my mother.I'll take my entertainment without the scantily dressed up political-evangelical agenda.

522,chriswiegel117,Good for what it was - not what I was expecting,7,3 June 2015,"Not really any spoilers, but selected for safety.After reading a lot of one star reviews where people crap on the movie, I felt compelled to write a review. I agree the intro is sluggish, the acting and chemistry isn't the best I've seen (especially in our protagonist) but it's not supposed to be amazing. In fact, its probably not even supposed to be for you. You could say the movie is ""preachy"" as many have, but I wouldn't call it that.Given the last two things mentioned, the movie is clearly aimed at a younger and family crowd (keep in mind this is a Disney movie). And for that, it does what it should; it aims to inspire young people to better the world through present and relevant issues (global warming, war, lack of empathy). It goes a little bit further and inspires young people, females specifically, to change the world via engineering - a field strongly lacking female representation.It's a visually appealing movie with a decent story that moves somewhat slowly, told a la the classic golden age 50s science fiction dystopian future we've all come to love with modern effects.Once more, the movie aims to inspire youth and after reading some reviews from younger people, I think it does a fine job in doing so. Ironically, I was hoping for more of a serious/dramatic/dystopian feel, but I suppose hope and youth are behind me.",Tomorrowland

Second, we are responsible for our own results in life. We can make positive changes. We are not locked into a predetermined fate. The film also showed generations working together toward a common goal.

Maybe I'm a hopeless romantic, but I enjoy stories that hold out the promise of adventure mixed with hope and some genuine magic. I was not disappointed. Tomorrowland hit all the right points with me--adventure, mystery, characters to love and root for, surprise story twists, laugh out loud moments, and, the best magic of all, hope.

It's a shame such an original work is being so under appreciated, I would highly recommend going to see it.In stark contrast with the majority of films these days, Tomorrowland brings a sense of optimism and hope to the future. So often are we subject in film to futures that are dark, grim, gritty wastelands that I forgot how refreshing a film about a bright and better future really is. Tomorrowland is director Brad Bird's most recent addition to his portfolio of already fantastic films (The Incredibles, the Iron Giant, Ratatouille, and Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol), and as much as this film is getting panned by the majority of critics, it is very well done affair.

There should not be any negative review on this movie. Budget was excellently used to make the graphics enticing. Although the setting was interchanged, it tried to go with the title of the movie. There is a surprise in the movie in every scene. Very disappointing that it did not perform in terms of box-office but it deserves better. Actors really did well and every second is exciting. It deserves another chance to be previewed again. This movie is Tommorrowland. Any other statement is obviously vague. The 2 votes that did not make the cut is because the movie was ""too deep"".

Guess what: It's not gonna come. What I am trying to say, the film has a good Analyse, but lacks showing any kind of real Solutions apart from letting children dream that they are chosen to get in an isolated, better place. That they get a letter that they can get to Hogwarts. We don't need a holy city of science in another dimension.

Regardless of political undertones, the movie blatantly professes a positive message: worthy of the embrace it shall never receive, as our neolithic society has yet to evolve from its guilty pleasures of persecuting they who preach love and shaming they who inspire tolerance.Stuffed here and there with nifty acting and an abundance of budget, in terms of pure entertainment and visual spectacle I am unquestionably sold. The plot is relatively predictable, at most moments, but in no way poorly conceived. Exposition goes down the seemingly endless railway to Forever as is the case with several Disney films I have encountered in my short lifetime, but I can never say that these trips ever fail to construct their curiously marketable characters. Dash it, I am pretentiously nitpicking, and only in a blazing Inferno would that be customary of me.Watch this film. Mull on an armchair. Dodge that contrition sinking in.

No no no no no! I nearly quit this film half way through because of her overacting and overpronunciation of everything. I can only assume the hype is brought by Americans who fail to detect the god-awful and frankly ridiculous English ""Oh HellLLLOOO"" accent she's got.

At the same time it looks at one go. I watched it already 3 times. The Idea and the major feeling of this movie are totally Christian: ""According to your faith be it unto you"". Beside the great work of Britt and the fantastic duo of Clooney and Laurie an absolutely mind-blowing element of this film is Raffey Cassidy's acting. She stunningly coped with a near-to- unachievable task - to perform on the screen a truly transcendent character, whose mesmerizing emanation (esp. through an absolutely special expression in her eyes) sometimes even reminded me of Higher Power representatives on the paintings of Leonardo: the unearthly tenacity of spirit, the axiomatically inexhaustible faith, the highest wisdom, the deepest compassion and condescension and the immanent joy of self-dedication and belonging to the saving source of true life - to Love. I find this film extremely timely and modern. Many-many thanks to the writers, directors and actors for their preeminent and so essential work!",Tomorrowland
535,hrhpink,Highly Recommended!,10,22 May 2015,"Disney has done it again! They have yet again added a superb movie to their collection. This movie really does inspire children to do their best and that they matter. They can change the world. They can be dreamers, and make their dreams become reality. Bring your children to see this amazing movie! I watched it in an IMAX theater, which made it even better. My friends said that they didn't like it, but heck, I don't think they're thinking straight. This was definitely one of Disney's better movies. Forget Marvel, forget Star Wars, this movie is simply, how should I put it, supercalafragilisticexpialidociously amazing in so many ways that I can't even explain.",Tomorrowland
536,bbinthep,What else is underneath Disneyland???,8,13 June 2015,"Wow. Look at the amount of people who feel the need to crap all over something. Yes it's Disney, Yes it's Sci;Fi, Yes it's mystery. Yes it's action. That's what you got, besides that a movie for children/teenagers to mull over and something for much older kids ""inner child"" to tap into. The young British actress did a very good job. Paedophillia? Er NO! There was a sub plot about the young Frank who clearly wasn't your normal average kid and hadn't many friends, his dad was an ass and the guy took himself to a showcase and met another man who told him his almost working invention was pathetic. One slightly older pretty girl was kind and intriguing and had him smitten instantly. She introduced him to a new world (in more ways than one) and their relationship progressed only for him to find out the truth later. Everything went wrong (as is explained to us) and Frank explains later being a stupid kid who falls in love with a robot and getting hurt. Some people want to build it up from there into something else but that's pretty much it. It shows that the character although depicted as a moody graying old git still has youth and hope inside him, which is what the theme of the movie is about... I feel sorry for those of you that are destroyed enough not to be able to grasp any positive notions this movie may hold and would suggest just staying home next time. and preachy> Oh how sensitive. A little patchy at the beginning and fairly long if it's for kids but plenty of escapism. Cheer up you miserable sneering snobs.",Tomorrowland
537,clairexcat,"Bright, but only in theory",6,10 June 2015,"The film commences on a vivid day in 1964. Young and committed Frank Walker's intentions are to present a jetpack at the New York's World Fair. At first, the head judge is intrigued by the striking creation the boy has proposed to him. However, Frank reveals that there is one setback... the jetpack doesn't actually function properly. This prompts the judge to ask Frank why he would enter something if it proved to be useless. Frank's response? ""Well, if I saw someone with a jetpack, whether it worked or not, it would inspire me."" If that approach was the movie's intention, then on paper, the film excels. Visually, the resplendent special effects provide audiences aspiration once the plot shifts into present day. The most impressive scene is when our lead Casey explores the newfound pleasures of Tomorrowland, a futuristic utopia. Though some special effects are used for a couple of robotic fights, this visually stunning feature ultimately conquers the pessimistic with it's raw splendor. Unfortunately, Tomorrowland's optimistic themes fall adrift with an overwhelmingly complicated plot that's paired with a lacking ending.After Frank's beginning is told, the film follows bright-eyed escapist Casey, who's intelligence and visionary views are tested when she receives a strange pin that transports her to a world that she believes to be the future. Britt Robertson's performance goes beyond ebullience, however. She is a brilliant young actor who's talent will easily hold many promises in future roles. Of course, visiting this so-called future comes with drawbacks. Casey must team up with Frank, who is now sixty years old and grim, and an offbeat but powerful young girl named Athena to fight robots, save the future, and return to Tomorrowland. Seems like a lot of work over just a magical little pin, doesn't it? Not only is this a lot of excess baggage for our leads to carry; the heavy overdose of mystery and story translates into a complexity of a film. 90% of Tommorowland's run time is bent on what will come around the corner. Though complicated, it's promise of an unraveled ending is what keeps audiences eager for what will happen next. Sadly, Tommorowland's uncertain ending is destined to disappoint movie go-ers. What's attempted to be explained is done with clumsy monologues. Loose ends of what could have been a very promising story are never tied up, leaving pieces astray from the puzzle. It's unfortunate that a movie that revolves around creating a glistening future fails to do so in their own plotting.",Tomorrowland
538,thechunman,"An original movie that inspires, one of the best this year",9,18 May 2015,"Finally an original concept movie not based on books/stories/previous materials. I went to a test screening only armed with the limited knowledge from the trailers. I think this definitely increase my enjoyment of the movie. The movie never cease to amaze me from start to finish. Admittedly there are moments which i was starting to get a little impatient. But right then something would happen and drawn me into the movie again. To be fair, I probably enjoy it more because of above average familiarity with Disney parks/history/movies. But there are plenty of humor and ideas in the movie to fascinate everyone. Also, please relax on challenging the logic in this movie, it mostly makes sense but is not bulletproof. Luckily, there is enough going on that should keep audience from doing that. There is one strong message being delivered throughout the movie But it never tries to shove it down your throat. In the end, it inspires hope and gets me thinking. I had fun watching the movie, and left with plenty of conversation topics with my son. The movie definitely planted a seed of change in me. I am just hoping that it will have similar effect on everyone. All the actors did an awesome job. I have seen similar performance from George Clooney, but never in the context presented in this movie. Without saying too much, an otherwise ridiculous relationship turns out to be one of the more believable and memorable one due to his acting. The fresh faces were natural in their roles and gave strong performances. One of them actually reminded me of Audrey Hepburn, if she was a child star. Anyway, if you can go to this movie with an open mind and don't try to over-think things, it will be a pleasant experience. Take it for what it is - an original with plenty of ideas, fun mix of action and bewilderment, some Disney Magic, and a message that hopefully can touch some people.",Tomorrowland
539,adnamanyl,Chucky Meets Disney,1,22 May 2015,"The PG rating for this movie gives a false impression that your kids are safe to watch this movie. Our family was horrified by the decapitation of a human-looking robot head by a child-looking robot, the child-looking robot being traumatically hit by a pickup truck, and then the holding of a charred human-looking robot skull. At that point, we had seen enough and left. I wish we could have been spared these graphic images. The theme question of the film is: How can we fix the future? A goal, which is never realized. Practically speaking, I wondered why the producers ironically lacked the effort of contributing to an actual better future for our children with the unnecessary violence and gore.

It is nice to see human advancement encouraged for a change, and hopefully it will serve as a model for directors to abandon their usual left-sided productions. The acing is phenomenal, on the part of actors both known and unknown, and the CGI is not overdone and looks great.

As for me and my kids, we liked it a lot.. My 6th grade son says its the best movie he has seen this year, while my 2nd grade daughter liked it, but probably should have waited another year or so.. I think the Disney label may have influenced the rating a bit.. PG-13 may have been more accurate IMHO. There were a few violent scenes that I was not fast enough at covering eyes. e.g. decapitated (human looking) android, and (human looking)child android hit by a truck being the worst.The acting was great all round I think Raffey Cassidy, who portrayed Athena, stole the show, but Robertson and Clooney were both believable. While there were flaws in the story telling and the cliché predictable ending was a little lack luster, I walked out of the theater happy that I ignored poor critic reviews that I had read the night before.. An enjoyable adventure to enjoy with the kids, (I'd say about 10 and up conservatively).",Tomorrowland

545,caflinton,Simply Question,5,23 May 2015,"Does this movie promote pedophilic (pedo-erotic) ideals? Overall, as a parent going to the movies with my children, I liked this movie. I had the great experience of going to the movies with my kids and observing a large number of families (parents with their kids) in a nice theatre. I also loved the concept of promoting optimism and the power-of-mind we have to save the planet. However, as the movie played on, it was not lost on me that there were a couple of middle-aged (50-60 yrs old) men sitting alone in theatre as well. I was disturbed by Clooney's character's emotional (romanticized)fixation on a peri-pubescent female robot. His character lived his life into his 50's, clearly unable to let go of his romantic love for a 10 to 12 year old girl (robot). This emotional/romanticized attachment is acted out in the last scenes. But I am aware that the ""adult-i-fication"" of children is a justification that child molesters use to ""allow"" themselves to ""love"" and sexualize/objectify children. This could have been easily fixed by some acknowledgement that Clooney's character had an adult, age-appropriate relationship at some point in his adult life (it would have taken 10 seconds to do so). Instead, we are left with the evidence that Clooney's sexual/romantic development is fixated on this representation of a peri-pubescent female. It's hard to believe that the editors missed this issue. After the movie, I casually asked another parent what she thought about Clooney's relationship with the ""girl,"" she said one word, ""uncomfortable."" Good concept for a movie, this flaw ruined it for me.",Tomorrowland

Lindelof, Damon and Jeff made everything in the storyline feel factual. The movie has essence, and a strong message that makes you think and reflect; and that's what a masterpiece of art is supposed to do--make you feel. The multidimensional set and the beautifully simple way that Space-Time is presented for the plot, makes it fascinating and intriguing. I felt reminded that imagination is more than knowledge.

I do not normally take my children to a movie in the theaters without having watched it myself first. But this movie is rated PG and from Disney so I figured it would be fairly safe. It was not safe and my kids picked up on every use of two of those words (one of those words they do not know yet). If Disney is going to continue to claim they are family-friendly, they need to stop using bad language in their movies because let's face it, even young children are part of the meaning of family.

If Walt Disney could have made Tomorrowland a reality in his time he would have. The movie takes us on a journey through the past/present/future based on Walt Disney's original vision of the City of Tomorrow. Like in the movie, we need the dreamers and non-conventional thinkers to make our world a better place. We need people to believe in the ability of making our world better for the next generation.

550,pyrhyc,Some intelligence required,7,25 May 2015,"I almost didn't watch this movie due to the reviews it received here, but I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed it. What I found was that the reviews stating they couldn't follow the storyline, or that it was senseless or boring, or that it used pseudoscience most likely weren't paying attention, know little to nothing about science, history, or quantum mechanics, and like their movies to explain every detail in a nicely wrapped little package with absolutely no previous intelligence required.This movie does require an ever so slight bit of intelligence to get the most from it. It has historical references. I can almost hear whoever's reading this groan, but you can relax, the references are of historical figures that anyone with an eighth grade education should know. I stress the word should. Now the science and technical references are a bit more advanced, and they don't explain the science behind it, so for someone that barely knows how to work their smartphone I can see the assumption of pseudoscience, plus most people will simply go ""SCIENCE"" or ""TECH"" and leave it at that. However for those that are familiar with and do understand the references, such as the use of tachyon particles, it's a nice little hat tip from Mr. Brad Bird.To sum it up, it's an overall enjoyable movie even if you don't get all the references.",Tomorrowland

552,filledblanks,kids' movie meant for adults,7,26 May 2015,"Nice visual effects, pretty characters, cool ideas, a message and a horrible plot which I think is not the main focus of the movie. The plot is a chain of events that happen within a period of 96? hours. If the plot was intended to be good, they would add more characters, expand the time span, go into more detail, be rather realistic, and perhaps add some character development. Tomorrowland doesn't have any of those mentioned. The movie intends to convey a message to the target audience -children-, and in doing so, a clever and elaborate plot is sacrificed. Hope, dreaming, despair, and struggle are the main themes of every scene. The message is constantly highlighted by amusingly absurd events, Casey's stubbornness against Clooney's despair, Athena's might, and Nix's ""tirade""- which pretty much makes the point of the film clear.The actual downside to the film is that it is not clear whether it is meant for all audiences or children. One scene you have Clooney Jr. flying with a jet-pack, the other scene Clooney Sr. telling Casey that she is going to lose 90% of her blood sugar. Kids be like ""there is sugar in blood?!"" while adults be like ""meh, bull___"". I think this ambiguity is what causes the harsh criticism.Aside from those, the movie is laden with entertaining content and great action scenes, all of them pointing to the message: Don't hesitate to struggle for your dreams.This is a kids' movie that is meant for teenagers and adults.Note: Remarkable acting by Raffey Cassidy(Athena).",Tomorrowland

I found it funny and helpful that a bright young woman can cut through the garbage and want to change things for the better ON HER OWN. 5) The plot was aligned w/ dreamers and creative people of the world to shape the world they want.

556,avigorjt,Tomorrowland: The Story of Athena,9,28 May 2015,"I have seen some, shall we say, mixed reviews of this movie. There is one reason for this, which many might not have recognized:The movie follows the wrong character.It follows Casey Newton, who was, unfortunately for Britt Robertson, written as a walking plot device.The true main character of the movie?Athena. Yes, the character who the movie tries to depict as a walking plot device is the main character. This movie chronicles not some girl whisked off to a fantastic world to save her own. It depicts the struggle of an android fighting to restore her world, and by extension, save our own. She must struggle against her own father, who has given in to despair and even tried to kill her. To complicate matters, she must do this while daring not to admit, even to herself, that her program has evolved in an unexpected way. Athena no longer is ruled solely by her directive to recruit for the abstract betterment of mankind, reinterpreted to try and stop an Armageddon by finding the perfect recruit. She fell in love, decades before she met Casey. For this love, she gives her life at the climax, admitting her feelings with her last words. The saddest part, perhaps, is that Frank doesn't seem to react the way I would have expected for someone who just discovered that his lifelong unrequited love was not so unrequited. Granted, the fact that Athena was stuck with the eternal body of a child, crossed with the fact that this is a Disney movie, is probably why.Suffice to say, I was moved by this speculative AI epic, and hope that more people can recognize it for what it is.",Tomorrowland

I've seen good movies get endless amount of hate, bad movies enjoy attention of metacritics who craves plain action and no deep end. Why? Because we believe so. We believe the critics. It's a domino effect. You had the idea that it's a bad movie, therefore it is. However, what if you'd thought it was going to be a brilliant one?

560,animatedreview,More Like Tomorrowbland... Heh.,5,8 June 2015,"So Tomorrowland is the latest film by the autocratic organisation and future supreme overlords, Disney. With the creative genius behind The Iron Giant and the Incredibles at the helm, I must say I found the idea of a high concept Sci-Fi adventure directed by Brad Bird quite exciting to say the least, unfortunately I left the theatre feeling bittersweet.Tomorrowland follows the story of plucky optimist and human, Casey Newton played by Britt Robertson, who stumbles upon an invitation to a fantastic world run by Hugh Laurie, which has scientifically flourished by shielding itself away from the rest of humanity. In her quest to find Tomorrowland Casey befriends grumpy genius Frank played by George Clooney and robotic robot, Athena, who is a robot.While the film has a lot of great ideas, and shows a lot of promise early on, it's scattered story telling coupled with a complete lack of emotional punch in the end marks this as a slight misstep in Disney's recent renaissance.Tomrrowland begins like so many other films nowadays, with a ""this story all started back when"" sequence. A trick often used instead of establishing character, it ignores that well known rule of thumb, Show don't tell. But here it's almost forgivable, almost. We get some decent character development later on, mostly from Frank and it gets things moving quickly. But wouldn't it be more interesting if we didn't see grumpy Frank until later. Leading us as the audience to wonder what happened to him, why he's gone from young, happy and hopeful to old, bitter and pessimistic. But instead we see grumpy Frank first, diminishing all sense of mystery in the audience. The reason I bring this up is A) Frank is by far our most interesting character and B) it perfectly illustrates many of Tomorrowland's problems, strange decisions that that are detrimental to the plot, pacing or development of characters. But we are treated to some of Tomorrowland's best bits early on too, redeeming it somewhat.We get some fun back and fourth between our two main characters, which is done so well it makes me wonder why it wasn't used more often. And we also get a pretty spectacular visual spectacle when first being introduced to Tomorrowland itself, in the form of a jetpack sequence so fun, it instantly made me wonder why I have to drive home instead of fly.So within the first five minutes we see the films strengths and weaknesses and the pattern in which it will repeat for the next 2 hours and 10 minutes. Fun, imaginative set piece followed by muddy, meandering story telling. The set pieces alone are enough to justify the price of admission especially if you're a big man-child like myself. A particular favourite of mine was a shoot out in a comic book store using ray guns, complete with Star Wars references (I wonder why they're present). And there are even some old school visuals for us classic Sci Fi nerds. They may look out of place to younger viewers but I definitely appreciated them.Even the parts between the action are entertaining enough thanks to the interplay between our two leads. Athena on the other hand is a different story, there's always something that seems quite off with her delivery. She also happens to have a history with Frank, which culminates with a (spoiler alert) selfless sacrifice, but lacks any emotional punch because we have no reason to care about her character or her connection with Frank. When they do try to develop their relationship it makes some uncomfortable viewing thanks to Franks advanced age and Athena still looking ten years old.We are however treated to some Hugh Laurie being wonderful at the climax of the film, he is given the unenviable task of delivering the heavy- handed message but he pulls it off, at least in my book. Although it could've been written into the script better, it is essentially Hugh Laurie telling us we're all dicks out of the blue, if it were anyone else I might've been offended. Now some people may find the message rather preachy but it is an amiable message and the film feels like it has the best of intentions. And then it ends, without much of a fanfare. There's some action, some fisticuffs but it's nowhere near as grand a payoff as it could of been considering the earlier action scenes, and the fact that the film had jetpacks in it.In short Tomorrowland is by no means a bad film, but it's not quite good. It's both hard to get excited about and hard to hate, like tepid coffee, spongecake or Alan Titchmarsh. It'll more than likely just leave you feeling nothing at all as a result, except for an overwhelming need for a jetpack.5/10",Tomorrowland
561,bobrice-17570,Excellent Film! ...for those who get it. Go see it for yourself!,10,3 June 2015,"Ignore the bad reviews, they are just jumping on the trash-it bandwagon which is always easy. Don't let the ridiculously over-the-top critical nay-sayers convince you to avoid it, go see it for yourself!The visuals are stunning, the message is inspiring, and it's got a good storyline.I suppose if you are a movie junky that likes dismal, dystopian, depressing shows with no hope, then maybe Tomorrowland isn't for you.But if you like good entertainment, that might actually dare to inspire you to look with hope towards the future, then by all means go see Tomorrowland!",Tomorrowland
562,thedealmaster,Phooey on the bad reviews...this is GREAT cinema!,10,5 June 2015,"I LOVED Tomorrowland! The only explanation for all of the bad reviews is maybe exactly what this movie is trying to point out, that negativity feeds on itself and just snowballs.... Was the movie perfect? No, but I have yet to see a ""perfect"" movie.The premise of the movie was very clear, we once looked with hope and anticipation to the future, and we were building it! Then for whatever reason people began losing hope and stopped caring, stopped building. It all became a self-fulfilling prophecy....but maybe it's not too late, maybe if we can find people who have a that spark still in them, maybe we can ""fix it"". That's the message of Tomorrowland. No, it's not an ""elitist"" message as some have suggested, it's not a left or right message either, it's a message of freedom. Free people, free to imagine, free to dream, free to create and build something for the benefit of ALL. ""Man has dream, and that's the start, he follows his dream, with mind and heart, and when it becomes a reality, IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE FOR YOU AND ME!"".The 1964 Worlds Fair segment was an incredible recreation! I sat there wondering ""how did they do that? I felt like I was going back in time! Of course the segments in the Tomorrowland City were absolutely stunning! How could you not be inspired? It's everything and more than I imagined for an awesome futuristic metropolis! Who wouldn't want to live there? Bravo! (I would have liked to spend more time there in the film however...).Excellent performances from ALL of the actors, but special hats off to the young actors Brit Robertson and Raffey Cassidy who nailed their performances! Thank You Brad Bird and Damon Lindelof for bringing this film and it's inspiring message to the silver screen! Phooey on the bad reviews! Us dreamers need to stick together!",Tomorrowland
563,meow_kitty-87441,"Slow start, but a good film",7,8 June 2015,"Imaginative storyline, and reasonably gripping. The start was a bit choppy and needed some revision, but otherwise the story moved quite well, with subtle hints along the way that were a little confusing when not paying attention - my partner and I thought this added a good depth, complexity and maturity to the film making, that is often lacking in modern films made just for fast easy entertainment. The child actors were also much better than I've seen in most films.On the other hand, the female lead was a little lost and doe- eyed at times, and I think they could have gone with someone a little less ""damsel-in-distress"". Not what I expected from the same director as for The Incredibles, since most of the comedy was pretty dark rather than the light- hearted comedy one tends to see in animated children's films, but I would definitely see this one again. A less-cheesy version of Spy Kids, you might like this film if you liked things like Donnie Darko. Climate-change deniers probably wouldn't like it due to some of the themes (as seen in the movie trailers).",Tomorrowland
564,hmin-45387,I fell asleep,1,8 June 2015,"I have to agree that the plot line(s) suffered terrible discontinuity. This is usually the product of bad writing by people who did not originate the story and do not really care about it.We must however give appropriate credit to the actors who were able to appear credible in spite of the ludicrous lines they had to deliver. Except for George Clooney, who seemed to be searching off-stage more than once, perhaps looking for his agent to get him out of this! The good news for me is that I nodded off twice and may have missed even worst parts of the film. All in all, a totally boring movie, even for Disney.",Tomorrowland
565,darylbaier,Disney is a little off on this Clooney Pedophile Vibe,4,10 June 2015,"The movie is a traditional Disney teenage hero story as expected. The story fell a little short in the end, good special effects (worthy of a higher score) but the story ran dry in the end. The strange element that was not needed in the movie was the creepy pedophile vibe of Clooney's character through the second half of the film. I am not saying he acted on it but a strange ""forbidden love"" thing was happening that seemed inappropriate for the target audience of young girls in this film. Did he act, no, did he activate the creep meter in most parents sitting with their kids, YES. Disney needs to be careful when they dabble with character boundaries. This was probably more confusing to a 10-12 year old, but it was suggestive between the characters and not a necessary component in the film. I hold Disney to a little higher standard to understand the psychological impact on pre-teens and younger teenagers when a soft message is applied to an adult figure and a child (not saying which) regardless of the circumstances that preceded it. That will make sense if you see it, but the point is, it has a unnecessary and inappropriate vibe that you may want to consider before taking an impressionable child to see it.",Tomorrowland
566,aqueelamumtaz,very poor execution of a highly confused idea,3,11 June 2015,"This was a terrible movie. And I feel compelled to write about it, because being a huge George Clooney fan, I took time out from my precious vacation to go see it. Except for the fight and escape scene in Frank's home which was a throwback to ""Back to the Future"" mechanical cool, everything else had no purpose, or point, or direction or storyline. Frank was a crazy scientist but he wasn't crazy looking enough like Doc from Back to the future. Athena was a robot but spoke with too much emphasis within a sentence while keeping a blank face - she definitely got the British vibe down pat, but I wouldn't credit her for being a droid. And their love, much harped about, was not translated well on screen leaving George Clooney to stare very lovingly at a 12 year old and creeping everyone out in the cinema! Why oh why didn't the director superimpose the younger Frank in that scene is beyond me! All in all, horrible waste of time, money, and leaves one with a lingering feeling that George Clooney is scared to share romantic on screen space with a woman his own age........",Tomorrowland

568,chriseatherton,Don't believe the negative reviews,10,24 June 2015,"First of all, I loved this movie. My kids loved this movie, and I just cannot understand why anyone would be so negative about it.The acting is excellent, particularly from the younger members of the cast , the script has the right amount of humour and as you would expect the special effects are superb. The story comes in for some criticism from a lot of people but I thought it was a great ride and had a profound message about the environment but without ruining the film.After the movie my kids were talking about jet packs and flying baths but also about how we should look after the planet. Mainly my eldest (11), the environmental message went right over my 7 year old's head, which shows how its not rammed down your throat. He did think the little girl robot was cute however which was also a reasonable take-away!I can only imagine the bad reviews for this movie have been ""encouraged"" by industries like motor, oil and gas, mining, etc, who all have a vested interest in people not seeing this film.I cant recommend this film highly enough, take your kids to see it they will love it and may have their eyes opened to an important message about how we can make a difference to the future of our planet if we really want to.",Tomorrowland
569,registration-52340,An enigma to many,9,21 June 2015,"There are nine pages of negative reviews before the first hint of positive words. This is explained by the fact that the majority of those reviewers don't actually understand the messages in this film and have completely missed the point. Tomorrowland's overall rating is disappointing but not surprising given the tragic state of world affairs but more to the point, it underscores why the pin is only given to select individuals. I expect that the executives anticipated this so I don't think they will be busying themselves with worry over ratings or box office figures and will otherwise remain excited by the prospect of arousing Walt Disney's motivation and optimism latent within people who dream of creating a bright and wonderful future. While this film remains an enigma to many it will only be those who truly understand the messages in this film that will walk away feeling empowered to act on the ideas and ideals that define them. Certain individuals who watch this film will find out that they have the ability to change the world. So how will you know if you have been selected? It's simple, you will just know.",Tomorrowland
570,jkfamily-73633,Love this movie,10,23 June 2015,"This movie is full of inspiration and a reminder to all that we influence the future for better or worse depending on our actions and beliefs. I don't want to spoil the movie, but the story line of which wolf to feed has really stuck with me. My kids ages 9 and 11 loved it too, and every now and then I will ask them which wolf they are feeding. The story has great special effects, and the ending is positive. I admit to being a Hugh Laurie fan, as well as Disney fan, which is what motivated me to go see the movie in the theater. If you are looking for some inspiration that is not too heavy and not sad, I recommend this movie as a fun, thoughtful escape.",Tomorrowland
571,korance,"Cool ideas, amazing visuals overshadowed by shabby story",6,27 June 2015,"I really, REALLY wanted to like Tomorrowland, and I did, parts of it at least. Unfortunately those parts were almost completely overshadowed by the glaring problems with the film that loomed onerously throughout the plot sapping what little compelling drama it had to offer in the first place.Here's why I liked it and what parts I enjoyed. There are a host of films out that portray dystopian realities of the future and paint a horrific picture of technology and how it will turn on humanity, betray us and wreck our lives. Cinema can't seem to think of the future without coupling it with either a failing and corrupt political system picking up the remnants of a self destruction or as machines and technology itself become the oppressors. Off the top of my head I can think of Terminator, AI, 2001, The Matrix just to name a few. There is a void in story telling of a genuinely positive future where technology is viewed in an optimistic light and the future a better place than the past or present. As they portray in the film, if we're constantly pumping in the terrible vision of an unenviable future doesn't it kind of become a self fulfilling prophecy telling us the direction we'll head? So because there's such a great need for that genre to be filled, I wanted to love it. This film held the promise of a vision of a millennial future and was unique in being able to paint it in a positive light. And there were moments where it succeeded, during those brief highlights where the main character was transported to an idealized future. This ended up being is pretty much on of the only scenes you really need to watch from the movie.Other than that the film reminded me of a B grade power rangers show with silly robots chasing kids around town. In fact the whole back plot about a secret army and the conspiracy of a group of men belonging to a secret future club in the Eiffel tower seemed like a pointless last minute addition and the film would have been better off without without it. Hugh Laurie's wonderful acting and character were drowned out by his tangential monologues and poorly written lines that did more to detract from the character than to help it. The special effects which were necessary to bring a vision of the future to life were used excessively in a futile effort to attract interest where character development and genuine human interests would have been better. Keeping effects subtle and stylish would have been a huge improvement to draw the audience in rather than blatantly showing off what technology could do without making anybody wanting it.The substance of the plot a bright and ambitious young girl trying to rouse a brilliant man who has become disillusioned with a lost dream of a better world was a good foundation. The characters portrayed by George Clooney and Britt Robertson had the talent and appeal to bring this solid plot to life, but was shot to pieces by a ridiculous subplot of the old man's lingering love affair with a child robot. I can't possibly see who thought George Clooney's unrelenting love for a child robot would make for an emotionally compelling story. More like a weird and slightly twisted justification of why people who are in love love technology should be held with a twinge of skepticism. His acting felt forced when touching that theme as well it should in a context that is both un-relatable and inhuman. And the same could probably be said of the other actors, they did well with what they had but a story lacking human interest made them hard to love. Overall I liked the actors, a lot of the themes and some of the visuals were completely awe inspiring and unlike anything I've ever seen, but this beauty was sadly overshadowed by a poorly cobbled together plot held loosely together by garish special effects.",Tomorrowland
572,duncanstroud,Tomorrowland is why todayland is so lost,1,9 February 2016,"The only thing that wasn't shallow about this film was the depths of its triteness and shallowness. Once again Disney has reduced the problems of our modern world to a fantasy, a fantasy where one lone hero saves the future. It perpetuates everything that is broken with the modern, mainly American, psyche. I can;t even begin to get into the ridiculousness of the plot. Honestly, Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs looks like Hamlet compared to this McMovie. Ug, I think I got dumber just watching it.",Tomorrowland
573,F70,Inspiring and awesome,9,27 September 2015,"There seem to be two ways to view this film it seems. 1. You hate it and feel it is a waste of time.2.

I found the film to be inspiring and awesome and after watching it with my wife, I genuinely feel that there is a chance to change the world for the better, if we only dare to act upon it.This is a must see film.

574,aniese,Tomorrowland Is About Hope,10,20 October 2015,"""Casey Newton: There are two wolves and they are always fighting. One is darkness and despair. The other is light and hope. Which wolf wins?""""Eddie Newton: Whichever one you feed.""Basically, that's what the whole movie is - a CPR for the good wolf (the enthusiastic part) in your soul... IF it is still alive.Visually stunning, dimension-spanning, thrilling and unpredictable sci-fi adventure, Tomorrowland is a tale about a brilliant teenager, a disgruntled scientist and a robot who looks like eleven year old girl trying to save the world from self-destruction it is eagerly heading for---HOWEVER, WHAT MAKES IT SO MUCH FUN TO WATCH is that the message of the movie is more than just a simplistic ""be cheerful"" or ""protect the environment"". It is rather that on every level - for me, for you, for the entire planet - wallowing in hopelessness and gloom never works out, and though winning may be tough, the only way to stop being a total loser to your problems is to actually start doing something about them (""even the tiniest action...""). But of course some people just cannot be bothered... (SPOILER ALERT: Btw, this explains how the villain in the movie ended up on the other side. His character is neither underdeveloped, nor underplayed. In fact, the way he is is crucial to the story. As played superbly by Mr. Laurie, Governor Nix of Tomorrowland did not start out as evil incarnate - he simply gave up on good... and then, like, made three more steps in that direction. Which unfortunately included sealing up the place, emptying it of creative influences, and dispatching killer robots not to let anyone in. He will gladly criticize the whole world citing every cliché in the book, but won't lift a finger to try to help anyone. He's past caring. In a parable of the tale, where Athena is the Future, Cassie is Optimism, and Frank is Realism - Nix stands for Negativity, the joyless hopeless cynic. END OF SPOILER)SO, IF THE MESSAGE OF THE MOVIE RESONATES WITH YOU, you are in for the ride of your life! You will spend two hours on the edge of your seat wowed how smart and tight and thrilling the story is, how acting is spot-on and direction is flawless, and the only thing you'll regret at the end is that the movie is over. You'll be left with a good buzz, walk out inspired, and wish to see it again, soon. Basically, this is how the film got its 6+ (IMDB's for 'Yeah!') vast majority rating. Get it and watch it by all means, you'll love it!IF YOU ARE TOO BUSY FOR HOPE IN YOUR LIFE - you will most likely miss its point completely and be bored and irritated and even somehow offended by the whole thing, spend next two hours wondering what all the fuss is about and what any wolves have to do with it (or decide it must be something political and thrash your pet political peeve) and finally end up reflecting how empty and disappointing everything is, that events and actions do not seem to add up and there is no ""chemistry"" between characters (whatever meaning that might have), and how 'Fury Road' had more blood, 'Aliens' had more aliens, and 'Swiss Family Robinson', well, more Robinsons. This accounts for quite a few reviews it got from other critics and viewers. If you are in this range, you'd be better off skipping it altogether.(Btw, if you are watching this movie as a chaperon for younger children - the ratings people owe you an apology. The movie is more suited for PG-13 (ages twelve to hundred audiences, same as 'Pirates of Caribbean' and 'Hobbit') - which the authors apparently pushed for, in ideas, plot points, and occasional word choice. Try watching this one on your own, you'll have a blast! )SOMEBODY NOTICED in another post that, quite interestingly, the reviews people write here, be that ""fun, full of hope and inspiring"" or ""shallow, pointless and boring"", actually seem to be ""talking about their own lives"" instead. Well, maybe that's what all really good art is about - however you look at it, you look at yourself.",Tomorrowland

It's got people from all over the world logging on to write their first review in years telling how much they loved or hated it. Either way, it does not leave people untouched. That's a lot more than I could say about most of the latest productions. Best of all, it can be watched over and over again because there is so much more in it than meets the eye.My prediction, it will be a recognized cult classic in months.

Quite honestly, I don't recall a movie that gave me so much pure joy watching, other than classics like RAIDERS OF LOST ARK, BACK TO THE FUTURE and TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY (last really good T). Seriously, it IS that great, an instant classic on a par with all three. And like these, it's not a one-time through movie. If anything, it gets better on - the first time you are too busy being surprised ('wow! wait, what? Wow!!'), next time you start to appreciate how smart and polished the whole thing is. Gosh I'm waiting for DVD release now like a child before his birthday, lol.I could write pages (and I did last time) on how the acting is great (remember Athena? you will), story is one ingenious thrill ride, visuals stunning, message intelligent and timely, how it is full of hope and wonder, sprinkled with smart references to science history and classic sci-fi movies, and how the whole movie came out even greater than the sum of its parts -- and it is all that and more.

578,valaisanglais,Confusing start with a great finish!,6,6 October 2015,"The film begins with a very confusing and dull exchange between Frank (Clooney) and Casey (Roberston). As adults, we were confused by the plot as it kept jumping between many scenes in the present and past. Twenty minutes into the movie, we finally settled to enjoy the spectacular visual imagery and enjoy the storyline. We were finally sure of our characters and began to engage with them. The film was extremely entertaining towards the end. Points that let the film down: 1. The beginning should have started with 'Tomorrowland' to captivate the audience into what life was like their and not a weird exchange between the two characters that was neither necessary or funny. 2. It was not clear to see who the target audience was. It led to a great debate between all of us. There was not a balance between humour for a young audience and an adult audience. It truly shifted. 3. Robertson was far too old to be playing a teenager in the movie. There were moments when someone would ask 'how old is she supposed to be in this film?' I think she was fantastic in the film but possibly not cast as a teenager. 4. Casey's younger brother confused many of us as we were wondering if that was little Frank because of the big shift in time. It was only until we saw little Frank more that we realised they were two complete different characters. Like I said, very confusing start to the film. Aside from the above, we thoroughly enjoyed the film and will be adding it to our ever growing Disney collection.",Tomorrowland
579,judithguy,Wonderful Movie!,10,9 October 2015,"I put off watching Tomorrowland because of all the negative reviews I was reading. I have discovered from past experiences that sometimes I will love the movie even if it has bad reviews,so I tried that with this movie – and I am so glad I did. I have absolutely no clue as to why some people do not like this particular movie. I think it has to do with the people of today and their spiritual vibe. Not anything religious, just basic human spirituality here. This movie will be enjoyed by only certain people. People who's frequencies match. That may sound like pure incoherent drivel, but trust me, it is far from that. Tomorrowland is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I have been around and have seen many movies too. Do not listen to these negative nannies here on IMDb. I seriously believe that many of them write negative reviews just out of pure malice.

580,behotkam,"If you are wondering about negative reviews, don't",10,14 October 2015,"I mean, don't be surprised. Yes, Tomorrowland is a science fiction adventure of the highest grade, an unpredictable thrill ride of a movie, full of plot twists, jaw-dropping imagery, hauntingly beautiful music, and brilliant acting by major star power. Not to mention the great direction and editing that does not leave a spare second throughout its two hour length. Disney, ILM and Pixar. Lindelof and Bird. Clooney and Laurie, Robertson and Cassidy. Wood and Murch. Giacchino. Rule-breaking and ingenious, inspiring and fresh, this is a top notch entertainment from a top notch talent. But it is more than all that. It is also a fable, a tale of two wolves. It makes its moral pretty clear.The thing is, people a fable is addressed to usually do not find it funny or cute. I wonder how many 'dumb', 'disappointing', 'preachy', 'pointless', 'boring', 'leftist propaganda', 'I fell asleep right when the Grasshopper...' Aesop was getting in his time. That is why Tomorrowland was a very brave thing to do. It takes guts to make a movie where everything from start to finish very smartly, very carefully, very distinctly adds up to the core message 'negativity is a failure' -- and to release it in a world full of negative people. Wow. I get why they hate it. I can also see why Brad Bird skipped Star Wars to make it. Personally, I think it was worth it. Thanks, Brad!",Tomorrowland

It has a great premise and George Clooney is in it so I figured there was at least one talented actor to look forward to. Unfortunately, that's where it ends for me. The writing didn't keep me interested and the main character is written in such a way that she is completely impossible to enjoy and says and does the most irritating things for someone who's supposedly so inventive. The only lovable people in this movie are Tim McGraw and Pierce Gagnon so there's that. I would say the best part is the beginning. After that the movie is just incredible slow, one of those shows where it seems like a lot is happening but it's really not. Considering previous reviews I think it's more just an acquired taste.",Tomorrowland

George Clooney, Hugh Laurie, and Raffey Cassidy all did an excellent job with their parts. Britt Robertson also did well with her part but I feel like she could have done better. There is a part where Nix (Hugh Laurie) says something excellent about human civilization in the present, and it is now one of my favorite movie quotes ever. It will probably go unnoticed by most people who watch this movie, however. It seems like the end of the movie was thrown together rather quickly in order to keep it at a certain length, which is a bit disappointing. We were deprived of a good ending in this one that could have been excellent with a bit more effort. Other than that, the visual and special effects were fun here. Will watch again.",Tomorrowland
583,leduca,Worth the watch - greatly underrated movie,10,20 January 2016,"I almost did not watch this movie due to the lower rating - thankfully the first review I read praised the acting and movie set. For that reason, I wanted to share a review highlighting the cast lineup which was phenomenal! Who could ask for more than having Hugh Laurie and George Clooney and Tim McGraw in the same feature movie! The special effects were ""out of this world"" (Please excuse the pun). This sci-fi story brings to the forefront the deliberate abuse that we are heaping on our Earth and that we are knowingly doing nothing to make a change. It speaks to never losing hope and to always keep the dreams alive. It was worth every minute of watching and is very entertaining and family friendly. Definitely a 10 out of 10 for me and a movie that I would watch again.",Tomorrowland

I don't watch Clooney often, but I'm happy he was in this.It simply tells a great story revealing ""secrets"" of the great minds of previous generations, and gives us plenty of back story and interesting laws that apply to ""Tomorrowland"" 5/7 would watch again.",Tomorrowland

586,tomhogan-43610,Incredible Facial Expressions,8,25 March 2016,"As far a science fiction goes, this movie is good enough. But what really struck me were the young actors with how believable their facial expressions were. I haven't seen this kind of acting since the days of Harrison Ford, Mel Gibson and Dustin Hoffman.Not surprisingly, George Clooney and Hugh Laurie are quite adept at subtle expression changes, something I have always appreciated about them. But the four kids, as young actors, had facial expressions that went right along with what was happening and what they were doing and saying. I can't tell - because I've never seen them before - if they are incredibly talented actors, or if it's due primarily to the direction of Brad Bird, who I also don't know. But all four of them - Britt Robertson, Raffey Cassidy, Thomas Robinson, and Pierce Gagnon - are all true actors, and I look forward to seeing more of them.Granted, Britt Robertson isn't a kid, but she is young. Her expressions were just incredible, and added immensely to the impact of her role. One of the most expressive acting I've seen in many years. Maybe she could coach Keanu Reeves? My applause, also, to the casting director for placing Thomas Robinson as the young Frank Walker. He was not only believable in his acting, but is also believable as a young George Clooney.",Tomorrowland
587,TomorrowlandSucks,Awful,4,28 March 2016,"I don't understand why I find so many good reviews for this movie. The story was ridiculous. The Eiffel Tower is a high tech antenna built by Nikola Tesla that transforms into a launchpad for an antique rocket that transports you to another dimension? Oh, and to get to the Eiffel Tower, our heroes used a magic transporter device that inexplicably uses satellites and unfortunately drains your body of 90% of its blood sugar. Thankfully there's a fridge at the other side (at the top of the Eiffel Tower) with a couple of bottles of Coca-Cola in it. Hurray for product placement. Britt Robertson then demonstrates the unfortunate bodily effects of drinking two bottles of soda in 10 seconds due to being drastically affected by the machine, while somehow George Clooney was miraculously able to walk away completely unscathed. If that sounds bad to you, you're likely not going to enjoy the preceding half hour of the protagonists trying to escape from robots trying to kill them with laser guns that turn humans into a burst of CG dust.I guess my point is that if you're the sort of person that isn't bothered by stuff like 10-year-olds inventing complex machinery that futuristic robots somehow know how to repair so that said 10-year- old can somehow know how to fly the invention that's never worked before around a city of nonsense, then you're likely not to mind the mountain of plot holes this movie rests upon. I'm sure this movie is perfectly enjoyable for children, but it was immature and annoying in my eyes =(",Tomorrowland
588,omar-62,Completely Underrated!,10,16 July 2017,"This movie is one of my all time favorites! This highly underrated movie is incredibly well balanced in story and action, and somehow manages to be funny at times. You will find yourself inspired at times and wondering why we cannot accomplish the monumental tasks similar to landing on the moon during mid-20th century, especially given advancements in our current digital age. A testament to Disney's vision of an advanced Utopian future, I would highly recommend this story for those individuals who want go on a roller coaster ride. I would also highly recommend this movie to those individuals with children. Some might warn against this, but I say it is an welcomed change to the traditional diatribe of reboots, remakes, and violent garbage offered now days.",Tomorrowland
589,essencebureau,a mediocre film,5,22 April 2016,"Surname of great architect Santiago Calatrava, which was written with little letters on the bottom of poster was a eye catcher for our architectural bureau "" Essencebureau "" team and big reason to watch this movie. But after watching this movie we had dual impressions. ""Just my opinion"" briefly: Positive moments is George Clooney cast ,his play making film brighter,cooperation with known architect in sci-fi film very good idea .Negative ones is - Predictable plot, a small number of hilarious,interesting moments, and a short timing of episodes in movie where was showed futuristic city made by Calatrava. In total mediocre film with famous persons. Surely it'll not be one of the best Disney movie for you but one time still worth to watching especially with a family members.",Tomorrowland
590,kunhammad,I felt like in paradise while watching this!,10,15 July 2016,"It took me to another world, I forgot all my negative feeling, Really one of the best movies ever! It made me feel good! this movie should have at least nine out of ten, mysterious, full of thrill, very awesome! You won't ever regret watching this, and you'll not forget it ever! I watched a lot of movies most of them disappointed me, and were a waste of time to me, even though they were with a high IMDb review, I really hesitated watching this movie because of the law review index, It really shocked me how a movie like this gets negative reviews from critics! And it is not hard to be understood as some people said, It was very smooth and like a dream! At last you really have to watch this!",Tomorrowland
591,facebook-37135,Fantastic child actresses and an excellent high speed pace -- underrated,10,5 September 2016,"This movie has one of the best sci fi child actresses performance I've ever seen.I was truly amaze and pleasantly surprise at the great acting performance of both Raffey Cassidy (Athena) and Britt Robertson (Casey).Britt's acting made it easy to feel the joyful emotion of her character as she gobbles up each new gadget.Raffey's acting was far superior to most A-rated adult actors.The pace of the movie was fast, but it didn't look rushed. Moreover it slowdown in the right places to let you capture the characters feelings and emotion.I can not see how anyone could rate this movie lower then an 8. This is the most underrated film I've ever watched.",Tomorrowland
592,tlxreed,A really excellent movie,8,24 December 2016,"The only reason I didn't give it a higher review was that as an avid sci-fi reader, I can't help but notice plot holes and improbabilities in the time travel scenario as depicted. Aside from that, the movie was tautly written and dealt with some pretty heavy themes regarding environmental destruction and war. It was pretty incredible seeing the antagonist deliver some scathing denunciations of our current society, this in a Disney flick. Tautly written, family friendly, kick ass female robot and protagonist, plus George Clooney. Great entertainment with thought provoking, continually evolving plot twists. It is not a dark, depressing movie and doesn't cavil about promoting a positive future available to us as a result of our current choices.",Tomorrowland
593,adewhitaker-81691,Captivating film,9,5 January 2017,"I'll keep this relatively short. I'm a 60 year old, very hard to please Brit. This film, pleased me very much indeed. Hence, the 9 out of 10 score. Those who marked this film down, really do require a reality check. I'm not usually given to writing film reviews, but on seeing this film's current low rating - I felt compelled to write something positive, in its favour. The acting and special effects alone, stand on their own. The film, may well be 105 minutes long, but it's 105 of the best spent minutes I've had, this millennium. I won't delve into the film's storyline, as that has been adequately explained by others. If you want to be engagingly captivated, in a futuristic, make-believe World - where anything seems possible - then this is the film for you. I for one, would love to escape the current mess of a World we live in - to experience the alternative dimension, on offer, in Tomorrowland: A World Beyond",Tomorrowland
594,franciscocdinis,Changing the world,10,5 October 2017,"Please watch this movie, it has been given bad reviews unfairly, it warns people about our dying world but it does it in an entertaining way. When the world is doomed, what do you do? You'd try to alert people so they could take action to prevent the death of the world from happening, right? And how would you do it? With news stories? Scientific data? Good luck. Most people would rather turn a blind eye to any environmental issues and just watch Walking Dead reruns to get their minds off it.But what if there was a movie that was family friendly, had a great cast, and even had the Disney name attached to it? What if Hugh Laurie had a remarkable and compelling speech which tried to get the message out to as many people as possible to get their acts together? To save civilization, the movie would show it's collapse.But how do you think this movie was received? The ticket sales were lackluster, because everyone would rather watch the same kind of movie they'd seen a hundred times before. People didn't care to see something original, they wrote it off BECAUSE it was original! Critics, internet reviewers, right-wing conservatives, all defecated upon this movie, and told people it was a waste of time.Meanwhile, the movie was actually a hidden gem. An entertaining film with a powerful message, but nobody cared to see it! And because nobody wanted to watch it, the message went unheard by so many. In every moment, there is the possibility of a better future, where people get off their lazy asses and actually take action to improve something! Learning a new skill, planting trees to make the air cleaner, spending time with their families, inventing new technology!But people would rather resign themselves to a boring future where they never do anything of value for one reason: Because it's easier. The future where we've solved world hunger, ended prejudice, and achieved world peace is hard. Achievable, but hard. And the future where everyone is a lazy glutton that does nothing but eat pizza and watch TV all day is easy.So yes. We saw there was a problem, and we tried to warn people. But they just ignored this warning like all the others. Why? Because they want to be lazy. They gave up.And it's not the movie's fault if it's not striking a cord with you, it's yours.",Tomorrowland
595,tiffanyhall-31575,Reading between the lines,10,12 October 2017,"Yes this movie has many points to point out that would make it an amazingly funny, cute and upbeat Disney movie. But my soul reason why I loved it, and gave it a 10 is the point. The reading between the line. The bases for the whole movie... for humanity to WAKE UP, our world is dying and we aren't doing anything about it. That one point in the movie were Nix explains the monitor... was the most revolutionary part in the whole movie. Brought tears to my eyes as I reflected on what he was saying and compared it to what is going on in the world. I need the writers of this movie to know... it has touched me. Thank you.",Tomorrowland

598,craigknight-69719,Great film. Please do not let the non dreamers spoil it for you,9,13 January 2021,"I have just watched this film again and loved it.It has all the feel good factors of a Disney film. You like the charcters, you feel for the characters.Is it cheesy? Of course it is its Disney. But thats the beauty of it. It shows you a world of what could be if we dreamed.....also what could be if we take the ""preacher"" perspective of some of the reviewers.A film is something that is supposed to take you away from reality. It inspires you, it makes you sad it makes you laugh...etc etc. When I read reviews and hear words like ""preachy"" and ""hollow"". I wonder if people that feel that way see films for what they are or just like being critical for the sake of it.In summary watch this film. If you have to switch of your brain whilst doing it, but let the kid in you come out again and think of when you had all of these dreams. For all of Disneys faults in the corperate world they make things like this to keep dreamers dreaming.",Tomorrowland
599,azurechestofdreams,Garbage,1,21 March 2019,"I'm not a paid review-writer who pretends to be an average movie goer who never writes reviews, so I actually will keep it short. The teen is a terrible actress and her character is super annoying. All she does is scream and ask stupid, pointless questions. The plot isn't revealed till the end of the movie, which often works, but failed miserably in this one. It's just a bunch of propaganda and yet more demonizing of an entire sector of society. Typical. Don't waste your time on this boring, annoying, shallow pile of trash.",Tomorrowland
600,shwinker,Everyone needs to watch this,10,11 November 2018,"This movie is great fun, entertaining and has a powerful message that everyone should hear. The acting is great and the characters are great. Effects are amazing. Time for people to wake up and feed the ""right wolf.""",Tomorrowland
601,ashjust,worth watching,10,28 November 2015,"Thought this movie was brilliant, very futuristic with an amazing picture. I was entranced in the movie the whole time! The acting was on point with lots of ""favorite"" actors in the movie and made you believe as if you were a part of the movie itself. I would most definitely watch this movie again, but would love to watch it in 3D. This is a feel good movie that makes you think and is enjoyable for any age group to watch. It's nice to see a movie that could have people left thinking about the environment and what more they could do for not only themselves but the world around them. Again I would suggest this movie to anyone!",Tomorrowland
