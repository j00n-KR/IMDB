0,SnoopyStyle,slow moving erotic thriller,5,2 May 2015,"It's 19th century Cuba. Luis Antonio Vargas (Antonio Banderas) is surprised that his mail order bride Julia Russell (Angelina Jolie) is that beautiful. She tells him that she deceived him with fake photos and he misled her about his wealth. They get married but later, she disappears with all of his money. Detective Walter Downs (Thomas Jane) arrives to find the real Julia for her sister Emily.This wants badly to be an erotic thriller. With the beautiful Jolie and sexy Banderas, this should be simple sexual dynamite. The problem is that the plot is slower than molasses and all the explosive eroticism in the world cannot drive this movie forward. Jolie can be extremely hot but she leaves me cold here. This movie doesn't have any excitement and certain no thrills at all.",Original Sin
1,ccthemovieman-1,Love Is Blind,6,30 June 2006,"Here's a ""steamy"" film - at least early on - about a Cuban (Antonio Bandaras_ who marries an American woman he had only previously written to, only to find out later she (Angelina Jolie) wasn't that woman but a scheming impostor (Billy Bob found this out in real life!) This is nicely photographed, ""lush"" being the best adjective to describe it. I didn't find the story very involving, yet it wasn't boring and I could relate to Bandaras' character. Perhaps many men could with the old ""love is blind"" story.This is one of those films with poor messages here and there where corrupt people live happily ever after despite their overt sins. There is an ""R"" version and a ""unrated"" version of this film, the latter being two minutes longer.",Original Sin
2,moonspinner55,Flagrantly ridiculous; one can have a good time laughing at it in spite of Antonio's strong performance...,3,8 August 2010,"A wealthy, handsome businessman in 1880s Havana advertises in the States for a marriageable woman to sail to his country, become his bride, and bear his children; however, the sultry, lusty young thing who arrives from Delaware curiously bears no resemblance to the photograph she has sent (she's even hotter!), and soon a private detective is snooping about asking questions. Cornell Woolrich's novel ""Waltz Into Darkness"" would seem an ideal murder-mystery/sexual thriller to absorb a modern-day audience (as a storyteller, Woolrich was far ahead of his time), but writer-director Michael Cristofer doesn't have the teasing personality, nor the sure-handed style, to bring out the juicy twists of this tale. Leads Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie look good together in and out of their clothes, but his forceful, full-blooded acting eclipses hers by a mile. Jolie is not convincing in this period setting; she has little range and, once the camera begins feasting upon her features in Mount Rushmore-like close-ups, her focus visibly wavers (it's a dreadful performance). Told in flashback, we are immediately privy to Jolie's mysteries, with an outcome that defies explanation. Cristofer intermittently tries out different photographic tricks and editing techniques, presumably to pad the running time but in effect showing off his uncertainty as a filmmaker. The dialogue (and Jolie's indifferent delivery of it) is often ludicrously funny, though Banderas deserves credit for at least attempting to take his part of the project seriously. *1/2 from ****",Original Sin
3,dbdumonteil,When paths of fear and alibis are black...,5,23 January 2005,"...And the nightmare is hung on your tree When an after dinner party's in the back Will you waltz into darkness with me?(Paul R.Michaud,1980)First adapted for the screen by Truffaut in 1969 (""la sirène du Mississipi"") ,with pretty good results.Although Woolrish's (Irish's ) tragic side eludes the French director ,the latter makes up for it by adapting the novel to HIS style and by depicting an amour fou.There were good tricks ,particularly the Snow White comic strip and the final open ending.And now a remake.Can this be called remake by the way?After all,it was an American novel from the start .Jean-Paul Belmondo's,Catherine Deneuve's and Michel Bouquet's parts are taken on by Antonio Banderas -a more credible planter than his French counterpart- ,Angelina Jolie -here I would favor Deneuve's perverse presence over her- and Thomas Jane -whose part is much more important than in Truffaut's version.At first sight,I thought that ""original sin"" was more faithful to Cornell Woolrich (William Irish) than Truffaut .""Waltz into darkness "" indeed as the characters move from the luminous landscapes at the beginning of the movie to the dimming light of the brothels,the dives,the dark corner of the streets and the station full of smoke.And beginning the movie when the die is cast (the whole film being a flashback) is Irishesque to the core.His novel ""I married a dead man"" ,a close relative to ""Waltzing into darkness"" ,begins with a woman realizing that now the game's over and they (she and her love) have lost . ""I married a dead man"" was adapted by Robin Davis in 1982 and was marred by a stupid happy end.That's what happens in ""original sin"".Its last sequences are ludicrous and laughable (notably ,the priest's help) and almost destroy the murky atmosphere the director managed to build .Most of William Irish's novels are desperate and most of the directors seem to be afraid to follow him into his darkest night.",Original Sin
4,Quinoa1984,Enough to make it watchable,6,6 August 2001,"Original Sin, a movie with scandal, surprises, and a whole lotta love (I mean the physical kind) has Antonio Banderas as a wealthy Mexican coffee maker owner who orders a mail order bride (weird to have this in 1900) played by Angelina Jolie.  They get married, seem to start falling in love, but then the film turns into a twisting film.  These twists give some great scenes of power for Banderas and Jolie to work off of, plus a excellent amount of sex and nudity from Jolie and a good feeling for the movie throughout.  Unfortunately, the film has some flaws including an overused music score, overacting, scenes that make the film confusing, and an ending that had me a little dissapointed, then really dissapointed.  Still , it's OK.  Thomas Jane has some wicked fun playing a, uh, detective. B",Original Sin
5,Coventry,Take a good guess why this BAD film is recommended after all?,5,16 September 2004,"Antonio Banderas (recently a promoter of potato chips in lame TV commercials) stars as a rich loser who mail orders himself an American bride. He's expecting an ugly broad but what he gets is the stunningly beautiful Angelina Jolie! He desperately falls in love with her (who wouldn't) and gives her access to all his bank-accounts (bad idea). The ravishing nymph quickly turns out to be a con artist and leaves him with a broken heart and financial hangover. With the help of a private detective, he goes after her. In all honesty: due to the dull sounding plot, I never would have checked out this film if it weren't for Jolie. Face it, Angelina is the most gorgeous actress alive and the fact she has several nude-sequences here is a damn good reason to sit through it. Female viewers might enjoy the looks of Banderas' butt-cheeks too in order to forget the weak story! Don't feel guilty about watching Original Sin just for this, the makers OWE you this much for sitting through this failure. The film is boring, the plot is so predictable and the entire production wishes to be so much classier than it actually is! ...And yet you keep staring at it! Why? Well, that's where Angelina Hot Lips kicks in again. You wouldn't want to risk missing out on another long close-up of her naked body, that's why! All in oneI liked the song by INXS much better.",Original Sin
6,michaelRokeefe,You can not just walk away from lust in love.,4,25 April 2003,"It is the 1880s and Cuba is a hotbed of commerce and personal manipulations. A wealthy businessman(Antonio Banderas) is thrust into a dizzy world of danger and mystery after marrying a sensationally beautiful woman(Angelina Jolie). Her past governs her future and her newlywed husband is obsessed with giving her his whole world. The story line seems at times a bit haphazard; but the steamy love scenes are worth more than the cost of admission. And we are talking about full redeeming nudity, because the story's very meaning lies within. Banderas has not been this powerful since MASK OF ZORRO(1998). And Miss Jolie evokes sex period. The sizzle between the two is what holds the movie together. In supporting roles are Thomas Jane and Jack Thompson. This movie may not be the best or even that memorable; but it will damn sure give you something to talk about.",Original Sin
7,sunwarrior13,High On Lust But Low On Logic,7,7 August 2013,"Original Sin is an erotic thriller based on the novel,Waltz into Darkness by Cornell Woolrich.Also,it is a remake of Mississippi Mermaid. Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas stars in it.Michael Cristofer directs.Luis Durand,portrayed by Antonio Banderas, is an 18th century coffee merchant whose supposedly plain mail-order bride turns out to be a sexy bombshell American Julia Russell,played by Angelina Jolie. Handsome and rich,Luis has never married. His expectations for the bride are realistic:kind,true and young enough to bear children.She does not have to be beautiful.But obviously,she sent the wrong photo.She sent someone who is of a plain woman.But she is far from that for she happens to be sultry and beautiful.She confesses she sent the wrong photo because she did not want a man who was attracted only to her beauty. He confesses, too: He owns his plantation and is not simply a worker there. He didn't want to attract a gold-digger.Then,both get married.At first,they seem happy. He is so smitten that he allows her access to all of his considerable financial resources. But the happiness ends when Julia vanishes in possession of her husband's money. He sets off in pursuit, although whether to kill her or to win her back, not even he can say.Too bad that the movie is contrived.Also,what's worse,it started to become illogical and absurd as the story progresses.Later,we learn a lot of the information from Julia herself who is in jail and being prepared for execution. Soon after Julia's disappearance, we learn she is not actually Julia at all, and that the real Julia was murdered. And many more plot twist until it provides the audience an ending where everything is turned around and it ends up cheating the audience.The acting was great in the early scenes for Banderas and Jolie have great chemistry but once Julia's loyalties are brought into question repeatedly, this chemistry is sacrificed for the story.Indeed,both the characters that they have played have become machinations for the plot. The only good thing about it is that it is high on lust as there are a lot of sensual and sex scenes between Jolie and Banderas that the audience would surely enjoy.But nothing more.",Original Sin
8,preppy-3,Dull dull dull,1,10 February 2003,"Antonio Banderas plays a rich Cuban man in the late 1800s-early 1900s, who orders a mail order bride (Angelina Jolie).  Unfortunately, she turns out to be a load of trouble.Horrible adaptation of a great book (""Waltz into Darkness"" by Cornell Woolrich).  There's some beautiful set design, exotic locations and good acting by Banderas and Jolie.  None of that can compensate for the leaden pace, horrible script, laughable performance by Thomas Jane (who appears drunk most of the time) and annoyingly jerky direction by Michael Cristofer. Also, why does this take place in Cuba?  The original novel is set in America.The only reason to see this tripe is for a very steamy sex scene between Banderas and Jolie within the first half hour.  After that, tune out. ALMOST worth sitting through for the real stupid ending (different from the book).A waste of talent.",Original Sin

If You are a Fan of Jolie's Lips than it is a Must See. Because there are Numerous Closeups of those Famous Kissers. There is Also a Generous Amount of Nudity and if You Catch the Unrated Version, More.The Film is Lavishly Produced and Looks Sumptuous in that Steamy, Tropical, Lurid Way that these Types of Antiquated Stories Set in an Antiquated Cuba must Deliver. Otherwise You pay Too Much Attention to the Dialog and the Expected Twists and Turns that are Forthcoming.Noir Writer Cornell Woolrich is the Source Material here and it is All Double Crosses and Unreasonable Love (or is it lust, someone asks) and the First Ending before the Real Ending will Answer that Again and Again and Again and Again.Not the Worst of this Type of Thing it has Enough Chutzpah to Carry the Heavy Handedness for the Duration. Just Don't Expect Anything too Snappy. It isn't Exactly as Crappy as the Critics Insist and its Mega Failure at the Box Office Speaks for Itself. But here it is, Take it or Leave it.

10,anaconda-40658,Not So Original.,3,29 July 2015,"Original Sin (2001): Dir: Michael Cristofer / Cast: Antonio Banderas, Angelina Jolie, Thomas Jane, Jack Thompson, Gregory Itzin: Stupid title as if there was any such thing. Antonio Banderas plays a successful business man awaiting mail order bride Angelina Jolie. She has strange dreams, visible scars and a sister who claims that she is not her sister. Banderas makes the mistake of allowing Jolie access to his account and she leaves him dry. Crushed, he seeks her with murder in mind. Well directed by Michael Cristofer with spectacular art direction and photography. His only previous film credit is Body Shots besides work in TV. Begins well then falls into steamy sex scenes and a revolting conclusion. Banderas plays a man whose love is real but his deeds are the result of corruption. Viewers will likely groan at anyone who leaves their accounts open because they are blinded by lust. Jolie is difficult to visualize as a mail order bride but the relationship is just a sexual tease and boring erotica. The ending is also difficult to swallow when factoring in issues of trust. Thomas Jane as a sleazy detective is the one good performance. Other roles are pretty much useless and never develop into anything worthwhile. The film's purpose is clear to anyone with any form of intelligence. It is sinfully pointless and stupid with laughable excess in steamy sex and other nonsense. Score: 3 ½ / 10",Original Sin

Antonio and Julia made a charming couple and especially when they were both involved in gambling with cards.   There were hot scenes in the bed and a giant old time bath tub which got quite steamy!

Uninspired drivel with poor  chemistry between Banderas and Jolie, ""OS"" is artistically and technically good but so lacking in sincerity and believeability that it does not beg the question ""how will it end"" but, rather, ""when""?

14,dromasca,A Real Sin,5,28 December 2002,"Amazing! Antonio Banderas and Amgelina Jolie are among the biggest stars in the movies industry today. They are being paid millions for each role, and should be getting many offers for good films. Why then, why did they accept becoming involved with such a bad movie? They, or their agents should have rejected this script, lacking both action as well as artistic logic.
The story sets in the end of century (19th, of course) Havana. A rich plantation owner orders for unknown reasons a mail wife from the US. Hete comes Angelina Jolie - she is more beautiful than he expected, he is richer than he expected (really? so why did she do what we learn a little bit later that she did) and a marriage planned a few hour later triggers a series of illogical B-class movie events. Nothing works, none of the setting has any artistic emotion or esthetic value. Acting is bad, with the exception of Banderas who gives a fine performance despite everything around. Jolie is amazingly beautiful, but her act is no more average. 5/10 on my personal scale. A movie to miss without too many regrets.",Original Sin
15,atlasmb,Unravel the Mysteries of Original Sin,7,8 April 2014,"""Original Sin"" starts with an improbable premise: that a wealthy man would venture to marry a woman he had never met and a beautiful woman would agree to marry a man she had never met. When we first meet Luis Vargas (Antonio Banderas) and Julia Russell (Angelina Jolie), there is the inescapable feeling that neither would have trouble finding a mate. We are half correct.This story has a number of twists in it, twists that I won't divulge so that the viewer's journey is more enjoyable. Luis owns a coffee plantation in Cuba. He falls in love with Julia. Their lives seem idyllic until the young woman disappears. The romance now becomes a mystery. In his efforts to discover what happened to Julia, Luis crosses paths with those of the lower social strata, shall we say, and his love propels him to make choices that he never would have dreamed of in his pre-Julia days.Along the way, the story of ""Original Sin"" takes a turn near ""Vertigo"" then continues on its winding way into unforeseen areas. The plot involves mistaken identities, a few red herrings, and some major grifting. In the end, all the piece of this puzzle come together, leaving us with a tale about love, faith and, maybe, redemption.The entire journey is lovingly filmed in some beautiful Mexican settings. The two lovers are beautiful in their own rights and the camera dwells on their images as part of the lush environs. But Banderas and Jolie are more than pretty faces; their acting is convincing. For the most part, the other actors also feel like they inhabit the places and times of ""Original Sin"".Anything more I might say about this film could reveal some plot lines, so I will just say I give it a score of 7 out of 10.",Original Sin
16,leplatypus,Love will tear us apart again (DVD),7,13 February 2011,"Back to back with director Cristofer and this time, he finally has a decent movie: Gone the stupid scripts, the flashy pain because here it's a good love story mated with a riveting thriller.At first, when i discovered that the story was set in Spanish culture (explaining the casting of Banderas), i was dubious but the director really focuses on the characters and their relationships. In addition, his camera is quick and it has the exciting move of surrounding, traveling the characters, even as they walk. But, he is maybe too fast because i don't understand two moments: first, when Banderas meets again with the detective, why there's no mention of their Sunday meeting? Two, why did they go then to Havana? Overall, I think this movie offers great lines about love (""to give"") and lust (""to take"") and portrays true lovers, because Banderas and Angie are ready to follow whatever the blows they got. (Personnaly, i lived that and i quit!).I admit that Banderas is a truly gifted actor and that it was cool to see Angelina back in her old powerful characters after her recent failures. Jane (the actor) is really the irritating guy because he has already annoyed ""La"" Bellucci in ""Under suspicion"".",Original Sin
17,smatysia,Angelina Jolie shows herself to fine advantage,7,30 March 2015,"What to say about this film? Set in Cuba in the late 19th century (with steamships and trains, but before electricity and the war) the Mexican shooting locations look very good. Also looking very good is Angelina Jolie, before her current anorexia. She shows herself to fine advantage and looks lovely in the late Victorian dresses and hairstyles. She showed real acting chops as well in this movie. Antonio Banderas did a fine acting job as well in this period drama. They both have the photogenicity and charisma that makes a movie star. This film has a bit of an unlikely plot, complete with some holes. It also goes to show you about the wisdom (or lack thereof) in trusting a woman.",Original Sin
18,sauravjoshi85,Much more was expected from this movie,6,4 December 2020,"Original Sin is a thriller movie directed by Michael Cristofer and stars Antonio Banderas, Angelina Jolie and Thomas Jane.Two great actors Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie, with an impressive plot you'd expect much more but somewhat failed to execute.Acting by both the leads were decent but the chemistry were clearly missing from both the leads, although Thomas Jane was surprisingly good. Plot could've made more intelligently and the movie start with a loophole. for instance when Luis played by Antonio had introduced himself as poor clerk how did Julia played by Angelina got to know that he is a rich man. Screenplay is unevenly paced and weakens in middle but still manages to hold the audience, climax is good and Cinematography is decent and could've been better.I have read mix to negative reviews of the movie and in my opinion the movie had the potential to become a great thriller movie but somewhat had missed the mark.",Original Sin
19,Samiam3,"A beautiful picture with a mediocre story, watchable though for sure.",6,8 May 2010,"I find it difficult to pass judgement of films based on novels when I have not read the novel. (unless of course the novelist was the screen writer like Michael Blake with Dances with Wolves) Original Sin feels like somewhat familiar territory. I cannot quite pin point a film off the back of my head which used this idea. I suppose though, that if labelled an erotic thriller anyone can name fifty films off the back of their heads. I think I can see Original Sin working as a novel. As a movie though, it has some storytelling problems, which depending on your attention span may weaken the experience. I am reminded a bit of Basic Instinct. What we have here a sexy and erotic game which sort of goes in circles. Original Sin is the superior movie in part because it is more beautiful, the sex is less distracting, Banderas and Jolie are a better screen couple, and the ending of the movie is a nice touch.Set in Havana, in what looks like the late 19th century. The curtain rises on the luxurious home of Don Luis Vargas. He has recently mail ordered a bride from the states, who shows up the next day. Her name is Julia. They are married in the sunshine of a beautiful afternoon, and they are happy. A few days later however, Julia disappears. Not only that but Luis' bank accounts have been cleared. Not only that, but he finds out that the girl he married is not the Julia Russell he has been sending letters to in the months leading up to their wedding. Oh and not only THAT but the real Julia may have been killed at this woman's hand. suddenly Vargas is in the middle of a very dangerous game, once he goes looking for his apparent wife.The film is sprinkled with several contrived twists and turns, which are typical of almost all thrillers. It is not inventive in the least, but it IS aesthetically evocative, and fairly engaging. In the same way Titanic was a contemporary love story set a hundred years ago, Original Sin is a contemporary erotic-thriller set around the same time (give or take a couple of decades) It turns out to be not bad, there is certainly room for improvement, but it's watchable.",Original Sin
20,triple8,Utterly and Completely over the top.,6,8 May 2005,"SPOILERS THROUGHOUT: Original Sin is a movie that is completely over the top in every way particularly the dialog. Of coarse that doesn't mean it wasn't entertaining, I was most definitely entertained-hence the 6 rating. Original Sin is a movie that should have come out in the eighties, it's got a kind of lush, glamorous, larger then life, feel to it and since the eighties were full of these type of movies, it feels more suited to that time period. I actually moderately enjoyed this movie at times, though, at other times I wanted to go to sleep. It probably should have been a bit shorter.Original Sin stars two of the best looking movie stars in the world-Antonio Banderus and Angelina Jolie. Yet strangely, their chemistry together was not strong. Not to me anyway. They were almost to good looking, their looks detracted from the storyline, instead of seeing a female con artist and her hapless husband, at times I saw-two larger then life, gorgeous Hollywood movie stars. And it REALLY didn't help that the Banderus character was given so little to do. Except follow Jolie around that is. Banderus is an incredibly talented actor and his character should have been a bit more multi dimensional, this role didn't play to his strengths. The general acting however was fine by all. It was the way the story progressed that I had trouble with.Firstly, all of the plot twists were dizzying and rather then being edge of your seat exciting it was, at times, a bit to melodramatic. I like psychological thrillers where the suspense seems natural and not force fed and it didn't here. You always know your watching a movie although the sumptuous visuals and just the general sultry, balmy quality of the movie keep you moderately involved all the same which is why I still gave it a 6. It wasn't BAD at all, just over the top and took itself way to seriously. I liked the premise, love psychological thrillers and like and admire the performers featured in this. I just thought the movie seemed to be playing more for outrageousness then for slow tension building excitement which it really didn't have so much. And there is such a thing as a movie having to many twists and turns.I was however interested in seeing how it all played out and it did get way more interesting toward the end(the romance starts to gain in intensity and intrigue) and I could see even watching it again if I'm in a certain mood as it's one of those ""guilty pleasure"" type movies. My vote is 6.5 Out of 10.",Original Sin
21,Sherazade,Weird!,5,21 May 2006,"The only reason this film was ever made, was probably because the director or producer or whatever found out that casting had gotten Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas to say years to a potential project, and in their glee they just wanted to come up with something that would make both actors (famous for their smoldering sexy looks) sizzle on screen. A lot of the stuff that goes on in the film does not make sense nor look good but because it's Tony and Angie we're expected to either pardon it or just gulp it up. Too bad the Razzie people weren't buying it. There were so upset with Angie that year that they nominated her twice for worst actress for both this film and the first Tomb raider film. Maybe it was her accent in both films that ticked them off? I didn't buy her accent in this one either...Anywho, the film is about a rich Don (ala Zorro) who advertises for a wife from overseas and gets one, just not the one he ordered but falls in love with her anyway. Sooner than later things begin to unravel and he gets a bad comeuppance when he doesn't take heed to advice. But will that be the end of him or will he pursue toxic love till the very end?

22,tomsview,Sinful romp,7,17 January 2013,"Set in the 19th Century, the film is about a Cuban Coffee planter, Luis Antonio Vargas played by Antonio Banderas, who advertises for a wife in an American Newspaper. She duly arrives in the form of Angelina Jolie. When she asks him why he wanted an American wife he answers, ""Here we are the past and there you are the future"".He marries her, finds that he really loves her, is then deceived and robbed by her, seeks revenge but falls in love with her again only to be enmeshed in her deceitful lifestyle. It was a tall order to make it all work; the film bites off more than it can chew then chews like crazy for the rest of it's running time.""Original Sin"" has enough packed into its 116 minutes to provide the material for a six-hour mini-series. The film is based on ""Waltz Into Darkness"", a novel by Cornell Woolrich, who must rank just behind William Shakespeare for producing the largest number of works that have been turned into film.""Original Sin"" is fast-paced, beautifully photographed, and features two charismatic stars – it all works perfectly as long as you just go along with it. Where the film runs into trouble is in consistency of tone, especially in the second half. But even if the only consistent tone in ""Original Sin"" is Angelina Jolie's nail enamel, part of the fascination is seeing how the filmmakers manage to get the story out of the many corners they have painted it into.One thing is for sure, Angelina Jolie dominates the screen. The filmmakers also showed a fascination with those famous lips; so much so that a couple of sequences start with a close-up of her lips before the camera pulls back to reveal the whole scene. In fact, she is photographed to great advantage in this film, and her Victorian era costumes suit her so well she looks as though she could sit for a portrait by John Singer Sargent the moment the director called cut.The interaction between Jolie and Banderas is fascinating and actually carries the movie over the rough spots in the plot. Calm and controlled, their performances have considerable depth despite the mounting implausibilities of the story. A couple of the supporting roles are also interesting; Australian Jack Thompson, who did brisk business around this time playing portly Southern gentlemen, plays Vargas' friend who warns him against Jolie's character. The other is Thomas Jane who plays a detective in a somewhat bizarre role.""Original Sin"" is a throwback to an era in Hollywood filmmaking when the audience accepted a fairly far-fetched plot as long as it was wrapped in the gloss of fabulous stars and a lavish production. Anyone looking for reality in film can forget this one, but the two attractive stars light up the screen, and despite everything that has gone before, it has a satisfying ending that brings a smile to the face.",Original Sin
23,MR_Heraclius,fantastic love story.,7,23 February 2020,"This is a tragic story. Angelina and Antonio make for a very enticing pairing but nothing is as it seems. Can love really exist or is all a double-sided blade of emotions and illusions, lies and deception?",Original Sin
24,baumer,"I wanted to leave, then I liked it, then I wanted to leave again...",6,9 August 2001,"With much trepidation I ventured to go see Original Sin.  It was with hesitation and angst because I really didn't think there was much to look forward to in the film.  The trailers didn't make it look overly appealing and to be honest I really didn't hear much from the stars in the promotion department.  But, today it is about 45 degrees here in Toronto ( that is about 110 for our metrically challenged American friends ) and even though I had pretty much seen everything else, the idea of spending 2 hours in an air conditioned theater and only paying six dollars to see the film, appealed to me.  So I did.  And to be honest, I can't decide if it is a film that I enjoyed or I despised or if it is somewhere in between.  There were times when I was mildly interested, times when I was emotionally involved and there were many times when I was completely apathetic to it.  So what do I say about a film that makes me feel so much yet so little.  Well it was better than many of the teen gross out comedies that have come out in the past few years and not as good as almost every other film I have seen.  So that means it rates around a 6 out of 10.Spoilers ahead!The film is about deceit and how love can blind you and make you do silly and/or stupid things.  Antonio Banderas has it all at the beginning of this film.  He is a handsome man that enjoys the fruits of his coffee business and he is now looking forward to meeting his new bride that he sent away for from the U.S. ( leave it up to those damn Americans to ruin everything ). What was puzzling was why Jolie has a British accent if she was from Delaware or Maryland or wherever.  But no matter.  Jolie is that bride and when asked why she replied to newspaper about a Cuban that wanted a woman to marry and bear children, she replies that she is looking to forget the past and start a new future.  So they move on and get married that same day. 
The beginning of the film moves along at a snails pace.  For the first half an hour, nothing happened.  They met, they married, they had sex, in which we get to see lots of Jolie and her ample bosom, but it was actually quite boring.  Then something wonderful happens.  We find out that Jolie is not who she says she is and she has taken all of his money and left him, penniless and heart broken.  Now I was intrigued and for the next half an hour we get to see the deception involved.  Banderas goes to Havana to find her with the help of a detective from the U.S. and low and behold, he finds her in Havana.  They make up and then get back together and then the real deceit begins.Original Sin is good when there are elements of surprise flanking the story but incredibly mundane when they are telling the rest of the tale.  There are two many shots of Jolies' lips and to agree with some of the other reviewers in here, the editting in the film was bothersome and annoying.  I don't know why they would edit it that way except to think that they did it because it is like they were editting it the way someone tells a story, with deliberate breaks and rebeginnings.  Sort of like..."" and then she did this"" ""and then he came to her"" and so on.  But the editting process was not at all done properly and no matter what effect they were going for, it failed miserably.Finally we get to the end where it makes the film sort of misunderstood, at least by me.  I couldn't understand what they were trying to tell the audience, and they were clearly talking to the audience as they looked straight into the camera and told their tale.  It reminded me a bit of The Usual Suspects in the sense that you are wondering if this was a story all told from the two leads point of view, therefore never knowing what was real and what was a fabrication.Original Sin is not a terrible film, it isn't a great film.  It is a little murky and if that is what they were going for then they succeeded beautifully.  I wouldn't want to see it again, even though there are many unanswered questions.  It was just too... strange.6 out of 10--  Not something you want to spend your money on in the summer time.  Bring on American Pie 2!!",Original Sin
25,NijazBaBs,"funny, realistic, negative",9,29 December 2020,"I liked this movie for being very romantic and funny, while very real. It shows how, just like in reality, guys can be naive, and girls can be dangerous. Negativity dominates in form of betrayal, disappointment, rejection, abandonment, loneliness, sadness, immorality, sins, desperation, hatred, anger. Motivates me to be anything from very picky and careful about girls, to live a completely single life, because it makes woman look dangerous here, as I find to be true in real life. Too much mature, sinful, sexual acts and too much focus on hot girl. Although lot of small romantic jokes, there is lack of real action as in some action movies, and too much negative stuff in form of relationship problems. Reminds me of seriousness of the problem, comparable to real life relationship problems like homicides, suicides, divorces.",Original Sin
26,hall895,Lukewarm at best,4,21 December 2012,"Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie star in an erotic thriller which is not particularly erotic and certainly not thrilling. Yes, the obligatory Banderas-Jolie sex scene sizzles. But after that the movie fizzles out completely. The heat goes out of this movie very early on. The story relies on myriad plot twists which never really convince or satisfy. The dialogue is awkward throughout, often downright laughable. The acting leaves much to be desired. Banderas and Jolie are not very good. But they're better than Thomas Jane who, in the movie's one key supporting role, hams it up to ridiculous extent. There are a few interesting moments sprinkled throughout. But not nearly enough of them to save what is ultimately a rather bad movie.The movie's story is told in flashback with Jolie's character, Julia, narrating. She does so from a prison where she is awaiting execution. How did she get there? Should be interesting finding out. Should be but really isn't. The story unfolds in 19th century Cuba with the Banderas character, Luis, having sent for a mail-order bride. Julia duly arrives from Delaware but she is not the woman in the photograph she had sent ahead of her arrival. She is not the woman she claimed to be but Luis is not who he claimed to be either, much wealthier than he had let on. But while it becomes apparent that Luis truly has the best of intentions it is just as clear that Julia is a woman with some demons and secrets. What darkness lies beneath the surface? Detective Walter Downs, played by Jane, shows up to help Luis sort out the mess Julia makes. From here the story relies on tricks. But you can see the twists and turns coming a mile away. There's nothing to surprise you. There's really very little of interest at all. The story limps along towards its conclusion. Yes, we find out why Julia's in that prison cell. But by the time we do most in the audience will find they really don't care anymore. The movie has completely lost its hold on us. And then as a final insult the ending is just ludicrously stupid, a tacked-on bit of nonsense which undercuts the whole movie. Not that there was very much worthwhile to be undercut anyway.",Original Sin

Bandaras and Jolie have incredible chemistry which makes this work. I love the ending.,Original Sin
28,MihaiSorinToma,A romantic but predictable story,7,5 September 2017,"A very wealthy man gets madly in love with a gorgeous woman whom he marries, soon to realize that her appearance hides a darker side, one which will send him on mysterious and unthinkable paths. His love has no boundaries, so he's determined to do anything in his power to get her back, no matter the consequences, although she seems to have other plans.It's a tale which presents what blindness can love bring to a man and what he is capable of doing if it is taken away from him. Although full of mystery in the beginning, the plot soon unravels, thus becoming a bit too predictable and boring. The main character's foolishness seems to keep on forever, but, as a result of his efforts, it all ends unexpectedly well for him. This movie is full of sensual moments, derived from the two protagonists' love but not only. It's interesting, excluding its mentioned downsides, and it provides an unexpected finale which raises the bar a bit, sort of.Overall, it's an average movie, a bit more like a soap opera than a film, which should be watched for its two main characters, not for its story or action.",Original Sin
29,perfectbond,Overlooked erotic thriller,7,25 February 2003,"Original Sin slipped under the radar and in fact tanked at the box office back in the summer of 2001 despite the fact that it starred Angelina Jolie at the peak of her fame. The movie itself is not bad at all. There are surprises a plenty which of course I won't reveal. Since the expected doesn't occur that provides plenty of incentive to follow the story through to the end. Since the movie is an erotic thriller there are of course... erotic scenes! Ms. Jolie is definitely an attractive woman by conventional standards! It goes without saying that her smoldering looks keep the viewer fixated on her character, Julia. Banderas fans should note that his chemistry with a female costar hasn't been this good since his hookup with Catherine Zeta-Jones in Zorro.  Thomas Jane, whose other work I am not familiar with, is also excellent in his role. Very good entertainment, 7/10.",Original Sin
30,CountZero313,great script and acting,7,27 July 2007,"Banderas excels in this period grifter piece about a man's love for a woman who believes herself unlovable. Jolie pulls her weight, too, giving glimpses of just enough vulnerability to temper the extreme mean streak her character exhibits, not least when she attempts to kill her husband not once, but twice. Thomas Jane as antagonist keeps up the high-calibre acting. The script twists and turns without ever letting down its theme, the redeeming power of love. What stops Original Sin from being great is the camera-work and editing. In one scene in a brothel the 360- degree pan distorts the edges of the frame and induces nausea. Jump cuts are over-used, and seem out of place in terms of the feel and period setting of the film. Less obtrusive craftsmanship would allow the audience to give the story the full attention it deserves.",Original Sin
31,FlickJunkie-2,A waste of talent,4,10 May 2002,"Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie are bankable stars with bright futures. How they agreed to sign on to this weak screenplay escapes me.  Jolie plays Julia, a mail order bride who turns out to be something quite different from the catalogue item.  Banderas plays Luis, who falls instantly and madly (and stupidly) in love with her upon picking her up from her journey. 
They have steamy sex with lots of gratuitous nudity and then the story begins.  Julia skips town with a bunch of Luis' cash and for the rest of the film, Luis follows her around like a love sick lap dog begging her to take him back and abuse him some more.   The plot twists and turns, but the `surprises' are so obvious that they may as well have put up road signs saying, `WATCH OUT, PLOT TWIST AHEAD.' The dialogue is banal and mindless and the characters are transparent and simplistic.  The viewer comes away without being able to identify with either character.  Luis is so pathetic that we can feel only disgust and lack of respect for all his groveling, and Julia is so callous and wicked that no amount of attractiveness can overcome the revulsion she elicits.This film is a dreadful waste of talent.  I rated it a 4/10.  One can only hope that this tripe does not deflect the careers of two promising actors.",Original Sin
32,diane-34,Much underrated!,9,2 January 2006,"Unfortunately I saw this marvelous film on TV last night-unfortunate because it was on the small TV screen and not a large movie screen. I admit it-I am totally taken by period pieces whose setting is somewhere in Latin America and if those movies have good sets and/or locations then I am smitten. Original Sin, set in Cuba and filmed in Mexico had the visuals down perfect-throw in the acting of Jolie and Banderas and you have a visual feast.The book/script were fabulous vehicles for the acting of the majors as well as a framework that works beautifully for the intrigues that pepper this film. This script should keep viewers interested throughout and I will definitely be renting this film so that I can savour it without interminable commercials. I want to wallow in the beauty of the images and settings at least one more time.Any viewer who likes settings and images from slightly earlier times owes it to themselves to look for Original Sin in their local rental shop because it is a wonderful film that seemed to slip by the reviewers when it was released.",Original Sin

Well of course it must have something to do with that original sin as the essence is that the Bible was right, women are evil and that's exactly what Banderas will feel once he ""orders"" his American bride. Banderas is a superrich South=American industrial who needs a mailorderbride just because he has to be married and doesn't believe in love, something he better should maintain as love will ruin him both financially and psychologically.

On DVD, this grubby little film seems even more perfect. People can now enjoy it for what it is, in the privacy of their own home. What is Original Sin?  It's a nasty good time.  Class is obviously not in this film's vocabulary.  Instead, the film wants purposely to be nothing more than a guilty pleasure flick -- and that is exactly what it is.Jolie gives one of the most calm and steady performances to date -- as the woman who can not be trusted.  On the other hand, Banderas seems to have mastered the role of the obsessed lover -- I can't imagine anyone else playing the part.  Thomas Jane is unbelievably perverse -- which is perfect for this film.With some very hot sex scenes; it's cheap film noir roots; and an excellent soundtrack by Terence Blanchard -- this film is a perfect DVD waiting to be spanked.A gorgeous film and a naughty good time!",Original Sin
36,cinephile-27690,8.5 stars out of 10.,8,7 November 2018,"This is the only movie I have ever given an 8.5. I was debating between 8 and 9 and knew it had to be in-between. Original Sin is very good, but near the end it starts to dwindle in pacing. But that does not hinder the movie from being very good.The movie stars Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie. You are probably familiar with Jolie, but if you don't know AB, he voiced Puss in Boots in the Shrek sequels and played Zorro in The Mask of Zorro. I also think Jolie was the best actor in the movie.The premise starts out like Amadeus. Jolie is in jail and sees a priest to confess her crime at the end of the story. She tells him that she married a man that she only knew from letters that they wrote. However, she soon later has an affair, and she steals all that he has. It turns out beauty may sometimes only be skin deep.Original Sin is known as an ""erotic thriller."" That title is slightly a misnomer. There are a handful of sex scenes that are a bit graphic and a little embarrassing to watch. However, there is not as much sex as the DVD case implied.But I will give credit to the movie that all but one scene is within marriage! The other is between the wife and another man and the movie clearly condemns it. (Not only with the plot but with the film title as well.)All in all, Original Sin was very good, despite it's pacing(and this may have to do with the fact that I have the unrated version that is slightly longer). I highly recommend it but if nudity bothers you or your'e not largely interested, this isn't a must watch. But if you are compelled to see it, then I think you should.",Original Sin
37,tburke85,Original Sin Is A Disappointing Thriller,4,5 June 2009,"Original Sin is a disappointing thriller starring Antonio Banderas, Angelina Jolie, and Thomas Jane. For those of you who haven't seen it I wont say anything else about the movie except for the solid acting by most of the cast the movie failed to entertain and left me disappointed. The director does an all right job of bringing this movie to the big screen but unfortunately the pacing is slow and the film could've been a lot better. The only reason I gave this movie four stars out of ten is because of the attempt by the actors and the very steamy sex scene between Banderas and Jolie that really pushes the R rating. If you're a fan of either of the stars than you might like this movie more than me. There are a few twists and surprises you might not see coming but then again you might expect it because I for one did. Despite the talent of Banderas and Jolie who try to bring life to the characters the same can go for Jane who does an okay job with the supporting role he does have the movie itself just isn't that great. The film does have strong sexual content, nudity, language, and some violence so this is no movie for parents to see with their kids at least not until their seventeen or over. Overall Original Sin isn't that good of a movie and you're better off watching something else. Unless your a kid who wants to see Jolie featured in a graphic sex scene and without her clothes on then this is the movie for you. Otherwise skip Original Sin and watch a better thriller that's worth watching more than once.",Original Sin

As I watched, I kept thinking: ""aren't they supposed to be in love?"" because they sure didn't act like it. There was no romance, no nothing. Like two wild animals. It left me cold.The costumes were as yummy as the sets were fake. The leads were badly underwritten. Banderas nails Luis's little-boy innocence, Jolie nails Bonnie's ice-cold cunning, but I didn't care about either of them, nor did I believe that he would willingly ruin himself for her. That he winds up taking Billy's place was beyond belief!And I have a silly question: how did Billy find out Luis was actually loaded if poor Ms. Russell thought he was just a humble clerk at a coffee company?",Original Sin

She seems to be nutty as a fruitcake in ""real life"" but who cares, she is quite a wonderful actress and anyone who didn't get turned on by this sexy steamy film with a fine plot is simply out of touch. Banderas as also come a long way as well. I enjoy him more and more. The two have a chemistry that steams us the theatre.

With Ms. Jolie and Banderas headlining, with some sensual cinematography to match, Original Sin is a hit in its own right. Unfortunately, everything else, from the flaky script to the dry music, takes the stir out of the moment.A professional Cuban sends out for a mail-order bride from Delaware. Instead he gets one big headache with a beautiful body.There are long movies, and then there are LONG movies. This was easily the latter. The movie is so drawn out, with no sensuality, no deep and true heart except for the first and last fifteen minutes. Cristofer, who made well use of Angelina in 'Gia,' does the same justice here too. Truly there is no use for this movie except for the first half hour, when you can attempt to make life imitate the art on screen.",Original Sin

42,jrfranklin01,Insane Infatuation,4,19 November 2004,"How wrapped up can a guy get in a she-devil? That is, perhaps in a nutshell, the best portrayal this film attempts. You have the usual lies, sex, deceit (just another way of saying more crafty lies), and false identities (more lies) in a canvassing masquerade of betrayal (oh, more lies!). The title of this should have actually been ""Original Sin(s)"", as it achieves just about all of them at least twice and in a short period of time. I am reminded by the old adage of messing with a snake and getting bit in this film. Or playing with dirt and getting dirty. In either case, good people fall victim to bad over some misguided concept of love. The harlot gets her knight-in-shining-armor and the knight succumbs to a succubus' poison apple. In the end, nobody really wins anything. But what you do get is Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie in some steamy scenes together after arranging a blind date marriage. The film is set back a bit, I would say in the 1800s, with Antonio as a wealthy coffee merchant and Angelina acting to be someone else, who's acting to be someone else (where the deceit comes in obviously). Antonio's foreign wife turns out to be anything but what he expected in more ways than one. He soon realizes that marriage truly can be a dangerous thing when he is left alone and penniless.Infatuation then seeks to change the suitor and the ill-suited (as was the extent of this film). 4/10",Original Sin

SFAIK, 2nd time a dude kisses him and this is way back before it was acceptable, lol! Also he didn't seem to be resisting much but he's character doesn't like it. And he's a macho Spain man so you do the math! ;-) So he wait's for the guy to kiss him in the mouth without reacting much, then he act's like his mad to be kissed. The sex scenes are pretty gross with him and Angelina, it looks like they really did it (so the trivia section say's). It's a very confusing film. I had to switch channels for 1min 50 secs when he first play's cards and then I couldn't follow the film anymore. They don't tell you when it's a dream, when it's real, when it's fake, thinking, pretending or a flashback? All I know is the corpse's won't stay dead lol! Well, it's fast paced enough so you're not bored but the movie is pretty bad. Also, Angelina might be jolie but she can't act. She does the same thing in all her films, she closes her eyes like she's being very dramatic but it makes me laugh cos it's as bad as Kathy Bates in The Day The Earth Stood Still, remember that LOL scene? That bad. Oh and can someone tell me if the detective was the same character that the man who control's Julia/Bonnie that she loves/works for him?? I didn't get it.

He gives the impression of a man who has been deeply disappointed by love, but a man of his social position needs a wife and family. He sends away for a bride, not caring what she looks like. When ""Julia"" turns out to be beautiful and interesting, he opens himself up to her romantically and falls hard. The first third of the plot is too heavily foreshadowed, but then it becomes more clever and interesting. Antonio and Angelina have great chemistry on screen, but the third most important element is the lush turn-of-the-century Cuba setting. The cinematography is rich and evocative. I gave it an 8 out of 10.",Original Sin
45,lingmeister,What a piece of junk,4,21 December 2002,"I watched this movie with very low expectation, and came out disappointed.With 30 minutes or so into the film, I thought to myself, OK, this is one of those slow sudsy plots that doesn't have much going on except for the great settings, lots of music scores to fill in the void and gratuitous nude scenes.  Inserted in it were a few blatant attempt to warn the viewer to remember such and such an event with the emphasis on specific scenes like the prolonged shot on the suitcase or the signing of the account.  You think to yourself, OK, signs to the logically challenged, but lets leave judgement until later.But when the suspicion started to rise with the appearance of the sister and private investigator, things started to fall apart with plot holes developing left and right.  With scenes where when both the sister and investigator appeared around the same time, it did not occur to Luis, played by Antonio Banderas, to inquire about the investigator to the sister, since it was supposedly her that hired the him in the first place.There were so many ham fisted attempt to lure the viewer to notice what is coming up and clumsy setup to many scenes of deception.  They included scenes where the bird died with a broken neck right after Julia, played by Angelina Jolie, complained about the bird's singing, and then they show her in the next room singing.  The restaurant scene with the newspaper and the so obvious clue they are throwing at our face.  Or the poker scene where the wife walks all around looking at other people's cards while serving drinks, and making blatant signs as if nobody know why she keeps making the throat slitting gesture.Why would she need to turn off the lamp after Luis is dead so the other man could sneak in?  Isn't it easier just to go downstairs and open the door? Of course, the whole escape and ensuing chase would not occur if it was done in that more logical way.  And doesn't Luis know the gun was loaded with blanks when he went to reload his it and saw the unused bullets?  Why did the plot keep going that way, even with him asking Julia about how did the investigator survive him being gunned down, and her telling the gun was loaded with blanks.There were so many instances with the intention of leading the viewer so that they are always a few steps ahead of the clueless Luis, this becomes one of those cheap horrors where everyone except him knows what is going to happen.  That included Julia telling Luis to report the murder while she cleans pack up and for them to run away as fugitives, but at the same time telling him not to touch the body, just so that it won't be revealed that there wasn't any penetration by bullets.  Why is she trying to shoo him away when she herself did not know the man was dead.  The whole concept of not touching the body so as to leave no evidence, while reporting the murder, having the body disposed of, going off selling all your assets and being on the run as a fugitive when there is apparently nobody after you totally throws whatever little logic that the plot had out the window.  The holes, inconsistencies and cringes goes on and on.The acting by Angelina Jolie is so bad, with her bi-polar personality and one second shoot me if you dare, and next second breaking down, it is unbearable.The pacing is not consistent, with altering melodrama and deception, breaking any continuity and buildup of suspense.  Resulting in a movie that drags on and on.The only thing that might have been good is the cinematography in the beginning, which helped pass the time of their sappy romancing.",Original Sin

It will bored some people, but for whom that would like to see a great unordinary tale about the dangerous and sometimes lethal power of love drama,  it's a must-see.The movie set in the exotic world of Cuba in the late 1800s.

When he arrives at the docks to meet Julia Russell (Angelina Jolie), he is amazed to find that she is not the simple woman he was expecting.

Half of this movie she just shows her amazing lips. In the rest she demonstrates her inability to express real feelings. Jolie obviously is a Lee Strasser school's failure.

She is more sexy than Marilyn Monroe, shockingly beautiful and also has tremendous acting ability.  This movie dies whenever she is not in it. It is worth it just to see her handling of the role.  The film itself seems to be Hitchcock like at moments and is interesting to watch but at moments degenerates.  Unfortunately as it progresses it all seems so pointless.  The film almost turns to comedy near the end and the end for me was a real failure and flop.Antonio Banduras was also excellent in his role and their acting elevated this film which would not be worth watching without Banduras and Jolie. Angelina Jolie seems like such a nice, sincere, and honest person that it would be nice to see her in some roles that reflect her instead of a continuing string of neurotic roles.  I know she mentioned she want to play more action roles which would be fine also.

Original Sin is a tale of emotion. With beautiful cinematography, wonderful costumery, the plot is rivalled only by Hitchock's Vertigo.Set in Cuba in the late 19th Century, the story revolves around a man, named Luis Vargas, played by Antonio Bandaras, and the mail-order bride, with whom he falls in love.  Vargas, who at the start of the film is marrying for convenience alone, because of his business, finds himself emotionally capsized by the sumptuous Julia Russell, played to the hilt by the fulsome-lipped Angelina Jolie.  But when Vargas's new bride suddenly disappears, the businessman discovers that his life is now totally based in her.Let us go back to Vertigo, the obvious source of this film.  In it, Scotty Ferguson, played by James Stewart, is obsessed with Madeleine Elster, played by Kim Novak.  When Scotty witnesses Madeleine plummet to her death, his world takes a dismal tern, until he meets Judy Barton, her physical twin. The thing is that Madeleine and Judy are one and the same.  Here was Hitchcock's irony of the illusion of Madeleine falling to her death actually gives rise to the demise of Scotty's soul.In Original Sin, Angelina Jolie plays Eve to Thomas Jane's serpent. Antonio Bandaras is poor Adam, with only one woman in all of the world for him.  There is even Lillith, all too quickly dispatched.

When i heard that Michael was directing this film i thought right away this is going to be a good movie... and once again i was wrong. Antonio Bandereas and the always fabulous Angelina Jolie both deliver good performances and the film was also very sexy... but it ruins the good story at the end with the whole deal with Ms. Jolie. And what is even more disturbing to me is that in the film Angelina has an english accent... but she is from Delaware. Thar just didn't make sense. But it was a decent film, the best part of the film was everytime Angelina was on the screen. (j/k)I give it ** stars out of ***** stars.",Original Sin

Their sex scenes are extremely memorable, so make sure you get an un-edited version (unrated).Banderas plays a wealthy Cuban coffee farmer whose dedication to his trade has thus-far distracted him from the important business of finding a good wife. Using a matchmaker, he agrees to marry a woman from Connecticuit. He has been dishonest, however, in describing himself as a man of only average means. Banderas admits his dishonesty to his new wife (Jolie). However, it soon becomes clear that there is more to her than meets the eye, as well. Soon Banderas becomes so obsessed with Jolie that her lies destroy his entire life. He is well aware of what is happening every step of the way, but he doesn't care.So, this is an interesting movie for a few reasons. As stated above, the sex scenes are among the best ever filmed. It is also novel to see a film about a man who is actually obsessed about his own wife. I personally could identify with Banderas in his willingness to give up everything for woman he knows he cannot trust. Heck, it happens to the best of us.",Original Sin

Banderas perhaps took this role to do something different from his Spy Kids role but Angelina Jolie I don't understand. She keeps on accepting roles in mainstream adult films. The film I think had potential to be a very good erotic thriller. However, the plot and characters are underdeveloped while the sex scenes take center stage.

Jolie because like Tom Cruise she makes me turn off or switch the channel after only minutes...This time I decided to keep watching for some reason. Maybe because these 2 people (Banderas & Jolie) are regarded as sex symbols by the majority of their respective opposite sex.Well, you can't help but compare these leading actors to the ones that have done movies like this before: Cary Grant, Katherine Hepburn, Sophia Loren, Gregory Peck ...Now whatever you think about those iconic actors, they had charisma and they could - in their own way - convey even the cheesiest of cliché feelings that some writers put words to and some directors put movements to.Well to cut things short: Banderas is a piece of wood, Jolie cannot act at all.Look at any scene that Jolie is in: She doesn't do anything with it! Just like S. Johansson and the whole slew of new and (sort of) young actors. One could argue that if you have gargantuan rubber boats lining your mouth your expression is severely hampered to the point of rendering you an expressionless freak of nature. But we are not talking about the Elephant Man here...James Lipton somehow finds it necessary to interview people like Jolie about the ""art of acting"". Evidently it's not the mastery of the acting profession that influences his choices but some other ghastly satanic perversion. Or maybe just marketing and money. Hard to tell any difference...Oh there are so many horrific travesties in this movie: When Jolie's character acts coy and seduces Bandera's character in the beginning - oh the humanity! There is nothing sublime, there is no honor, ... there is just hammy high school acting. Just the natural instincts and flirting of a professional ... whatever ... but no acting I could detect.Or when the man beats up the woman - that scene is horrible! She actually defends herself, there's nothing theatrically exaggerated about it. Like a white trash couple fighting in the street and you are sick watching it...The story is horrible and implausible and not worth mentioning. Maybe this movie was just an excuse for a couple of stale love scenes. They couldn't even get those right...! Oh why don't they cut to a fireplace anymore and spare us the misery...?But then the very supposed sexuality of both leading actors is just like how they behave in front of the camera (some actually call it ""acting"") - S.T.E.R.I.L.E.What a world...",Original Sin

65,fabulousrice,"One second you buy it, the other you don't",2,2 August 2003,"SOME SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW.First of all Antonio Banderas does a very fine job in this movie. This screenplay is quite interesting, and when Angelina Jolie leans ahead of the dead body and says ""Billy, you really got what you deserved this time"", you're thinking ""oh, nice plot-twist"". From the beginning of the movie until that moment, you are entertained. The problem is that right after that the body ""wakes up"", and a lot of other, less interesting plot-twists ensue. After a while, you don't really care if Banderas' character is going to die or not because his character has lost all the respect you had of it; and you don't care about Jolie's character anymore either because of what she's tried to do in the film. Such a manipulative and untrustworthy character as her doesn't draw my interest, such a weak and unthinking character as he, doesn't either. Love, to me, isn't a ""trait of personality"" sufficient enough in a movie character so that I care about it. Therefore, when the only thing that remains in both these characters is the love for each other, and when they have left their jobs, friends, integrity, and should I say, mental sanity (because they become guilty of murder) to stay with each other, you can pretty much guess that from there the movie can become vulgar and raw. Which it does, when Angelina turns into a prostitute again at the end - not a least bit worried by the love she says she carries for ""Luis"" - and offers herself to 4 or 5 men, while she already has a relationship with Luis and one with her pimp. So in the end I'd say that the film is pretty graceful - gracefully written, acted, shot, though out - from the beginning to ""Billy, you got what you deserved"", and after that it turns into something else, another type of movie which we could call ""the-plot-twist-contest-kind-of-movie"". Unfortunately for that ""almost good"" part of the film, Angelina Jolie was cast as the main actress of ""Original Sin"". Her blown-out of proportions lips invade the screen from the first seconds of the film, and sadly, her acting is proportionally emphasized. One can regret that she was chosen for the part, and while some may enjoy the view of her naked body, true film lovers will regret the choice of her for this role. Not a whisper from her, not a glance, could give a man goosebumps on his back. Everything from her, up to the register of her voice, is cold and slow. While Miss Jolie was compelling and true in a film like ""Girl, Interrupted"", she is nothing here but a commercial value on the movie poster. An actress with such passionate eyes as Mia Kirschner's, or with a sin-inspiring body as Sherilyn Fenn's, could have saved the part very easily. But Angelina Jolie looks in no way like the character she portrays - and maybe simply doesn't fit with period dramas. The music plays unnoticed in the action's background - no theme remains in your mind after the end credits, no lyrical moments have flashed your ears - but then again, you didn't come see the film for its music did you? The cinematography comes where needed, as needed, with as little boldness as expected. No image from this film is sheerly ""beautiful"" or ""picturesque"", but the sceneries and actions are properly lit and shot with imagination. If you hesitate between watching an old film and this, go for the old film!",Original Sin

Well, you can add to the mediocre acting staff that of her partner in crime, who is not clear to me if she loves, hates, cheats, wants or what. I think the screenplay was poor, as well as the direction. The story could've been better developed... with better acting I bet. Probably I was so frustrated with the movie that I didn't get to understand where, when and what was the ""original sin"" in the whole story. Probably cheating with silly signs while playing cards?

Both films are based on a Cornell Woolrich novel -- yes, the very same author whose short story was masterfully enriched and used as the basis of Alfred Hitchcock's «Rear Window». Also a reminder for those who'd want to brush up their knowledge of the French language. As you may (or may not) have noticed, the «C» in François should have a little «tail» under it : in French, it is a «cédille», a punctuation sigh that makes that letter sound like a «S» -- not a «K».

Though many of the plot twists are predictable, the films is beautifully shot and well acted.  I especially enjoyed the frequent panoramic shots, displaying Cuba as it might have been.  If it was ever as idyllic as shown is not for me to know, but I was satisfied with the scenery I was presented by the screen. Jolie is beautiful as usual, and she plays well with Antonio Banderas. While the story starts kind of slow, there is enough foreshadowing to keep an observant viewer happy.  There is a lot of sexual content, and I fear many people will let their puritanical nature prejudice them towards the rest of the film because of it.  I wasn't bothered.  The acts performed by Jolie's character are extremely atypical for a supposedly innocent ""lady"", but they would only be gratuitous if they were not within the bounds of her character--which has no bounds.  The powerful emotional outbursts which occur never seem forced, showing perhaps Baderas' and Jolie's skill at the craft.

The plot was just as one dimensional and predictable.Aside from the blah characters and blah plot, my biggest pet peeve was the film editing.  I don't know enough technical stuff to ascribe a name to it, but the movie was edited similarly to ""Traffic,"" with a couple random seconds of film tossed out here and there.  In ""Traffic,"" this worked really well.  It just seemed to fit.  In ""Original Sin,"" I got a mental picture of a twelve year old with a reel and pair of scissors shouting ""whee.""  When the movie is (I think, though I couldn't be sure) going for a deadly smooth kind of mood, jerking the film around doesn't help anything.There are a couple of funny moments in this movie, and in one or two places there is a palpable sense of eroticism that is excellent.

What I saw was an awful film with some very banal dialogue and affected performances from Jolie and Jane (sounds like a new double act). Angelina Jolie is certainly a good actress as witnessed by 'Girl, Interrupted' and can play a plausible seductress as in 'Pushing Tin' but here she is simply unbelievable as someone who can manipulate men without effort or conscience. She and Thomas Jane seem to play their parts from the view of what they think the audience expects, so that they are performing parts and not acting at all. Antonio Bandaras is the only one of the main parts who shows a naturalism and it is a shame to see Jack Thompson wasted in a small and unimportant role.

I also thought Angelina was perfect for the role of julia/bonnie she really captures the essence of the femme fatale and I greatly sympathized with her character she wasn't really playing a villain she was more influenced by her accomplice/lover Billy who manipulates and twists her mind into thinking that no one could ever love her.In my opinion Julia/Bonnie was struggling with inner emotions and was even more confused by what she was feeling for Luis which is why she tries her hardest to deny that Luis does indeed love her. My favorite moments in the movie is when the two Luis and Julia are arguing in the hotel and Luis goes into a rage telling julia how much he loves her and the last few scenes in the movie when Julia poisons Luis' coffee and Luis practically pours his heart out before willingly drinking the poison telling Julia he loves all of her good and bad inspite of all the hell she put him through(I even cried a little.

91,Forests,"Very sensitive acting, clever plot, important theme, and lush photography",9,12 August 2001,"Angelina Jolie has this way of looking at you that assures you you are seeing through an entirely transparent woman. Her wide eyes, at-ease stare, evincing no effort to judge, suggest you just look at her and there's nothing more to know.The character she plays is somewhat less than this, and that is too sad. But then, there are women who, raised in poverty, were required to learn con games.  And, so, Jolie has been chosen to portray them.  Personally, I'd rather meet the Jolie outside of this movie.As it has been so far: no Jolie, only movie.PLOT SPOILERThe plot is written from humor, one must understand that.  Probably no one ever puts out an ad for love claiming to be much poorer than they are! ...
The theme of the movie is in favor of love, which is agreeable enough for a theme.  ""You don't walk away from love,"" says the Banderas character often. The story illustrates this by two men who both believe they are in love with this woman and are not willing to get over her.  The illustration places this moral in doubt.  You would wish you would be able to walk away from a woman who is no longer interested in you or your deal (Thomas Jane) or who has schemed against and stolen from you (Antonio Banderas).On a background of pleasing scenery and architecture and gratifying sexual endeavors, the movie's glib humor comes with ease.I wouldn't bother reading reviews.  Just go see the movie from ... caprice.",Original Sin
92,cerasea,"If truly watched, you cannot walk away from loving this gem!",10,5 December 2002,"Usually I rely on the voting averages to give me an idea of how good a movie is. I have to admit that a 5.6 rating is much different from what I would give this film.""Original Sin"" seemed to be the movie that everyone walked away from. The only thing I remember about its opening was all the chatter about the nude scenes. I guess it reminded a lot of viewers about the whole ""Wild Orchid""/""Showgirls"" fiasco which is still etched in the mind's-eye of every self-conscious moviegoer. Perhaps this apparent smoke screen of an issue caused Angelina Jolie's (often chapped and super-pouty) lips to be sealed regarding her role in the movie. Likewise, the dependably silent/aloof Antonio Banderas was even harder to locate when it came to any promotion of the film. And after making sure every radio listener heard, ""The Music of My Heart,"" even the inconspicuously conspicuous Estefans forgot to drop the hint that they contributed to the film's lushly romantic score.The fact that this was not a perfect movie didn't prevent it from being an excellent one. I think the film's real problem was that it couldn't quite fit into the typical Hollywood hype machine that has crowned more inferior material with non-stop publicity and gratuitously ""glowing"" reviews. It could also be due to the fact that the plot, ""not a love-story, but a story about love,"" didn't match the small space many viewers have reserved in their hearts for Romance and Drama - just not both!Anyone who takes the time to TRULY WATCH THIS MOVIE will find that they cannot walk away from loving it. Banderas and Jolie succeed in being both glamorous and gritty. Antonio Banderas is one of the most beguiling actors in contemporary cinema (believe it or not). I am always amazed by the vast artistic depth that lays beneath the stereotypical Latin-lover super-bronzed matinée-idol exterior that he has been assigned to. Banderas' talents, like this movie, are grossly underrated and marginally explored. His every motion gives Vargas the pitch-perfect blend of simplicity and passion. Banderas' portrayal makes it hard not to hurt when Vargas hurts or trust when he trusts. This makes it easy to see why the naive Vargas and the lethal Julia/Bonnie are integrally compatible.Wacko Jacko antics aside, Jolie, in all her un-Gwynnethness, is a site to have and behold. As the mysterious Julia, she is one mail-order bride who can both sell her body and steal a man's soul. Jolie succeeds in revealing every aspect of Bonnie's internal struggle to achieve personal authenticity while accepting a once-in-a-lifetime chance at true intimacy.In many ways, the film is about humankind's universal need to be, ""who we truly are"" as well as the long, winding and often treacherous road toward love's salvation (closely examine the play Julia & Vargas went to see). The movie's many twists and turns represent the bloody sacrifices/transgressions that often mark the way. This was constantly echoed through a script which foreshadowed the story's theme (in a manner both poetic and hypnotic). Equally intoxicating were the use of nontraditional cinematography and sound techniques. They perfectly complemented the period-heavy scenery and costume. All these elements melded to create a picture that was at once abundantly sensual, visually stunning and emotionally sensitive - with an excellent ending!Oh, and as for the much talked about ""skin scenes"". I thought they were well done. Gratuitous, yes. Gratifying - definitely! If you've got it, flaunt it. Banderas and Jolie absolutely have it, and then-some!",Original Sin

All right, the sex scenes were ludicrous and the ending is just plain *stoopid*, but I loved the music and the costumes. Poor Antonio Banderas was rather nice, but his character looked quite dumb. Angelina Jolie couldn't save this film but at least she tried to. On the other hand, I really liked the supporting actors: Thomas Jane was the only sexy thing in the whole movie as everyone's favourite sadistic bully. His character was loathsome, but there was some strength in Mr Jane's performance, I thought his Billy was the only one who cared about something. All he knew was violence, that's the way he was raised, and he expressed his ""love"" with violence. Very compelling performance. And it's always nice to see Jack Thompson: he was typecast but he's always a first class actor.",Original Sin
95,wilde_at_heart,Get Your Nude Jolies Here.,3,3 December 2001,"Contains Spoilers For those of you who are prepared to spend the price of admission just to see Angelina Jolie's breasts and Antonio Banderas' butt, this is the film for you. If nudity offends you, or you like to `get your kicks above the waistline' (with thanks to Murray Head), give Original Sin a wide berth. No matter what the serpents may tell you, the worms in this apple are not a value-added source of protein. Directed by Michael Cristofer, who brought Angelina Jolie to the world's attention with Gia, this is a ham-fisted attempt at an erotic thriller with film noir pretensions that falls well short of the mark. Based on a novel by pulp fiction writer Cornell Woolrich (who also gave rise to Hitchcock's Rear Window), Original Sin is simply trash with a highly paid cast and the odd bit of nice cinematography. Luis Antonio Vargas (Banderas) is a Cuban in the coffee trade, who has decided that it is time to take a wife. Uninterested in affairs of the heart, he places an advertisement in an American newspaper, thus contacting a young, plain, Christian girl named Julia Russell, who agrees to travel to Cuba and become his wife. Waiting at the dock, Vargas is surprised when he is approached by a beautiful young woman who claims to be Julia (Jolie). Julia admits to having misled Luis, sending the photo of a much plainer woman, so that she could be assured that he was truly interested in marriage, and not just a (very) pretty face. Somewhat taken aback, Luis admits that he has also lied  he is not a clerk for a coffee company, he actually is a part owner  he wanted to be sure that her intentions were not monetary. Before the shock fully subsides, the couple rush off to be married immediately, and the businesslike Luis quickly finds himself falling headlong into love and lust with his new bride. For those of you who need to have it spelt out, this is the part of the story where they get it on' with a series of shots and close-ups that are (believe it or not) overlong and overtly revealing. If this is what you paid for, you'll certainly get your money's worth, with a series of revealing images of the beautiful pair in various states of post-coital bliss. Unfortunately, there's still about 90 minutes of the film left to go. You may want to walk out now. Of course, all is not well in this paradise, and Cristofer leaves clues and foreboding signs across the next 15 minutes like banana skins at a Clown's Convention. Luis couldn't be happier, until people begin to start asking questions and he wakes one day to find that his wife has cleared their joint accounts and done a runner. Still hopelessly in love, Luis decides to track her down with the help of a private investigator employed by the real' Julia's sister. At this point, Banderas runs through the rest of the script with a big Kick Me Again' sign taped to his back. Angelina Jolie gives a pretty good account of herself in this villainous, femme fatale role, adding a certain amount of haughty spite and vitriol to the talents that puberty blessed her with. However, neither she nor Banderas has the charisma to pull themselves from the quagmire of this sorry, sordid tale. There is one scene, quite early on in the film, in which Luis and Julia head off to the theatre to see a touring American theatre company presenting (without much subtlety) Faust. They are accompanied by Luis' business partner and his wife, who describes the production as cheap melodrama. Julia, obviously thrilled with the production (for reasons that become apparent later) retorts that she likes cheap melodrama. While the director may have meant this as a dig at the critics, all he really did was write Original Sin's review for them. By all accounts, this film has bombed miserably in the U.S. and given the costs of period drama, it is unlikely to have recouped its expenses. Plastic surgeons, on the other hand, probably made a packet from the extensively altered Melanie Griffiths after she saw her hubby getting his on-screen Jolies.  Yes, it's a cheap shot  but it's a cheap film. SABIAN WILDE.",Original Sin

But you don't have to be their fan to like this movie. It has a great plot (I would really like to read the novel it is based on), great performances and really good direction.  Plus, 19th century Cuba looks quite fascinating. The story is about a rich Cuban, Luis (Banderas, obviously) that is set on marrying an american woman.  He posts an add on a Boston (I think) newspaper, and he finally finds the bride of his dreams: Miss Julia Russel, a not very pretty but young and strong woman that will give him an heir. But when Julia arrives, it is non other but Angelina Jolie, not quite like the picture Luis has of his bride to be. With this intriguing start, the plot gets thicker and thicker as love and passion, as well as treason, lie and crime come into the game, so you can never get bored.  The characters' acts seem a little unbelievable sometimes, but the tagline is ""how far would you go for love"", so be prepared. And in spite of what many people said about the ending, I personally liked it - it was almost exactly what I wanted to see. I give it 8/10.",Original Sin

99,unreconstructed,A grand and shiny monument to implausibility.,1,1 July 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I'm trying to remember a worse movie that I've seen....can't do it. Maybe it'll come to me before I finish this review. Let's see, how to begin: A rich, handsome, outgoing Cuban businessman(Banderas) intentionally decides to screw up his life. Why?? Blank-out. No answer. The Plan: he decides that a bad marriage will be his downfall. Okay, but how does one intentionally design a marriage to be so bad as to destroy oneself financially, emotionally, spiritually.**********MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD***********************Since the antihero is handsome, rich, and outgoing he could easily marry one of any number of women, most of whom would jump at the chance. Many of these theoretical matches might possibly work out. No, no...there's got to be a worse way. I know: the man must marry a complete stranger found via a newspaper ad placed in a foreign country. That's it. And to lessen the probability that she is compatible with the man, the woman must arrive in the man's country no more than 3 hours before the wedding takes place. The man and woman must know nothing about one another except the lies they've exchanged with each other in establishing contact via the mail.Okay, now here's the shocker. Are you ready for this. Hold on to your seat. Despite these elaborate plans to undermine the marriage from the start, the marriage does not in fact work out and the man is destroyed financially, emotionally and spiritually. What I have just related is the precise opening premise this movie expects you swallow in order to grab your attention for the movie's remainder. If it sounds implausible to the point of imbecility, well, that is not my fault.To be fair, although this movie in no way deserves it, the woman he marries is a con artist(Jolie) who has helped kill the actual intended bride and assumed her identity. But that absolutely doesn't matter, because it may just as well have been the con artist who answered the  man's marriage ad as any other woman.I really can't discuss this movie much further...the level of irritation Original Sin caused me makes it out of the question. Let me just say that the account I've related so far is not the most implausible element in the movie. For example, let's assume for the sake of argument that you are a psychopath. Somebody tells you they love you a total of 999 times. But you are a psychopath and it has no effect. So you decide to poison the person who loves you. Hey, it's what psychopaths do. Somehow the person finds out you've poisoned their drink and they tell you. Right before the person drinks the poison they tell you for the 1000th time that they love you. They knowingly begin to drink the poison. Suddenly, the scales of psychopathology fall from your eyes and you see everything in a different light. You spring to your feet with all the good-hearted innocence that a recently cured criminally insane person can muster and try to knock the poisoned drink from their hands.
Here are the crucial questions: Do you find this plausible? Possible? Psychologically realistic? If so, let me state in the strongest possible terms: This movie was made for you.Hey, I just had a revelation. I just remembered a worse movie I saw: Ed Wood's Love Feast, aka Pretty Models All In a Row. I knew I could do it!!",Original Sin

Although this might be becauseboth quote Cornell Woolrich's novel ""Waltz into Darkness"" as source.I consider Truffaut's movie to be of better make. The erotic charge is much less in Mississipi Mermaid. The tension between (young) Belmondo and Deneuve is of a very different nature than the relationship between Jolie and Banderas.

108,JohnVanBrunt,Drags but saved by good ending,6,7 April 2006,"From the beginning this movie struck me as melodramatic and poorly acted. The director is overly fixated on 'creating the scene'. As the film takes place in Cuba sometime well in the past (maybe the late 19th century?), it's understandable to flaunt the romance of the setting, but it comes off like a slutty romance novel. Of course the erotic scenes with Jolie and Banderas (and later other men), only add to that feeling.The purpose of the music is to add to the mystique and romance of old Cuba even more. The problem is that while it's adding to the setting, it's hurting the story. This movie is supposed to be a bit of a thriller, and music is always a big part of creating suspense in film. The music here just doesn't get the job done, and it really hurts the flow of the movie.Because of all these issues this movie really drags. A lot more footage should have been chopped in the editing room, but its redemption is that if you wait long enough, you find it does have a point and a good one at that. The melodrama never really leaves, but the story nonetheless comes together in the end. I can't say I'd particularly recommend it, but it's watchable if you're patient.",Original Sin

The suspense isn't there (but it's supposed to be) & the story is dull as plastic scissors. The other actors are weak!! There aren't any real character actors, just walk-ons. And a lot of cardboard performances outside of the two stars. The story drags on (it's much too long) and it's dull (though it's supposed to be film noir-ish).",Original Sin

The direction in the movie is horrible and quite dull if it wasn't for Angelina this movie would be horrible in every way.  The sex scenes are way over the top to the point it's just sad.

What a pity.  These actors have proven their ability any number of times.

It was a story of true love and what it takes to be with that one, special person. Angelina Jolie and Anotonio Banderes were perfect in portraying their characters. One of my favorite parts of the movie was when Luis (Banderes) and Julia/Bonnie (Jolie) were yelling and screaming at each other and he said that he couldn't live or breathe without her and then held her.

124,bbouknig,one of this summer's guilty pleasures...,9,9 August 2001,"***1/2 out of ***** starsImagine the typical cheap romance novel that you used to pick up (or still do?) at the local `Five & Dime' or K-Mart. It had melodrama. It had exotic places. It had SEX. You enjoyed it, because it took you to another place, but deep inside you knew that it was no more than so much fluff to pass the time. Now imagine making a movie out of one of these novels. Not high art, and it wasn't meant to be. But you might be intrigued enough, despite yourself, to check it out. Now, imagine the same adapted novel, with the star power of an Angelina Jolie and an Antonio Banderas. Now you want to go, don't you? And you don't care that the plot might be implausible, that the stuffier critics are thumbing their noses, and that the Academy is not impressed. So what? If `Original Sin' is a mere cinematic diversion, it is at least an entertaining diversion. And more than a small amount of credit for this should go to its headliners, Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie, who may go down in cinematic history as the unlikeliest pair to make use of a mail-order bride service. Luis Antonio Vargas (Banderas, suave as always), who is looking more for a bearer of his children than romance, is pleasantly surprised that his betrothed is much more fetching in person than the photo that he is carrying. Julia Russell (Jolie, demure one moment and sensual the next), in turn, is mildly taken aback that her husband-to-be is a wealthy part owner of a coffee bean plantation. Needless to say, a relationship built on misinformation and/or deception before it is even begun will not be without its share ofdifficulties. What soon follows this initial meeting and subsequent marital bliss is a series of incidents & acts of mistrust, double-cross, & complicity that one would expect to read in pulp fiction novels. Added to the mix is Walter Downs (Thomas Jane), an enigma with a ridiculous moustache who is introduced as a private investigator. He gives the faintest impression that there is more to him than meets the eye, yet his ulterior motives (if any) are unclear. Add these ingredients, the exotic locales, and the undeniable appeal of the lead actors, and you get something less than high art but more than the sum of its parts. Jolie is so mesmerizing and Banderas so charismatic, you'll just want to sit back & enjoy one of this summer's guilty pleasures. You do want to see it, don't you?",Original Sin

Like all of Hollywood's remakes that I have seen so far , this one is just as unsatisfactory ( to say the least )as all the others (The Day of the Jackal, The Manchurian Candidate etc.).All of the reviews I read ( the first 20 or so) were all raving about this in my opinion silly remake. They are too young to know that many , many years ago there were so much better originals( mostly European)which is also expressed by IMDb ratings ( for The Day of the Jackal 7.9 vs. 5.7 and for The Manchurian Candidate 8.4 vs. 6.7 )",Original Sin

I preferred to see them end up together and not living back on the plantation that he re-built from the ground up with his ""honest"" sweat and blood.

133,dalibor_r,absolute waste of time,1,22 August 2001,"Spoilers ahead, but who cares.Every now and then an avid movie theater goer is bound to stumble upon something like this, but it still took be by surprise. In fact, having seen the Tomb Rider recently, and bearing in mind Girl interrupted, because of Jolie alone I had some mild expectations going to see this summer afternoon time killer. Alas, what a mistake.A female beauty is really not a matter for discussion because everyone has his/her own taste, but I can't sway away the feeling that there is a way too much hype about Jolie's physical appearance than can be justified. A nice woman, but nothing more. As for her acting, she somehow fit into the roles of a schizophrenic or a comic/computer game type of characters, however, as la femme fatale she completely fails. Rapid transformations from a cold blooded rascal to a passionate volcano leave the sensation more of a sitcom style parody then some subtle introspective struggle of her character. Stick to Lara, Angie.Would someone tell me what it is about Banderas that they keep hiring him over and over again? Ok, he looks good and throws that sexy broken English at us, but come on: the guy can't act. It's as simple as that nothing more, nothing less. Pass.The story, ah the story of this 'movie', I guess there is more sense in answers to Jay Leno's questions in Jay Walking. Absolutely unimaginative and absolutely absurd and absolutely boring from the beginning to the end. If you make through it without dozing off at least a couple of times, than you're either a single lecherous 17-year old with a thing for Jolie or a bodyguard on duty. Several examples: why would a con team choose a poor Cuban clerk as their victim, as he described himself in the ad? what is the purpose of that charade with a private detective impersonation? how come they rent huge houses all over Cuba while being looked for by the police as the biggest public enemies? would a modest righteous monk agree to help a death row convict assuming serious consequences for himself, only after hearing her not-so-convincing story without any repentance? An so on, and so on, there's more, and some of it I surely missed due to the drowsiness.Other elements of the whole project barely jut out from the swill. The soundtrack is nothing close to what it might have been given the plot time and location. The scenery is again a disappointment given the huge opportunity to capitalize on the Caribbean surroundings. Instead, we mostly get the rundown backyards of big Cuban houses. The way the supporting characters are pictured as well as the nameless Cuban natives stenches miles away of the obsolete bourgeois colonial treatment which focuses exclusively on the petty preoccupations of the lame main characters.The end is more than annoying, not to use any stronger word. After seeing movies with tragic ending, one feels either sadness for the loss or the sense of helplessness for the inevitable. After seeing happy end movies, usually one feels relieved and optimistic. With this movie, one feels disappointed - that everyone gets away after choking the audience to death for almost two hours.1/10",Original Sin

She is very professional in acting and gives herself totally for a role. I think you can see that in this movie as well. In this movie she has to play a bad person (Julia). But there is some good in the character as well. You will notice this in different parts of the movie. The mysterious beauty and serenity of Angelina are important for this role. It gives the movie character bad and good sides at the time. From the beginning of the movie, you'll know something is wrong with Julia. This is also emphasized by the way the filming has done. The whole movie is shot with great camera perspectives and good sphere setting. This is due to the good work of the director Michael Cristofer.Antonio Banderas is also playing well. Antonio is the perfect romantic figure that the movie needed. On the other side he is aware what happens but lost himself in the love for Julia. This gives the tension between Antonio and Angelina which is an attractive aspect of the movie. Maybe you think this movie will be too romantic for some, but there is a good lot of tension in it.
