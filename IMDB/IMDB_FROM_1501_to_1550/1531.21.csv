0,MartinHafer,Give this one a chance and see it through to the end,9,3 July 2008,"This is one of three films I saw on a trans-Atlantic flight. None of the three were ones I particularly wanted to see, but I was bored and in hindsight I am thrilled I saw 21.Now I'll admit up front that the first section of the film isn't super-exciting, but I stuck with it. My wife and daughter also tried, but quickly gave up and switched channels (their loss). Stick with it, as the film becomes more complex and intelligently written as it progresses--ending with many nice little plot twists to keep you guessing. Additional pluses in the film are the acting (particularly by Kevin Spacey) and the excellent musical score that really takes chances but works so well.I'd say more about the film, but frankly I'd hate to somehow divulge any of the film's twists. Suffice to say that it's about a brilliant group of card counters who make a killing at Vegas--and then things start to turn ugly in ways they never expected.",21
1,bkoganbing,The Kids Who Broke The Bank At Las Vegas,8,6 April 2008,"Straight A student Jim Sturgess at MIT is having a real problem, he's one of many geniuses trying to get into Harvard Medical School, the cost is going to be over $300.000.00 if he does not get a prized scholarship that several other geniuses are competing for.So it seems too good to be true when his advanced calculus professor, Kevin Spacey, let's Sturgess in on a little sideline he has going for him. Seems that Spacey has recruited an elite team of his most promising students to work the blackjack tables in Las Vegas, something he used to do himself, but now he's too well known there. Blackjack or 21 he says is the most popular game at the casinos and the one it's easiest to beat if you know how to count the cards.Counting cards isn't exactly illegal, but something the casino owners do discourage. The discourager is Lawrence Fishburne and he's pretty good at his job, at both spotting and discouraging counters.Spacey's team consists of Sturgess, Jacob Pitts, Aaron Yoo, Kate Bosworth, and Liza Lapira and all do a good job at convincing you they are actually MIT students and not pretty faces from Hollywood pretending to be geniuses. Spacey of course is his usual fine self.I particularly liked Pitts's performance as the kid whose jealousy of Sturgess ultimately wrecks the whole operation. 21 is a pretty good film with good location filming on MIT and in Las Vegas giving it an air of authenticity.You have to love how Sturgess gets the bankroll to Vegas.",21
2,SnoopyStyle,interesting premise turns into flashy romantic thriller,6,2 January 2015,"Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) is a MIT math major looking to get into Harvard School of Medicine. He comes from a poor family and needs to dazzle for a full scholarship. Ben impressed his professor Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey) and is introduced to the professor's secret club. Along with Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth), Choi (Aaron Yoo), Kianna (Liza Lapira) and Fisher (Jacob Pitts), they hone their card counting skills to beat the casinos at blackjack. It's a great ride until casino pit boss Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne) catches him.The premise is interesting. The movie depends on Jim Sturgess and where the movie chose to concentrate on. I'm not thrill about the romance being glued on to this. It feels ill-fitting. If there is one compelling relationship, it should be Ben and the professor. This could have been a great dark character study. Instead it tries to be flashy and cool. The romance drains the edginess out of the movie. Also it would be more compelling to have Ben start off as a more introverted loner. It would allow more room for the character growth and some possible father issues.",21
3,kosmasp,It's slick alright,6,7 August 2008,"""21"" is a decent movie. It delivers on it's promise, nothing more and nothing less. Of course it's always a positive thing, to have Kevin Spacey in your movie, it's always Quality improving. But that doesn't change the fact, that this movies plays out ""by numbers"" (no pun intended). You can see the characters developments from a mile off, can sense the plot/turning points before the movie has begun, so there's little left to really surprise you.The intentions and the acting is good, but you can have only so much fun with it. And being good with numbers isn't always really attractive. The movie would've been better, if it had tried to make something new, but even the ending will most likely leave you emotionless/not caring. Don't even try to compare it with the really good movies, that have been done with that (or a similar premise) ... your vote would be lower than mine right now",21
4,lee_eisenberg,gambled life,7,28 July 2008,"Hot off ""Across the Universe"", Jim Sturgess plays another good role in ""21"". He plays an MIT student who joins a special math class: the teacher (Kevin Spacey) uses cards to show them all sorts of tricks, and even takes them to Las Vegas. In the casinos, they use various hand tricks and key words to help each other win money. But all is not what it seems...It was hard to say what my favorite part was. So much of the movie was so impressive that I had to remember to concentrate on the movie and not get caught up in the math tricks. While it's true that Spacey plays pretty much the same role here that he plays in most of his films, I still recommend the movie. I don't think that I could do it justice by trying to describe it; this is one that you have to see to understand. Also starring Kate Bosworth and Laurence Fishburne.",21
5,jboothmillard,21,5,3 January 2012,"I saw a short television trailer, and it was obvious it was about card playing and gambling, specifically the game Blackjack, or rather 21 like the title, from director Robert Luketic (Legally Blonde, Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!, Monster-in-Law). Basically young student Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) has very high intelligent, and has ambitions to get a scholarship and transfer to Harvard School of Medicine so he can become a doctor, but for four or five years he needs $300,000, which he can't afford. One night he meets Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey), an unorthodox math professor, and he joins the teacher's group of fellow students, Jill Taylor (Superman Returns' Kate Bosworth), Choi (Aaron Yoo), Kianna (Liza Lapira) and Fisher (Jacob Pitts). All are being taught by Micky in the skill of card counting in the game of blackjack, using a clever number of hand signals and key words to use during play, and if successful obviously they could make fortunes. Eventually, after some training, Ben and the others are ready to use the techniques they have gained in the real paying casinos of Las Vegas, and naturally the young man is only going to keep going until he has his tuition fee. Jill sees that he is being corrupted by greed and becoming arrogant in the process, and he is also caught out by casino security enforcer Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne), this angers Micky, who Williams has a grudge against. There is the point when there may not be enough to money to go to Harvard for the young man, and no way to get any new blackjack games for high stakes and money, but eventually Ben is welcomed back for one last big con in Las Vegas, and this does go well. Also starring Jack McGee as Terry. Sturgess is okay in the lead role, but of course Spacey and Fishburne are the one you pay the most attention to as they are the big shots of the film, the story is reasonably interesting, the card games are certainly the scenes that grip you as you wonder if they will get away with it, a not bad drama based on a true story. Worth watching!",21
6,ccthemovieman-1,"Slick, Entertaining But Far From Reality",8,30 July 2008,"I enjoyed the movie because it was entertaining all the way. It was slick and had interesting characters. The only problem was the last half of it where credibility when flying out the window. The movie is all about supposedly very intelligent people, led by the smartest of the all the group, the only veteran in this college age-dominated cast: ""Professor Mickey Rosa,"" played by Kevin Spacey. Well, Rosa would not do what he did here, for starters, meaning trusting an untrustworthy and revenge-seeking kid. If you've seen the movie you know what I mean. The others in the group wouldn't go along with the renegade - ""Ben Campbell"" (Jim Sturgess) - either. There is no way this kid is going to totally outsmart the professor, but it makes for good Hollywood dramatics.There are a bunch of other holes, too, such as wanting to be anonymous but going back to the same place; a ridiculous chase scene through the casino gambling area and kitchen; hand signals that a junior detective could see (and are never changed!) and - maybe the worst - winning tons of money in sessions. Nobody with half a brain would win much at any session, because it draws attention. You win a little here, a little there and go from place-to-place and remain anonymous. This movie is based on a true story, and I can guarantee you that's what the MIT students did in real life - not what you see here.Still, facts aside, it's still a fun movie to watch and since entertainment is the name of the game with films, it succeeds and I still give it an ""8"" star rating for that. At no time was I bored and overly insulted at the dumbness that I would have stopped playing the DVD. It will hold your interest and you'll be thoroughly entertained, especially if you don't know a lot about blackjack and how casinos operate.Oh, as a postscript: they don't beat up ""card counters"" in back rooms of casinos. If they think you are counting cards, which I don't believe is illegal, they still have the right to kick you out of their establishment.....but they ask you nicely and you are removed from the floor with no big scene or violence. They have your picture, there are security people everywhere, and you aren't allowed back.So, enjoy the film but don't believe the screenplay.",21
7,Tweekums,The story of a group of MIT students determined to win big in Las Vegas,8,17 December 2020,"Ben Campbell is and MIT student hoping to go to Harvard Medical School; he has applied for a scholarship but fifty other students with equally impressive CVs have applied. If he doesn't get the scholarship there is no way he can raise the $300,000 dollars required... or so he thinks. One of his professors, Micky Rosa, is impressed with Ben's mathematical abilities and approaches him with an unusual proposal. Rosa wants Ben to join a small group of students with the intention of earning a fortune playing blackjack in Las Vegas. He explains that they won't be gambling... they have a system which involves card counting, tracking the values of the cards already dealt, to stack the odds in their favour. There may be nothing illegal about it but the casinos certainly do everything they can to stop it. Security consultant Cole Williams, who is losing contracts to computer systems, is particularly keen to stop counters at the last casino he works at... the one targeted by Micky's group. As Ben gets caught up in this new world he starts neglecting his old friends.This might not sound the most exciting idea for a film but it works surprisingly well; at times feeling like a thriller as the counters play cat and mouse with Williams... facing the probability of a beating if caught. The interaction between the characters is fun to watch; it is easy to sympathise with the group... or just about anybody trying to legally beat the system in a casino. There are moments of comedy, many provided by Ben's old friends; as well as tension, both within the group and with Cole. There are a couple of twists, but nothing to major. The cast does a fine job, most obviously Jim Sturgess, who impresses as Ben; Kevin Spacey, who is on fine form as Rosa; and Laurence Fishburne who is suitable menacing as Cole without being a pantomime villain. Overall I'd recommend this; don't worry if you have no interest in gambling, that isn't necessary to enjoy the film.",21
8,blanche-2,Loosely based on the true story,7,17 December 2008,"""21"" is the story of the famous MIT Blackjack Team that plays fast and loose with the real story. Nevertheless, it's still a compelling and interesting movie. It's really a morality tale about a brilliant young man, Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) is talked by a professor (Kevin Spacey) into joining a blackjack group that counts cards, uses hand signals, codes, and disguises, and goes to Vegas every weekend. Ben has been accepted into Harvard pre-med but has no way of getting the $300,000 tuition. In this story, there are no such things as financial packages and student loans. Ben reluctantly joins the group but only until he can make his Harvard money. Of course, that's not what happens. Once in and living the high life, he can't stop. He finally becomes so arrogant that he makes what turns out to be a very costly mistake.The shots of Boston, where I went to school, and Vegas are great, and the acting is excellent. Sturgess is joined by the beautiful Kate Bosworth, Aaron Yoo, Liza Lapira, and Jacob Pitts. Laurence Fishburne has a small role, but he's scary as all get-out as a security man. Two real-life members of the Blackjack Team played card dealers.In the actual story, there were several of these groups out of MIT that played for years. In telescoping the story, there are a few holes. For instance, Campbell never wears a disguise until the end, which in real life, never happened. The only one who consistently wears a disguise is Bosworth; these teams were much more careful than that. Also, they seem to go to Vegas every week instead of switching off with Atlantic City, for instance, or laying low for a time.There are a few interesting twists in ""21,"" and it moves quickly. Recommended - a very good movie.",21
9,Quinoa1984,want to take a gamble? this movie STINKS!,4,2 April 2008,"Robert Luketic, director of 21, doesn't have as his major folly to change the characters from the book (which I have not read but heard a bit about) from an all Asian group of card counters in Las Vegas to a more 'mixed' lot (i.e. about 1/4 are Asian now). Nor is it even his casting of his lead actor (Jim Sturgess probably brings more charm to the two-dimensional part than one would've thought was possible). His biggest folly was not questioning as he went through the motions of making a silly, contrived, hyper-slick-music-video-shot-in-Jiminy-Jilikers-High-def if there was anything to change up on an audience who knows such motions through and through. The only thing that might differentiate this movie from a whole host of smart-guy-in-a-new-dirty-pond flicks (and I can't name them all but the likes of Rounders is a masterpiece compared to this) is that the characters turn into models from GQ and Maxim by the time they hit it big in Vegas. Not expecting much from 21 is just about right, or even worse.And don't get me started on Laurence Fishburne and Kevin Spacey. It's a paycheck day once again for these two very good- sometimes even fabulous- thespians, who slum their roles as a would-be-DeNiro-in-Casino and a shady MIT professor who by the looks of the movie should be characterized as team-leader-Satan respectively. They too understand what is going on in 21, which is an ol' fish-out-of-water fable about smart people doing stupid things with lots of money at stake as an MIT kid (Srugess) with aspirations for Harvard med joins a group that goes to Vegas and stakes out hundreds of thousands per weekend by counting cards and hustling from table to table. I guess, in a way, I don't blame them for not doing much at all with their roles. But one would hope that there would be something, ANYTHING, that would make this as something for them to distinguish, that the director &/or the script would give them something to do aside from filling in pat performances from at least a good few other parts they've played.As mentioned, Sturgess at least brings a little bit of interest to a character carved out of some sympathy as kid who gets in way over his head. There's not much else with supporting players either. Kate Bosworth is the kind of actress whom you think can sort of act, or at least knows how to *pretend* to really act. But there's also something just not there clicking, something when she puts on the 'concerned' face that just screams so bland that you can't even take it. The writers also plug in clichés of yester-year (and not long enough): Jacob Pitts as the snotty side character in the group who is just too jealous and stubborn to stay in the group long once Benn arrives; the old nerdy friends from before Ben's trip into blackjack land, who are there as a function and not as any real character 'base'. And then there is the script in and of itself- giving us such forlorn twists and turns in its final reels that I want to choke on my popcorn- and the direction as well, which pumps up the volume for the kids while making sure to completely sanitize a real Vegas experience for college-aged younguns (and, of course, the shallowest of all, the two hot male and female leads have to hook up, without much connection whatsoever).Maybe you could give it a couple of quick peeks, maybe five minutes, when it's on TNT in a couple of years. But as far as giving any substantial money to this enterprise? The house wins, Johnny, that's the way it is.",21

11,sunwarrior13,It's Lightweight Fun Of A Film,9,1 October 2012,"21 is a heist film that stars Jim Sturgess, Kevin Spacey, Laurence Fishburne, Kate Bosworth, Liza Lapira, Jacob Pitts, and Aaron Yoo. The film is inspired by the true story of the MIT Blackjack Team as told in Bringing Down the House, the best-selling book by Ben Mezrich. The film was about the true-life tale of six genius students who used their brains to beat considerable odds.It was directed by Robert Luketic.Ben Campbell may be shy, but his wallflower reputation betrays his inner brilliance. As smart as Ben may be, however, if he can't pay his tuition he'll be kicked out of M.I.T. Fortunately, the answer to all of Ben's problems is right there in the cards. Recruited to join a team of extremely gifted students who have used their mastery of numbers to beat the odds at blackjack, Ben procures a fake identity in order to join the casino scammers and their brilliant leader who is an eccentric math professor and stats genius Micky Rosa in some highly profitable weekend excursions to Las Vegas. Counting cards isn't illegal, and by using a complex series of signals, this team has cracked the code. Of course, it doesn't take long for Ben to become seduced by the glamorous Las Vegas lifestyle, and the attention afforded to him by his sexy teammate Jill Taylor finds him pushing his luck to the absolute limits.The film is definitely a fictionalization of a true story.The viewer get the essence of this insanely crazy double life that these kids led as they were breaking the bank in Vegas.This makes it for glossy and lightweight fun.Spacey makes a nicely chilly villain and Bosworth a warm and glamorous leading lady, if an implausible maths genius.",21
12,CinemaSerf,The look on Jack Gilpin's face at the end....,7,17 September 2021,"Jim Sturgess is quite personable in this story of a group of aspiring MIT students who are groomed by their lecturer (Kevin Spacey) into becoming expert in the practice of ""counting cards"" in casinos, thereby mitigating risk and - well, fleecing the joints! He is recruited to join this team, and after some initial scepticism but facing a looming debt to service his $300k Harvard Medical school tuition bill, he joins in and... It's based on a true story and is actually quite fascinating. Is it fraud? Seemed to me like skill, but that's not a view shared by a rather off-form Laurence Fishburne whose rather analogue security business is being rapidly replaced by bio-algorithms. Sturgess portrays his ""Ben"" character well, managing his transition from reluctance to addiction whilst squeezing in a smidge of romance with ""Jill"" (Kate Bosworth) before an ending that did rather bring a smile to my face... I'd never heard of the underlying story, but given the brash, in-your-face, success of these casinos, I couldn't help but cheer them on... No harm, no foul?",21
13,dbborroughs,Good but clichéd telling of MIT students breaking Las Vegas,6,26 May 2008,"Story of an MIT student who needs quick cash who joins the legendary group of students and teachers who set about taking on the Vegas casinos. Well acted, with a showy performance by Kevin Spacey in a showy role. the cast shines in what is really a bunch of clichéd characters. Forgive me for saying it but Hollywood has taken a very good and exciting tale and made it into a cliché. Don't get me wrong its an exciting tale expertly if overly slickly told, but I never really bought it. I know it happened, I've seen a couple of specials on the History Channel on the group, but it wasn't quite like this. Its not bad, far from it, its very entertaining, its just not real. Its a very good movie, just not a great one.",21
14,writers_reign,"Aces, Hi",8,13 April 2008,"Kevin Spacey really is a card; apparently there is no movie job he won't stoop to if it subsidises his real job of running and acting at The Old Vic in London. Here he plays scammer turned Math Professor who grooms a team of MIT students to rip off the Vegas casinos by legitimately mastering the art of 'counting' the cards. The inescapable fact that this is perfectly legal cuts no ice with the casinos who naturally prefer to retain the advantage so Lawrence Fishburne is apt to show up and 'discourage' gifted amateurs - who have, after all, spent hours honing the art of memorising discards - from darkening their doors in future. It's all quite glib, quite superficial, quite glossy and yes, quite enjoyable.",21
15,view_and_review,Not Quite My Cup of Tea,6,1 June 2021,"""21"" is a scenario that teenage boys and young men can only dream about. Imagine being the smartest guy in the room all of the time, then using that same intelligence to make loads of fast money which is parlayed into fancy clothes, fine food, upscale parties, and the hottest girl in the school. Like I said: stuff of dreams.Well, Ben (Jim Sturgess), was that guy in ""21."" He was a senior at MIT and mind-blowingly smart. So smart in fact that his professor, Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey), recruited him to be on his five-man black jack team. Prof. Rosa developed a foolproof card counting scheme that raked in tens of thousands of dollars per weekend in Vegas. The system was formulaic and simple, but it required extraordinary intelligence. Ben needed the quick money if he was ever going to be able to afford Harvard Med school.Obviously, there has to be a catch or there has to be a downside to all of this or else it couldn't be a movie. The downside was keeping it all a secret, the catch was to always stay in the system and never let emotion take over, and the drama was in staying ahead of the eyes in the sky. Could and would Ben be able to do that? That was the question.As loaded with talent as this movie was, I think it was a bit over its skis. As much as everyone likes the idea of a winner, usually the winner has to have a flaw. Ben had the brains, the money, and the girl; all he was missing was martial arts skills and the ability to beat everyone up. He was a Mary Sue character that I think needed one or two more flaws to be more likeable. He wasn't a bad character and I didn't hate him, he was just too choir boy. In fact, he was very akin to Patrick Dempsey's character in the 80's movie ""Can't Buy Me Love"" with more money. ""21"" was a cool movie--more of an MTV production--but not quite my cup of tea.",21
16,Uriah43,"A Solid, Basic Crime-Drama",5,15 January 2013,"This film is about a mathematical whiz-kid who is convinced to join a college professor and 4 other brilliant students from M.I.T. in an attempt to win big money gambling in Las Vegas. Now, although technically legal, counting cards is a serious issue in the casinos with equally serious consequences. So the students are taking an extreme risk and have to be extremely careful not to get caught. Anyway, that's the basic plot of the film. I thought Jim Sturgess (as ""Ben"") and Kevin Spacey (as ""Professor Micky Rosa"") both did creditable jobs. Likewise, I thought Lawrence Fishburne (as ""Cole Williams"") performed in an adequate manner as well. Additionally, although Kate Bosworth (as ""Jill"") was definitely attractive I thought the romance between her and Ben lacked passion. That said, while I enjoyed the film there was nothing really remarkable about it. In short, it was a solid, basic crime-drama worth a look if you enjoy movies of this type.",21
17,ferguson-6,No Chicken Dinner For You,6,30 March 2008,"Greetings again from the darkness. Fascinating real life story based on the book by Ben Mezrich gets slick, polished Hollywood treatment from well known fluff director Robert Luketic (""Legally Blonde"", ""Mother-In-Law"").For some reason the MIT students racial mix is much different than the real life stuff. Wait, I believe that reason would be Box Office appeal/money!! Kevin Spacey is a fine choice for the ego-maniacal professor who is the brains behind the brainy operation that takes Vegas for a ride. Jim Sturgess and Kate Bosworth are the eye candy inserted to make this tolerable for a wider audience.The actual guy whose Sturgess' character is based on, Jeffrey Ma, has a quick role as a Planet Hollywood dealer. Throw in Laurence Fishbourne as an old school security muscle man, mix it with some slow-mo and fast edits and loud music and you have Hollywood's idea of high-tech Gen Y thriller. My advice ... read the book.",21
18,anaconda-40658,21 and Stupid.,4,21 May 2015,"21 (2008): Dir: Robert Luketic / Cast: Jim Sturges, Kate Bosworth, Kevin Spacey, Laurence Fishburne, Aaron Yoo: True story starring Jim Sturges who hopes to get into Harvard Medical School. He is recruited by a professor to join other students in Blackjack. He learns the basics of counting cards, which casinos take a dislike to when they clean up during several visits to Vegas. Fine setup becomes predictable with questionable attitude towards the consequences or just merely the payoff. Directed by Robert Luketic who previously made Win a Date With Tad Hamilton and Monster-in-Law. This marks quite a departure from his usual romantic comedies but certainly he proves that he can indeed scout other genres. However, his romantic comedies seem to elevate beyond what this ambitious premise ultimately reduces to. Sturges does a fine job as someone caught up in wrong and going full throttle without care or consequence. Kate Bosworth is an object of romance thus doing little more than being Sturges's girlfriend. Kevin Spacey plays the professor in what is a limited role but not without consequence. Laurence Fishburne plays the casino head security with ties to the Spacey character. He will do the standard pursuit but not without a great payoff. Very bland and certainly not as good as it should have been but it demonstrate how such addictions can lead to a downfall. Score: 4 ½ / 10",21
19,safenoe,It is what it is...the book was better,5,1 October 2016,"If I watch a movie based on a book, I prefer to see it before reading. Here's a movie I watched after reading Ben Mezrich's Bringing Down the House, and I wish it was vice-versa. The book was compelling but the movie was sort of okay, and I guess it tried to be a piece of art on its own.Much has been made about the ""whitewashing"" of the cast, as some of the real life college students in Ben's book are of Chinese descent. The accusations of whitewashing are fair enough, and it's a shame the cast wasn't more reflective of the real life characters. But hey, Hollywood is unfortunately replete with such whitewashing type examples. Valkyrie I don't think had any Germans in the cast. It was pretty much Americans and Brits playing Germans. The director wasn't German! Also in Schindler's List, same deal, no Germans in the lead roles. Similarly, Hogan's Heroes didn't have any Germans in the cast - in fact quite ironically some of the Nazis were played by Jewish actors. Also in in 'Allo 'Allo, no Germans were featured - all Brits played the Germans. Nary a German actor in Raiders of the Lost Ark. So unfortunately Germans are being whitewashed out of casting roles sadly.",21
20,Sylviastel,It Could Have Been Better Though!,7,13 February 2012,"I read the book, ""Bringing Down the House,"" about a few years ago so I don't remember the details. The film could drag at times. The cast is wonderful especially Kevin Spacey as Mickey Rosa, Lawrence Fishburne as Cole Williams, Kate Bosworth as Jill Taylor, etc. The cast was fine in their roles even the supporting roles. While the film looks great on paper especially the Las Vegas scenes, the script seems to be the weakest part of the film. It never really flies off the ground. I'm still wondering what happened to Mickey Rosa and his protégé students who take Las Vegas casinos by storm. They used Planet Hollywood, Riviera, and Red Rock Casinos in this film. Still I think the film could have been much better overall. It did drag at times and I thought it could have been overall. It's still is nice to see a book made to film about blackjack, card counting, and trying to beat the system. Maybe math teachers could find this film useful in the classroom without breaking the rules.",21
21,mm-39,21 is a 19 out of 21.,8,3 September 2008,"21 is a 19 out of 21. The movie 21 has a compelling story, which is well acted, and directed. I love watching well executed movies. Will the protagonist get his money for college? Is the professor an evil man? How evil is the security firm? These questions and more will be answered in the next couple of hours when viewing 21. I enjoy watching Kevin Spacey who always plays a good creepy role. The only part I hated about the movie was when the pizza delivery guy interrupted the flick! When does it take a hour to get a pizza, when the place is 10 minutes from my house. Well, that is besides the point. Worth downloading on payperview! Payperview is cool and way cheaper than video rentals. I did not even have to take the movie back. Worth seeing on payperview. 21 is a 19 out of 21 or in IMDb terms a 8 out of 10.",21
22,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: 21,7,29 June 2008,"While Las Vegas is Sin City personified, having been there in person actually stripped away much of the glitz and glamour that comes courtesy of various movies and television series. Maybe because I'm not a high roller (or even a simple punter to begin with) that I don't get to enjoy the sexiness that comes with attention lavished at their well-known, well-paying customers. But in any case, the mathematics of it is that the house always win, and it is not a zero sum game, always in favour of the house. A bus driver in Vagas once told me that it's simple logic - look at the hotel above the casino. The larger it is, the higher the overheads, and guess where their revenue is coming from? You guessed it.Based on a true story about a group of MIT students who utilized their smarts from what the textbook never taught them, you can trust Hollywood to sex it all up, especially with a professor in the mould of Kevin Spacey, and teammates who look like they jumped right out of glamour magazines. Being naturally smart and the cream of the crop, they get seduced by Spacey's Professor Micky Rosa, who rationalizes that they aren't cheating, but beating the system on their own numbers game through card counting. That means back to basics probability and statistics, together with some tools of the trade such as disguises, fake IDs and a whole elaborate rouse of communication using secret words and sign language.And here's the flaw of the movie, perhaps to dumb it down for an audience because it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that signs and codewords should change each time you hit a different casino so that you won't be caught repeating the same trick over and over again to the eyes in the skies, which provided a separate sub plot dealing with the threat of security personnel being outsourced and downsized by technology, and therein making old school folks like Laurence Fishburne's Cole Williams obsolete.Jim Sturgess is slowly getting his profile raised, last seen in these parts with Across the Universe. Here, his Ben Campbell is the A student who's just like every other A student trying their best to get to Harvard Medical School, and that sole scholarship up for grabs will be awarded to just one fella with the most impressive resume. Knowing that his chance is slim, he has to figure out how to cough up US$300K just to get himself into his dream institution, so as the tale would have it, that rationale and figure required became his excuse to take up gambling as a means to his end.Joined by fellow students Jill (Kate Bosworth), Choi (Aaron Yoo), Kianna (Liza Lapira) and Jimmy (Jacob Pitts) under Prof Mickey's tutelage, they hone their mathematical and social engineering skills in an expected montage, before hitting the gaming floors of Vegas to rake in the dough. And in between they will find time for romance, and constantly battle the urge of easy money, emotions running high, and all the trappings from the lifestyles of the rich. However, don't expect a lot from the supporting characters, as Kate just got to preen around looking like a pretty vase, while the token Asians get caricature roles, like a kleptomaniac.While Spacey is his usual chilling self and Sturgess managed the pretty boy charismatic presence well, 21 still found it necessary to explain everything, from detailing every bit of plot development including laying out all necessary twists and turns out on the table neatly, and how the mathematical rouse actually worked. However, don't expect to pick up a tip or two from the movie, because it actually requires a step one for you to be a mathematical genius for mental gymnastics to be performed at the top of your head. Otherwise, you can just forget it, and just pick up a lottery ticket and hope for the best.But what I enjoyed from the movie, is all the wink-winks with regards to the corruption that permeates through the education system, be it getting grades from your tutors, or admissions requiring exorbitant amounts of cash. Granted that the tuition fees are not cheap because of rising salaries and cost of maintaining the school, sometimes these can be contributed in nice ways which are quite above the board, in cases of having to scratch your back and having you scratch mine back.Still, 21 made for an enjoyable heist/gambling type of movie, sans those comedic ones which HK used to put out continuously at one point in time. It has a decent, Hollywood-hyped up story to tell, with the usual message that crime does not pay, and to use your smarts wisely in the right direction.",21
23,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Nothing new, but it's worth the watch",6,3 April 2008,"21 is definitely the major film for the spring time, it has young hot actors, including an incredible academy award winner, Kevin Spacey, and another great actor who's head looks like it grew quite a bit bigger, Lawarence Fishburne. So it has all the key ingredients for a good movie, a decent plot, over all a good combination of actors, and looks like a well put together movie. So I saw it this weekend and I have to say that I was a little disappointed, I think this movie was more for the teenagers, with the actors and the rating, I think it should've been more adult. It was a typical rise and fall story with cliché'd characters. Kevin Spacey, seriously my favorite actor, he's always a dead on hit with every role he takes on, but he seemed to just sleep his way through the film and didn't really care about it. He and new and hot up-comer, Jim Sturgess were not a bad couple on screen, but were not strong enough to hold the story into something original.Basically we have Ben Campbell who needs $300,000 for Harvard Med. School, he's extremely gifted with numbers, so when his professor, Micky Rosa notices his gifts, he invites Ben with a group of his other students to go to Vegas and play 21. But there is a way to beat the game apparently, by counting cards. Ben promises up and down that it is just for school, but of course when he gets so hot, he takes it way further and ends up making a huge mistake and gets caught with some nasty security guards you don't wanna mess with.Now 21 has decent enough acting, the movie itself is decent, I didn't mind at all watching it. For the most part, it's the young group of students that keep the movie interesting and keeps your attention. My main problems are for example about the characters Ben and Jill hooking up, I seriously doubt that would happen for real, but for the movie, they want these two hotties to get together at least for the teenage audience's sake. Also supposedly the group says they have to stay on the down low in Vegas so they don't get caught, yet they go around Vegas buying all these new clothes, clubbing, drinking, etc. 21 is worth the watch, but to be honest, if you're reading this, wait for the rental, it's just a regular rise and fall story.6/10",21
24,DKosty123,"Winner Winner, Thinner Dinner",6,23 June 2009,"This film has a youthful enthusiasm which is infectious and a young cast that pulls off the infection. It is done Hollywood Flashback style in that it starts after everything happens, goes to back to how it happens and then ends by going back to the beginning.Overall, sadly, it obviously spent a lot of money in production but tries to simplify things a bit too much. While it is entertaining, it is much too simplified to interest the serious gambler. The appeal here is in telling the story in a light mood, interesting a young audience, and entertaining it. In that sense it succeeds though not on quite the stylish ease that a movie like ""The Sting"" did. Of course that one was a best picture. This one is not.AS I have not read the novel, I am not sure what liberties were taken from the true story but my feeling is that the true story here is a better tale than the movie one. That being said, as I put my brain away & look for light fare, this one fills the bill quite nicely. Kate Bosworth, Kevin Spacey, and the rest of the cast do quite fine in going through a not too serious treatment.I have seen worse, & better films than this one.",21

And revolves around students that go to MIT, and the character Kevin Spacey plays tries to recruit some brilliant math students to join his crew and beat the system and Kevin Spacey does what Kevin Spacey does best. Although I like gambling movies this movie isn't about gambling but beating the system, and the conflict that comes with trying to beat the system. Cause some other intelligent character Laurence Fishburne is trying to catch them red handed. I didn't find anything surprising about this movie, it was just cliché on top of cliché. Although this movie had some flare, but it ran like a fairy tale and that sort of disappointed me, and the MIT students just wasn't that smart in this movie. ""21"" entertained me the first time I saw it, but it also didn't pull any surprises. The characters weren't even interesting, except maybe Choi the character Aaron Yoo played.

27,sddavis63,It Didn't Do A Lot For Me,4,31 August 2009,"It was OK. That about sums up my reaction to ""21."" My primary reason for thinking it was just OK is that the whole thing just didn't ring true to me, in spite of the claim that it's based on a true story. Based on what I've read about the movie's background since watching it, I think I'd describe that as ""very loosely based ..."" Essentially, the story is about an MIT student (Ben, played by Jim Sturgess) who needs $300,000 to attend Harvard Medical School. How's he going to get it? He's applied for a full scholarship, but although he's brilliant, it's not looking good. Then , along comes one of his math professors (Kevin Spacey), who turns out to be a former gambler who's developed a system for counting cards in Blackjack and then recruits the best and brightest students at MIT to be his team - he teaches them the system and they fly to Las Vegas repeatedly to gamble and share their winnings, until they get caught.Setting aside the Hollywood deviations from the ""true story,"" I just didn't find this to be all that interesting, nor did I feel any particular sympathy for or closeness to anyone, except maybe Ben's two former best friends, who essentially get the brushoff from Jim once he's embraced his new lifestyle as a high roller. For whatever reason, there was an attempt to build an unnecessary romance into the story between Ben and one of the female gamblers which added nothing to the story. There's a twist near the end that did take me just a little bit by surprise, so I give credit for that, but overall I was disappointed with this. I've certainly seen better (and truer) movies. 4/10",21
28,Buddy-51,interesting story given decent treatment,6,6 February 2010,"The only thing standing between 21-year-old Ben Campbell and his lifelong dream of attending Harvard Medical School is the $300,000 in fees and tuition it will cost to go there. But Ben has a special skill that might make it possible to cover his bills and then some. It turns out he's a genius when it comes to numbers, and it is this talent that brings him to the attention of Micky Rosa, Ben's professor at MIT, who has come up with what he believes is a full proof system for winning at blackjack. Rosa invites Ben to become a part of a handpicked team of similarly gifted students who are getting some extracurricular lessons in how to beat the house at 21. Ben is, at first, reluctant to sign on to what seems like a morally questionable enterprise, but the lure of easy money and the appeal to his ego finally win him over. So off to Vegas they go to put their system into play. But can a clean-cut, wholesome boy like Ben stay true to his goals and principles once he's had a taste of life in the fast lane? Based on a true story, ""21,"" directed by Robert Luketic, is a slick, superficial, well-oiled crowd-pleaser that holds one's attention while it's playing itself out but doesn't provide much food for thought or emotional resonance after it's over. Jim Sturgess makes for an appealing protagonist as the acceptance-craving Ben, but the real acting here is done by Kevin Spacey as the odious professor who uses blackmail and bribery to keep his minions in line, and Laurence Fishburne as a head of casino security who may turn out to be the one serious impediment to the team's success. The script fails to make the card-game esoterica comprehensible for the lay audience - we're forced to accept way too much of it on faith - but hardcore gamblers will probably be taking notes for future pointers.Plus, there's a great moment at the end that makes the whole shebang suddenly worthwhile.",21
29,Robert_duder,Hollywood fodder makes for a quasi entertaining experience,7,15 April 2008,"21 certainly won't go into my books as the most intelligent or deep movie I've ever seen, in fact as far as Hollywood films go 21 is about as shallow as they come. They stack the cast with some big names, flashy romance, the latest fad...in this case cards...Blackjack to be exact, and people will come out in droves to see it. Now there was a Canadian made film about this same story entitled ""The Last Casino"" (see my review) and if you ever get a chance to see it definitely check it out because it's one of the better Canadian movies I've seen and it also actually is much smarter and more artistic than 21 but tells the nearly identical story. Still 21 has some key elements going for it including a new hot lead actor that is very talented, a big budget, fun with cards, a half decent story and a little romance thrown in to boot. It just won't have you walking away feeling any smarter or better about life and that's okay as long as it entertains.Latest It Boy Jim Sturgess following his success in Across The Universe plays math genius Ben Campbell. Sturgess has this definite quality about him that I predict will make him an absolute star and big movies like this definitely help and he already has a recognizable face. He is very energetic and really shines on screen and he is just someone you relate to and can watch him in this adventure plus he gets to show some emotion and probably the only character with depth in the film. Kevin Spacey is the powerhouse of the film or at least he's supposed to be. I mean in all fairness he does well as the leader of their gambling group and a University professor but he doesn't do as much with the part as I would have thought. He doesn't really grip you as much as he could have considering the man can act and is a legend in his own right. Kate Bosworth is lovely but in all honestly I found her downright boring in this film. She does little to nothing other than look cute and be a romantic interest for Sturgess' character which I thought the entire romance felt forced anyways although they had decent chemistry. Fellow team members Aaron Yoo and Liza Lapira are practically non existent as the entire film focuses almost entirely on the three of the main big actors which is unfortunate for them. Someone who does stand out from the rest though is larger than life Laurence Fishburne as an aging security agent for Casinos. He is really great in the role and makes an awesome anti-hero to the story.The cast is decent although no one really is mind blowing but that could be because of the rather lack luster script. You know a twist is coming and you're trying to figure it out as you go but even if you don't figure it out the twist doesn't really shock you or anything. Basically what I am saying is that millions will see 21 and probably enjoy it and I don't disagree with them. The film is fun but it's just not something that will stick with you for very long. It's Hollywood fodder made to make money and it will likely do that but don't expect it to be a time lasting classic or anything. But check it out and see for yourself. 7/10",21
30,Lejink,Casino boogie,6,4 January 2013,"Hard to believe this movie was based on a factual story, given the improbabilities in the narrative, but this was still an enjoyable caper film, colourfully set in Las Vegas, centring on a youthful team of blackjack players out to clean up in Sun City, under Tge tutelage of their college master, ex-player Kevin Spacey.Putting aside how a runaway swindler like Spacey could find himself ensconced as an esteemed mathematics professor at Harvard, recruiting his team from students in his class, he and his young crew raid Vegas every weekend building up their ""winnings"" until dissent in the ranks upsets the gravy train in its tracks.The action centres on nerdy but normal , played by Jim although one of the problems for me was that too much happens to him. By the time we've reached the predictable twist at the end, a lot if the dramatic tension has been dissipated with each succeeding development as it affects Jim.Of course it's tricky to make blackjack gripping on the big screen and despite some clever time-lapse photography, with the threat from the security team lacking menace and too many loose strands in Jim!'s. The acting is okay amongst the younger set, but Spacey isn't really stretched here, plus his character disappears for a significant period before making the unlikely decision to return with his acolytes to Vegas for one last hit.Running about half an hour too long, considering the slightness of the story, even the sights of Vegas itself couldn't adequately fill the gap. However, I was just about intrigued enough by the story to see it through to the end",21
31,paul2001sw-1,By the numbers thriller,4,23 July 2008,"There have been many great movies about casinos, but '21' is sadly not one of them. Heavy handed, unsubtle and obvious, it's a film about a maths professor who gathers a team of elite students to pull of a gambling scam. But every point is clumsily made: the hero is a genius who just wants to pay his fees for Harvard Medical School; his friends are geeks but this fellow gamblers are all glamorous; the direction of the plot is highly signalled and even the twists are well-signposted; someone turns out to be utterly (and arguably incoherently) villainous, and so on. What makes this so bad is the fact that the film attempts to disguise its ordinariness behind a veneer of pseudo-cleverness: for example, the hero proves his brilliance to us (and his tutor) by solving a probability problem that is in fact well known outside mathematical circles and which he is posed in the middle of a lecture that is nothing to do with probability theory; while the basics of the scam are laid out on the table for the audience, but it's details remain obscure and unexplained. It's a shame, as if the film didn't labour its points so badly, it could still have been entertaining. As it is, it's by the numbers stuff which, in the words of a line uttered in it by Kevin Spacey's character, won't tell you anything you didn't already know.",21

But, it was made in a way that would attract your attention. Card counting is not an interesting subject, but I liked how this film made it to be.Robert Luketic's film is based off a true story about how several MIT students and their professor head off to the Las Vegas casinos to make money, perhaps not from the most legal way.The acting is not too bad. Jim Sturgess has the makings of being a fine actor and he shows promise here. As always, Kevin Spacey is great. The same could be said for Laurence Fishburne. However, I was not a big fan of Kate Bosworth though.Overall, 21 is a good movie but it does have some faults. It seems to have a weaker script than one would expect for this kind of film.

38,Rodrigo_Amaro,"""Winner Winner Chicken Dinner"" and a strange lesson learned",9,19 July 2010,"In ""21"" Ben, a bright young student (Jim Sturgess) with an amazing memory for numbers is approached by his teacher (Kevin Spacey) on a big plan: go to Las Vegas to make money by counting cards on Blackjack. The teacher has a whole team of students along with him, and they will help Ben in the plan by making signs and codes. Why Ben joined the team? Because he wants to go to Harvard Medicine School and he doesn't have money, and even with an excellent background and many extracurricular activities the director is not impressed. So in order to get a scholarship he needs to convince the man that he has a impressive life experience to dazzle him. I'm sorry...did I just delivered the whole thing and ruined the experience for you? Sorry my bad!I haven't read the book in which Robert Luketic's movie is based or even haven't heard about the real life story in which this was based but I can say that it's a very good film about how money and education always are walking on the same side. For someone who lives in a third world country this movie doesn't make no sense for one can think: Or you born rich, pay for your studies until high school and then go to a public college, without paying but getting a good education, and then get rich otherwise you're gonna be locked in the lousy public school system during high school and then paying for a college degree and having a mediocre formation. That's how it sounds for those who live in countries like Brazil. And what's the connection between the movie? Everything! Ben is only doing the counting thing in Vegas because he wants to go to a prestiged college, it's his dream, even that his already studying at MIT. He's smart, hard working, but he's attracted to other things while ""gambling"" such as women, money, fun, all things he didn't have with his nerd friends at MIT. He dreams big and knows exactly what he wants and that's great but here's a real tragedy bigger than to be beaten by the security staff of the casino: Ben is good with numbers so why he can't think about millions of people that won't have what he's get so far and be happy with it? It's not mentioned in the film why medicine is so important to him, if at least he said that in the future he would work for Doctor Wihout Borders and go to a foreign country where the health system is poor, okay I would get it and I would be more favorable to his character. That's not the case. And even with all the ""Winner Winner Chicken Dinner"" cheered throughout the movie, and all that fun of playing like a hot shot in Vegas what was the lesson that the director in Harvard (played by Jack Gilpin) gave to Ben in the end? That if you participates of a little and innocent scheme to make money, deceiving his family and his true friends and even making a strange deal with his mentor (and deceiving him too in the end) you really can impress Harvard and be welcome to be a doctor! We're talking about medicine, folks, the most ethical of the professions and that's how Ben finally entered in by coming clean with a fraud? This took a lot of credibility of the pursuit for a good education theme.Despite these criticism it's a quite enjoyable, thrilling and interesting movie. Well acted by the incredible cast (Sturgess is fascinating; Spacey efficient as usual), and directed with a fast good rhythm by Robert Luketic ""21"" is a must see film for those who enjoy stories with a difficult mission to achieve. It has a great soundtrack too. In the very last scene it starts to play Rolling Stones's ""You can't always get what you want"" which is ironic considering that Ben talks about several things he missed and gained, and it seems that he didn't lose anything. 9/10",21
39,Dr_Coulardeau,"Kind of funny, even if perverted",8,5 October 2010,"Be it true or not, the story is funny. A rather impoverished student at MIT decides to accept a proposal to make some easy money, since he is good at numbers, by playing Black Jack in Las Vegas. That student will get the scholarship he needs to go to Harvard medical school that costs 300,000 US dollars. He is dragged into the black jack business by some math teacher who is using a group of students to make easy money (he gets 50% of the winnings) without being seen because he is persona non grata at all and forever in Las Vegas, though they do not know his face. That professor is of course a crook and when one night, unsettled by some riff raff with his best friends, our student, Ben, loses a lot, the professor destroys everything: he blocks him at MIT, he visits his room and steals his money that was hidden in the false ceiling, ruining at the same time his dream of Harvard, he even tells the security people that the student is back at the black jack table. But the student gets his revenge on the professor, the hard way, but he had to deal with the security boss in the casino who cheats him in his turn and he is still without any money left. But that really dazzles the Dean of Harvard Medical School who interviews him a second time: he went to Las Vegas 17 times, won the 300,000 dollars twice and they were stolen from him twice too. Apparently that is a dazzling life experience that deserves a scholarship. That film is immoral, wicked, perverted, and that student is going to be a doctor. I just hope he does not gamble with the life of his patients the same way. And yet it is fascinating because it demonstrates some people are ready to do absolutely anything to satisfy their desires, to reach their goals, to succeed, no matter what it may be. At the same time some are ready to betray anyone to get even or get revenge or just to get a profit out of these others. But are you sure you would not do that too? You can't imagine what some very decent people were able and ready to do in Nazi concentration camps just to be a Kapo, which meant they had a chance to survive longer. In some situation you cannot know what you would do. Anyway, to defeat casinos on their own ground is absolutely funny for us the spectators and must be absolutely funny for the ""gambler"" even if he has to be good with figures, which means slightly autistic, which means slightly retarded.

Also starring Kevin Spacey as he features as the dissolute professor who recruits the brightest minds at MIT to count cards for guaranteed profit. Only human error can break the winning streak. 21 stars Jim Sturgess as Ben Campbell. The film happens quickly and precise as the important moments of the film are present in a quiet manner. Ben immediately stands out in a class taught by statistician Mickey Rosa (Spacey), but when Mickey offers him the chance to win untold riches in the game of blackjack, Campbell declines on principle. It's only time will tell when fellow classmate Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth) and the steeply-rising price of college education, that Ben gets on board with the crew. 21 is seemingly interesting and entertaining but there appears to be several small flaws or parts that are rushed or not executed well.

But actually, if you strip the rules back, it's fairly simple. 21 presents its simplicity to extreme levels, to the point that even children could start playing and believe in the old ""counting cards"" technique (please don't...). Despite the basic approach, it's an enjoyable crime drama. A ridiculously smart student lacks the funds to attend Harvard medical school, and is coincidentally recruited by a professor to participate in the ""business"" of blackjack.Utilising his intuition and inhuman mathematic ability to ""count cards"" and rake in large amount of chips from casinos. Essentially resembling a human calculator, succumbing to peer pressure for nefarious reasons. It all seems too good to be true. Alas, a few predictable twists and turns sends our protagonist down a journey of reflection, however the pace and frantic energy within the narrative consistently makes this flick enjoyable. The first half constantly threw enough mathematical equations, logical scenarios and variables to complete a degree in advanced statistical analysis. The second half then tossed in some unwanted melodrama, romance and plot conveniences. But hey, it's fine.The fun light tone throughout was never diminished, and the bright illuminations of Las Vegas enhanced the enjoyment even more. Spacey (excuse my language...) was excellent. Slimy, sarcastic and sophisticated as all businessmen/professors should be. Sturgess overplayed the awkward nerd slightly too much, but by the end I was invested in his performance. The soundtrack of trashy pop songs detracted from the flamboyant environment that the characters spent many nights in. Not enough for me to not recommend this film however. A light-hearted crime caper that could've been a ""winner winner, chicken dinner"" but settled for a ""I'm going to call it a night"" instead (no idea where I'm going with this...).",21

When his professor Micky Rosa (Spacey) discovers his mathematical genius, he enlists his help as a ""business partner"" training him to join his team of blackjack card-counting students who take weekend trips to Vegas to make bank.Ben is initially very resistant to the idea, saying a definitive no to a very tempting Kate Bosworth. Naturally, he has a change of heart, but the film lets out that it doesn't really care about its characters when we see no motivation for the change. We could assume the money is too hard to pass up, but we really don't know. The characters merely go through all the motions, same with the relationship that eventually buds between Bosworth's character Jill and Ben.The movie follows this basic nobody prodigy discovers a hidden talent and rides the waves of fortune until he becomes cocky and thickheaded and trouble starts. Not that you expect anything different, but that's really all it is. Pepper that with flashy gambling shots and montages of living it up in Las Vegas and that's your movie. There are several scenes that seem so forced or dialog that seems unnecessary that you have to laugh at it. It's just not something you can take too seriously. All this just detracts from the interesting storytelling possibilities that the concept offers.All the same, you root for Ben anyway, you want to know what happens and you feel reasonably entertained. Despite director Robert Luketic (""Legally Blonde"") choosing a lot of poor, overdone techniques, ""21"" is paced well and keeps your attention. The only difference is that you don't care what happens, you just want to know.There's nothing clever, smooth or edgy about ""21"" though it just seems to come off that way. You're usually a step ahead of what's going on, so there's no way you can be dazzled by the story. It's the thrill of Vegas and winning big that keeps us tagging along with the story.",21
43,Anonymous_Maxine,How to ruin a fascinating true story.,5,1 May 2009,"Ah, Las Vegas, the city of lights. The place that probably offers more false promises than anywhere else in the world, Hollywood included. I've never been much of a gambler myself, usually when I go there I plan a given amount of money to gamble with and, once it's gone (because I understand in advance that I'm gonna lose it) then I stop and go back to my buddies and concentrate on getting nicely drunk. But cards are even less my thing. My friends back in Venice Beach had almost nightly poker tournaments that I couldn't get myself interested in to save my life, so my experience in gambling real money on card games is almost nonexistent. Nevertheless, I have an endless fascination with Vegas, and the true story of those people from MIT who raked in hundreds of thousands of dollars by counting cards at the blackjack tables should have been a great movie. Unfortunately, 21 is not it. The movie deals with the true story of those MIT students, but the movie is so heavily fictionalized that it's nearly impossible to tell what really happened under what ultimately turns out to be a twisted mass of Hollywood clichés.Jim Sturgess plays Ben Campbell, a college student graduating from MIT and about to fulfill his lifelong dream of attending Harvard Medical School. The only problem is that he doesn't have any money and Harvard Med will run him $300,000. Since he lives in a world that contains one single scholarship opportunity and not a hint of student loans (seriously, with an academic history like Ben's, there are about a million ways to get the money he needs), he sees his chances of going to Harvard Med slipping away. Soon he meets a professor, Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey) who introduces him to a carefully designed card-counting scheme involving himself and a few of his most gifted students. They all head to Vegas and try to beat the system, while security chief Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne) lurks in the darkened security office surrounded by TV screens watching out for people like them. I wanted to see a movie about the real story, something almost documentary-like that tells not only how they beat the Vegas system but also how they got caught and what happened afterwards, but 21 plays more like a completely fictional story. It's like a cheap version of Ocean's 11 except the only laws being broken are when Williams drags various characters into the casino basement to, ah, knock some sense out of them. I have no idea how card counting works, I'm just not a math guy. The movie doesn't concern itself with helping us understand it either, beyond some quickly edited sequences showing the main characters devising an intricate counting and communication scheme that will allow them to work together in the casinos without anyone realizing that they are a team. The problem is that the card counting itself requires a tremendous intellect, but the characters are phenomenally stupid. Are we supposed to believe that the same people who perfected this counting scheme would come up with signals so stupidly obvious as linking your arms behind your back when the deck's hot? It was bad enough that they all constantly glance nervously at each other whenever they're in the same room, but that arm-linking thing was amazing. Every single time!! Didn't they ever think it would be a good idea to change things up a little bit? It would require a stupendous quantity of incompetence on the part of the security administration to miss THAT. Even worse is the fact that in order to remind us that they're humans, the characters have to make drastic mistakes, but drastic gambling mistakes done well will give you something like the poker scene at the end of Casino Royale. Here, they get dunk and blow their cover or make gambling errors that can only be described as purely moronic, and the screenplay is more concerned with cheesy relationships between the characters that only distract from what the story is really about. Pearl Harbor had the same problem. We want to see a story about a major historical event, not some idiotic romance between Josh Hartnett and whoever that girl was. Even worse, nothing is told about what happened after they were caught. They won't go to jail because counting cards isn't illegal (and shouldn't be), but the movies ties everything up with so much obviously fabricated nonsense that it's nearly impossible to walk out of the theater without feeling cheated. And in a movie about card-counting and taking Vegas for hundreds of thousands of dollars, it's the casinos who should feel cheated, not the audience.",21
44,Vartiainen,Fine heist movie with some occasional hiccups,6,14 July 2020,"21 is heist movie based on true events, starring Jim Sturgess, Kevin Spacey, Laurence Fishburne and Kate Bosworth, to name a few. It follows the ""crime"" career of a group of MIT students who learn to count cards in order to make money in Vegas. Unfortunately, they, like many others, fall to infighting, greed and hubris.The film is directed by Robert Luketic and he has a good eye for entertainment. The world of gambling, especially in Vegas, is a glamorous one and Luketic showcases that rather well. The juxtaposition between the razzle dazzle of Vegas and the dreariness of Massachusetts works well to make us sympathize with the characters and their downward spiral towards greed and the ever rising stakes.It's also interesting to keep in mind that this really happened. Not quite this neatly and there were a lot more people involved than five students and a professor with a shady past, but still.But that's also the film's biggest downfall. It avoids the usual problem with stories based on true events in that it doesn't feel episodic at all. The narrative flows smoothly and there are no jarring time jumps where nothing of value happens. But there are fictive obstacles thrown in. Very cinematic obstacles. Like a big bad casino representative who hunts these pesky kids. Or these great, big confrontations between the main characters in public places where they snipe at each other, exchanging witty quips and snarky one-liners. Things that are not bad on their own, but work to pull you out of the experience when done this jarringly.21 is not a bad heist film. It has style and substance. It has good characters. Its only flaw is its reliance on clichés. But that can be forgiven.",21
45,Chris Knipp,"Dross into dross, for fun and thrills",6,2 April 2008,"Luketic ('Legally Blonde,' 'Monster-in-Law') provides a few thrills and some pretty mindless fun in this more or less reality-based story about a half-dozen college students involved in a risky but successful get-rich-quick gambling scheme supervised by their MIT math professor. Interest is provided by the contrast between the dour snow-covered Boston area setting of the Ivy League school and the glitter of Vegas. Kevin Spacey plays the manipulative, larcenous prof who masterminds the scheme and Lawrence Fisbourne is his old hood nemesis, protecting casino interests. It's slumming for such good actors to indulge in this sort of shallow diversion, but they add tone to the proceedings. A movie like this that skips over details like fine-tuned dialog, character development, or intelligent exposition cuts little ice with critics but is catnip at the box office in this winter-release dead time. Younger viewers can if they choose enjoy the images of honor roll kids grabbing quick money at the Blackjack tables in a world of danger and romance; gambling freaks may fantasize on sequences wherein players beat the tables for hundreds of thousands. The risk factor is real: ""counting cards"" may not be illegal in playing ""21,"" as Spacey's character says, but a team working the tables in a coordinated operation using secret signals is the best possible way to get casino goons on your tail.The weaknesses of 21 are many; nothing works too well unless you watch with your brain on hold. The young characters have no depth. Spacey and Fishbourne are on hold too. Spacey, whose classroom talk predictably has precious little to do with MIT-level mathematics, is never anything but a bossy and threatening smart aleck. Fishbourne is a tough and relentless meanie, about whom we know only that he's soon to retire without benefits and that he once knew Spacey as a Blackjack ace long ago. The details of the game and the counting are mushed up. The pleasant enough, mildly cute young English actor Jim Sturgess as Ben, the brilliant new recruit of Prof. Micky who becomes the team's big player, is about as lackluster and generic as a young lead could be. As his sidekick on the team and erstwhile girlfriend Jill, the (also) cute, stylish-looking Kate Bosworth is another actor whose talents are debatable and whose character is so underwritten as to be nonexistent. For ""color"" we get one Asian guy, Choi (Aaron Yoo), who adds a few lines and a head of wacky, Basquiat-like hair. The real-life Asian identity of most of the MIT team has been dropped. An excellent online discussion by Ian Kaplan (bearcave.com) gives evidence that the fictionalized true story '21's' based on, 'Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions' by novelist Ben Mezrich, is a page-turner, but itself shallow and poorly written--and possibly exaggerated as to the amounts of cash involved. A weakness in execution in the movie version is that the team members don't use disguises until after they think they've been spotted. They don't ever change their signals, and the key one is ridiculously obvious. It's doubtful that Ben could come in as a high roller, win big, and then just move to another nearby table; the real life team had to win often but small--and in many other places besides Vegas. Ben also violates the rules of winning by counting by being flashy and getting on a first name basis with doormen as well as staying at deluxe comp suites with Jill, another gauche attention-getter. He would have been spotted and barred. The team's partying a lot and going on shopping sprees when they win big are two other obvious no-no's. Are they trying to get caught? And the depiction of the tables action is simple, one scene hard to distinguish from another. Director Luketic and his writers Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb don't know how to make card play compelling and specific. The prof, Micky Rosa (funny name for somebody teaching non-linear algebra at MIT, but real name of an actual Blackjack ace) is accompanying the kids to Vegas and getting half their take, but what follow-up supervision is he providing? No wonder that when Ben succumbs to hubris and messes up big time and Micky dumps him they decide to proceed on their own. The movie provides a level of violence the real life account lacks. Counters are usually barred, not beaten. The movie nemesis Cole Williams represents a whole team in real life, shown here as giving way to computerized devices; in reality both high tech and human elements are used to protect casinos from being wiped out. But in general the movie has, by the evidence, dumbed down and simplified an already low-IQ book.The movie's narrative framework is as mildly clever but shallow as the whole. Ben is being interviewed for a full scholarship at Harvard Medical School where he's been accepted and the interviewer tells him to get this special prestigious all-expenses ""Nelson"" award he needs to exhibit ""startling"" attributes and tell a story that ""leaps off the page."" This is that story. Only trouble is, he's trying to raise the $300,00 he needs for Harvard throughout the narrative. ""Did that leap off the page?"" Ben asks the interviewer at the end, who responds with a dumb look. We're supposed to respond to all this with dumb looks too. Ben is provided with a naive mom who offers her limited life savings to put him through Harvard Med. He also has two nerdy MIT best buddies working on a science robotics contest whom he drops when the excitement starts and then touchingly reunites with thereafter. Neat, and dumb. Movies have been known to spin weak books into gold; not this time though. Luketic & Co. have spun a book with an interesting story to tell into a down-time diversion that rated only a 48 on Metacritic. But in spite of all this, it still has some entertainment value.",21

Jim Sturgess who was last seen in Across The Universe(2007), and The Other Boleyn Girl(2008), really comes alive here, he looks a cross between Jude Law and Jake Gyllenhaal. Not to mention Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne are also great. Lets not forget the ever so lovely Kate Bosworth who really shines in her role. The story starts with Ben Campbell(well acted by Jim Sturgess) who is a MIT student, who has a brilliant intelligent mind when it comes to numbers. But Ben discovers that there are problems that his brilliant mind can't solve. When he has trouble paying for school.

47,Polaris_DiB,"Pretty, and average, so pretty average",5,19 June 2009,"What can I say, I like a good story that combines math talent with risk and danger. Not quite a heist movie, and of course ""loosely"" based on a true story, 21 is some pretty good popcorn fare for a good two hours and change.The images are pretty. They are mostly clichéd and typical shots of Las Vegas, the usual glam and color on winding aerials and dissolves, but it's fun to look at. The characters are entertaining. For some reason, Kevin Spacey went to sleep for this role, which is interesting because if he had actually bothered to put some work into it, it might have made this a much more fun movie, and his character would be much more dynamic. Instead, he barely keeps his eyes open. It's strange. The story is predictable, but the details suffice to keep you interested.All in all, it's a very average movie. Sometimes movies are so average, that it's worth emphasizing the absolute average-ness of it. This is one of those movies. There's really nothing else to say.--PolarisDiB",21

What I believed would be a typical Hollywood juvenile piece of celluloid tripe was actually a watchable, engaging motion picture with a good story, good acting, a credible script and ... a beginning, a middle and an end. The movie glorifies the art of card-counting and paints a rather cynical picture of the human condition but never sinks to the level of a maudlin melodrama. The movie also is unpretentious and tells a story without trying to moralize. One thing is for certain: if you are a member of the Las Vegas chamber of commerce you will definitely love this movie because this movie has to rank as one of the better movies whose setting is Las Vegas.",21

It would select the medium option. This movie was full of cliché moments and expected story arcs. The character development was done just professionally yet didn't go anywhere new. The rough plot is a brilliant kid doesn't have enough money to attend Harvard Medical School and rather easily gets persuaded to enter into a Blackjack card counting scheme as justification to help him pay his way. Will he earn enough before or if he gets caught? Who will end up being his hot romantic love interest and who or what will he overlook during his quest for money and thrills?

50,Lechuguilla,"""Winner Winner Chicken Dinner""",8,28 March 2008,"Slick camera work and some good performances rev up the technical quality of this fact-based story about a 21 year old MIT student named Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) who, along with his brainy Ivy League chums, travels to Vegas to win tons of money at the blackjack tables. Their sleazy math professor, Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey), leads the group. Rosa has devised an elaborate and conspiratorial card counting scheme that consists of code words and hand gestures. With all that preparation, the group's scheme does work ... for a while. And in the process, the shy, cautious Ben, who only wants the money for tuition costs, morphs into his alter ego, a person quite unlike his original self.The film's pace starts off leisurely, then alternates between fast-paced Vegas casino action and periods of downtime wherein Ben and his girlfriend, fellow conspirator Jill (Kate Bosworth), talk shop and take in the high life. The story does have a villain, but it may not be who you think it is.The script's dialogue is snappy and hip, and contains minimal tech jargon. ""Variable change"" is one such math term, and it has thematic implications toward the end, as the story twists and turns in ways that may surprise you. And ""winner winner, chicken dinner"" is the group's lingo for gambling success.Production design is realistic and lavish; this is a big budget film. Color cinematography, by DP Russell Carpenter, is polished and slick. There are lots of elaborate camera dissolves and close-ups. The best parts of the film are the close-ups of the characters at the blackjack tables. Film editing coincides with plot pacing, and ranges from slow to super fast. Acting is all-around good. Kevin Spacey gives his usual topnotch acting job; Sturgess and Bosworth also give fine performances.It's not a perfect film. Background music was noisy and rather nondescript for my taste. And I could have wished for more card playing, and less time spent on Ben's college buddies in the first Act; the result is that the film gets off to a slow start. Still, the script is credible, and stays close to its book source ""Bringing Down The House"" by Ben Mezrich.Thematically relevant in today's world of greed and materialism, ""21"" is a terrific film, one that has greater import than other films, because the events in ""21"" really happened. And the fine performances and polished visuals enhance the overall look and feel, to create a film that is both engaging and entertaining.",21
51,barnabyrudge,Easy-to-watch caper inspired by true events.,6,11 December 2008,"""21"" is an easy-to-watch caper movie based on factual events. You don't particularly have to be able to understand the rules of blackjack, nor do you have to be a gambling enthusiast, to enjoy the film. It begins, keeps you engrossed for a couple of hours, then finishes. The whole thing is smooth, slick and enjoyable on an undemanding level. The lack of depth hurts the film when it comes to repeat viewings, but if you intend to watch it once only it's a reasonably entertaining flick.MIT student Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) is desperate to secure a place at Harvard Medical School, but cannot afford the educational fees so is hedging all his hopes on winning a much-sought scholarship. Fate lends a hand when Ben proves his ingenuity in an advanced maths class taught by charismatic lecturer Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey), during which he successfully solves a complex probability question. Later, Ben is invited to join Professor Rosa and five other students who are part of a well-organised gambling racket involving the card game blackjack. Using their mathematical know-how, the team have devised a system for winning tens of thousands of dollars at the blackjack table. They take it in turns as ""spotters"" (card-counters who place minimum bets and look out for tables where the game is about to yield big money), and ""big players"" (players who move in with the expensive bets once a promising table has been identified). Ben is suddenly caught up in a world of glitz and glamour as the team work the Las Vegas casinos. he's having a blast, winning a fortune, and falling for the girl of his dreams - team-member Jill (Kate Bosworth). But trouble brews on the horizon as old-school security expert Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne) gradually latches onto the team's scam..Based on the Ben Mezrich book Bringing Down The House, the film is generally quite believably plotted. It only really slips into moments of unpersuasiveness when melodrama and clichés take over (e.g the somewhat fanciful love scene between Ben and Jill; the contrived ""sting"" planned by Cole Williams to nail his longtime nemesis Mickey Rosa; etc.) It's nice to see a clutch of personable new stars coming through in a film like this, even if the script doesn't place huge demands on their acting ability. Spacey and Fishburne are the older, more experienced hands on deck, and they do their thing with an air of confidence and professionalism. The book-ends of the films - during which Campbell tries to ""dazzle"" a Harvard interviewer with the story of his gambling adventures  are a bit forced and obvious and, if I'm honest, irritated me a little. But, on the whole, ""21"" is entertaining stuff. you could certainly do a lot worse.",21
52,3xHCCH,Math Genius Gone Awry,7,30 May 2008,"It is not so common that we come across a movie about a math genius. Of course, there was ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Good Will Hunting,"" now comes another one. ""21"" is the story of Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess), an MIT math nerd who wanted to go into Harvard Medical School. However, being poor, he needed to come up with $300,000 for him to get through med school. Opportunity presented itself when his math professor Mickey Rosa (Kevin Spacey) noted his skills and recruited him to join their blackjack card counting group. This group would go to Vegas in the weekends, make a killing at the blackjack tables by employing pre-arranged signals, code words and card counts, and go back to school on Monday as if nothing happened. Of course, you know that with schemes like this, happy days will not be forever.I liked the movie very interesting. I did have to gloss over the fact that I honestly did not understand any of the card counting techniques they were using. What on earth does is mean if the card count is ""+17"" or ""+15""? In any case, I liked the character arc of Ben Campbell and the predicaments he was in. I knewthere would be retribution at the end, and I liked the fact that this part of the movie was not cut and dry. There was still a lot of suspense and unexpected developments.Jim Sturgess, though I have never seen him before, played his role very well, as the shy intellectual turned blackjack high bidder. Kate Bosworth, while gorgeous, looked too old to be his love interest. She did not look like her Lois Lane character here, but she also does not look credible as an MIT rocket science student. Kevin Spacey played his role quite efficiently as always. It was a bit of a stretch to believe how an MIT professor can run this ""business"" while having a record in Vegas back in his heyday as a card hustler as well, and still keep using his real name.Overall, I found this very interesting and a movie worth watching. It is even more interesting to find out that this was actually based loosely on a true story!",21

This particular effort was first a non-fiction novel by Ben Mezrich telling us about 6 very bright,but stupid MIT students & there somewhat slimy professor who robbed Las Vegas Blackjack tables for millions. Peter Steinfeld and Allen Loeb wrote the screenplay. The director is Robert Luketic.I wonder how much research these film creators made.The film in inaccurate in the portrayals of the Las Vegas Casino operations,Las Vegas itself,MIT the school these students are from & a few other things.All these inaccuracies could be tolerated in a film that was interesting and fun to watch. Even the original Ocean's Eleven, in all the Rat Pack's foolishness,Studio sets etc seemed more real.Now OCEANS 11 & its sequels had real professional actors doing these roles & made us accept all the inaccuracies as fun.The performers in 21, have looks & some talent and that is about all. Jim Sturgess is the lead actor, He may eventually be a good actor. Kate Bosworth is the requisite female & yes the 2 of them do have a mild role in the hay. The other 4 student are OK.NONE of them standout. Kevin Spacey is the slimy teacher, he used to give great performances What happened. Laurence Fishburn (the most talented actor in the cast) is wasted,This film was made on location in Boston & Las Vegas areas,the sets look good & thats about it, also none of the song score was done live, NOTE the do have live entertainment in casinos, but not in this film.The running time is 124 very long,very boring minutes,thus my ** (unsatisfactory) rating.ratings ** (out of 4) 58 points(out of 100) IMDb (5 out of 10)",21

Though what they do isn't strictly illegal, the casinos aren't really happy about them winning a lot, and have their own shady countermeasures.Comments: There is a saying that you don't play a player. In this movie, everything is business, everyone is a player, and everyone is playing everyone (in one way or another, i.e. not only for money). A good set up for intrigues, and there are a enough of them, not too many though, to make this a good thriller.However, it lacks a little to make it a great one. For one thing there is really never any doubt how it will end, because of the way the movie is set up. It just a question of how to get there, and as the movie progresses fewer and fewer options remain. Fortunately it doesn't become totally crystal clear, and it does some twists at the end to throw you off. It is partially successful but not wholly. It manages to become suspenseful enough to be entertaining but not surprising.There are some good actors, most notably Spacey and Fishburne, but this won't be the height of their respective careers. Sturgess does a good lead, supported by always beautiful Bosworth, but none of them give a performance worth remembering.In the end it just a good entertaining movie, don't bet on anything more.7/10",21

The movie nicely introduces the basics of the subject of blackjack card counting and showing good depiction of first hand practice. Yet the movie wisely refrains from showing the details of the introduced basics so as not to encourage the practice even more. The added twists nicely start at the exact half time of the movie. Those twists and turns escalated on an accelerated rate well enough until the movie hits us with the double hidden story flow that's revealed as the surprise ending at the finale. The acting overall is decently good. Jim Sturgess portrayed the semi nerd college student with almost perfect expressions. Kevin Spacey lives up to his reputation as one of the ultimate antagonists. Kate Bosworth nicely provided the love interest angle. Aaron Yoo and Liza Lapra also adds well enough to the team setting.,21

63,eric262003,Flawed But Entertaining Sin City Themed Movie,6,8 September 2019,"As a fan of movies based off of high stakes gambling and the manipulative way of how Hollywood has glamourized Vegas to death, I do come to the realization that Sin City id not as glittery as they make you all believe. Sure it may be biased in my point of view because I'm not a gambler but I was never turned-on by the seductive nature this city unapologetic exposes to us making it feel as if it's a giant amusement park for adults. No matter how much profit you make the results are always the same, the house emerges victorious. Aside from the casinos many hotels surround them and guess where they get their revenue from? Need I say more?Inspired by real events based off of a novel by Ben Mezrich, ""21"" centres around six MIT students who esoterically use their cunning wit that no textbook was offered to them to come up with their own codes and rhythms to win it big on the Vegas strip. As usual, Hollywood successfully sexes up the scenery combined with Kevin Spacey taking charge as Prof. Mickey Rosa and the students are donned in their trendy night outfits. Although they are super smart, the students are persuaded by Mickey that they deny they are cheating, but rather outsmarting the system by way of card counting. Sure there's a hint of complex mathematics and some methodology to avoid being caught even by means of going incognito, fake names and different gestures, words and body language.What gets me annoyed here is that the filmmakers try to dumb us down by providing us every detail stating the obvious that through every casino codes change, and that no trick is ever repeated twice. It makes it that way so that the subplot featured here leaves a bad impression that their manipulative influences are out-shined and downplayed by technology the threat of head security officials like Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne) in an unimportant job.After the success of the 2006 film ""Across the Universe"", Jim Sturgess seems to be increasing his credentials to his resume as desperate for money MIT student Ben Campbell who like every academic is trying to enroll at Harvard Medical School is willing to rake in the dough with the limit of $300,000 which is how much it is to get that prized scholarship. So then we have this formulaic theme as Ben becomes so good at the game that all his earning get taken away from him and the lesson that greed will get you nowhere.The other students under Mickey's guidance include Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth who co-starred with Spacey in ""Superman Returns"" and ""Beyond the Sea"") Choi (Aaron Yoo), Kianna (Liza Lapira) and Fisher (Jacob Pitts) their mathematical methods are honed by a systematical montage. They go through the tests and regiments and the strategy in how they're going to pull themselves through the tables. While this is proceeding, they have room for some romance, and their obsession for quick cash, intensity is in high gear and the not so glorious lifestyle of being wealthy. As sad as it seems, the supporting cast add very little significance to the story. Bosworth is just on for the cliche love interest and while the two token Asian performers are just stereotypical caricatures like a kleptomaniac.Though Spacey is convincing in another chilling performance and Sturgess handled the naive pretty boy role fittingly, however '21"" just has to spoon-feed us putting every piece of development right in front of us and all the essential plot twists are just a motion away and how the mathematical rouse is fully explained. If you think this will be an educational trick to learn from, don't be fooled. There's a myriad of mathematical know-it-all and the methodical practices are more complex than what is given to you. Maybe you'll be luckier on the slot machines.What was great about ""21"" was that it demonstrated just how crooked the Vegas tables really operate and how getting good grades are not the only requirements in getting a good education and that money and finance are the keys to your goals. And yes tuition is expensive and salaries increase every year, it's believable that students who aren't privileged will go through great lengths just to reach their goals educationally and financially.In the end, ""21"" succeeds in being an entertaining heist film and keeps itself as serious as it can be. And sure it's colourful like the average Hollywood film normally is, the cheaters never prosper moral message is pasted on the while time through. And that only the smart survive once the dust clears and that earning money is better than winning money.",21
64,pc95,"Pretty Good Story, but with bland support and poor middle",6,26 September 2009,"""21"" reportedly inspired by real events has pretty good pull and storyline. The leads in the movie of Sturgess and Kevin Spacey do a respectable job keeping the picture afloat. However (spoilers), the rest of the ""team"" and development for supporting actors is underdeveloped and unremarkable. They become cut-outs in the background - almost stick figures. Worst of all is Bosworth who may be a better actress than this role provides, but is utterly uninteresting and unbelievable as MIT brainiac, and playing the love-interest blandly. Lawrence Fishbourne in a guest-starring role gives the movie a bit of depth and validity while the finale scene(s) are foregone conclusions and predictable as are a lot of the happenings the simple drive of the story works and is entertaining. This is something akin to ""Rounders"" but not quite as good. The middle third or so of the movie feels empty nonetheless as edits show too many boring Vegas parties and lavishings devoid of meaning or fire. Finally The narration is satisfactory as well as the ending, so Overall mildly recommended if you like gambling.",21
65,bob-rutzel-1,"Did someone say, ""Deal?""",6,1 August 2008,"MIT professor Micky Rosa (Spacey) recruits some of the brightest minds there to help him take Las Vegas down by having these students count cards at the Blackjack tables. Counting cards is not illegal, but if caught there are consequences. This movie is based loosely on events that happened in the 1990s when MIT students took Las Vegas for millions by counting cards. The story here is fiction and goes to show how things might have been done.We knew what they were trying to do without understanding the mechanics of counting cards. And, we are left with Ben (Sturgess) getting greedy by gambling and not counting as per the system. So it turns into a story about some MIT students, greed, betrayal, and retaliation. There's a twist in here. Was there that twist back in the day when this all happened.? Probably not. Actually, the twist helps save the movie. How about that deal?The acting was fine by all, but I do not know why they bothered to have a love interest story too as there was no chemistry between Ben and Jill (Bosworth). Oh, it wasn't much but it was there. Wait a minutegood looking guy, good looking girlOh, I get it..Got to have it now.How, in real life, in the 1990s, were these students caught? Casino people kept seeing the same faces at the same Casinos over a period of time and put 2+2 together. No, this movie did not ""catch"" them that way. Usually, when a story is true we learn what happened to the participants at the end of the movie before the credits are run. There was nothing shown here along those lines. But then again, in real life, the students were rotated over the years so I guess that would be hard to do. In real life, there may not have been an MIT professor who managed and supervised the operation so it may have just been the students themselves. The students were told never to come back to Vegas or they would be prosecuted for trespassing. Did someone say ""DEAL?""If you take out the DVD, there is a Special Features section on it where the cast will explain Card-Counting. Good luck with that. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",21
66,MartianOctocretr5,Doubling-down on gambling movie clichés,6,16 May 2010,"Fairly entertaining, but you've seen all of this before. It's another story about people beating the powerful gambling houses in Las Vegas at their own game.The movie's line, ""It's counting, not gambling!"" should read, ""It's futility, not science."" The counting key cards idea is neither effective nor new. It's characterized here as being genius, which is almost laughable. Also, they use the old routine about gorilla-sized casino security guards watching everybody on video, standing by to beat somebody to a pulp. Like always, their leader is some demented head-basher. Then, when they actually chase somebody, there's maybe three guys (in a casino which would hire hundreds of people), and they always grab the wrong person, lol.Most of the cast overact somewhat, especially the lead who goes emo for no apparent reason. The lead couple have no chemistry. Kevin Spacey, as the unilateral demigod of the blackjack team is effective in his role, and Laurence Fishburne as the casino boss is suitably menacing. Many of the later twists can be seen from a hundred miles away, but two items might creep up unexpectedly. Some plot complications seem contrived. There seems to be a weak reference to gambling addiction or something; but it's not developed properly. It's used only as a cheap plot complication.Worth a watch if you have nothing else to do.",21
67,dunmore_ego,Counting to Dumb.,5,9 January 2009,"In this vacuous drama supposedly based on a true story, Old Hand (Kevin Spacey) teaches Teen Models (Kate Bosworth, Aaron Yoo, Liza Lapira, Jacob Pitts) to count cards and take on Vegas. Happens that Old Hand is college professor Micky Rosa, and his Teen Models are his students at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston. I don't doubt this may be a true story. That the characters displayed such stupidity, I do doubt.From a book by Ben Mezrich, Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions, 21 follows talented young M.I.T. student, Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess), struggling to pay fees for classes he can't afford. He is invited to join the covert team of Teen Model Card Sharks (who make us cringe with their Too-Kewl-For-Skool 'tudes) aiming to break Vegas.When the Teen Team recruit Ben, they speak like they're old hands at the Vegas scam, wowing him on how his lifestyle will change, yet when they gather in Vegas, Professor Micky lays down instructions like they've never been there before. I call this the Movie-Astronaut Rule: Always save the most crucial information on space travel for the actual journey, when the cameras are rolling. For the Ignint Audience.Two glaring loopholes in logic ruined this film: first, they have no fence. These are just college kids. When they come into large cash, how do they propose to launder it? Ben hides it in his dorm roof, but when he starts paying for that college he couldn't afford, the IRS is gonna rain down on him like a Vegas jackpot.Also, their attempts at discretion are ludicrous: they all arrive in Vegas at the same time, sometimes in asinine disguises, check into the same hotel together, go drinking together at strip clubs, constantly acknowledge each other and spend big in loud montages. Smart - but no Common Sense. Their fantastic ""secret signal"" (on whether a table is hot to hustle) is to fold their arms behind the chair. Nice for some podunk operation in Ohio - but this is Vegas! Sure enough, a sinister casino cop, Williams (a beefed-up Laurence Fishburne) notices the scam signals on these new inventions called Security Cameras, and uses the Bush Administration Interrogation Policy of ""America Doesn't Torture"" to torture some answers outa the dweebs. Williams, on Professor Micky's tail for years, now sees his opportunity to get Micky through his Teen Model stooges.In most scam movies, we marvel at the ingenuity of the criminals. In 21, we cringe every time these jokers are on screen. Spacey and Fishburne carry the movie on their shoulders alone, as every time we turn to the Teen Models, Sturgess is too busy looking like Tobey Macguire and Kate Bosworth is too busy pretending she's hot, and the movie falls flat.The attitude casinos have towards ""counting cards"" bugs the babyjesus out of me! In Blackjack or 21, everyone maintains counting cards is not illegal. So why do casinos allow any jackass to play the game except those who are exceptional at it, who can count the cards? Casinos will fleece anyone, but anyone who fleeces them - legally - is taken to a room with no windows to get the intelligence beaten out of them...Ben loses his mind over plain Bosworth and starts losing and drinking, and then defects from the Teen Team to scam solo. To stop Ben's stupidity leading up the chain to Micky himself, Micky grasses up Ben to the authorities - sadist Fishburne. He had every right to do this, as Ben was ""gambling not counting"" with Micky's outlay-money, so Micky cut him loose. It's a dog eat Teen Model world out there.However, Ben has one last con up his sleeve. He gives Speech Number 32 in the Generic Screenwriter Inspirational Speech Catalog (the ""Let's Do This One Last Time... For the Honor, For the Game... For The Boys"" speech) - and grasses up Micky to the Ethical Non-Torturing Fishburne, who proceeds to torture Micky.The twisted message 21 sends is that even though the Teens betrayed their mentor and he tried to protect himself, the Teens won by being even more unethical, amoral and underhanded. And they're justified because... well, because they're Teen Models fer cryin out loud.",21
68,KUAlum26,"Without ever having read the book,I can sense the egregious bastardization here",3,29 August 2008,"I don't recall where or when I heard about some MIT students who'd managed to make a killing counting Blackjack tables throughout Vegas and(I think it was also)Atlatnic City. I'm not even sure it was the book ""Bringing Down the House"" that was being discussed,but the story that 21 is based off of seemed pretty familiar to begin with. Off the top,the thought of a film on this subject populated by Kevin Spacey,Laurence Fishburne and a promising newcomer named Jim Sturgess seemed to have a lot of promise going for it.Alas,that was not the case.One of the cadre of problems I had(And I'm not alone,judging by the many comments and posts along this site) is that this is most certainly and inescapably a morality tale,established practically from the fifteen second mark of the trailer. The seduction of one Ben Campbell(Sturgess,who hopefully will get stronger material in the future)is a fairly plain one: he is,besides being an already gifted student excelling at MIT(of all places),he is a numbers whiz,whose prowess is noticed by a sharp,charismatic professor(Spacey,who's as crisp and interesting in the first half of the film as he is dull and one-dimensional in the second half),who draws him into his team of fellow math whizzes/grifters who routinely go to Sin City and work the Blackjack tables.The progression of events is pretty darned predictable,as young Ben is able to use his talents to become rich beyond his ambitions(he's of course,saving up for HArvard medical school),fall in love with a fellow student(Kate Bosworth,not very convincing here,but that might be how her part's written)and end up being the quarry of a wiry Casino security chief(LAurence Fishburne,one of the few things that didn't disappoint here)who's seen Ben and his gang there one too many times. Somehow and for some reason,the makers of this film(including director Robert Luketic,co-writers Allen GArfield and Peter Loeb)decided that to make this film would require making this sexier,sleeker,less steeped in such trivial things as veracity,thoroughness or realism. The end result is something that truly deserved a mid-winter release: full of star power,youth,sound,image,sex(restrained as it is)and at least two chase scenes but a very pedestrian story and payoff underneath. I originally considered seeing this on the big screen;now I'm not even sure if I should've paid money for it on DVD.",21
69,pyrocitor,Just as predictable yet enjoyable as the game depicted,7,2 April 2008,"Considering the risky pleasure generally associated with gambling and the seductive thrill of watching a heist or scam unfold, it should come as no surprise that 21, a film which combines the two aforementioned premises should excel at being enjoyable. And while the film may be very familiar ground to anyone with in any experience with Ocean's Eleven style crime capers, and the majority of the film's plot points verge on being almost laughably predictable, it is executed with enough exuberant flair to make it worthwhile in the midst of its formula. A slow start gives the necessary exposition as to how a thoroughly ethical young MIT student (Sturgess)'s desperate need for money to attend Harvard medical school leads him to join a team of mathematical geniuses trained in blackjack card counting who routinely rip off Las Vegas casinos during weekends between class. However, this opening proves overlong, overly predictable, and largely unnecessary, dragging far too much before plunging into the film's real fun as Sturgess and his team are engulfed by the seductive glamour of Vegas and the thrill of the huge monetary takes. Some judicious editing, clearing away such unnecessary subplots (such as a robotics competition with Sturgess' tiresomely stereotypical nerdy friends) could have resulted in a far more streamlined and faster paced film. Some viewers may take offence to the ""Hollywoodizing"" of the MIT team, with team members of different ethnicity largely shoved to the background in favour of the typically gorgeous Caucasian leads, a disconcertingly common practice in modern day cinema. However, the flashy MTV style cinematography and editing ably capture the engrossing spectacle of Vegas, and once the film gets going, it would be difficult to deny the sheer enjoyment of being swept up in the heady rush of quick wealth and all of its hedonistic trappings.The film's quality cast add credulity to the frequently underwritten characters they portray. Jim Sturgess once again impresses as the ethical math prodigy slowly corrupted by a world of superficial glamour, his endearing charm putting an intriguing enough take on the ""troubled but well meaning hero"" archetype. As one might expect, Kevin Spacey effortlessly steals the show as the charismatic but ruthless professor managing the MIT card counting team, and Spacey's easygoing yet commanding presence is a profound boost to the film. Kate Bosworth contributes a typically flat performance, but given her token 'inevitable love interest' role, she fails to detract much from the film's overall quality. Lawrence Fishburne adds class, much needed dramatic weight and moments of grim humour to his antagonistic burly head of casino security, gradually catching on to the MIT team's scamming.While the age old adage of 'style over substance' certainly holds true here, 21 may essentially epitomize the modern Hollywood crime caper film, but the formula hasn't quite run dry enough to overly detract from the enjoyment factor. The film's snappy visuals and strong casting are mostly enough to make up for a largely uninspired and frequently weak script. However, fans of similar works will not be disappointed, and for those willing to forgive the film's frequent delving into the wells of convention and accept entertainment over profundity, 21 should prove an ideal watch.-7/10",21
70,Sirus_the_Virus,21,10,24 August 2009,"21 stars young British star Jim Sturgess as M.I.T. student Ben Campbell, sort of a nerd but very smart. When professor Mickey Rosa(Kevin Spacey) looks at Ben's test scores, he introduces Ben to a card-counting group of students. Ben has a secret crush on one of them(Kate Bosworth). The gang travels to Vegas to play Black Jack. Ben decides to tag along only because he needs money to get into medical school. Everyone in the group gets fake I.D.'s and have to pretend not to know each other. The head of the casino surveillance is played by Laurence Fishburne. That whole medical school mumbo jumbo lasts until he realizes how great Vegas is. ""Greed is good"" is what Michael Douglas said in Wall Street. But when you see this film, you realize that being too greedy will come back to bite you in the ass. Greed is not good. 21 is based on a true story. So there really was some asshole professor that tried to mess up everybody's lives. 21 is great entertainment and incredibly entertaining. I surprisingly loved this film. Every one of the young actors and actresses does a good job. Laurence Fishburne is good and Kevin Spacey, as always, is great. The film does have a happy ending. We usually don't see many happy endings in films now days. Actually, that is sort of a lie. I advise that you go and buy this film. If you're expecting an extreme casino film, then don't watch this. It's from the director of Leagally Blonde for god sake. I think that you should see 21. Go and rent it. I did last year and absolutely loved it.21: ****/****",21
71,TheUnknown837-1,one tired old cliché after another in a movie that had me looking at my watch every ten minutes for the entirety of the second and third acts,3,18 December 2009,"""21"" is one of those movies where if you are only looking for an investment where all the dollar value was put into the visual presentation and not a dime was spent on the story, it's right up your alley. If you like movies that are eye-rolling in their idiocy but make up for it with oh-so-popular clichés, it will suit you, as it did the majority of my generation. But if you are like me, where you realize that the story and the integrity of a picture is most important, then ""21"" is nothing but sheer boredom. Just as a measure of my ennui, I didn't have high expectations, but I looked at my watch for the first time at the forty-five minute mark. And my eyes shot back there every ten minutes for the remaining one-point-two-five remaining hours of the film before the credits finally rolled and I unleashed a big sigh of relief. The torture was over.""21"" is also one of those movies that assumes that just because it's based on a true story that it's automatically going to be gripping. Well, documentaries are the same and I've seen some documentaries that were flat-out boring as well. It all depends on the quality. And in terms of its visual presentation, ""21"" works. But where it really counts, in the story, in the characters, in the timing, it falls before it even takes off. It's about a Harvard professor (Kevin Spacey) who enlists the top students in his classes to travel to Vegas for the weekends to ""count cards"" at the casinos and make millions. The latest recruit is a stereotypical dweeb well-played by Jim Sturgess who needs money to pay for tuition. And what follows is just one tired old cliché after another.There was hardly a moment in ""21"" that I could not predict. It's just the standard rise and fall story with the same old morals about pride and greed. Once again, we have the dweeb with talent but no money. Things go well at first, then he goes over his head, things go bad, his hot girlfriend gets ticked off at him, so on and so forth. I knew right off the bat the sort of mentor-student relationship that Spacey and Sturgess would have. I knew that Sturgess would have a pretty girl (Kate Bosworth) smiling at him from the corner of the screen. I knew there would be a moment where somebody just blows it andwell, you get my point.Most premises, even clichéd premises, can work out if they are done right. But ""21"" is not done right. The look of the picture is good, the directing is acceptable, the acting is quite good, but the story, the characters, the energy of the picture, the believability, it all just goes out the window, or should I say, into the card dealer's pocket. And it's our money they're snatching unfairly away from us. It's got the look of a professional picture, but is just as fun as watching a gambler's home videos. ""21"" is not a worthy investment.",21
72,jaredmobarak,Did that dazzle you?21,6,8 June 2008,"I wasn't averse to checking out this new film. That is until I started hearing all the bad press going around the circuit. So, with low expectations I finally took the opportunity to try it out and while there are definite problems, 21 is not too bad. Obvious and generic as far as story structure goes with a concept well known in America about beating the game of Blackjack, my main gripes were with the small stuff. What I found really working was the fun/entertainment factor. Even though I could guess how it would all turn out, the ride was a joy to partake in.We have our genius student who did everything right throughout his school career to get into Harvard Medical. What does this kid have to complain about, besides maybe the lack of a stimulating social life? Well how about the $300,000 tuition necessary to actually attend the school itself. Thankfully for Ben, an opportunity presents itself very early on in the application process, for a full scholarship, that could solve all his troubles. A whiz at numbers and pretty much everything to do with analytical thinking, Professor Rosa sees a younger version of himself in Ben, the perfect choice to lead his team of card counters in wiping Vegas clean. Not only does this proposition play on Ben's need for money, but it also gives him an excuse to get away from the dweeby friends and drab school life. Las Vegas was calling and he was ready to live for the first time in his life. I mean, without any consequencescounting cards is not illegalwhat did he have to lose? It turns out everything. I'm sure if you've seen the trailers at all you understand the magnitude of what happens in the ""backrooms"" of casinos, the place where those on the payroll inflict their own sort of justice. The thing about this film is that the moment when they experience what truly happens isn't until pretty much the end. We are allowed a nice exposition of how the team nurtures their new point-guard and gets him game ready. The relationships formed become stronger, the takes become bigger, and the theatrics more brazen. There is some nice movement in the shooting style, low angles, extreme close-ups of the signals, and nicely choreographed sequences with the cards flipping, giving a cursory introduction to the system being utilized. I really liked this aspect because it allowed me as the viewer to get a handle on what was going on. At first I was bored, hoping movie magic would gloss over the lesson, but in the end I am thankful for having watched it. All the process jargon is tempered with more humanistic moments to keep us grounded in the story too. Ben and Jill's friendship evolves; Ben begins to distance himself from the only two friends he had before his recruitment; Ben and ex-top dog on the team Fisher butt heads; and ""eye-in-the-sky"" Cole Williams watches everything from behind the scenes, looking for a huge bust in order to save his job from being replaced by computer facial recognition software.It's all by the books, our hero faces the challenge of stepping out of the villain's shadow and then giving a little pain back himself. We watch to see how it all turns out, no matter how obvious it will be. The scholarship meeting bookmarks help frame the story nicely, showing what it was all for$300,000 and he was out; sometimes it's not that easy. And because of that fact, the cast needed to be a good mix of personalities, all who could pass for geniuses and miscreants. Jim Sturgess has the exact unassuming charm needed to pull off the transformation from bookworm 4.0 student to the high-rolling playboy Ben becomes. He has an everyman quality about him perfect for us to put ourselves in his shoes and think whether we would have been able to resist temptation. The rest of the team is great as well with Aaron Yoo and Liza Lapira adding some humor, Jacob Pitts showing what fame and jealousy can do to your soul if not held in check, Kate Bosworth is solid as the love interest, and Josh Gad exudes soon to be millionaire dork with grace. The real surprise had to be Kevin Spacey though. I would have thought he'd chew as much scenery as possible and while he does overpower at times, the humor he portrays as a quick-witted professor and the glee when he gets to Vegas in the middle of the action really rings true for Rosa, as well as the serious times when his darkside comes out.Besides the generic Hollywood quality on display, the small things are what bugged me. Should they have as much as they did? Probably not, but nonetheless they nagged at me the entire time. One is Sturgess' bad American accent. It is weird because when he plays the role, it's hardly noticeable; however, during every instance of voice-over narration, it was as if he was reciting dictation in a class where he was learning to hide the British. Another example is in the casting of Ben's friends. These guys are the epitome of geek and yet they are with Sturgess, a guy that can pass for geek if necessary, sure, but do they have to stick him with these two guys? The juxtaposition is so broad that it just stuck out like a sore thumb. Sometimes bashing the audience over the head isn't the best way to go about your business. Otherwise, a good effort for a brainless popcorn flick. One could do a lot worse.",21
73,classicalsteve,MIT Student Genius Comes of Age in Vegas--Ocean's Eleven meets Rounders,9,23 August 2008,"Life experience versus book knowledge is at the heart of ""21"", which is apparently based on a true story. This perfectly enjoyable but somewhat fantastical film centers on a mathematics genius who climbs out of the womb of academia and into the fast lane of Sin City, via everyone's favorite Vegas game, Black Jack. Ben at first seems an unlikely candidate. At MIT, he has an IQ measured in light years, but he has about as much street smarts as Mister Rogers. Seems the last time he was outside of Boston was during a previous life. He hangs out with two similar like-geniuses who get A's in chemistry and physics and F's in sociability and charisma. They giggle at the local pub but have no idea how to approach any girls.But one of his professors, a conniving mathematics professor with ulterior motives, played with sly intelligence by the incomparable Kevin Spacey, detects the computer-in-tennis-shoes in one his classes. Spacey signs him on to an underground group of Black Jack players that make money for themselves and their mentor on weekends. And they return to Boston to their ""normal"" lives of students and professor. Much of the film flip-flops between the glitz of Vegas and the snow-clad streets of Boston, similar to Rounders where the poker playing world and the law school world are contrasted.Ben learns not only the subtleties of the game but also how to use his computer mind to discern when to bet high and when to lay low. The other members of the team act as scouts to determine which tables are ripe for action and those to be avoided. They wear disguises and use assumed names. The only thing that was a little hard to swallow was that when Ben gets to the table, he can't seem to lose. No matter how good a player may be at determining what cards have yet to be played, they don't always turn up the way you want. I might have wanted him to lose a little bit to differentiate when he won he big.Like Rounders, Ben is flying high. He is winning hundreds of thousands of dollars for himself and the team, and particularly Kevin Spacey. Until a savvy spotter (Laurence Fishburne) starts to see Ben a few times too many. And see him win one times to many. How this plays out is the best part of the film, with a good twist towards the end.Some have complained that the movie is predictable, but I found it a breath of fresh air when compared with most of the Hollywood sub-par Vegas fair being offered today. ""21"" is far better than the likes of the ridiculously silly movie ""Lucky You"". ""21"" is well-written, mostly believable, and with an outstanding performance by Jim Sturgess who carries the whole film much like Matt Damon in Rounders. Sure, maybe it follows the typical W form of story-telling a little too closely, but I was never bored and I was pleasantly surprised by the ending. Overall a winning hand, I mean film.",21
74,hall895,Entertaining but don't think too much,7,31 July 2010,"21 is a movie for which your level of enjoyment will probably depend on how much you actually think about the plot. In this case the less thinking you do the better. Thinking will make you realize very quickly that the film's central characters, reputed geniuses all, do a lot of very stupid things. So don't think about it. Just enjoy the movie for what it is. It's not a particularly smart movie but it is entertaining and sometimes that's enough.The movie is based on the true-life exploits of the MIT blackjack team. The movie veers quite a distance away from the actual true story but the basic premise remains the same. The two key characters here are Professor Micky Rosa, played by Kevin Spacey, who runs the team and new recruit Ben, played by Jim Sturgess, who joins the team to earn the money he needs for Harvard Med School. As soon as he has enough cash for his tuition Ben is out. At least that's the plan. But we know better than that. Once Ben gets sucked into the Vegas life he's not leaving. Unfortunately, and inevitably, things go awry. So then we get some twists and turns and drama as Ben tries to rescue the situation.As the movie plays out our team of math geniuses are basically begging to get caught. But if they're not going to face any potential consequences there's really no conflict, no drama, and ultimately no movie. So there's quite a bit of stupidity from the blackjack team. And that stupidity is not limited to their time spent in Vegas. So Ben, when you return to MIT with hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash where are you going to keep all that money? Oh dear, this will end badly. OK, some of the plot contrivances are a little hard to accept. But accept them you must for the movie to move forward. There's enough good here to make you look past the movie's flaws. Sturgess does well with the key role of Ben, creating a compelling and sympathetic character. Spacey is reliably excellent as always. Unfortunately nobody else in the cast adds much. As the required eye candy a film of this type demands Kate Bosworth's character of Jill disappoints. There's no spark, no personality there. When we first see her the MIT geeks build her up to be some sort of goddess but when we actually get to know her it's a letdown. None of the other blackjack team members make much of an impression at all. And in playing an old-school casino enforcer type Laurence Fishburne is little more than a cliché. But despite all that's wrong with it the movie still somehow succeeds. It's well-paced enough to hold your attention throughout. At times, especially in the end, things get a little convoluted but the story works. More or less. As a whole the movie is not quite winner winner chicken dinner but good enough.",21
75,jon.h.ochiai,Dazzle?,7,13 April 2008,"In ""21"" M.I.T. mathematics Professor Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey) and boy genius Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) discuss an intriguing mathematical paradox surrounding the game show ""Let's Make A Deal"". In the ""Let's Make A Deal"" scenario, the contestant is offered one of three doors. Behind one of the three doors is a trip to Hawaii. Behind the other two doors are two goats. After making a door selection, one of the two unselected doors is open to reveal a goat. Now the contestant is offered a chance to change his original selection. Ben says that it is incumbent to now select the other door. The point being, that when he originally made the choice, the probability of picking correctly was one third. Given this new information, the probability changed from one third to now a half. Still not intuitive to me, this is amazingly intriguing. The rest of Director Robert Luketic's ""21"" is not entirely intriguing, although it is entertaining for what it is. Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb's screenplay based on the book by Ben Mezrich, is a kinetic and over-the-top rites of passage tale involving our hero Ben, well played by Jim Sturgess. The over the top elements are chewed on by the performances of Kevin Spacey as Micky and Laurence Fishburne as old school casino surveillance expert Cole Williams.My bud John had read the book ""Bringing Down the House"", but told me that there was no Professor Ringleader character. So that is an interesting narrative choice by Steinfeld and Loeb. For the most part it works, as Spacey does his charismatic best, providing a visceral protagonist for Ben as he reclaims his soul. Ben (Sturgess) is a brilliant M.I.T. student, even for an M.I.T. student. Ben's future at Harvard Medical School relies upon him winning a prestigious scholarship of which he is one of 41 applicants. The dean challenges Ben, ""Dazzle me"" Micky (Spacey) acknowledging Ben's brilliance attempts to enroll Ben in his assembled team to win big at Blackjack in Las Vegas. Here Luketic bends over backwards to clarify that this innovative strategy is not ""card counting"". Oh, well. Circumstances mount, and Ben agrees to join the team which includes the beautiful and fetching Jill (smart and tough Kate Bosworth). Ben becomes a star, and predictably alienates his geek buddies Miles and Cam (believable Josh Gad and Sam Golzari), who were depending on his partnership for critical science competition. Ben is seduced by the dark side: money, sex, and power. He also falls for Jill. But the ride can't last foreverat least not in these kinds of stories. Betrayal and retribution eventually reign supreme. However, Jim Sturgess as Ben keeps ""21"" engaging. He's got a natural, smart, and edgy charisma which weathers most the narrative flat spots and formula.""21"" also has sense of corny justice and karma. In the end, Ben in his low key and confident way gets to ask, ""Did I dazzle you?"" ""21"" is not great cinema. But for what it isit is a smart and entertaining time at the movies.",21
76,Rogue-32,Doesn't even work as a fairytale,2,1 April 2008,"I was intrigued by the preview of 21 because I'm a sucker for films about gambling, and this is a film about gambling ~ it's the director/writers gambling with our intelligence, hoping we're completely devoid of brainpower, which would make us stupid enough to buy any of the claptrap we see on screen in this bonafide turkey.The beginning is good, it's only when the true fun should be starting - when Ben starts going to Vegas as part of the blackjack team headed by Micky (Kevin Spacey) - that the movie begins to seriously fall apart.Vegas is a huge town, with literally hundreds of casinos, but these clowns wind up going back to the SAME casino, over and over, using the SAME signals to one another (their ridiculous signal to indicate a hot table, for instance), until it's more than blatantly obvious to the security overseer, Laurence Fishburne, that these stooges are playing a very dangerous - and stupid - game.The story then continues on its deathtrail of stupidity, with the storyline and the characters' behavior becoming more and more ridiculous until Ben - duhhhh - loses Everything and has to - double duhhhh - find a way to outsmart Micky (a 2-year-old could outsmart this guy) and get his life back together. The way it's done is even stupider than what proceeds it, what with Ben luring Micky back to the SAME casino for one last shot at the Big Money. ""They'll know us there,"" Micky says, ""So we'll have to wear disguises."" Oh yeah, genius - a cowboy hat and fake mustache really make Spacey look like a totally different person (not), and even stupider --- they show up using the SAME signals that they've used all along; yes, these giboneys are that dumb.Then, to insult the audience even further, the writers tack on what they believe, in their deluded states, to be a double surprise ending. By this time, the only surprise is that anyone is still left in the movie theatre.",21
77,joebloggscity,An Entertaining look at the World of Blackjack players,6,13 April 2008,"Kevin Spacey has been a fine actor through his career with some stellar performances under his belt. In this movie he has decided to star in this adaption of a book based on a true story of a university mentor who takes a group of MIT maths prodigies to Vegas to make money big time. How do they do it? They are picking away at the weak point of BlackJack (""21"") by card counting.Basic story is that one graduate is desperate to fund his way through Harvard Med (not cheap!) and gets noticed by a university mentor (Spacey)for his arithmetic ability, so gets roped into the Blackjack group. They then go on romps to Vegas to cash in while they can, hammering away at the BlackJack tables.As per other films in a similar vein it follows standard certain routes: a will-they-won't-they with a good looking girl, jealousy from a fellow player, rise and fall of the whole plans, damage to previous friendship, being consumed by the money/lifestyle etc etc. Regardless, the story still comes together.Direction is pacey and the settings in Vegas are fun. The film is nothing special, and at heart is really a simple general feel good movie. An enjoyable romp and ride with a likable cast.",21
78,agmoldham,Check this out before going to the casino,6,10 August 2008,"I saw a television programme some time ago that told the story of the college campus kids that 'won' lots of money from Casinos around the world. This film is clearly based on this story although I do not know how much of the background story is true.The bizarre thing about the story is that even though the group are clearly highly intelligent the system is remarkably easy. It revolves around counting cards on a blackjack game and allocating points according to each of the cards that is dealt. Low cards are given -1, mid cards 0 and high cards are +1. Once the score rises to a certain figure the odds suddenly favour the player rather than the dealer. You aren't guaranteed to win each time, but if you only play at these points you will win over time.The film is about the relationships between the group and I cannot say how much of it is true, but it's a fairly entertaining couple of hours.",21

The main character of this movie can tell it very wellIt's a nice movie about this subject and it shows us the frightening world of Las Vegas casinos'. The plot is quite interesting and appealing and the cast is also good. I score it 7/10.",21
80,RonellSowes,Devoid of any verisimilitude or substantial entertainment,3,10 December 2020,"21 advertises itself as an account of real life events when it soars so high above fact it loses all resemblance to fact. The movie is based off the book Bringing Down The House which was a fictitious recount of the author's experiences. This should be obvious because as I mentioned before this isn't a film that depicts a group of proffesionals at work it's a dramatized story that is dimly derived from actual escapades...and a poor at that.
The only two well known(and somewhat talented) actors in this film are Laurence Fishburne and Kevin Spacey. Somehow the scenes involving Spacey play out better than those without him.21 holds neither any verisimilitude nor any substantial entertainment. It utterly fails at what it attempts to be and busts like an overplayed hand.",21
81,Carycomic,I have to agree with Max-787 on this one.,1,29 March 2008,"I went to see this movie, earlier this afternoon, because Kevin Spacey and Lawrence Fishburne were in it. And, any film in which they appear is pretty good, more often than not. This film, however, was one of the ""not's.""I mean; the premise was initially intriguing. And, some of the banter thrown about, by the various characters, was surprisingly somewhat funny! But, past the ninety-minute mark, I began to get bored. I actually ceased caring about Ben Campbell!His gradual transformation from ""the Anakin Skywalker of MIT"" to ""the Darth Vader of black-jack"" was so predictable, to describe the rest of the film as ""less-than-riveting"" would be putting it charitably. So, I walked out. Completely uninterested in knowing whether or not Ben got the girl and/or the Harvard medical scholarship. Nor will I waste any money on the eventual DVD to find out.In short: the early promise shown by this movie gets broken really fast. And, not even Messrs. Spacey and Fishburne can change that.",21
82,DonFishies,A shoddy script and terrible characterization make 21 barely watchable,4,12 August 2008,"Ben (Jim Sturgess) is a math whiz-kid at MIT. He dreams of going to Harvard Med School, has the grades and the acceptance, but has nowhere near enough money to put himself through it. Enter Professor Mickey Rosa (Kevin Spacey), who takes a shining to the kid after a rather brilliant mathematics discussion during a class. As it turns out, Rosa is running a blackjack counting group who goes to Vegas on weekends and make tons of money.Obviously, we know as an audience that this can lead to no good, but are taken along for the adventure anyway. Unfortunately, the ride does not last very long.What plagues 21 incessantly is its wanton desire to be a more complicated and intricate movie than it is. Yes, it does deal with a lot of intense mathematical equations, but it never tries asking the audience to answer them. It does give us a rather lengthy montage as to how this team works (using hand gestures and certain words in phrases), and then tells us again when anyone mentions one of these words. It almost gets to the point where the filmmakers begin beating the audience over the head with these simple words (such as ""eggs"" and ""sweet"") that we wonder if they had any subtle notions over their subject matter. We see the varying hand gestures multiple times too, but at least they blend in a lot better than a blatant cut to that specific scene in the original montage.The story itself is a bit of a mess in that it plays out almost frame for frame like any other film with a young person looking to make money the quickest way they can (with an interesting, little-seen twist nevertheless), right down to the supportive mother and neglected friends. And after seeing movies like Martin Scorsese's lengthy epic Casino and the small Canadian film The Last Casino (based off the same material as 21, but somehow ended up being a smoother and more interesting film), you can tell exactly where this film is going to end up by its last frame. Hell, Lawrence Fishburne shows up for less than thirty minutes of screen time, and right after he starts talking, predictability more than just sets in. It gets comfy and makes you feel stupid for even attempting to give this movie a shot.And because it is so predictable, the movie becomes boring quickly. Seeing the same montages over and over again becomes tedious, and watching these characters move to their eventual ending is almost painful. But the film drags its heels for every minute of its just over two hour run time, and rather than try and attempt to make the film interesting, everything thrown in just makes it more dull and repetitive.The characters are not much of a help here either. The main character has his motivations for joining the club, but we are never given any sort of indication why any of the other group members are there. Jill (Kate Bosworth) is the supposed sexpot goddess of Ben's dreams, Fisher (Jacob Pitts) is the has been of the group who has a grudge against Ben, and Kianna (Liza Lapira) and Choi (Aaron Yoo) are there simply as glorified seat fillers. Those two do the majority of the hand signaling, and just about nothing else (Choi has a bizarre, albeit useless, subplot where he steals bottles of booze and cheap hotel room pens). Jill and Fisher serve their purposes, and then spend the rest of the movie in a daze, basically going through the motions right up to their character's final moment on screen. I realize this story was based off a book, which in turn was based off a true story, but there has got to have been more to these characters than these simplistic cut outs.Sturgess, in his first truly lead role (Across the Universe was an ensemble to its very core), is weak as Ben. We can see him struggling to hold the picture together from the start, and he does not get much better as the film goes on. I think it could have been significantly stronger without his continuous narration, but even without it, Sturgess just looks uncomfortable with what he is doing, and almost looks out of place. I can understand that Julie Taymor's uniquely flawed musical opened a lot of doors for him, but this is one he should have either missed entirely, or trained up for a little bit better.Out of the supporting cast of young people, Bosworth is the only one who really gets a chance to shine, and she does a fairly lousy job of it. As said previously, she plays the supposed sexpot goddess, and she does that. But only, that. She never makes any attempts at giving the character something interesting to do besides watch Ben, and gives even less of a reason for Ben to be so infatuated with her.Spacey and Fishburne on the other hand, appear to be enjoying themselves as they chew scenery literally limb from limb. This is clearly not their best work, but their roles allow them the space to give their characters a certain finesse and originality that this script clearly made no mention of having. If only they could have rubbed some of their talent off on these young actors, we could have truly had a watchable movie on our hands.Even with an interesting concept, 21 managed to entertain very little, and frustrate even more. Even with great performances from two seasoned character actors, there is no saving this film from its shoddy acting, and even worse storyline. A solid polish, and less feeling like those that have come before it, could have only made this film worthwhile.4/10.",21
83,nathanmanson,Why so many negative reviews,8,22 February 2021,"I wasn't expecting much because of the bad reviews but I was very much surprised. Kevin spacey was incredible as always. There was definitely a few cliches in there but nothing to serious to mark it down on. Great film with a great ending, you seriously can't complain.",21
84,rajdoctor,21,6,30 June 2008,"When I saw the trailers, I got interested in seeing the movie. I found the concept quite good. I read its reviews in the Amsterdam Weekly, which were not so great, so I was in two minds  but still decided to go and see the movie. The story is based on true event.Ben Campbell (Jim Strugess) is brilliant in his academics, and aspires to be at the Harvard Medical School, but does not have USD 300K for fees. Prof. Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey) comes to Ben's rescue when he knows Ben's expertise with numbers. Micky picks Ben along with a team of four other students. He trains them to master the computations that would surely help win the game of Black Jack at the Las Vegas casinos. Things work in the beginning, but once Ben makes an error and looses money, Micky abondons the team. Ben and the team try out things on their own, but Casino Manager - Cole Williams (Lawrence Fishburne) finds out the trick and beats Ben up. Micky takes away all Ben's savings, de-grades him in his classes. Ben without any choice  approaches Micky to join hands for one last time and have a BIG go to get back the lost money. Micky agrees and the rest forms the end of the movie. Will they succeed? The movie has an interesting premise. Ben Campbell though has acted well, does not fill life and soul into the role, nor does his chemistry work with the heroine of the movie Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth). Whenever Kevin Spacey or Lawrence Fishburne are on the screen, the story becomes more intense. So there is a patchiness in the way the story moves  with jerks of interest and boredom. But in the last twenty minutes the movie catches up with the missed opportunities and finally I felt quite okay and satisfied with the movie.Australian born young director Robert Luketic does a decent job in the movie. I think a bit of good editing could have reduced the time by 15-20 minutes.I think this movie would be liked and enjoyed by school and college going students more, as there are sub-plots, topics of money and images that might interest them.Overall above average 6.25 rating out of 10.",21

Imagino que esperan que solo vean la película gente muy tonta. Eso dice mucho de la misma.¿Qué tiene ritmo? Sí, pero uno llega a preguntarse, ¿pero con lo listos que sois no os dais cuenta de que os van a pillar? Hombre cambia las señales ¿no?Me gustan los actores, están muy bien.

No llega a ser buena, pero al menos es bonita.Con esas localizaciones, la verdad es que es una pena que esta tan
desaprovechada. Podría a ver hecho unos planos preciosos y a ver narrado la película a base de planos, pero como no, no sabe hacerlo. Al menos no aburre, hasta el final claro.Bueno pasa un buen rato y a otra cosa.The truth is that it was to be expected, but it is a pity. When the movie starts with those spectacular credit titles and then the movie starts and it becomes a movie to use and ends fatalWorst of all is that rule that is being imposed for a few years here, that at the end of the film you have to explain things. I imagine they expect only the movie to see very silly people. That says a lot about it.What has rhythm? Yes, but one gets to wonder, but with how smart you are you do not realize that they are going to catch you? Man changes the signals, right?I like the actors, they are very good. But for what it servesThis movie reminds me of that you are you and your circumstance. I say it for the clear romance.It has a nice lighting. It does not become good, but at least it's pretty.With these locations, the truth is that it is a pity that it is so wasted.

Based on a book that is based on true facts this film displays another side to the story of six students that worked together to ""bring the house down"", to play the casino to the point of coming away with big money.The film runs like any average film. A short bit is dedicated to lay out the character definitions and when that has been done well enough the actual story starts. The main bulk of the film is done quite nicely too. Nothing too fancy or too good, but good enough for cinema. The actual card playing is made interesting by displaying the thoughts of the main character together with his reasoning and there's a fair bit of action sequences added as well to make it even more interesting.I can't comment on how true the film is to the book as I've never read that, nor can I comment on how true it is to reality as I don't know the facts.

87,FilmFanInTheHouse,Best thing to do is sit and enjoy the characters in their environments.,7,28 January 2009,"21 (2008, Dir. Robert Luketic)In order to be accepted into Harvard School of Medicine, Ben Campbell (Sturgess) will have to save $300,000 for the course. Only problem about this is the Ben can't get this amount of money. After being impressed by his skills in his Math's lesson, Prof. Micky Rosa (Spacey) invites Ben to become a member of a small group; a group who are planning to walk out of Vegas with millions, thanks to Ben's card counting. There are certain things about '21' which would attract audiences towards it, as well as certain things which would put others off. '21' is not an action film, nor is it a horror; it is in fact a drama. Some audiences would consider a drama boring, but is this drama boring? Not at all! Firstly, '21', does contain a small, yet great ensemble cast. Relatively unknown British actor Jim Sturgess heads the pack, which includes a small number of known stars. Kate Bosworth, who is much better in this than her recent performance in Superman Returns, provides the romance of the story. Whilst not a household name, Aaron Yoo is starting to build up a steady fan base, since starring in Disturbia, and clearly has fun playing Choi in this. The problem with any scene involving Yoo, is that you will always need to be watching him. Whether it's slipping a bottle into a bag or making a quick quip, Yoo is someone you need to be watching. Rounding off the group are Liza Lapira, Jacob Pitts and the always awesome Kevin Spacey. Like every other role he has, Spacey is a joy to watch and makes the film even more enjoyable. Another high profile name featured in 21, yet not with the ""heroes"", is Laurence Fishburne, who like Spacey, is always wonderful to watch. The majority of the film is based mostly on the actual game playing, but it is filmed in a way which prevents it from being boring. Watching the techniques and interaction between characters make an interesting watch, as you wonder how far they will get before they are caught. 21 isn't completely perfect however. In particularly, remembering the rules to the actual game can be a struggle. As well as remembering the rules, you also have to remember the signals that characters have to give. Picking up the signals can be fairly easy, but if you have no interest in blackjack and similar casino games, then there's a possible struggle to keep hold of the rules. Best thing to do is sit and enjoy the characters in their environments.I think he's gonna be ready for our little trial run tomorrow.  Prof. Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey)",21
88,CinematicInceptions,Mediocre.,6,19 March 2018,"This is a movie that tries to act smarter than it is. It exists in a world that is inherently intelligent, since counting cards clearly takes skill and innate talent. The card counting is shown in a way that makes it so that the audience understands what is going on, but doesn't have to actually learn the skill of card-counting for themselves, which is definitely good. The characters also go to MIT, which is obviously a place that takes crazy intelligence to get into. So, basically this world should be intelligent. But at its core, it really isn't. There aren't plot holes per se, but the characters definitely miss things that they shouldn't miss. Given everything that is shown about Mickey before the climax indicates that he should really have been too smart to accept Ben's proposal. I really think he would have smelt a rat and not taken the bait. The minor team members, including Jill, didn't give the impression that they had an MIT level of intelligence. I can't think of a specific example, but just the way that they characters interacted with each other and particularly the content of their arguments was not as intelligent as it should have logically been. Yes, having a great mind for engineering does not necessarily mean that you can argue well with someone, but it does often come with a level of perceptiveness and logical acuity that is lacking in the characters here. Not every movie has to be that smart, some shouldn't be, but this was a movie that should have. The main issue was that it started off with things like the game show host scenario in Mickey's class, and then ended with a Guy Ritchie-style reveal that just felt cheap.The plus side of the movie is that it's somewhat entertaining and has a good, cinematically appealing subject matter. I mean, when you're doing something as cool as cheating the casino system, there's only so bad your movie can be. There's also some standardly cool camera/editing techniques in the casino scenes that are cool. It's also decently paced and keeps you interested in what will happen next.However, the protagonist, Ben, is pretty flat. He's kind of like an action hero in that the stuff he does is cool and he has mad skills, but as a character, there's not much there. Despite what he says in the ending monologue, there isn't really that big of a change that he goes through from the beginning to the end. Yes, he learns to have fun and gains confidence as he learns how skillful of a card shark he can be, but he really doesn't learn anything in the end. Jill is about as standard and flat of a female lead as there is. Mickey is really only a decent character because he's played by Kevin Spacey (yeah, I've heard what he did, but the guy's a heck of an actor). The other parts are similarly unremarkable, including Lawrence Fishburne. The only character that I actually liked was Miles, Josh Gad's comic relief character.Overall, it isn't bad, but it's really nothing special despite what it may try to fool you into thinking. It will keep you entertained for two hours, but you'll probably forget it soon afterward. One final bone to pick, there really didn't have to be as many scenes in the strip club as there were, especially in a PG-13 movie. Basically, my main problem with the movie is that it could have been much better given the subject matter and the world that was created in it. So watch it if you want, but don't expect anything on an Ocean's Eleven level. Overall Rating: 6.9/10.",21

Only for the terminably bored,2,14 May 2010,"Are we allowed to write reviews of films which became so mind-numbingly dull and predictable that we didn't even watch until the end? I don't know. Perhaps someone from IMDb should publish a definitive protocol. But 21 was just such a film. I didn't actually walk out of the cinema early because I was at home watching it on DVD. But I really had neither the patience nor the heart to carry on with this formulaic drivel. Yes, I know that the US market it so big that even drivel can recoup its costs and then - hopefully - some. But don't be fooled. If you are inclined to prefer safe, boring, predictable films with the usual content, the usual characters, the usual 'dilemmas', the usual dialogue, the usual clichés, the usual plots and the usual plot devices, this is for you. Otherwise save your money, whether this is showing at you nearest fleapit or 'on offer' at your local supermarket. Save your money and buy a decent DVD instead. Incidentally, Kevin Spacey, rather good in The Usual Suspects and Beyond The Sea, has a habit of picking the occasional clunker. So don't even bother because our Kev is involved.

90,dead47548,Massively entertaining.,4,31 March 2008,"It doesn't aim to be anything incredible and just allows itself to be a lot of fun with a great cast. Jim Sturgess again shows some great talent as the film showcases his naturalism and diversity. He does a superb job of leading the story and is really proving to be a true rising star. Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne are great to watch as the veterans of the film whose pasts lead to some twists and turns at the end that I really didn't see coming. But neither overstep their parts like some big stars do in supporting roles; they let Sturgess make the film the entertaining up-and-down story that it is. Kate Bosworth is incredibly sexy in a rather underwritten role. In a small role, Aaron Yoo again delivers a hilarious performance as he did in last year's Disturbia. It's a little too long and I didn't really buy the fact that everything works out so well in the end, but overall it's just an enjoyable little film that demonstrates the strong talent of a great young actor.",21
91,JustCuriosity,"Good, but not Great",7,9 March 2008,"This film screened at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX. It is a reasonable well-made based-on-a-true-story film that tells the story of a group of MIT students who attempt to make a fortune counting cards in Vegas. The screenplay apparently plays pretty fast-and-loose with the version told in the book. Never-the-less, the acting is excellent - especially Jim Sturgess in the role of the lead student. Honestly, his accent was so good that I didn't realize - until he came on stage afterward - that he was British. He does a great job with the mannerisms to give you a real sense of the character's evolution. Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne are solid - although Fishburne's role is fairly small. The minor characters are not as well-developed as they could have been. The cinematography of both Boston and Las Vegas is quite good, especially on the big screen. It's an interesting story, but they could have edited down a bit to make it move a little quicker. This is a good film, but it probably could have been a lot better.",21
92,gary-444,"Enjoyable, slick and intelligent.",7,20 April 2008,"Whilst knowing broadly the story on which this film is based, I hadn't read the book, nor am I a gambling expert. My wife, who watched it with me, has never stepped inside a casino. Despite all this lack of inside knowledge, we were both royally entertained for two hours.The minimum of profanity, the sharpness of the script, and the lavish production values made this an unusually enjoyable tale. I can live with a bit of ""bad guy"" violence and the obligatory chase scene as they did add some spice to proceedings.Jim Sturgess is a competent male lead, carrying the part of Ben Campbell well, part geek,part super -smart con man.Kate Bosworth as love interest Jill Taylor convinces as both equally smart, and drop dead gorgeous. The imperious Kevin Spacey dominates each scene in which he is in.The film is not without its flaws, the nerdy comedy duo best friends of Ben are formula writing at its most basic, and several roles (Bens mother and the ""Loss Prevention"" Casino Team)are caricatures.Also, the background music at the start is mystifyingly loud and anonymous with no attempt to contemporise the story with a period soundtrack.However, the film is well acted, pacey after an inevitably slow scene setting start, and lavish on the eye with some glamorous Las Vegas sets, and some hedonistic living.Accepting it as a story, rather than a documentary is the key to enjoying this film. Critics seem to focus on what it might have been, pleasure comes from enjoying it for what it is.",21
93,barrys82,Worth to watch,8,3 July 2008,"21 is a movie that will catch you from the very beginning, in my opinion it has everything a movie needs to enjoy and entertain. Its a very well developed drama with some moments of adventure and with the necessary amount of humor. It has a really quick rhythm causing the movie to never fall down and get tiresome. With a very interesting and original story based on actual events, about Ben Campbell is a shy, brilliant M.I.T. student who--needing to pay school tuition--finds the answers in the cards. He is recruited to join a group of the school's most gifted students that heads to Vegas every weekend armed with fake identities and the know-how to turn the odds at blackjack in their favor. It has a very good cast, beginning with Kevin Spacey in the role of Micky Rosa, an ironic and greedy math professor, his performance is almost brilliant, Lawrence Fishburne as the casino's guard is excellent as always in his acting, Jim Sturgess is convincing enough, he really makes you to believe him in this role and Kate Bosworth was also very good. In conclusion, this is a movie worth to watch and very recommendable.",21
94,Hunky Stud,"i am shocked by this racist practice, not based on a true story!",1,14 April 2016,"when I saw the film, I thought that it was just another average caucasian film, it has so many white characters in it which is so typical for most Hollywood films. the last memorable mostly Asian film that i saw was : Joy Luck Club, which was so long ago. often times, people say that Hollywood doesn't have many films that are suitable for Asian American actors, because most roles are for white people. there are hardly any Asian children in the USA that have dreams of becoming big actors, because they never see any famous big Asian actors as their role models. when i saw the film, i only knew that it was based on ""a true story"". i thought that it was some smart white students from mit who did it. I just found out that this film was actually based on some real Asian students from MIT. it could be a good positive film to represent Asian people in the USA. i am shocked that i was fooled by this so-called ""true story"" which wasn't true at all. this film could be one of the few rare films that actually have plenty of roles for Asian American actors. the producers and director chose to discriminate against Asian American actors, did the wrong thing by hiring white actors. no matter how they explain it, what they did is totally racist. and the protagonist wasn't even a US citizen, he is a foreigner. why do Hollywood hire foreigners who have to fake US accent when there are plenty of Asian American actors who speak perfect English.black people boycotted 2016 Oscar because it has no black nominations. some Asian American actors might have won an Oscar if they were given the chance to play a role in this film.",21

Its a group of people who are in Vegas and playing to win - via card counting. Illegal by Casino rules, but it is practiced at times nonetheless.Spacey trains a group of students to bring down the 'house' in Vegas with this scheme. So he takes them there - all the while getting the students off at the university and giving them automatic grades. But if you cross Keving SPacey, things can get ugly.This film has three different mini-plots in the film. And they are weaved together in a very good way.

97,eshwarmail,Doing anything else would be more fun,3,8 January 2017,"Reviewed November 2011Winner winner chicken dinner, a lot of cheese dripping all over. Featuring good looking leads, a real big mentor and a simple script that may not go too wrong. The director messed everything up spectacularly. Trying to pull in every known stereotype attached to the game and genre, way too long in duration and he may better end up being known as the director who brought the worst in Spacey. Features a typical brilliant boy (Jim Sturgess), with an ordinary life and in need of money/scholarship to get into Harvard Medical school. He realizes his scholarship is in jeopardy and at the same time gets noticed by a shrewd professor (Kevin Spacey) who offers him a spot in his team that specializes in counting cards to beat the dealer in Blackjack. He accepts the offer for two reasons. 1) As a means to an end. 2) His long time crush Jill (Kate Bosworth) is in the team. Finally he ends up getting sucked by the glitz, glamour and easy money of Las Vegas. How he gets his act together comprises the rest of the story. Extremely cheesy with enormous number of redundant scenes featuring characters that are mere caricatures. Cinematography is good, background score is peppy, editing is slick and the lead character is believable. Kevin Spacey has given the worst performance I have seen of him and was a total letdown. They could've added a little more fun while presenting the Blackjack games than just the calculations in the minds of the geniuses that we should imagine. I was a bit disconnected with that.I could not think of any recommendation like 'Watch it only if ...'.. nothing comes to mind. Just drop it. It's easy and more fun.",21
98,rlaine,"Smart subject, dumb movie",3,2 November 2009,"Kevin Spacey, IMDb average score of 6,8 and a subject involving smarter-than-usual people doing some gambling mathematics sounds like a good movie. And was I fooled.The story starts out fairly nice, Massachusetts and the university locations are nice to look at and the basic setup of using your special brain skills to make you rich is intriguing.Only, little by little I noticed that all the interesting stuff is left to the minimum. Secret signs, the actual card counting and mathematics, fooling the cameras, face recognition. There was so much to play with, but the movie was basically all about loosing yourself to money and hi-life. Your regular ""too much, too fast"" story we get to read about up and coming film stars and musicians alike.To me this just doesn't quite match up. At times it was like watching Britney Spears with an IQ of 160. Still, somehow, the story managed to be very predictable until maybe the very end.I think the biggest let down here was, that I was actually looking forward to a smart movie that provokes some brain activity, but it was a simple popcorn movie afterall.",21
99,shadowman123,"A highly charged , entertaining flick!",8,20 May 2008,"21 tells the story of several students from MIT who go to Vegas and make a killing through counting cards which is legal. Anybody who is strapped for cash and is a bit of a wheeler-dealer should check this movie out. Right from the start 21 wastes no time with getting straight into the action , it sets the scene in a great way which makes you really feel for main characters and their reasons for doing this. The laughs were plenty and the movie rolled enough at a fast enough pace for you to catch up on everything. My only problem was that it felt like a typical Hollywood movie put together with glitz and light and had a typical formula ending but having said that it made up for it with its high on entertainment value. Another thing which I find a little offensive to a degree was that the real MIT was actually a group of Asian students and really made me wonder how actuate the story truly was although it was inspired by true events. To conclude 21 , was a highly entertaining flick which gave us a brief insight into how to the game of cards and also told a highly entertaining story , defiantly worth checking out.21 - 8.3 OUT OF 10WINNER WINNER..CHICKEN DINNER !!",21
100,pkzeewiz,"Interesting the first time, boring the second!",4,4 April 2010,"This is my second time viewing this and I enjoyed it and was on the edge of my seat the first time, but here on my second I saw this movie had nothing but a good story thats no fun to hear twice.This movie is based on true events and the screenwriters adapted the film from Ben Mezrichs book 'Bringing down the house: The Story Of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas For Millions'. The book was also used for a movie from 1994 called The Last Casino.The title of the book tells the story well enough but I will elaborate..A boy who's extremely smart gets sucked in by a teacher who knows the kid will be good with numbers and counting cards. The teacher has a few other students and he takes them to Vegas and they count cards and win millions of dollars. It's not as easy as it all sounds and they have a good system working together and they have casino guards constantly trying to catch them.Not only is main character Ben realizing that life can be fun and that he might be letting his dreams slip, he is also finding he's losing his friends and changing from what he wants to be.The real story is about some Asian kids at M.I.T. but here its mostly played by white kids. The actors were okay. Jim Sturgess was brought to my attention first in the wonderful Across The Universe movie and Jim did a wonderful job, it's one reason I picked 21 up to begin with. He is English and his voice coach did a wonderful job teaching him to speak more American. I am a huge fan of Kevin Spacey and usually think he chooses great roles. Laurence Fishburn is so so too, and I like seeing him as a bad guy in a co-staring role, never liked him in large doses so here he is fine. I do however want to point out I hate the Asian kid Aaron Yoo, he plays the same guy in every movie and is rather annoying. Josh Gad is another young actor I want to see less of, he's always playing the fat cliché geek friend in these movies and just does a horrible job.This movie is okay, I wont lie and put it down, because I did enjoy it the first time, I will say all and all it's a nice little film...It's neither great or horrible..its average...worth a watch.. 4 out of 10 stars",21
101,jemps918,Great soundtrack!,8,18 May 2008,"The soundtrack is pretty darn good! And yes, the movie is entertaining, too. But Young Folks by Peter, Bjorn and John, You Can't Always Get What You Want by The Rolling Stones (Re-Mixed), and L.S.F. (Lost Souls Forever) by Mark Ronson featuring Kasabian definitely add to the overall appeal of 21, along with other amazing tracks.Jim Sturgess (Across the Universe) is terrific as MIT geek Ben Campbell desperate for a Harvard Med scholarship. He gets chosen to join the underground elite team of blackjack-playing smarties after impressing his non-linear equations prof Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey). Beauty and brains Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth) can't help but fall for Ben, who is not only achingly cute, but can also impressively do the math. Trouble ensues when casino consultant Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne) gets suspicious.Directed by Robert Luketic (Legally Blonde), 21 is said to deviate a lot from the book Bringing Down the House on which it is based, but effectively tells a proper story nonetheless. Aside from another white guy, the rest of the crew is Asian American (Korean and Filipino). However, the real Ben Campbell is Jeffrey Ma (who has a bit part as Planet Hollywood Dealer Jeff), and the rest of the real characters are mostly of Asian descent, too. But this is still a Hollywood flick, after all, so this product must be sold in the way producers (which includes Spacey) see fit.",21
102,joemamaohio,My Review,7,16 July 2008,"""21"" is the true story of Jeff Ma (who also has a small cameo in the film) - who is called Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) in the film, a kid who's incredibly intelligent with regards to numbers, and is recruited by an overzealous college professor (Kevin Spacey) to join an underground group of students who count cards and go to Vegas on the weekends to win at the Blackjack tables.Ben's in the club just so he can get enough money to go to Harvard Med, but as the money piles up, he begins to fall into the trap of greed. He thinks he can do no wrong, and he becomes overconfident and arrogant - forsaking his old friends, without a fear of repercussion.However, unbeknownst to Ben, he's being watched by Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne), who works for the casino to weed out card counters. As Ben becomes more and more arrogant, he becomes more and more suspicious to Cole, and suddenly Ben's luck runs out in many areas of his life.With a blend of great actors, great story and awesome scenery, ""21"" delivers the drama with impeccable timing, and is well worth the time to see the film!",21
103,saytosandeep,MY REVIEW: An Easy Number Game!!,7,15 March 2014,21. It is the fact-based story about six MIT students who were trained to become experts in card counting and subsequently took Vegas casinos for millions in winnings. First lack of money drives characters to do something insane and then abundance of money make them insane. Genius and selfish Professor Mickey played by master actor Kevin Spacey and simple sober smart student played by Jim Sturgess both are the strength of the movie. Supporting actors also do OK. Movie aimed at youthful emotions in an easy ride never getting dark or overly emotional. The big guy Laurence Fishburne playing the spoiler in the otherwise a foolproof plan makes his character quite enjoyable. I am going with strong 7 out of 10 for 21. If you want to enjoy an easy ride which does require your mind to read the game then 21 is right one.,21

Seen it, done it, lets move on shall we, please?Ah... But hold your horses, there Chief!

This brings us to ""21"".I thought ""21"" was just a fabulous, unpretentious, piece of entertainment. Nothing more and nothing less. It has a young, attractive cast (Jim Sturgess and Kate Bosworth are, frankly, too beautiful to live), the gravity of experienced hands (devious Kevin Spacey and granite-like Laurence Fishburne), a cracking soundtrack (horrible remix of the Stones' ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" aside) and, lest I forget to mention it, the backdrop of Las Vegas looks amazing.So, clichés aside, I really enjoyed ""21"".",21
105,mr_popcorn,"McCheesy's take on ""21""",6,28 May 2008,"'m not really a fan of the game Blackjack or any of those card games (with the exception of poker) so I had some problems going into this film. Will I understand the film with all the Blackjack thing going on? Add to that the card counting and stuff? Well, it turns out it wasn't a problem after all. They somehow managed to explain the card counting bit but no worries because you can still understand the film even if you don't know Blackjack.Jim Sturgess, an up and coming young star, stars as MIT student Ben Campbell. He is persuaded by his teacher Micky Rosa (Spacey) to join a team of card-counting MIT misfits so he can pay off his Harvard Med plans. Kate Bosworth and Laurence Fishburne co-stars.The script, directing, acting, cinematography, editing, the casino scenes, the laugh-out-loud scenes, the Kevin Spacey scenes: its all good. Laurence Fishburne as an old-school Vegas thug was so badass, he will go down in the ""2008's Badass in Films"" list.",21
106,screenwriter-14,"""Tell me Professor, did I dazzle you???""",10,4 May 2008,"21 feels more like a dramedy, than pure drama, but what a fast paced and exciting film with a solid cast and writing. Kevin Spacey is in top form with biting dialog as a cynical Harvard Professor, bored by his career, but brilliant enough to captivate a group of students out for adventure and gain. Jim Sturgess from ACROSS THE UNIVERSE continues to dazzle an audience and is completely believable here in this film as a Harvard student on the precipice of a brilliant chance for Harvard Medical School, and the lovely Kate Bosworth adds to the mix of glam and love. The diversity of cast in 21 makes the film such an interesting mix of characters and the fantastic Lawrence Fishburne brings a tower of strength to a character in 21 that is more than enough of a challenge to ""Spacey & Co."". Really loved this film on many levels.",21

108,Siamois,Decent drama neglects its core subject...,5,22 August 2008,"First, lets get the obvious out of the way: several people have noticed they have ""seen this movie before"". Indeed, a small budget Canadian movie called ""The Last Casino"" was released a few years before this one, with much of the same plot. But 21 is not a ""ripoff"" of The Last Casino. As a matter of fact, both appear to be based on a book called ""Bringing Down the House"" although only 21 properly credits the book. It would thus appear that it's the Last Casino which is technically the ripoff. I have seen both movies but it's been a long time since I saw Last Casino and will not compare them here.Now that this is cleared, it's time to look at 21 on its own merits, which are unfortunately few. The movie is competently directed, rather luscious and features a pretty impressive cast. The premise is rather interesting and Jim Sturgess, whom I had never noticed before, pulls an engrossing lead performance as Ben Campbell, a poor but extremely promising young man looking for a way ($$$) to get to Harvard. He gets the opportunity of a life time when a group of students led by a teacher offer him to be in on a counting card scheme to ""beat the system"" and get rich quick. Naturally, Ben is portrayed as a decent guy who becomes conflicted between following the straight path or becoming caught in the high life of Vegas and quick bucks, not to mention his feelings for one of his partners in crime. And the script flows smoothly and the frames are pretty and everything is hip... but there are problems with the movies nonetheless and they start with expectations one might have.The movie is called 21 and the entire plot capsule revolves around Blackjack and casinos... yet you never get much of a feel for the game. It's brushed off by a script and direction which seem totally uninterested in that aspect. Instead, we seem content to follow young and ambitious Ben on his journey, where the director highlights how pretty and fast and tempting and easy everything gets in Vegas. Now, I do respect wanting to illustrate and emphasize that, but not at the expense of the actual game of cards and the science that goes around it. And that's where 21 fails most. Another rather important (and somewhat related) aspect is that of choices and decisions, or lack thereof. In 21, our protagonist almost never makes decisions. Be it at the game table or his personal life. The whole movie screams for decisions to be made, it revolves around the weight of choices. When to bet. When to stop. When to resist temptation. When to confide in close friends or family members. Yet these important elements are ignored, or handled off screen in the most bland way. As a result, the thrill we would (should) feel for Ben, the tension that should exist, is never there. We as an audience never feel any indecision, we never question what is going to happen as Ben goes from plot point A to B to C and so on... this ends up being a catastrophic failure.I really feel director Robert Luketic's previous experiences (his resume is filled with bland, vanilla romantic comedies that require a railroading script) put him as a disadvantage because 21 falls flat on its face. Kevin Spacey, as a sort of flawed mentor is wasted as his character only seem to further the plot and equally, Laurence Fishburne as a main antagonist with shades of gray is a non-factor for the story. The movie (much like Kate Bosworth) is pretty enough that you won't skip parts but it all feels remote and lacking in realism or real sense of drama. It's a tremendous idea but left unfinished and sketchy. How can an action-thriller with a super-heroic icon and a busy plot like Casino Royale succeed in highlighting both the romance, the gambling aspect and a fulfilling story while the much more straightforward 21 fails at highlighting anything? Poor story and direction.Watch The Cincinnati Kid or Rounders instead.",21
109,jace_the_film_guy,"Despite its flaws, I absolutely love this film",8,14 September 2021,"Despite its flaws, I absolutely love this film. From the first scene in the MIT classroom with Ben's explanation of variable change, I knew that I was hooked. Watching intelligent people outsmart an unbeatable system is enthralling and exciting. Jim Sturgess had a strong performance as the socially awkward yet genius mathematician and Spacey's deliberate and controlling mentor was well executed.While the climax was slightly underwhelming and the character development was nonexistent for any student not named Ben, I was still invested in the story itself. Similar to Free Guy and Ready Player One, I was a little bored with moments in the ""real world""; in this film, the ""real world"" being Boston with the game being the casino life in Las Vegas. It was especially interesting to see the tonal shifts in both behavior and color as the characters bounced from one setting to the other.In spite of the weaknesses in storytelling, 21 is an anxiety driven, edge-of-your-seat film that I find myself repeatedly drawn to. The precept of the characters not gambling but following a specific set of rules and playing a system was fascinating to me. It is because of this intriguing premise that I am continually drawn back to this film.",21

Hollywood's tortured version was 'wisely' created to spoon feed young demographics with its success duly confirmed by the high IDMb ratings and comments.Here Hollywood plunges into fantasy mode creating casino-guest violence (there was and is none of this type in this manner), hand signals one could see a mile away, the group not permitted to so much as look at one another in the casino but arrive together by limo and saunter up to the casino door so that welcome camera can get a good shot of them. Then, to keep that low profile they go off clubbing together, shopping together....everything together. Like the gang that could not 'stealth' straight. Ben is such the MIT genius he can do no better then the equivalent of keeping his huge cash horde under his mattress. Has he ever heard of a dorm burning down? Does he deserve to be in MIT or Harvard where he can not figure out how use bank safety deposit boxes? They stay mostly in one casino which of course would never have worked.Welcome to a Las Vegas where casino employees may invite you to please follow them to the casino's nearby torture chamber. Not just the fact that the movie trashes reality to create a MOSTLY fictional flick but the insulting stupidity of the whining, erratic and out of control counting group. Hence my new title for this movie: COLLEGE CARD COUNTERS GO WILD! Stacy's rants reminded me somewhat of Charles Dickens Fagen which may be the true reality base of the film. On the big plus side the card dealng cinematography was top notch.",21
111,larry-411,"Slick and polished like a blackjack table, and a complete delight",7,13 March 2008,"""21"" was the official Opening Night Film of the 2008 SXSW Film Festival. The film is based on the true story of a group of MIT students who use their math skills to ""beat the house"" at blackjack in the Las Vegas casinos. Robert Luketic (""Legally Blonde"") directed the Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb adaptation of Ben Mezrich's bestselling book ""Bringing Down the House.""""21"" is pure Hollywood all the way -- slick and polished, like the wardrobes and personalities inhabited by the kids in their transformation to high rollers. The tight ensemble cast includes Kate Bosworth and Jacob Pitts as team players and Laurence Fishburne as a security chief with a massive dilemma on his hands. But the show belongs to Kevin Spacey as professor Mickey Rosa, mastermind behind the escapade, and Jim Sturgess as Ben Campbell, the reluctant recruit who drives the film as it barrels headlong to a breathless climax.The script is clever, funny, and worthy of math geeks everywhere, and the widescreen action is as nonstop as that on the casino floor. Spacey is Spacey at his best -- just the Kevin we know, nothing more, nothing less -- and that's good enough. Sturgess, a Brit playing an American here (quite well, by the way), proves that he is destined for stardom in the States.In the intro to the screening, Luketic explained how Spacey had bought the rights to Mezrich's book, leading to his having to fight to win the actor over and let him direct the film. Memo to Kevin: thank you. And, whatever you do, wait for the end credits. The stunning remix of the Rolling Stones' ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" is almost worth the price of admission.",21
112,mohit_sinsniwal,must watch one time,8,26 May 2019,"This movie was based on a true story, and if the makers had stuck closer to the true story it could have been a much better movie. But no, they had to Hollywoodize it and dumb it down so that anyone with the least knowledge of the game of blackjack and how casinos operate will be saying ""No way"" to themselves all through the movie. It actually ends up with a chase scene and characters running through the kitchen, for God's sake.In real life the team's success was 90% in being careful to not attract the attention of the casinos detectors and only 10% in their scheme, which was based on the well-known technique of card-counting to get an edge. In the movie, the team's actions were childishly crude even to the point of continually returning to the same casino...so the movie makers could develop the characters of the casino bad guys. In real life the team was careful to not win much at any one table or at any one casino, not more than $1,000 a session, which would be well within the amount any lucky player might win without counting. In the movie they hit the same table for tens of thousands of dollars, which would have set off alarms all over Nevada. Even the hand signals the team used in the movie were childishly obvious. All this by the supposedly brilliant MIT students and professor. No way.The movie actually had the bad casino guys torturing card counters when they caught them. No way. In real life a casino has the right, tested in court, to kick anyone out and ban them from ever playing again...they do not have to prove cheating or card-counting, they do it under the laws of trespassing on their private property and this is what they do. Remember, card-counters are only making what amounts to an hourly wage, so they are not a serious threat to a casino.Another example of the Hollywood treatment was that after showing how brilliant Ben was at counting cards when they were recruiting him, he was not used as the card counter, he was used as the big bettor and one of the female team members did the counting.an entertaining movie for someone not knowledgeable or much interested in real life casino gambling, but dumb and dumber for those who are.",21
113,Ozzy2000,Unreal but entertaining.,9,18 May 2008,"Having been to Las Vegas and also loving table games I found the film entertaining and mildly nostalgic even though my trip was only a couple of years ago.The film is very loosely based on a bunch of MIT students who used card counting rather laboriously to win around $60,000 each with a couple of exceptions over a long period in various Casinos around the USA. They were eventually banned from casinos and could have legally challenged the casinos for their rights to play there but instead pursued their studies and careers.The film however takes us on a silly fantasy tour in which the players win extraordinary amounts and being caught means a violent exit from the casinos. The film is not only unrealistic but totally misleading. It was up to about a decade ago that some casinos used a three deck shoe for Black Jack but now as with Australia there are five deck shoes which makes card counting almost impossible as well as automatic shufflers which totally make it card counting useless.Kevin Spacey again performs well as the lecturer who runs the team of recruited card counters. The idea that you have to be some sort of genius or A grade grad student is a fallacy you just need to highly motivated well trained and have a reasonable memory and several months experience at Black Jack.The other ridiculous aspect of the film is that if you wanted to play really big and win big in a few sessions at any of the major casinos you could go to the high roller or premium rooms. Another strange thing about the film is that they are supposed to be playing at various casinos and the Casino Investigator who is tracking them Cole Williams ( Laurence Fishburne) appears to work at all the casinos at the same time which is really silly.I guess most people not only miss my observations but wouldn't really care and just enjoy the action and bright lights of Vegas and above all the fantasy.So for fantasy and entertainment I give the film three stars.",21

Without boring novices too much and people should watch casino to get some sort of idea how casinos stop people from winning, you don't just walk in there night after night, walk out each time and get away with obvious hand signals and irregular play, you'd be lucky to last 30 minutes. And this isn't the 1950's, they don't take you into back rooms anymore, they just kick you out BEFORE you make any serious money and thats the final point kids, card counting on any level is really, really difficult. Even if the deck is in your favor, you can still get a bad hand, a very important point that was never mentioned in the movie, and casinos will constantly change the rules by closing tables, changing dealers, shuffling more etc. Aside from those massive plot holes,its an OK movie, there are a decent couple of twists at the end and there's good chemistry between the kids although Fishburne and spacey were miscast.

The movie's intellect never aspires to the level of it's subjects, but the visual aesthetics and bouncy tone are enough to wet even the most ardent of anti-gamblers' appetites.",21
117,frankenbenz,21 Going on 11,6,13 May 2008,"If I was eleven years old, there's a good chance I would have loved Robert Luketic's 21. But, unfortunately for the last 123 minutes of my life, the eleven year old kid is all grown up. Watching this movie I got the feeling it was Australian director Luketic's first film, but after fact checking I was a little shocked to see it was his fourth. Based on 21's steady parade of ""seen it all before"" it's obvious he hasn't learned much in his four trips to the helm, unless of course his intent is to recycle every film-making cliché available. It's not that 21 was painful to watch, it actually is entertaining, but it begs one very real question: does Luketic have an original idea in his head?Things start off with the introduction of Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess), whom everyone refers to as ""the smartest guy they know."" Ben, despite being the smartest guy everyone knows, is stumped at how to come up with the 300 grand he needs to attend Harvard med school. Ben's hail mary is the Robinson scholarship, although the one thing keeping him from qualifying is a lack of real life experience -- can you guess where Ben finds it? I'll give you a hint: there's about 110 minutes of movie left.The problem with this setup is, while it does a great job providing us with a (requisite) dilemma, it spoils the (requisite) 3rd act twists. I guess the screenwriters felt sacrificing surprise was a small price to pay to establish Ben's motivation for getting involved with Prof. Micky Rosa's (Kevin Spacey) ragtag band of genius card counters. Either that, or they assumed the audience would completely and conveniently forget about the scholarship.While most young filmmakers worth their salt reference Welles, Godard, Fuller, Scorsese and other screen giants in their films, Luketic establishes very early into 21 his major influences are the makers of cookie cutter 1980's teen dramas. Case in point: the entrance of Ben's love interest Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth). As we cut to the POV of Ben and his friends, we cut to an over-cranked, slow-motion shot of Taylor striding across the gym floor. The shot wouldn't be complete without the hit-you-over-the-head musical cue, and Luketic does not disappoint. The only thing missing was a wind machine tussling her golden locks. This shot is so cliché that even spoofs of it have become cliché. Perhaps Luketic missed the memo that this shot was officially retired after Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Remember the shot of Phoebe Cates, bikini clad and dripping wet, rising out of the swimming pool with nothing but the Cars ""Moving in Stereo"" blasting across the soundtrack? Even Phoebe was smart enough to know her career had plateaued, prompting her to disappear into retirement/motherhood not long after. On another tangent, let me ask you this: if not one hockey player in the NHL has the arrogance (or ignorance) to don the number 99, what possesses Luketic to think he has the right to regurgitate this tired cliché of a shot?Throughout the movie, Luketic pulls out all the stops: voice over narration, flashbacks, montage sequences, time lapses, match dissolves, pop zooms, etc. His film-making is very democratic in the sense he refuses to leave anyone confused about what is going on. In other words, this is idiot proof film-making -- every idiot will be able to follow what's going on. The result: every nuance, every gesture, every raised eyebrow, every nod is shot in super slow motion and smash cut to an accompanying extreme close up. Luketic simply refuses to let subtlety get in the way of slapping the viewer across the face with what is going on. Even the product placement in 21 is shameless and overt, as evidenced in the bar scene when Ben orders ""two BUD LIGHTS"" and then nails his mark as he perfectly positions the bottle's labels within the camera's line of sight. I feel sorry for the actors in the film since every reaction demanded of them is telegraphed with utter disdain for realism. Watching 21 I could imagine Luketic redirecting his actors: ""can you do it again, but make it bigger this time."" I'm at a loss to explain why Spacey would even sign on to play a character that is practically a parody of his previous work. I found it really hard not to snicker as he dispensed rat-tat-tat, yoda-like pez of wisdom.There's no question 21 is a paint by numbers affair, yet despite being formulaic and predictable, it somehow manages to be entertaining enough to not walk out of. The source material is definitely fascinating and the eye candy is worthy of most hip-hop music videos, but unless you are eleven years old, you can't excuse 21 for its bluntness. I mean really, are MIT geniuses really so stupid to think the same set of deliberate hand signals are never going to get detected? And if you do manage to stay through to the end, you will be witness to one of the most poorly directed chase scenes ever committed to celluloid.21 ends with a very literal soundtrack cue that is as on-the-nose as the Rolling Stones' track is infamous for being overused: you can't always get what you want. No sir, you sure can't.http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/",21
118,tubby1,Tiringly Straightforward,3,3 August 2009,"21 does not generate the thrills or excitement associated with the casino world. It is very laborious effort with an all too predictable tale.Kevin Spacey adds a bit of glamour to the film but even he suffers from the films ineptitude of style and direction. The mathematical geniuses employed to make lots of money playing blackjack are cocksure (which they are meant to be) but they are decidedly unappealing protagonists (if that is what you deem them to be) . Jim Sturgess is the strongest of the cast and makes the most of a tame story.The film does not entertain and focuses very much on the all too cumbersome teenage themes of money, love and friendship. This is sadly a tired, wearisome and sluggish creation.",21

Budge $35M; box office $160MI think the story was good and was well-written and fully plausible. I would not be surprised if it was based on a true story. When you analyze its parts you realize that each part fits well the next part and the next part, and together they make a well-built whole that makes sense. There is an initial start with mystery, then a steady rise to the climax, then a decent climax, a downfall, and then rise again, then a twist, and then another twist, and then we get a really good ending. Well done! This movie was an 8/10 until it got to the end and then it got bumped up to 10/10.Laurence Fishburne (the ""antagonist"") - excellent work. Perfect for the role!Kevin Spacey (the professor) - as usual, his acting was great.Jim Sturgess (the protagonist) - I think he did ""decent"" work, but nowhere close to the level of Fishburne and Spacey who performed at a high level.Kate Bosworth - I felt her acting was weak; too stoic? I know Kevin does the same, but that is his trademark. She had her good moments, but in general I thought she was weak for this movie.Aaron Yoo - he barely spoke, but his acting was great and funny. He was a good supporting cast.Jack Gilpin (Harvard employee) - he had a very tiny role, but he did good.Supporting cast - the rest of the supporting cast I thought had a weak and forgettable performance.Director Robert Luketic, writers Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb, cinematographer Russell Carpenter, and editor Elliot Graham, as well as everyone else who worked on this film, great job!Conclusion: this was a well-written story. It had a good story, it was entertaining, it was never boring, and had a great ending. I am glad I re-watched it. I think this movie is recommendable and definitely worth a shot.10/10",21

121,CihanVercan,"Nothing funny, nothing sensational, nothing joyful; perhaps a little interesting",5,30 August 2008,"Worth to watch for spectacular views from Las Vegas, the movie 21 starts with a ""Maverick""ish gambler movie opening. Though, this movie is not even half good as Maverick. We initially see how Jack and Ace forms a lovely couple. Then we meet our leading actor Ben something, the singing frog of the movie ""Across the Universe"", as a very sharp-witted campus kid trying to persuade the dean of the Harvard Medical School to access student scholarships.A gambler gang of campus kids leading by Kevin Spacey drives Ben and the others' -including Kate Bosworth as another campus kid- minds over gambling in Las Vegas by means of proved mathematical methods of counting cards. Ben, who must have swallowed a calculator, becomes the smartest one of all. We are witnessing our campus kids how actually they gamble with cheating over cards at a casino. Best thing of the casino scenes are the chance of getting know how the backstage of security cams goes. There are a bunch of technicians trying to catch whoever does cheating on the games.The actual happenings of the story is hidden behind the script. Accordingly, it forces us to undone the knots. Yet regrettably, the search for straightening the story is just getting boring and boring until the end starts to occur, while leaving mentioned questions unanswered.Thankfully at the final, knots are getting undone. For five minutes long, while Rolling Stones-You Can't Always Get What You Want is playing, we see how the life takes on shape for each character. Then we end up at where we started; back on the faculty dean's room, Ben is still talking to the dean. Whole movie has passed in this room, we realize. The dean looks persuaded by Ben for his scholarship.",21
122,robertallenandersonjr,An original movie that was well made,10,9 April 2008,"21 was such an exciting movie to just sit down and watch. The whole entire movie was very intense. Especially the last 10 minutes of this, it really keeps you on the edge of your seat. This movie had some great twists that you do not see coming at all. Especially one of the twists at the end that you will be shocked from. I loved the main actors role in this movie. I thought that Jim Sturgess did such an amazing job playing the main role. He had a whole lot of stuff going through his mind in this movie the whole time. I thought that if they tried they would not have of found a better actor to play his role. Kevin Spacey also handed in a great performance as well. Kate Bosworth was looking very hot, and also did a great job. I loved how this movie was really based on a true story. I always find movies that are based on true stories good. This one was especially good though. It sort of teaches you a little bit about black jack as the movie goes on. This movie is well worth your money and time. It's good this movie was 2 hours long it made all the better. The thing this movie is trying to show you is that you get a second chance. It really shows the main actor in it that you don't know how good you have it until you loose it all. The people in this movie get way ahead of themselves and want to do to much. Overall this was a great movie. It was well worth my time and I would love to see it plenty of more times. So just give this movie a chance and go see it. You will most likely enjoy it. I think that any ages above 13 would enjoy this. You will especially like this movie if you like to gamble or play cards.",21

124,jake-179,"Avoid this one, don't believe the hype",1,11 April 2008,"This movie was exactly what I thought it would be. A boring plot, no interesting characters, and ""paint-by-numbers"" direction. Mainly this movie just lacked a compelling plot. It was just BORING. I figured it would boring, but I saw it anyway just because nothing else was playing at the time.Aside from being totally boring, there was one particular error that really bothered me. The characters throughout the movie are visiting a variety of casinos in Las Vegas. All kinds of different casinos on the strip, and some of the casinos that are nowhere near the strip, such as the Red Rock Casino. However, no matter where they go, Lawernce Fishburn's character is watching them, and happens to be at the casino they are in no matter when they are there. How did he magically transport himself around the entire Las Vegas valley like that? It was really obvious that the movie makers did not take this into consideration. They just expect you to believe the Fishburns character is inside every casino at all times.Another thing that bothered me about this movie was the geographic setting of the casinos. I live in Vegas, so I know that the Hard Rock casino is NOT located on the strip, as it was depicted in the movie.Anyway, this movie sucked, I hated it, and I wish I had not wasted my time seeing it. So, take my advice, and go see a different movie. Hopefully one that has a decent plot.",21
125,Mccadoo,Entertaining but with major problems,6,15 April 2008,"Let me begin by saying that I haven't read the book this movie is ""based on"" so I went in with no pre-conceived expectations. I enjoyed the movie, it was definitely worth a night at the movies however, I had some major issues with it that really detracted from my viewing enjoyment and yes, I know it's just a movie, but when things occur in a movie that's based on actual events that yank me out of the flow of the plot that's a problem. Things that jumped out at me were; The main character is supposed to be a genius and yet he hides over $300,000 in his ceiling?? No one is that stupid. Especially since there was no need for him to hide it at all; he won it gambling in Vegas, where gambling is legal, hello? He would have had to pay taxes on it but all he had to do was declare it as gambling winnings and open a bank account, or better yet, a short term CD to earn some interest. What did he plan to do, drop $300,000 in cash on the Dean of Admissions desk at Harvard Medical School? That would have gotten the IRS down on him in a heartbeat. It just didn't make any sense and was an incredibly stupid and unbelievable move.The group was counting cards which is not illegal but will get you banned from any casino that catches you. I would think they would have wanted to keep a very very low profile so they didn't attract attention. Wasn't that why they wore disguises? And yet, they stayed in suites, walked into the casinos greeting everyone by name like high rollers, they did everything they possibly could TO call attention to themselves. Again, it just didn't make any sense.Vegas casino's are all owned by major corporations these days, the days of the mob running the casinos are long over. Casino security does not beat people up over counting cards anymore, they haven't for a very long time. They escort you off the property and ban you and that's all. The main character could have filed a complaint with the Nevada Gaming Commission (because again, he hadn't done anything illegal), and the casino would have had a lot of questions to answer.The main character's mother offers him a check for $68,000 for medical school, telling him that she's been saving it for years for him so he could go to medical school. So she obviously didn't pay for MIT if she's been saving for years for this, how did he pay for MIT? I assumed he'd gotten scholarships but they never tell you one way or the other.Kevin Spacey's character steals his money and is going to see that he doesn't graduate, huh? Again, the main character hasn't done anything illegal, other than not declaring his winnings and paying taxes on them. On the other hand, I can't help feeling that the powers that be at MIT would take a very dim view of one of their professors acting the way Spacey's character did. All our hero had to do was go to them and spill his guts, I'm sure he could have gotten at least one or two of the others to back him up, probably the guy Spacey had already bounced from the team. He also could have gone to the police and reported the theft of the money in his room, OK, so he would have been in a little hot water with the IRS, but he would have kept at least a large portion of the cash.Casinos don't usually comp luxury suites to big winners, more often to big losers so they'll keep coming back. They want the big winners to go elsewhere. And we're back to the low profile thing again.There are a great many casino's in Vegas, if your trying to get away with counting, why would you go back to the same one (the Hardrock) again and again? Those are just the ones that come to mind at the moment. Again, I did enjoy the movie, but my enjoyment was tempered by the things I've listed above that were, in the end, kind of an insult to the viewers intelligence.",21

Fortunately, the answer to all of Ben's problems is right there in the cards. Recruited to join a team of extremely gifted students who have used their mastery of numbers to beat the odds at blackjack, Ben procures a fake identity in order to join the casino scammers and their brilliant leader -- eccentric math professor and stats genius Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey) -- in some highly profitable weekend excursions to Las Vegas. Counting cards isn't illegal, and by using a complex series of signals, this team has cracked the code.Of course, it doesn't take long for Ben to become seduced by the glamorous Las Vegas lifestyle, and the attention afforded to him by his sexy teammate teammate Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth) finds him pushing his luck to the absolute limits. Laurence Fishburne stars as Cole Williams, the Sin City security chief who catches on to the group and makes it his mission to expose their lucrative blackjack scam.There isn't much more for me to say only that even if the plot synopsis might excite you really don't bother with it.

131,EXodus25X,"Blackjack, no but not a bust either.",7,22 July 2008,"21 is pretty much as advertised in the many trailers I had seen, but in this case that's not all bad. It's trailer pretty much sets up the whole movie, introduces pretty much every character and gives me a pretty good guess as to how it will all play out. Trust me in no movie where the character says ""I'm going to do this but just until I get a set amount of money, then I'm out"" do they ever hold true, never. I guess that would make for a very boring story, maybe, then again maybe not. Anyway the predictability for the most part doesn't bother me here, I'm too distracted by some solid performances and just some amazingly beautiful cinematography and camera work in all the Las Vegas scenes. But, and yes there is one, in the early moments of this film there is a scene that leaves the main character in what he feels is a hopeless situation, of course him not having the benefit of seeing the trailer like we all have, he doesn't know that the answer to his problem is just around the corner. Which separates us from the character and makes all the scenes after where he doesn't know what he's going to do so pointless to the audience. Also that early scene I mentioned earlier, remember? Ya, that anyone could watch that scene and not figure how this whole thing was going to end is beyond me. So I guess my bottom line is, the trailer tells you everything but doesn't seem to ruin it because it is a fun ride, the only thing that remains a mystery is how the ride will end, well the first 10 minutes took care of that mystery for me, so what remains, the fun ride and yes it is. Kevin Spacey is great, and by the way where has he disappeared to recently. Jim Strugess is a great up and coming young actor and Kate Bosworth plays her part well enough (but she should never have been Louis Lane). Laurence Fishburne has been better, way better but the length and pace of this film leaves little time to delve much deeper into his character and what time he has he puts to good use.

Written by Peter Steinfeld & Allan Loeb, based upon the book ""Bringing Down the House"" by Ben Mezrich. Starring Jim Sturgess, Kevin Spacey, Kate Bosworth, Laurence Fishburne, Aaron Yoo, Lisa Lapira, Jacob Pitts, Josh Gad & Sam Golzari. Running Time: 122 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com, May, 2008.OVERVIEW: Ben Campbell (Sturgess) is a shy but brilliant MIT student who wants to enroll at Harvard Medical School once he graduates, if only he can come up with the $300,000 for tuition. His math professor, Mickey Rosa (Spacey), recognizes his genius for numbers and invites him to join his special ""math club,"" a group of fellow students who make weekly trips to Las Vegas to beat the casinos by counting cards at blackjack. Why apply for a student loan when so much easy money is to be made? The Vegas lifestyle soon seduces Ben -- as does one of his sexy-smart teammates (Bosworth) -- and he begins to lose his way. Warily watching all of the goings on is Cole Williams (Fishburne) the casino's old-school security chief who is trying to figure out why the weekly airbus from Boston seems to coincide with big losses for his client's casino.REVIEW: 3 out of 4 Java Mugs Based on a real-life account of MIT students who won millions in Vegas casinos in the 1990s, the screenplay adds Hollywood melodramatics and romantic comedy tropes to an already remarkable story. In other words, its a lot of fun... and if you ever had a fantasy to beat the bank at your favorite gambling parlor, this is the movie to see.Sturgess and Bosworth are fine as the white-bread romantic leads, but the supporting cast is far more fascinating, including Gad and Golzari as Ben's nerdy pals, Yoo and Lapira as two of his colorful teammates, and Fishburne as the menacing casino cop.But the other actors might as well fold their cards when Kevin Spacey comes to the table. Feel free to hiss, because that is exactly the way he plays it; he chews up every scrap of scenery in a performance which alone is worth the price of admission.Watching a group of people sitting around playing blackjack is not the most visually exciting experience you could imagine, which provides a challenge for the filmmakers. They meet it by employing extreme close-ups, imaginative special effects, flashy camera angles and dynamic editing.

138,tsmith417,Just another teenage action/romance movie,5,17 May 2009,"I know there are pages and pages of reviews already but I just had to write something or bust after wasting my time watching this movie.The film has really nothing to do with being a blackjack counter; it uses the Las Vegas casinos and the premise of card-counting only as a vehicle for a teenage action/romance story.The script is full of contradictions. The most beautiful girl on the campus of M.I.T. is supposedly a rocket scientist. We know this only because one of the nerds says she is; she never utters a word or gives us a clue about the scope of her intelligence or her field of expertise.A college math professor, who becomes the organizer of a blackjack card-counting team, mentions more than once that this is a business and that emotions should be kept out of it, yet once the team starts showing a profit they go crazy-wild, spending exorbitant amounts of money going to boutiques and topless bars.He tells them ""When we get to the casino we don't know each other and we'll wear disguises"" yet only one girl ""disguises"" herself with a wig once in a while; the rest of them don't do a thing to change their appearance.For five people who are supposed to be strangers they spend an awful lot of time watching each other intently at the gaming tables and partying and shopping together; the only time they keep their distance from one another is back on campus where they strangely don't interact at all.They're supposed to stay under the radar and not draw attention to themselves but they play at the same casino every weekend and within a few weeks the main character goes from being a shy college kid to the biggest whale Vegas has ever seen, and is on a first-name basis with every dealer, pit boss, and valet in the joint.And for someone who doesn't want to draw attention to himself and his team, a 50-ish professor shouldn't be caught hanging around with a bunch of 20-ish kids, especially not in a titty bar.As for the card-counting, I found it to be slightly unrealistic to say the least. A count of +10 is a counter's dream; to consistently find counts of +15 and above at every table is ridiculous. Not to mention that pit bosses are competent counters themselves and any one of them would order a change of decks in a New York minute if they saw the count staying that high for that long. Oh yeah, another thing about counting cards ... a high count is favorable to the players because it means they might get more 19s and 20s, but the dealer stands the same chance of getting those 19s and 20s so a high count doesn't necessarily guarantee a win on every hand.I found myself wondering how a college kid could fly to Vegas every weekend without his mother, who obviously kept in close contact with him, calling the police and filing a missing person's report. The kid's friends ask why he doesn't return their phone calls but they never think there's anything odd about the fact that it's only between Friday and Sunday that he can't be reached.What I found really confusing was the time frame. The original M.I.T. team worked the casinos in the 1970s, yet the film makes no attempt to make Vegas look anything like it did thirty years ago. The casinos shown were all built within the last twenty years and even the bars, clothes, and music are 21st century, and I don't think anyone called anyone else ""dude"" in 1974 and I know for certain there were no cell phones (the kid's friends question why he doesn't call them on his cell when they can't reach him). If this is a story about one of the later incarnations of the M.I.T. team, however, since the newest team member is recruited to replace one who left to work for Google which wasn't even a glimmer in anyone's eye in the '70s, then it's just as confusing because they're talking about facial recognition software just coming into use when those types of programs have been around since the late 1980s. In addition, if the team has been working this gig for a long time, as suggested by the fact that they need a replacement member and are not starting from scratch, then why do they go money-crazy all of a sudden? Why haven't they been filthy rich for lo these many months prior to the addition of the new member? The whole scenario makes no sense any way you try to explain it.If you want to know how blackjack counting teams really work, don't think you're going to get any insight from this movie. But if you enjoy unlikely romances, bad guys chasing good guys, silly plot devices, and watching otherwise intelligent math professors getting double-crossed by inexperienced students in unbelievable situations, then this is the film for you.",21
139,wilsr,"Not great cinema, but nevertheless a couple of hours' entertainment",7,1 January 2011,"I think many of the reviews here are missing the point: I know nothing about betting on cards but, even if I did I would not be over-critical about the fidelity of the casino operations.It's fiction, folks: the idea behind the film might have been based on actual happenings but - it's still fiction.I'm a fairly hard marker about movies that rely on whiz-kid CGI and wanton destruction of expensive cars rather than sound screenplays but in this case I personally watched a presentable film, well acted and with a halfway believable plot line. OK, some of the situations were, as previously mentioned, a little set-up, but on the whole the inconsistencies didn't spoil my enjoyment.Spacey is, in my book, one of the best and most natural actors working at present. He, and Fishburne, give excellent performances here. Spacey's handling of a controlling and mendacious lecturer is one of his best efforts.It was a little disappointing that the old chase-through-the-kitchens scenario was hauled out yet again, but the way the finale came round again to the Harvard Med school interview to round the movie off was, I thought, a nice touch. Not, to be sure, a ten-Oscar contender but one hell of a lot better to pass the afternoon with than Inception or some of the other pretentious pseudo-intellectual rubbish that is shoved at us nowadays.",21
140,burnzyburns,One of my all time favourite movies,10,13 December 2020,"I'm not going to dive into the plot or change anyone's minds, I just wanted to come on here and say this movie is one of my all time favourite films.And I have my reasons. First off, the intro. An opening song by MGMT Time to Pretend instantly puts me in a good mood. It's the only distinct song in the movie and it's perfect in its delivery. Second off, I am obsessed with Ben and Jill. If it was any other actor I would have my doubts, Jim Sturgess is awesome in this role. Jill is not overly attractive, she's not a doll, but she seems like the perfect woman to have a beer with and she's super flirty and likeable. The chemistry between her and Ben almost steals the show, and I thought was a great sub plot. And lastly I love the bouncing between ""real"" hometown Ben and ""Vegas"" Ben. The way he highs himself in Vegas as ""the man"" makes me laugh every time. What a bad ass. Hometown Ben is just an ordinary kid going through life like anyone else, minus the fact we don't all try to go into Harvard Med.It's worth mentioning that the main story is really good and entertaining. It's easy to follow and I think it's all because of Kevin Spacey. He lifts the story.21 is a fun entertaining movie with a lot to like.

Where's the Russian leader of the pack? Where are the OTHER casinos they gambled in? The film also is based on the preposterous rationality (NO WHERE IN THE BOOK) that a poor student can't go to Harvard Med without joining a card reading Blackjack team. Right. That's because Stuident Loans have not been invented. And they don't give Student Loans to Harvard Med students. And Harvard Med grads never earn enough money to pay back their student loans, because a Harvard degree is so worthless on the market. RIGHT!!! Only rich kids go to Harvard or MIT. Right! Not one poor kid to be found on their campus. Right. Well, if your gullible, stupid, politically correct, and proud of all that, you'll buy into the stupid script. I wonder how much Mezrich was paid.

142,dbogosian-1,Stylish and satisfying,7,3 April 2008,"""21"" follows the rise (and ultimate fall, and what happens afterward) of a college math wiz recruited by his professor to outwit the blackjack tables at Las Vegas and make a ton of money. It's a well made movie with lots of class and style, and if you aren't turned off by the notion of filthy lucre, then you are bound to enjoy this.The movie works well because of its cast. Jim Sturgess, the young male lead, is outstanding. He does a great job of transitioning from initial uncertainty to eventual acceptance and ultimately relishing his new ""career."" He's eminently likable and you can't help pulling for him all the way.Kate Bosworth is lovely as his love interest, always impeccably polished. She looks a bit old for the part of a college student, and especially her style of clothing in the casinos (while ravishing) is not quite right for a 21-year old. I wish more buildup had been devoted to her relationship with Sturgess, but the movie is all told from his angle. Best of all, Kevin Spacey is dead-on as the ringleader. He is cool, efficient, very sharp with every line. As always, he always manages to steal every scene he is in.There is also a nice subplot about these aging casino security agents, who are being phased out in favor of software recognition systems. It gives the movie more depth and interest, and ultimately you can't help realizing that these guys, while ""villains"" in one sense, are also ""heroes"" in another.The look of the film is fabulous, well worth consideration for art direction. It's all about Vegas, but not over the top, somehow. You never blame the character for falling into the trap, because it is all so addictive: the cash, the clothes, the fabulous rooms (it's almost worth seeing the movie just to see those penthouse suites!). The editing and camera work are awesome. They did an especially good job zooming way in on the cards, to where they almost become characters in the story. But it never gets technical, it never dwells on splitting 8's or hitting a soft 17 or anything like that. Even if you know nothing about the game (and I know very little), it won't impair your enjoyment of the movie.It's not a very deep movie, but it does have insight into human character and motivation. It's mainly just a lot of fun to watch. I give it a solid 8 (maybe shading towards 8-1/2).",21

And the movie would have fared much better if it had came out a few years ago, since there's a lot in it that we've now seen in the Ocean's 11 movies and the TV series Vegas. However I still enjoyed it. Laurence Fishburne is great and provided gravity and genuine menace.I admit I was frustrated at times by not understanding some of the characters actions. As an example, the main character, Ben, was hiding his winnings, hundreds of thousands of dollars, in the ceiling of his dorm room! Why? Forget the stupidity of it, I just didn't understand why he couldn't put it in the bank. They weren't doing anything illegal, so I didn't get that at all!But if you can turn your brain off, you'll likely enjoy the fun!",21
144,piksplanet,It was just okay..,5,27 June 2008,"21 is a film by Robert Luketic starring Jim Sturgess, Kate Bosworth, Kevin Spacey, and Lawrence Fishburne. It is inspired by the true story of the MIT Blackjack Team, and is based on Ben Mezrich's bestselling book, Bringing Down the House. The film revolves around Ben Campbell, a Harvard Medical School hopeful studying at MIT. His dreams of going to HMS are put on hold because he does not have the necessary amount of money required to enroll. He is pulled into a group of 'geniuses' who, under the supervision of Mickey Rosa, their mathematics professor, learn the art of counting cards in order to outplay the casinos in Vegas.All of the above added with some flashy Las Vegas images, heartfelt (not really!) best friends, a cheesy sequence near the end, and a non-existent romantic chemistry between Sturgess and Bosworth, makes 21. It's not as bad as I make it sound. The introduction is nice, so is the technique in which they show how one learns card counting. I had no difficulty in understanding it at all. The film is fairly gripping with some nice background music, and the Vegas shots are kind of okay. I've seen much better though. Jim Sturgess and Kevin Spacey are the only ones who actually act. Kate Bosworth is flat. I loved her in Superman Returns. Here, she hardly makes an effort to act. Plus, she looks highly weird (with her whole doll-hair). And lets not even talk about Lawrence Fishburne. The film is verging on two hours. It might have been a better movie if they did away with about 15 minutes (read: the whole best friend thing!). It got a little boring near the middle.I liked Jim Sturgess in Across the Universe. He was quite good here too. He's building a nice career for himself. Getting to the main point.. If you've got nothing better to do, you can watch 21. You surely wont be missing anything if you don't.5/10.",21
145,miroslavhradel,A good example of an interesting story being ruined by an unimaginative director,6,22 February 2021,"Although the story around which 21 revolves seems pretty interesting in itself, the way it is told is characterized by an almost total lack of creativity. As a result, there were several stages in the movie when it struggled to keep me entertained.The realization was especially disappointing because it was constantly clear that the story did have a lot of potential for being a good cautionary tale about the dangers of greed. Unfortunately, the fact that 21 was directed by a director who is mainly known for directing brainless ""romantic comedies"" quickly became noticeable and the repeated use of the musty stereotypes from such movies ensured that there was a pervasive feeling that 21 could have been a much better movie under the direction of another, creative director.Not only is the ending predictable, but the characters turn out to be chronically underdeveloped as well. This is especially true of Miles, the main character's best friend, who proves to be both a complete caricature and easily the most obnoxious movie character that I have seen in a very long time.The soundtrack is another element of the movie that turns out to be glaringly unimaginative on more than a few occasions and the visual appearance is exactly what the viewer can expect when following a story that is set in Vegas, as well as one that takes place on a university campus. The performances are relatively good, even though it quickly becomes obvious that Kevin Spacey is a much more capable actor than the rest of the film's ensemble.",21

Pastie bosomed strippers/lap dancers in Las Vegas circa 2008? Not even in Shecky Greene's day.It would be hard to care for these characters even if you were related to the actors. One more howler: card counters from MIT staying under the radar, winning hundreds of thousands from various casinos, but shown in several scenes (I should have counted them) being greeted by name as a high rollers by doormen, casino executives, and dealers.

149,Critomaton,You'd have more fun going to Vegas... and losing everything,3,29 March 2008,"""21"" bets that it can build on the excitement of the book upon which it is based but busts by going over the top.Here's how bad this movie was: ""Jumper"" was more entertaining. 'Nuff said. Need more explanation? OK, here goes but there are lots of spoilers ahead.The movie is based on the book ""Bringing Down The House"" by Ben Mezrich. The book is a quick read with a detailed and captivating explanation about how a group of college students, led by their professor, beat the system in Blackjack using knowledge of statistics, memorization techniques, and teamwork. That is, they had a really successful system for counting cards. I found the book compelling.However, as I read it, I realized it wouldn't translate well into a movie because there just wasn't a lot of action in the traditional sense and it didn't have a ""Hollywood"" ending; the card-counting team just kind of fell apart and each member went his or her own way. So I was very curious to see how the filmmakers would try to jazz up the story.Here's the irony: They embellished the story significantly and still managed to produce a tedious, predictable movie that didn't do justice to the characters, setting or tone of the book. I recommend reading the book and skipping the movie.Here are some of the differences I remember between the movie and the book. Caveat: my memory might be a bit fuzzy here - I read the book a few months ago. In the movie, there is a scene where a jealous card-counting teammate practically rats out his buddy at the Blackjack table, likening him to the Dustin Hoffman character from Rain Man. This scene is awkward and unbelievable and a far cry from anything in the book. In the book, the tension and dynamics between the teammates were much more subtle, but I guess subtle doesn't work on the big screen.Apparently, the inexplicable popularity of ""Superbad"" means there now has to be an incredibly nerdy, weight-challenged, wannabe stand-up comedian in every major studio release. That's a shame. He wasn't funny in ""Superbad"" and he wasn't funny in ""21"" (yeah, I know it's not the same actor). Nothing against the weight-challenged, just the blatantly unfunny. You know a screenplay is weak when the big confrontation between the college student with the double life and his techno-geek buddies occurs because he puts an 8K chip in their science project instead of a 16K chip. Who writes this stuff? I don't remember the ""Ben abandons his nerd buddies"" subplot being in the book, but I could be wrong about that. It's pretty trite regardless. In the book, the team kind of just falls apart, primarily as a result of too many close calls with casino staff and a particular loss prevention specialist. The team also corrodes from within due to jealousy, disillusionment from a few big losses, and resentment that the organizing professor doesn't seem to be taking any of the risk while collecting his reward. Some of the money gets stolen but they're never sure who did it and so the team just kind of dissolves. They try to regroup in various configurations but it doesn't last. Financially, everybody still makes out reasonably well in the end.In the movie, Ben gets beaten up by the loss prevention consultant (played by Laurence Fishburne), gets all of his money stolen by his professor (played by Kevin Spacey), exacts revenge on the thief by improbably teaming up with LF (who has a personal vendetta against KS), then loses it all again to LF's five-finger pension plan and six-shot revolver. But don't worry, he'll probably get a scholarship to Harvard by wowing the administrator with tales of his wild experiences. I haven't seen a college administrator that wowed by irresponsible behavior since Richard Masur in ""Risky Business"" (and he had a much better reason). Then again, I guess it's not much different than scoring big by writing a book about it, which actually did happen.So far, you might be thinking the movie sounds a lot more exciting than the book and I'd have to agree. But somehow it still manages to fall flat on screen. The book emphasized the team's use of disguises and alternate personalities very well. This was an element of the movie, to be sure, but it seemed very underdeveloped and I was surprised how much more entertaining it was on the printed page than the big screen. Same thing with the initiation scene, Ben's transformation into a ""player"", his enjoyment of the Vegas VIP life, etc. In the book, the pursuit by the loss prevention consultant was much more dogged. It wasn't confined to just one or two casinos but went nationwide. The film really didn't capture the determination of the pursuit very well or the number of casinos the team hit.I could go on and on but, thankfully, IMDb's word limit won't let me. So I'll just mention a few bad things about the movie that have nothing to do with it being based on a book: 1) At 2 hours long, the movie seems very drawn out given its rather shallow treatment of the subject matter. 2) Kevin Spacey seems to have a trademark style. It is menacing yet monotonous - as contrasted with Jack Nicholson's style of menacing and maniacal. Jack's style usually works, sometimes in spite of itself. Kevin's style doesn't seem to be producing memorable performances lately. He's made some great movies, to be sure, but after ""21"" and ""Superman Returns"" I'd say he's officially due for a comeback. Many movies that have strayed from their literary inspirations have been entertaining and worthy in their own right. ""21"" is most definitely not one of those movies.",21

All in all, you can have a good night at the movies without feeling that you've been cheated or that you have to write a philosophical dissertation.

It had all the elements of the heist movie with a little after school special mixed in. 21 is not destined to be a classic movie by any means. But how can you not enjoy a movie about a group of good looking kids making loads and loads of cash? In 21, the main character is a nerdy guy who rides around on his bike with one pant leg hiked up. He hangs out with two equally nerdy guys. The three of them are designing a car that runs by itself. They hang out at bars and drool over girls.Ben is all ready to start Harvard Medical School, if only he had enough cash. He is spotted by one of his teachers and covertly ushered to an underground room where said teacher forces the kids to play blackjack until they learn to play the game well enough to win loads of dough. They are MIT geniuses and can count cards.On the weekends they hit Vegas and play blackjack. Then, for Ben, everything falls apart. Will it stay that way? The rules of the after school special say no. The movie was predictable and should have been forgettable if it weren't for a math problem.I can't get this movie out of my mind because of the math problem suggested by the teacher (Kevin Spacey) towards the beginning about the 3 doors.",21

After card counting for a while he gets 315,000$ and keeps it in his dorm room where it gets stolen which is insanely stupid. Who would keep 300 grand in his dorm room??!?! Anyways lets move on to the even stupider parts of this movie. Afterwards there is a chase scene where Kevin Spacey is conveniently lead to a limousine which has one of the casino bosses in it but seriously the odds of him even going that way was very low anyways the whole movie gets really very silly and confusing at the ending. I mean the whole movie leads up to this? It didn't even make a heck of a lot of sense there like he went through all that getting screwed over in card counting and yet he still wants to bring his friends into it??

156,Oceans17,"Stylish ""life experience""",8,7 January 2009,"***Spoilers ahead***Many people pinpoint plot holes as if they were very smart, or as if the plot holes were very obvious, and I think they don't realize films need not to be taken too literally. In fact, the obviousness itself can be a signal to the clever viewer, telling her/him that she/he is being presented with a metaphor, a narrative license, an excuse to be stylish, or simply a joke. Why are they going always to the same casino? Because it represents all casinos, and Larry Fishburne is a symbol for all security guards: the filmmakers chose an arena for the struggle, and a character to be the antagonist. Why are their gestures so obvious? In the first place because they are being clearly shown... of course, it's a film. And also because Jill is very, very sexy crossing her arms like that (and we also expect some ""glamour"" in a film that happens to happen in Las Vegas). If the director had chosen to tell with painstaking detail all the shifts from one casino to another, from one gesture to another, then instead of plot-hole hunters we would have the other kind of people who always complain about films being confusing. Film narrative should be clear. If your attention span is high, then you can entertain yourself catching the tiny little bits of information that the filmmakers let there for us between one scene and the following. And the board discussion about the first and last scene reminds me a similar one about ""The Bourne ultimatum"". Please! Cinema is a symbolic art. So: those discussions are pointless. Of course they were the same scene, in spite of the obvious differences in clothing, etc., because they were the same at a symbolic level, and that's what counts. The book is just the inspiration for an atmospheric thriller with a sexy bias, which is in fact the kind of film we all love, and ""21"" is a nice, stylish and well conceived one. If you are interested in the mathematics of BlackJack, or want precise instructions to beat a casino, look elsewhere.",21

158,jhobdell,A mini 'Ocean's 11',8,19 April 2008,"I had above-average expectations of this movie (that is to say I was hoping it would do more than just entertain me!) and to begin with I was afraid it would be a massive disappointment. I'm not sure of the timescale exactly, but the first 'section' seemed very slow-moving and frankly rather dull. But credit to the whole crew: it picked up very nicely in line with the excitement of the college students and their professor heading for Vegas, and his descent into 'insanity' certainly stirred feelings of frustration from me.Beyond the quality of the story and its realisation, Spacey is in fine form, as is a rather menacing Laurence Fishburne. The younger actors are unquestionably good, and a semi-naked Kate Bosworth is always worth a look! Hang on in through the initial brush-strokes: the outline is boring, but the colours are dazzling.",21
159,robertdegeus,Blackjack,8,5 May 2013,"This movie did not immediately catch my eye, recommended to me by my father, I obediently watched and was pleasantly surprised.I won't lie the movie had it's faults and short comings, as any movie does, don't worry I'm not going to nit-pick. I certainly, at this stage in my life, could do no better.That being said I bonded with the characters extensively and thought it was a thoroughly enjoyable watch.When I finished the film I realized I was smiling to myself. It's one of those movies where after you watch it you just think, ""I want to do that"".",21
160,connorwburnett,Terrible Directing,4,21 March 2021,"I'm going to jump straight to the point for this one because I don't think this film is worth much of mine or your time. 21 is a heist film which presents the story of an MIT blackjack team which make regular trips to Vegas with a strategy they use to exploit the casinos through their advanced knowledge of maths.I finished watching 21 and the first thing that came to mind was how much they wasted such a high potential concept. To put it simply, if I were to explain to someone how not to direct a film, I would tell them to watch 21.You can pick apart this film until there is nothing left which is really unfortunate because 21 isn't at all boring. But throughout my watch I struggled to truly enjoy my time because of the constant reminders of amateur film making. Almost all of the problems would have been fixed if they had a more talented director at the helm.The performances are good enough, nothing special. My favourite aspect of the film was Kevin Spacey's character and its not even close.The pacing is really jarring in some areas of the film, character motivations can change in an instant with almost no build-up.I don't want to enter spoiler territory but I must say that I hated the ending. Tonally, It contrasted massive with the rest of the film leaving a sour taste.I think a 4 is just about right for 21, one of the only positives is that it certainly wasn't dull. Is it worth a watch? No.",21

One down for 21.Then, the real story was much more interesting then this one.Kevin Spacey as a professor, not bad.Casino's security folks? Bad choice, the actors chosen were a little too nice and pretty. They seemed to play at only a few casio's, well there a lot of casinos in Las Vegas, they could have switched casinos for 17 times 3 different ones every weekend and not run out.Hotel scenes? OK, so they are worried about the money and then blow it on really expensive suites? Why bother, you are only going to sleep there.The movie could have cut out 30 minutes easily and told the story better. Next movie like this, you might want to use USC students to do the production, they would do a better job.Oh well, I watched it all, sure glad I didn't pay for it.",21
162,brendon-kenny,"21 - Any substance behind the bright lights, glitz and glamour?",6,19 May 2008,"This review was originally written for South Yorkshire newspapers and featured on BBC Radio Sheffield, Leeds and York.In a bid to fund his Harvard education Ben (Jim Sturgess) is persuaded by his college Maths lecturer (Kevin Spacey) to join a team of top students and embark upon a card-counting hustle in Las Vegas. Ben soon casts aside his geek origins and friends when he finds that his maths genius brings him easy money and easier women at the casino Blackjack Tables. 21 is based on a true story, documenting the rise and fall of a handsome college nerd, as he deals with moral dilemmas, his sexual awakening and the lure of being a high roller.It's great to see that director Robert Luketic has branched out beyond the lurid pink fluffiness of Legally Blonde and got his teeth into something a little more blokey  thankfully he proves himself competent at providing sprightly amusement for both sexes. This is just as much enjoyable schmaltz as anything else Luketic has made; only this time it's lit in neon - Vegas style. The nerd who gets a taste of the cool life has served many a film maker well in the past so it comes as no surprise that Ben's first few Vegas visits provide the film's flightiest scenes. Following this initial buzz, the card playing feels like a missed opportunity. The sheer drama of Blackjack could have been used to great effect, but here screenwriters Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb have failed to capture any of the game's inherent excitement. As a result, 21's numerous casino scenes are all bright lights and no depth. It's what happens when six mathematical whizzes apply a formula to eliminate surprise and doubt.Ben's fellow card counting con-artists are two-dimensional caricatures with simple personality traits that provide an immediate sense of character  a necessity given their limited screen time. At least their varied wardrobe and Beadle-esquire penchant for daft disguises at the tables ensure that they're fun to be around. Stick-on sideburns, cowboy hats and Hooker wigs are probably not the most proficient means of going unnoticed, even in Vegas, and contrary to the film's 'true story' mantle it does require that you suspend belief. It's not just the outlandish costumes and the contradictory role of Ben's hunky geek that pushes the boundaries of reality either; the film's love interest Jill (Kate Bosworth), happens to be an intellectual who would look more at home on the catwalk or the school's cheerleading squad than hitting the books. It's testament to the quality of the two young leads that the more far-fetched elements of 21 don't become a grating distraction. Bosworth is sweet, sassy, cool and collected yet sufficiently feisty as the object of Ben's affections. But it's Sturgess who makes the movie. The young Brit, who recently starred in 'That Other Boleyn Girl' (reviewed on these very pages several weeks ago) is like a young John Cusack, having a charismatic, natural appeal that gives the movie a solid heart. Spacey is clearly enjoying himself immensely playing Professor Mickey Rosa, maintaining an undercurrent of menace throughout his role as the team's leader - a father figure that exploits his adopted 'children'. Unfortunately Laurence Fishburne is surprisingly limp as the villain of the piece, playing a security supervisor from the old school, on the brink of being usurped by new technology. He's more of a wet lettuce than a hardened pit boss employed to doll out punishment to cheats and hustlers. The only truly bad hand that the film plays is during the finale; no amount of bluffing can disguise the obvious con and it plays out unconvincingly. This doesn't tarnish the film too much  it deals out plenty of fun for the most part, and it's all wrapped up quickly and with plenty of gusto. As shallow entertainment 21 is a safe bet, but like Vegas, you shouldn't expect to find much in the way of substance behind all the glitz and glamour.",21
163,VoiceOfEurope,"Take off in a dull, grey winter, and land in an everlasting subtropic summer",7,12 October 2008,"Even though 21 constitutes of elements you can find in a lot of movies, I did not feel I was watching the thirty-fourth version of the poor, miserable kid getting rich and then losing it all again, so there can be a lesson learnt, that it is not money that makes our life but honest relationships and loyalty. All was there, in the script, for it to be a forgettable flick full of uninteresting characters, common places and shallow moralizing, but good pacing, nice photographing and a terrific Kevin Spacey made it a good past-time to sit it through. A heartfelt performance from Jim Sturgess was just another surprising add-on.I am not a huge fan of cards, but this film has implanted an honest curiosity in me for blackjack. I know the system these kids follow is partly false - it has to be; I never endorsed a film teaching you to cheat, to build bombs out of household materials, to paralyze somebody by tapping on a hidden stress point -, still, it makes me wonder what stunts you can pull to enhance your chances of winning in card games.The last action sequence, however, is too very reminiscent of the plots of cheap B movies and there also are some awkward moments - very unlikely situations - throughout the whole movie, nevertheless, I tend to like it. Regardless of how things conclude, it gives you back your childish hopes and dreams of once kicking it big time.You too, like Ben Campbell, can get fooled by the fake facade of Vegas - the city that only comes to life when it is soaking in floodlight -, and the blinding contrast it shows with the grey, slushy winter streets of the traditional, WASP college cities of the Northeast.",21
164,dominicpearson,Enjoyable if not a little generic,7,29 December 2009,"I, like lots of others, am captivated by the idea of hitting Vegas and winning big at the tables. We would love to be able to beat the house but live with the knowledge that the decks are deeply stacked against us. Which is why I loved the premise of this film - a team of MIT students with the intelligence and guts to do so take on the casinos and win. Well, kind of.The first point for anyone watching this who has any knowledge of the book/true story that the film is based on - creative licence has been used quite liberally. Not that this is a bad thing - without it we would have been denied Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburnes performances which are, as ever, very assured if not their best.The story develops a little too quickly for my liking but I am aware of the time constraints a film like this suffers from. My main issue is that there just did not seem to be sufficient character depth, especially for the supporting cast. Kate Bosworths love interest almost gave us a back story but all we learnt was that her father played blackjack, lost a huge hand and is now ""gone"". The other team members are so transparent as to be see through. You don't care for them, shown when the other big money player (I don't recall his name!) is booted from the team. You have no empathy for him and the feelings of jealousy he is having. The story continues without a second thought.With a little more effort from the writers I think an extra dimension could have been given to the film, particularly with Bens relationship with his teammates. Its a shame as the friendship he has with his ""geek"" friends seems genuine and you feel for them as he begins becoming distant from them.I understand the reasons the film was written like this - the relationship between Ben and Kevin Spacey's character is the crux of the film and, more specifically, how easily and quickly Ben becomes corrupted. And it is this corruption that proves the second fault in the film - we go from seeing a well rounded, likable character fully focused on the job he is doing fall from grace in the space of a couple of scenes and find redemption in a few more. It all happens too quickly and without any real conviction that this is in his character to switch so violently against character in such a short space of time.He gets everything he wants and does not seem to pay for his arrogance and mistakes much less learn from them. Indeed, he seemed proud of his story, (which includes dishonesty, double crossing, promiscuity and all the excesses of a life in Vegas as a high stakes gambler) I would question whether an establishment such as Harvard would really want to give such a prestigious scholarship to someone of such questionable character?! The other main problem I have with the film is that the ending is a little too Hollywood - he walks away unscathed and with the ""life experience"" he needs, the security guard gets his pension and Kevin Spacey is the only one who is punished. Lets remember that Ben was keeping the money in his roof and breaking the same tax laws as his mentor! But for these faults, however, there is a gripping thriller/drama that is well worth checking out. I always enjoy Kevin Spacey. His ability to control his menace throughout before unleashing his true, nasty personality in two or three quietly gripping scenes was a particular highlight. Here is a person who gains the full, unquestioned trust of his pupils, uses them and spits them out when they are no longer of use to him. He is manipulation personified.Laurence Fishburne is also very believable as the old school Vegas security struggling to come to terms with the future and, indeed, his past. The scenes where he is ""interogating"" the card counters is reminiscent of Christopher Walken in True Romance - he exudes very confident malice, a softly spoken tough guy that you will not want to cross again.The score of the film is perfect as well. It complements the story perfectly. The picture itself is shot very stylistically, which is something you expect from a film of this nature. I can recommend this film for someone with a spare couple of hours to fill - sit back, relax and enjoy the ride! 6.5/10",21
165,siandrew-57119,I'd give it 0 stars if I could,1,5 April 2021,"Probably the worst film I've ever seen. I think a 15 year old could've written a better script, didn't get to the end everyone decided it too was painful to watch. Wouldn't recommend to anyone.",21
166,owen9825,Interesting plot with unappealing characters,7,8 April 2012,"The plot about the professor training these people to count cards was interesting, but it seemed totally unnecessary to recruit bright engineers and the like.The idea that this guy was a promising engineer who wanted to give all that up and go to medical school already made it difficult for me to like him.If you end up watching this, you'll see that the main character does plenty of other deeds that make it unappealing for viewers to like him and in fact I didn't really like anyone on the card-counting team. They all cheated on tax and none had any ambition for using the money on anything other than a good time or (in the main character's case) an unnecessary degree.The notion that this engineer devised a better method than the famous ""Newton method"" was preposterous. Furthermore, being good at engineering-type mathematics would not imply that he'd be quick at calculating the price of a suit.",21

Although this was based on a true story, I thought the ending was also horribly predictable as I could see the ""twist"" coming a mile off which sullied it slightly, and despite its obvious merits I didn't feel the film sucked me in at all.On the plus sides Kevin Spacey really stood out for me, as he usually does I suppose, but his performance was probably one of the highlights of the film. Once the film entered full flow when the counting started, as a bit of cards fan, I found the system and gambling scenes quite intriguing, and surprisingly 21 also provided quite a few good laughs.Overall by no means one of the best films of the year, but well worth seeing.",21
168,SiLenTxfAiRy,great movie! (SPOILERS),7,8 April 2008,"I suppose the first time I saw a preview for 21 was probably close to 7 months ago, so I did know there was a film coming out and it looked fairly interesting. Since I am getting around the age of being able to gamble and go to vegas, it was nice being able to see the scene of vegas in an up-to-date movie! I love the characters, and im sorry the Asian kid.. haha all I could think of was disturbia ringtone.. HAHA!I loved the way Kevin Spacey played the whole good guy, bad guy role.. It was nice seeing him in a role like this, simply because I relate him back to Pay it Forward, and I believe that this is a great role for his personality. The main character does a great job really showing the struggles that college students do face everyday. Though most of us cannot say that we have a 4.0 at MIT and are awaiting money to attend Harvard, I can personally relate to the financial struggle college does bring to myself personally. Maybe I should go card count!??Once you started to pay attention I really began figuring out the true meaning behind card counting and it really is very simple, with the word connection to the card value. As for the gestures, they were a big out there, and I really think that Vegas PD would catch on to the whole arm behind the back thing 10 times quicker, simply because it is such a drastic move. The movie is great, and I personally loved it because it played out the roles of each of the characters and came to a conclusion with all of them. Sorry, but it was nice seeing what happened to Spacey at the end. :]7 out of 10! Go see this film!",21

He looks like he's an England actor, so expressive and into it, a really train wreck actor - Kevin Spacey in the role of the teacher and the business man. Great Work, actually were two different roles in one! - Pretty good even the ""girl"" of the movie Kate Bosworth - Fishburne not at his best performance, but still good as the Casino Rock.And the steak is always up to the top. Never fall asleep, or loosing attention, thanx so much to Jim Sturges. And a really good plot.I can say I was thinking the movie was about to ending with the reconciliation between Kevin Spacey and Jim, like father and son, or something like that. And I get terribly surprised by the changing of the point of view.Yes, Surprisingly interesting and cool!",21
170,patricklewallen,It's Kevin Spacey... what more do you need,8,30 March 2008,"I just recently saw this movie and was more impressed than I thought I was going to be. The best part of the movie was the pacing. It jumped right into the action that everyone wanted to see after giving a very brief set-up of the main characters, and then jumped straight into the action! The actors did an exceptional job with their roles, including even the minor roles, portraying exactly what was necessary. Kevin Spacey, of course, stole the movie with his absolute command of every situation, both as the commanding character and the obviously experienced actor. Because of his amazing ability, other actors stepped up to the plate, taking risks that I believe would have otherwise not been taken. I would recommend this movie for about anyone. Don't look for an ending, just let it happen for you. Overall, this movie deserves an A-. Very great film!",21

Kevin Spacey needs to keep the blackjack winnings for his retirement and give up acting.What's with the Tobey McGuire (yawn also) wanna-be?

172,lance24,"Slow paced, predictable movie we've seen before",5,29 March 2008,"You know the studio is nervous about a film when the publicists are leaking stories about the ""steamy"" love scene between the stars. (As it turns out there was a harmless 10 second scene that had no steam and no passion). ""21"" is an unusually slow paced drama loosely based on a card counting scheme pulled off (at least for a while) by some very smart MIT students. The fingers of the development executives are all over this film--an unconvincing love story about a nerd who gets the hot chick; the devious professor masterminding the kids for reasons that are murky; the security team worried about how advancing technology is impacting their careers, once based on gut and guile. The film meanders to find a real theme and the conceit that the single smartest student at MIT had to count cards in Vegas to pay for Harvard Medical School (according to the movie only one scholarship per year is granted and the last recipient was a Korean with one leg!!) is preposterous. Apparently, student loans are a thing of the past. Instead of a fast paced story about greed (which is what this film should have been about), we get a meandering drama that fails to convince at any level. The acting was generally good considering some of the ridiculous dialog that the actors had to embrace. Kate Bosworth has lost any sex appeal she may have had--anorexia ain't sexy. Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne get a chance to ham it up a bit. In the end, the film is too driven by a need to please all quadrants and ends up pleasing none.",21
173,space_base,Highly entertaining despite historical Inaccuracies,6,24 March 2008,"Okay, first let's dispense with the pleasantries. Jim Sturgess, Laurence Fishburne, and Kevin Spacey are all of course their perpetually brilliant selves. The script is nice and tight, with plenty of physical and verbal humor. It's a thoroughly enjoyable movie...but Anyone who's a fan of the real story though will be both off put and possibly offended. In the book Bringing down the House, the four main students are all Asian. I understand this is an American movie, so I can see why the studio would cast mostly white people...hey, it's money what can you say? The thing that irks me SO much is the time frame. The MIT Blackjack team originated in the late 70's. This incident, with Ben Campbell, took place in '94. There was no Vitamin Water and there were definitely no PSP's. We're supposedly watching the story in modern times as they face a software program developed over a decade ago!

There was one scene where the ""Ocean 11 highschoolers"" were power walking in slow motion down the hall of their highschool yet their alliance was supposedly secret. The ending was also a bit cliché' as the main guy took down the main bad guy, I'm guessing he was murdered by the casino thugs although they just kind of swept that part under the rug. So he's a ""hero"" for getting his evil highschool teacher killed? Anyways, not too bad, not too good. By the way, does every Hollywood movie have to have love interests and do they always have to ""get the girl""? Why?",21
175,travis36,Watch for the entertainment value..not the factual,7,25 June 2018,Usually a story based on actual facts makes for a great watch. However this movie had quite a few moments that questioned the believability. I gave it a 7 out of 10 purely based on the entertainment value. As I watched the movie I tried to forget that it was based on actual events so I would not be so focused on trying to believe some of the things the characters did that I am sure the real students did not do. For instance returning to the same casino over and over made for some contrived drama but would be very unlikely given the intelligence of those involved. I did learn a little bit about 21 and the ideal of card counting but again it was more entertainment. If I were to rate it from the actual events perspective I would only give it a 3 out of 10. Kevin Spacey nailed his part as he usually does,21

I mean they do play blackjack, but it is more about the main character's descent into drinking, lying and gambling than anything else. Then, of course, his turnaround when he realizes the error of his ways.It was fairly well acted... not perfect, but not bad either. I was a little disappointed in Spacey's performance. He is usually very solid, but the problem may have been more with the lines he had to work with than anything else. Fishburn did very well with his part as well. All the other performances seemed a little uninspired. You can tell that there were parts forced into the movie that weren't in the true story it is based on. ... and it is pretty predictable It was a decent way to spend a couple of hours, but I probably would pass it up until DVD.Overall the story was pretty good, probably because it was based on actual events. So on the Gargamel scale I give 1 for story 0.5 for acting, 0 nudity, 0 gunfire/explosions and 0 car chases. That gives us a whopping 1.5 on my scale or a 3 on the IMDb 10pt scale.",21

Furthermore, the professor (who has everything to lose in this scenario) recruits his super-smart students in some kind of organized crime syndicate that flies to Vegas on the weekends.Oh, and the super-smart geek changes his mind about joining the blackjack group for absolutely no discernible reason. He turns down the brilliant professor. Then he turns down the beautiful temptress. Then, suddenly, for seemingly no reason whatsoever, he shows up to the card-counting class.Oh, and instead of flying to Vegas and withdrawing the money there, these supposedly super-smart geeks stuff the money into their pants to get it through airport security.Oh, and the card counters, who are not supposed to know each other, walk into every single casino in a dramatic slow-motion Delta formation -- and gather in the same suite to plan their strategy, as if there are no cameras in the hotel portion.Oh, and 10,000 security cameras on the floor are not supposed to notice the tall, lanky HOT women obviously and conspicuously CROSSING THEIR ARMS BEHIND THEM to signal the super-smart geeks at the high-roller tables.Oh, and the super-smart professor who manufactured this brilliant scheme does not suspect a thing when his ostracized prodigy comes back to the fold to help him win more money without the professor lifting a finger.Get my drift? There are more ""roll your eyes"" moments in this movie than any movie I can remember in recent history.

181,TheRationalist,Not The Movie It Could Have Been,5,31 March 2008,"This movie was based on a true story, and if the makers had stuck closer to the true story it could have been a much better movie. But no, they had to Hollywoodize it and dumb it down so that anyone with the least knowledge of the game of blackjack and how casinos operate will be saying ""No way"" to themselves all through the movie. It actually ends up with a chase scene and characters running through the kitchen, for God's sake.In real life the team's success was 90% in being careful to not attract the attention of the casinos detectors and only 10% in their scheme, which was based on the well-known technique of card-counting to get an edge. In the movie, the team's actions were childishly crude even to the point of continually returning to the same casino...so the movie makers could develop the characters of the casino bad guys. In real life the team was careful to not win much at any one table or at any one casino, not more than $1,000 a session, which would be well within the amount any lucky player might win without counting. In the movie they hit the same table for tens of thousands of dollars, which would have set off alarms all over Nevada. Even the hand signals the team used in the movie were childishly obvious. All this by the supposedly brilliant MIT students and professor. No way.The movie actually had the bad casino guys torturing card counters when they caught them. No way. In real life a casino has the right, tested in court, to kick anyone out and ban them from ever playing again...they do not have to prove cheating or card-counting, they do it under the laws of trespassing on their private property and this is what they do. Remember, card-counters are only making what amounts to an hourly wage, so they are not a serious threat to a casino.Another example of the Hollywood treatment was that after showing how brilliant Ben was at counting cards when they were recruiting him, he was not used as the card counter, he was used as the big bettor and one of the female team members did the counting.an entertaining movie for someone not knowledgeable or much interested in real life casino gambling, but dumb and dumber for those who are.",21

Being a film with Sturgess, Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishbourne, I was pretty stoked for this film. However, 21 turns out to be quite drawn out and the trailer for the film seemed more exciting.The story is inspired by a very popular book called ""Bringing Down the House"". The main character, Ben Campbell, goes to MIT and need 300,000 dollars to go to med school. To suffice this requirement, he is invited by a group of students to a Blackjack group. He learns the technique of counting cards and goes to Las Vegas every weekend to make money and enjoy the high roller life at the same time.The premise of the story sounds very interesting. However the story seems to stray to many Hollywood clichés. Despite interesting characters, it can be pretty obvious how the characters affect the plot. The film also incorporate multiple strands of storyline together into one film. The film is built of Ben's experiences in Las Vegas, his relationship with his older friends/his mom, and the security professional who is trying to put an end to the Blackjack Team. Although the transitions between storyline are effective, the side stories aren't very exciting to watch and again it is pretty predictable.The dialogue is very slick and fluid although I was not completely assured by Sturgess's ability to act and speak in American English. Also, the film doesn't throughly explain the concept of counting cards. I was confused to what he was doing at many points during the film. Also I think it was possible to cut out some of the scenes in the film. It got a little drawn out and wasn't adding much to the overall story plot.When the ending was nearing, I felt like this was going to end very poorly. It had caused me to temporarily not like any of the characters. However, the film went a little further in the ending than I thought it was going to be and it turned to be a fulfilling ending. Overall, 21 was a bit of a disappointment. Despite the slick dialogue and promising story, it became too predictable and drawn out.",21
183,hardrock666,'21' a disappointing movie on all counts,4,3 August 2008,"""21"" is one of the most disappointing and dismaying movies to emerge from the land of dreams - America. It tells us that immorality is not just a modern motivating mantra, it is fine, if used in the right doses, no matter how many feelings or bones get crushed under one's enterprising spirit.The fact that all the debased characters, using a pack of cards to make a fool of the universe (and that includes us in the audience, watching their Casino Royale-meets-Quentin Tarantino antics), are based on real people doesn't make the film or its characters more interesting. It just makes them more annoying in their ambitions.The central character of a young, middle-class student struggling to make ends meet is played by fairly wooden actor Jim Sturgess, who just might become the latest teen sensation after this film. He has the right attitude of 'I know it all though I may appear stupid and dumb'.When you're young, you do stupid things - like taking on a massive gambling organisation in Las Vegas. But one presumes neither the film's director nor the professor-protagonist who trains his students into reckless and criminal gambling are young and stupid.So what makes the film's sassy premise - gambling your way to doom - such a good idea? There's no tangible explanation why a noble profession like teaching should be turned into a blackjack game. """" is the college-campus version of ""Ocean's 11"". Here, however, the glamour of gambling is much reduced since the protagonists with the cards are confused teenagers who should know better. There's a callow hero and a shallow mentor and the twain never meet as individuals.The other members of the blackjack team are woefully hazy in their depiction, as though the director didn't want to invest too much time and energy getting into the fringe players' lives.There are some expertly done shots of the casino's compulsions spilling into colourful chips in a splendid tumble. But that's it. """" is more about the hype and hip than the plot and script. There're no surprises in the way the maths team subverts its art into a Zen of vice.You really can't like these guys, let alone feel connected with them. Not when the young hero sells out his guru to the casino goons in return for his own freedom. He walks free. So do we. But after two hours of wondering which side we are on.",21
184,Layput,falls short of brilliance,3,11 June 2008,"first, Jim Sturgess is just the perfect opposite of Kevin spacey's versatility. though he did look like a dork, he didn't look anything like brilliant. his acting was really really disappointing; lacking too much in expression and conviction, lacking in subtlety and emotion. lacking in almost everything. why him? second, the plot was very ambitious but lacked the necessary intelligent twists and means, not that the main character was unable to portray his part convincingly, but that it was just too damn simple, clichéd, and threadbare.third, the film wanted to depict that some of the best institutions in the world harbor incorrigible offenders amid all the years of teaching of doing what is right. Mr. spacey and MIT just gambled their names in vain. this is just the worst film Kevin spacey had been into.fourth, if this film were intended for the intelligent audience, then it should have delivered crafty story lines. but by the looks of it, it really was anything but intelligent.overall, this movie was a complete waste of time. the only redeeming part this movie has to offer is the seemingly less obvious twist that Mr Sturgess so sorely failed to orchestrate.",21

The cast and character were really good, they fit well with their character. The character of Fisher was quickly gone, I believe he could give more spice to the story as well as a good nemesis. At first, I thought that the Kevin Spacey, the professor was actually speaks to his character, a professor who teach his student not to sell them out.I wonder if this was really happened in MIT, if this professor do really exist and if Ben Campbell did really good in school.Overall, the movie was really a blast to the movie goer.

186,muddam,Entertaining & Wonderful Concept,8,2 March 2009,"Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) is a student at MIT. He needs 300,000 dollars to fund his higher education at Harvard Medical School. Prof. Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey) is a maths professor at MIT. He is amazed with mathematical skill and the ability to think rationally without any emotional attachment of Ben. Micky assembles a tiny group of his best students and train them to beat the game of Black Jack. After initial resistance, Ben joins that team. They go to Los Vegas in every weekend to win loads of money at casinos by playing Black Jack game. The rest of the story is all about whether Ben could achieve his goal of raising 300,000 dollars for his med school or not.The fascinating story of this film is about a bunch of students robbing the casinos by beating the black jack game. It also has the ingredients of love and revenge.VARIABLE CHANGE: The professor explains the concept of variable change in the beginning of the film. And the same concept is used against the professor towards the climax.TAILPIECE: 21 is based on a real story that happened in MIT. There is a saying that 'always the house wins' in any Casino. But a group of brilliant students robbing the Casino is a wonderful concept.",21
187,vdecaire,"Exuberant, smart and fast-paced",7,10 April 2008,"In this exuberant, smart and fast-paced drama/comedy, there is no denying that you can't have fun watching a hard working, but financially struggling kid, Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) become seduced by the wily king of card-counting Mickey Rosa (Kevin Spacey). It is good to have thrown in such a veteran actor like Spacey into a mix of new comers like Campbell, Kate Bosworth or Aaron Yoo. Also Spacy produced the film, based on Ben Mezrich's autobiographical novel ""Bringing Down The House"" which chronicles the uprising and downfall of the group of card-counters. Campbell is a hard-working kid that uses his intellect to arouse the attention of his mathematics teacher, who just happens to be the leader of a group of intelligent cheaters who go to Las Vegas every weekend to, well, count-cards. At first Campbell is skeptical in taking part in such an activity, with a history as unnerving as it is, but being informed that there is no danger and it is not at all illegal, he rethinks, because in order to get into Harvard Med, he needs 300,000$. Mickey informs him that within a month of joining them on their escapades, he will have the money easily. The humor is spread through the film, the dramatic elements are the dangers that the weary kid faces, being Casinoss what they are with security, and the serious points about what greed and desire do to you. Campbell said he was only in for the money he needed to get into Harvard, but it is harder to stop then he thinks. That is why Spacey's role as Mickey is so important, the mentor is both guiding them on the table, and off the table. He was more right about Vegas then anyone. Director Robert Luketic's trip from chick flicks like ""Legally Blonde"" and ""Monster-In-Law"" to this was quite a voyage, but there is a sub-text that remains true to his conception that 'the law is the law, and heck if were gonna break it...'. And the lead protagonist in this film really developed from the quiet, geeky kid to the partying and greedy monster that Vegas spawned was a very down-hill, bumpy trip that would land him right back to the drawing board, but the end is one that came to no surprise, but to my regret, I can't tell you just yet. See it yourself, it was a fun trip. Funny.",21
188,peterroeder34,This movie is awful,5,12 July 2012,"I'm a Danish chess, backgammon and card-player, and I must say I am disgusted by this movie. Not only is the drama very boring and uninteresting but the card parts are also very, very bad. It is like those chess and poker movies where they just didn't bother to make it right. It's like they have thought ""the audience is not going to know blackjack anyway, so who cares?"" However, if you watch this movie to learn something about cards you are going to be very disappointed. Sure, the guy from ""Se7en"" is great but, come on, Matt Damon got at lot of things right in the movie ""Rounders"". This movie ""21"" gets almost nothing right and there is nothing to be learned from it.",21
189,sannelehmann,Mildly entertaining movie weak on characterization,5,4 November 2009,"21 tells the story about young MIT student Ben Cambell who is trying to somehow finance Harvard medical school. He is admitted the school but does not have the funds to pay for it. He is a brilliant student in the areas of mathematics and logic and by chance is spotted by his teacher Michael Rosa, who welcomes him into his student group of competent card counters.In my view the theme of the film is achievement. What does it mean to achieve something and are all the ways of achieving great things legitimate? This central theme is especially apparent when looking at Bens relationship with his old friends that cools way down when he starts spending all his weekends in Vegas, and suddenly does not have the time for his buddies anymore. It is precisely in Ben's treatment of his friends that we really begin to question the legitimacy of his new path to gaining funds for MED school. The film does engage its audience but to my mind the characters surrounding Ben are way too weak. There are too many unanswered questions about the motivation of the other characters. For instance about the teacher Rosa. How is he using all the money he wins? What happened in the past? The love interest Jill Taylor seems more of an image than a real character - what is her motivation? The same goes for the other team members. The central characters are portrayed in a sketchy manner where we do not have any idea about their motivation. It is only Ben's story and Ben's motivation that is part of the film. It would have been a much stronger film, if the theme of achievement would have been supported in the characterization of the other characters in the film.",21
190,himaank,Lucky no. 21!,8,3 October 2008,"According to me, not taking risks in life is the biggest damn risk you can ever take! How can you live without taking risks? You need to take chances and go with your instincts. Taking risk is like living on the edge. Your pulse is pounding like hammer, heart will blow out of your chest anytime and you are sweating like hell. Getting this adrenaline is one hell of an experience. On this same theme, 21 is all about taking chances on your caliber with little planning. It is based on a true story of five MIT students trying their special skills to remember the flow of playing cards and trying it out in the amazing world of Vegas. Beautiful Vegas- The only place in this world where you enjoy only when you're lost! The movie starts with an amazing one long shot introducing Jim Sturgess-the central character. He is in desperate need of money required to study in Harvard. He is trying hard but that's not enough at all. He then joined his professor Kevin Spacey and gang of four students to explore the gambling world of Vegas. Plan is to make a quick fortune with their skills to count cards while playing. How Jim joins this group, gets addicted and finally, comes out of it is what the movie follows. Crisp narration by the director, well thought of script and excellent cinematography is enough to keep you engaging. Though you can predict the outline as what will happen next but the way it is been shot has made this movie an interesting watch. Jim as the main lead has done full justice to his role and so do Kevin Spacey. The supporting crew including Jim's friends and four students as partners in crime is worth watching. Laurence fishburne too looks so real in his character. In a good movie, every character is assigned to bring out specific emotions and feel like love, fear, etc. In 21, each character is for specific feelings. You can relate feeling of fear, love, betrayal, anger, affection, confusion and etc with each character.Another best thing about this movie is the climax. I think the director knew that his audience is smart and they can easily predict what will be coming in the end. This is where director uses an interesting twist which excites the viewers and surprise them. In 21, my favourite scene is not one but various close-up shots of actors playing at tables in the casino. Brilliance of great camera work. Movie doesn't have punchy dialogues which I think is an deliberate attempt. Characters could've had become loud and over acted with heavy dialogues which is not at all required here. Characters in this movie have deliberately been kept low and close to reality. 21 gives a fresh feeling with its gripping script, focused narration and great star cast. And that's the reason why I thoroughly enjoyed the new hit formula of movie making called 21.",21
191,aourchan,Typical,4,29 July 2008,"I'm not going to pretend that I am some sort of movie professor or something like that, but am I the only one who expects more from movies? I don't understand how this movie has a rating of about 7. Before watching the movie I could have told anyone who would listen the exact plot line up until the last 7-10 minutes of the movie where they finally decide to add a slight twist to the plot. Other then those few minutes this is just your typical Hollywood movie these days with a cookie cutter script. The difference in quality of this movie compared to real movies is just incredible, because everyone who was a part of this movie just decided that they wanted to make some stupid popcorn flick movie for some teens and people who think they can learn to count cards from this movie. Everything about this movie reeks with mediocrity, apart from maybe Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishbourne who I think play their parts well. This is just another typical movie made in a time when it is better just to pump out crap rather than take a chance and try to make something that 1. makes people think 2. makes people feel something. I hate movies like this but they are becoming more and more common. I mean movies are made to entertain, but seeing the same cookie cutter plot in 50 different movies each year is not entertaining. This movie is not good and its not bad. If I were to make a recommendation I would say not to waste your time watching it, because even if you haven't seen this movie you've seen this plot before.",21

I liked must of the ""true"" parts of the story--i.e., the true anecdotes lifted from the book, like the test at the local illegal blackjack room. The best friends (total fiction) were cute and made for some comic relief.This COULD have been a really good movie if it followed the true story closer though, rather than having the ridiculous premises that it did. Their was plenty of conflict for the protagonists in the book. Example: having the coed girlfriend at MIT at the same time he was dating an NBA cheerleader! (that was good stuff!)

Trite in every sense of the word, I hope Spacey got paid well as this thing certainly didn't propel his career anywhere.

The cinematography captured the bright lights of Vegas particularly well and the sheer fun and excitement of what they were doing was well communicated to the audience.

I don't know anything about blackjack nor I understood its aspects by watching the movie, yet it was fun. With its protagonists and leading character being the brightest minds of the MIT, some of the conversations in the movie tend to make you look stupid. The scene when Ben Campbell explains how he will choose the door behind which the car will be present in a game show accounting for some hi funda factors like Variable change is a case in the point. I have to confess that I did not make out anything about it.There are many such instances, but the movie is not about the technicalities. It is about the life changing experience that Ben undergoes through the steps that he undertakes to collect money to fund his Harvard ambitions. The turn of things are indeed bizarre and certainly he does dazzle and jump out to merit your attention.This is a movie which students on the crossroads of moving abroad for pursuing higher studies will relate to more than others but having said that, it is a movie for all.

As for plot, character, etc.: who cares? Spacey almost has enough gusto to distract us from the fact that his character is utterly improbable and ridiculous -- almost. ""Nice guy"" Ben is corrupted so fast and then uncorrupted just as fast that it's amazing we don't have whiplash. All the other ""characters"" are empty. The main girl was (sexy) and Boswroth did what she could -- but she was a plot element, not a character. The nerdy friends made no sense: did the filmmakers spend any time at M.I.T.? And the dialog! Except for the initial classroom exchange between the professor and the student (a game show analogy), which was somewhat credible banter, most everything else was ""dialog of the obvious: "" I did bad, I did the wrong thing, sorry...."" But the most offensive thing is that it all comes down to being an advertisement for the casinos ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" may play on the soundtrack, but the message is that you ~can~ always get what you want: the girl, the scholarship...: just go to Vegas ; but if that's the case, why waste money on going to see the film: watch any free TV show about Vegas and/or playing poker, or wait for the DVD if nothing else is exciting for that week.",21

Instead I found myself feeling anxious the whole time, waiting for the team to fail and inevitably loose all there money. Not the edge of you seat anxious, more the awkward 'why are they doing this' anxious. Of course it came to a relatively satisfying conclusion, as these types of films often do, but I gained little enjoyment from watching this as it was so obvious that everything had to go wrong at some point.Saying this, if you like cards and tense situations then this may be a good film for you. The acting was below average from most of the leads but, as always, Kevin spacey is a delight to watch.

His American accent was flawless and his chemistry with both Kate Bosworth and Kevin Spacey was perfect.I was never a fan of Spacey. I'm still not but he did a really good job in this movie.

206,johnnycandle,What a waste..,4,31 July 2008,"This stands out as an illustration of just how difficult it is to make a good film.Here we have a talented cast, a superb location and a script based on a successful (and true) story. It should be great, but it isn't even close. Why? Well, there's nothing amazing or even surprising about the central ""scam"" itself. Perhaps it was simplified for the movie, but you certainly do not need to be a maths genius to do what the MIT students do. This of course is fine in itself, but the whole movie is shot as if it's some amazing Oceans 11 style plot complete with slow motion shots of the gang exiting the casino. It just doesn't gel at all with what is a down to earth, old as the hills, easily understood method of increasing your chances of winning at Black Jack.The biggest problem however, is the characters. The film could have stood the stereotypes of the gamblers gang if the leads were developed (including surprisingly, Spacey), but they're not. Jill (Kate Bosworth) is the romantic interest and starts off as a slightly mysterious seductress that sucks our hero, Ben, into the world of Vegas gambling. However, part way into the movie, she completely changes into Ben's sensible girlfriend, and no longer seems like a person who would even be attracted by the high risks and bright lights of their Vegas plan.Even that would be OK if our hero kept our interest going, but, after joining up with the team of gamblers, Ben goes from sympathetic nerd to obnoxious tosser. And he stays that way. The ending suggests that we were supposed to like, or at least be impressed by him, but he does nothing whatsoever to encourage that.All in all, this is a massively disappointing movie.",21
207,mike872,21 A Bad Shuffle of a Superb Nonfiction Classic,4,31 March 2008,"21 is a poor version of Ben Mezrich's best-selling 2002 Bringing Down the House. The original story is about five Asian MIT students who walked off with $3 million card counting at various casinos around the country, beginning in the early nineties.The movie makers have constructed a half-baked love story that isn't actually in the book. With the romantic intrusion, the thriller aspect of the original is lost. The book may have been tricked up a little. But 21, the movieseems bent on helping casino ecurity Bull Laurence Fishburne keep his image intact and that of the Vegas casinos unblemished. Because the characters appear to be playing in real Las Vegas casinos, at least at times, it looks as if producers may have cut a deal with Vegas to soften both Fishburne's tough guy image and minimize embarrassment the Casinos suffered at the hands of the merry MIT crew.In the book, the casinos and their pit bosses and security people were clods who never caught onto a thing for over six years. The movie hasn't got time for that long a wait. Fishburne is suspicious of lead Ben Campbell almost instantly.Here's a major myth that grew up in the seventies that the book explodes: Casinos spread the story that once multi-decks were placed in shoes, card counting wouldn't work anymore. In fact, multi-decks actually improved odds for counting players by lengthening the period of time that dealer's hands stayed hot for players and cold for dealers.In the film the MIT crew does all its work in Vegas. In the book, the MIT gang went to riverboats around Chicago, to Louisiana and Missisippi Indian casinos and even overseas to Monte Carlo and Cannes.In the film, Kevin Spacey is an MIT math prof who spearheads the Casino Con and enlists his own students to be his players. A college girl is in love with the hero Ben Campbell. In reality, all of the players were Asians who wore disguises and masqueraded as rich orientals out to blow big money at the tables. Mickey(Spacey), the crew leader and organizer is not an MIT prof but a professional gambler.The movie constructs a fiction that Campbell only wants to make $300,000 to finance his education at Harvard as a doctor. The truth is the real Jeff Ma never went to Med School and never wanted to. Ma and the four orientals who took down Vegas, worked the various casinos for nearly ten years and only gave it up when most casinos in the country had identified them and they could no longer play.Somewhere in the middle of the book Mickey and the Ben Campbell character modeled on Jeff Ma split, and begin running separate teams in the casinos. The movie has Mickey (Spacey) fingering Ben and his team to Casino Security. That would have exposed Mickey too. Its absurd. In fact, though there was some minor bad blood after the split, it was in the interests of both teams to keep quiet about one another.In the book, the players wore disguises always and changed them often so they wouldn't be recognized when they returned to the same casinos. The movie talked of disguises but Ben never actually wore won except once. It made no sense. He'd have been caught on the second visit without a disguise. In the film, one of the hand signals to tip the Ben to the 'hot' blackjack table, was so blatantly obvious, no pit manager or security bull could have missed it.The movie left two nerdy friends of Ben Campbell's lurking around MIT clueless about Ben's weekend table action. Those characters and the plots around them were lame. The whole college crosscut was so weak they might just as well have eliminated it altogether. Trying to merge the college weekdays and weekend gambling simply didn't play. Campbell (Jim Sturges) was supposed to have been half-enticed into the ring by his yen for fellow student Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth). But the romance seemed half-hearted once underway. The book knew better. The deceptions and nearly being caught by security time after time took up all the action and made the book a unique thriller. Movie makers constructed a supposed collusion between Campbell and Security Bull Fishburne to get even with Mickey. The tacked on ending was so absurd anyone could see through it. In fact, Jeff Ma and the four fellow MIT students worked the casinos for nearly ten years and were well into their thirties before they quit. Only near the end of that time were they thoroughly caught, identified and forced to stop. I'm not sure any of them even graduated from MIT.Spacey and Fishburne give routine performances as if they couldn't take the film seriously. I wonder why? In the washroom afterward I told two twenty somethings what a pack of lies the film was and gave them the book title so they could read the true story. 21 could have been a remarkable film in the hands of a writer-director like Dave Mamet. The film was marekt designed as a cross between Wedding Crashers and a bad Adam Sandler movie. A few of the six college students behind me kept mistaking ordinary lines as American Pie easy laughs, but the rest of the audience stayed silent.The Filmmakers, who are not worth mentioning, destroyed a perfectly wonderful story that could have been a great movie. They doubled down in duplicity.",21
208,hunk-of-monk,"Enjoyable movie, that attempts to span several different genres with varying success",5,29 April 2008,"21; a movie about an exceptionally talented young mathematician, Ben, who reluctantly joins 4 other students in an attempt to count cards in Vegas and raise $300,000 in order to attend Harvard School of Medicine, but Ben soon finds the wealth he gains more alluring than he imagined.21's main strength is also its biggest weakness on many occasions, it tries very hard to span several different genres; smart thriller, Apatow style geek comedy, teen coming of age drama, sweet romance and profound morality tale. 21 dubiously juggles these balls, for the most part, successfully. The plot is, more often than not, engrossing, Ben's close friends provide an effective comedic counterbalance to the moralising of the main Vegas storyline, Kevin spacey and the other students manage to prop up an often two-dimensional performance from Jim Sturgess (for example: whenever something happens to Ben that is new or outside of his comfort zone, Sturgess does the same breathy sigh and looks at the floor) while the tale's concluding moral, one that rewards friendship, loyalty, reminds you not to forget who you are once you achieve success, and values hard work over corruption, may seem like a tale that's been told before, but remains a worthwhile message nonetheless.Unfortunately, 21 drops a juggling ball or two along the way. An insistence to portray Ben as some sort of nerdy hero causes the film to indulge in trite clichés, most annoyingly, Ben's initial encounter with the card counting students, a shameful example of the 'outsider that's learnt to be accepted by the cooler kids' storyline. The romantic subplot appears underdeveloped and rather impromptu. Excursionary story lines that, while enjoyable, don't often add much to the overall plot bring about an excessive use of montage to hurry the story along, which can become tiresome and result in a loss of tension in the casino scenes (as opposed to the tense and gripping games in Casino Royale). The final twists are possibly the biggest let down though, predictable and too sugary , they may be impressive to the pre and early teen audience, but anyone older should really be left wanting something more substantial.21 is a film that lets itself down by trying to be too many things to too many people, (ambition is good, but you can't please everyone) which is a shame, because it could have been a really great escapist fantasy and despite its many flaws this was an enjoyable Vegas caper.",21
209,mklasr,Failed to meet my low expectations,2,5 February 2009,"There were 2 aspects to the 1980's movie ""Soul Man"", and they have each been featured in their own 2008 movie. Robert Downey Junior stole the show in ""Tropic Thunder"" by revisiting the concept of a White Man acting like a Black Man. 21 revisited the idea of a successful Harvard applicant faced with the daunting task of having to pay its steep tuition.However, that's where the comparisons end. While ""Tropic Thunder"" used the main premise of ""Soul Man"" as a comedic sidebar, this movie used its sidebar as the main premise. No one wants to feel sorry for someone who's admitted into Harvard but can't pay for it. If you got in there, odds are you'd be accepted into a state school which you can most likely afford. Once C. Thomas Howell accepted the scholarship in ""Soul Man"", his inability to pay was no longer an issue. He simply had to live his life undercover as a black student. Ben Campbell never had any obligation to maintain any of his cover stories, only to use a different one each night. C. Thomas Howell was pulled over for no reason by racist cops. Ben Campbell was only caught because he stayed too long at the same table of the same casino.Ben Campbell experienced the seedy underworld of the Las Vegas High Roller. In doing so, he abandoned his close college friends. He then realized that card counting was too risky of a lifestyle to wish on anybody, so he made up with his friends by...teaching them how to count cards? If he had been a drug dealer, would he have ended the movie by giving his friends his remaining crack to sell? I'm proud of him for Graduating from MIT and being accepted into Harvard Medical School, but that doesn't make up for the fact that he never explained the moral of his story. Other than that he now has a story to tell to his admissions officer. Wow, that's deep...",21

211,drawesomeengr,A few smart cats cant do anything many can change the world,4,4 April 2008,"Knowing people that attend MIT, and trying to confirm many of the facts presented in this movie I cannot agree with much of this ""this movie is based on facts"". This movie has a lot of resounding issues with me not to be impartial but a few of these are: All Students are A students, All A Students are Geniuses, All Students that Attend MIT are Great Card Counters for Blackjack, MIT has a History of Card Counting back to when the actor Kevin Spacey playing Micky Rosa, hit the card counting at MIT long before ""21"" unfolded as a flashback.For me genius has anything but to deal with education or institutionalism and more to do with the nature/nurture issues perhaps environment and different approaches to solving problems. Of course there will always be cases in which higher learning enhance the gifts of some but most geniuses swing by the wayside of conventional metrics.This segmenting society into the leaders and the followers or the gift of a degree often to find a job which this movie appears to suggest is the way of life is unfortunately in many cases reality and we furnish our fortune 500s with tic tacs. Tic tacs in the sense that they are hard coated almost perfect replicas of what industry requires, we throw away tic tacs that are not shaped uniformly. A few of these throw aways are so disgusted with the system they start companies like ""Microsoft"" and ""Apple"" to name a few.Telling someone they're not good enough for something and that another person is a more suitable candidate is great as it was approached in this movie. The issue that resounded with me was this means to an end to make the cut by describing trials and tribulations with a casino scheme as a means to attain acceptance which seems rather like a casino advertisement. ""Hey get busted by the security at a casino and we consider you really smart and worthy of a scholarship"" I will admit we live in a complex almost impractical world everyone knows the saying ""life is not fair"" but for many of us we try to make the best of it. For me as someone in the 25-29 demographic I have some serious reservations with what this movie is telling people that are struggling with money and other pressures associated with life. This casino option is the wrong message to send, Hollywood is a powerful message sender and these are the wrong messages; Gambling doesn't solve anything. Even if Kevin Spaceys character states ""you need to follow the system and not get emotional we arnt gambling here this is a business we are in"" the quote is a summary of what was said and not word for word from the movie. Treat this movie with a grain of salt. I am still researching to see if the facts are even true for the baseline plot (or lack there of with no character development and no glue putting anything other then the money making scheme).All in all this movie may appeal to some who just want to be dazzled by the mighty brilliance of the rich, straight A geniuses of MIT with 4.0s and perfect SAT scores or the romance of the ""geek beauty and the bigger geek"". For me this is not the case. I thought this was a cheap shot at the working middle class and struggling citizens who struggle on a day to day basis to make ends meet and get educated ( college, university). Being successful or great has little to do with MIT, if we look at research itself we find the top schools do not account for a disproportionate amount of good research or scholarly articles amongst all the other universities out there worldwide. Anyone is capable of great things from a bum on the street to research being done at any school with or without resources. These schools like MIT are for the most part well funded and have the power through cash to scoop up talent from lesser known institutions, still most of the break through work is never done in their own institution.All it takes is some hard work and a bit of drive and ""sometimes"" not always assets for higher learning where a university or some vessel capable of providing tools can help, I believe in the next 20 years Google and infrastructure like Google will become the next education or institution dynamic of tomorrow and give these MIT class institutions a run for their money. I have a saying "" a few smart cats cant do anything many can change the world"" and these education institutions are only producing a few smart cats every year.My rating is as such.",21

Please don't see this movie, because if its successful, they'll make a sequel or a remake or something, and the movie fans of the world deserve better than this rubbish.

214,Guy177,"21 is the ultimate ""cheating"" story",6,25 August 2010,"There are plenty of movies out there that try to tell you when it is good to cheat and when it is bad to cheat. This movie does neither. It tells the story of Jeffrey Ma, renamed Ben Campbell in the movie and possibly the book on which it is based on. It focuses on a system of counting cards and the basics and complexities to getting there. Certain characters did not exist actually. It moved the story along in both the book and for the writer who says he did exaggerate and switch facts around. The real Blackjack team was mainly comprised of Asians or Asian- Americans. The most important imprint it left on me was not the urge to count cards and win big. In fact, many people who try and duplicate lose which is why casinos allowed this movie at all. No, the biggest imprint it left was the story of the ""ultimate"" cheating method and what it can do to you if you let it. Cheating may not always be bad, but it is dangerous. The movie was produced for big business. The actors act well mainly for big business, but the movie itself is fantastic. I suggest seeing it despite the controversies and scandals. If the movie affects you the way it affects me then it has done the job it should do. Read the book afterwards if you enjoy reading. That should leave even a bigger imprint. I say this movie is a, ""Winner, Winner"" and maybe a ""Chicken Dinner"" too.",21

I will, however, quote Bosworth herself, saying that they both had to get dead drunk before their half-minute romantic exchange.But I will say that montages are not an acceptable substitute for storytelling, nerds don't argue about ""rounding errors"" when they mathematically rate girls' attractiveness, and movies that purport to be based on true stories should NEVER mangle the facts the way 21 does.",21

But what really annoyed me were the really badly animated chip stacks that had no plot value whatsoever. You get that in the opening sequence and then once more later on. I mean if this was some low-budget production where showing chip stacks was an important plot device, you could still just film real chip stacks.

217,shl13132,Predictable Mess,3,19 August 2015,"21 is predictable and has clouded motivations on what we are hearing this story.Despite a few performances the acting is dull and wooden. The characters are not fleshed out except for our leading actor who had the strongest performance, even though his performance was still not that strong. The script is messy and predictable. Once Kevin Spacey's character is invited back to play in Vegas again you know what is going to happen for the last half hour of the movie. The opening and closing scenes are probably the worst thing this movie has going for it. It opens up that this college student wants to get a scholarship to Harvard because he can't afford the tuition and he has to write an essay about a life experience that would make the school want to give him this scholarship. So he decides to tell the school about how he went to Vegas and became a criminal and got his teacher at MIT beat up by the casino security. Then in the closing scene he makes all of these comments like: ""Does that impress you?"" or ""Did that make you go 'wow'?"" The other part about the script that bothered me was how they kept going back to the same casino even though they knew security was watching them and knew who they were. For the dialogue, there is some really cheesy romantic dialogue that doesn't work. Also some scenes are supposed to funny and they really are not.

221,compaq24,Inspired by the true story? Come on...,1,4 August 2008,"Before making a movie about blackjack and card counting it would have been a good idea to read some of hundreds of books on this subject available in any major bookstore. That would have prevented the creators of this movie to look like a bunch of ignorant fools totally lacking even general knowledge of the game of blackjack, card counting and casino's countermeasures. Here is why:1. Nowadays blackjack is played with 4-6-8 deck shoes cut in the middle (or 2/3 at best), which makes the player's edge (if any) so small, that making any profit is mathematically possible only in the long run. It means that no matter how favourable the count is, you chances of winning a particular hand are increased by such a small percentage, that before making any profit you may be losing many hands and even suffer substantial financial losses. Only if you are ready for losing streaks in the process and patient, and if you don't make mistakes with count and basic strategy, you may be winning in the long run. Coming to Vegas for a weekend and making fortune by winning all the time is an absolute nonsense.2. To prevent card counters from making money casino's security personnel do not abduct them in the middle of a crowded casino, torture them in the back office and take away their winnings - casinos simply ban card counters. Casinos in the US are legally private clubs: they don't charge admission fee and it's up to them to decide who will be allowed to enter the club. Since card counting is not illegal (it's just a skill), nor casino security, nor law enforcement can arrest anybody for it without serious consequences like losing casino license and possibly serving jail time. Not all casinos ban card counters, but those which don't changed blackjack rules to the degree that card counting would not overcome house edge.3. Besides blackjack related issues a person who keeps more than 300 grand cash in his dorm room can only be seen as a complete idiot. Obviously depositing this money in a bank account in the US could have caused problems with IRS, money laundering regulations, etc., but renting a bank safe deposit box could have solved the problem altogether. The image of a brilliant MIT student acting like a retard doesn't make any sense and makes me question the intellectual level of the screenplay writers.Conclusion: stay away from this movie - don't degrade yourself by watching it.",21
222,moviebug06,pedantic trivia,7,29 March 2008,"Decent movie; entertaining enough and attention--getting and keeping.To someone here: MIT is not an Ivy League school, but it is more elite than most.

For whatever reason it is something he desperately wants--and maybe is the only one from the med school itself that offers a full, free ride--the reason given for why he wants it. Even if--as there are--other scholarships are available from Harvard Med, maybe it's the most prestigious. But there are certainly plenty of other scholarships from other source available for Harvard or med schools in general.",21
223,evan-luzi,A movie that bet the house and came out busted,4,31 March 2008,"Unfortunately for audiences going to see the new movie ""21,"" the producers of the film didn't adhere to that all important Vegas slogan that gives reprieve to the city of sin: ""What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas."" In the case of the new movie that follows a team of Blackjack card counters, the story should've been left alone in the book it was based on and never graced the silver screen. Unlike other films of Las Vegas lore, ""21"" didn't feature such grittiness like that of ""Casino"" nor the charming wit of ""Ocean's Eleven."" What the film did feature, however, is monumental melodramatic moments and lackluster directing that had me struggling to keep that $10 soda I bought from squirting out my nose. In fact, the only redeeming quality of the film was the end, which came only after an excruciatingly slow two hours.The story, based on the bestselling book ""Bringing Down the House,"" hinges on Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) as a quiet MIT undergraduate who lacks the resources to attend Harvard Medical School. It is only after he is invited to join an established team of card counters that Ben sees a way to raise the $300,000 he needs to pay his way to becoming a doctor. The team features four other students, including Ben's schoolboy crush Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth), and is lead by MIT professor Mickey Rosa (Kevin Spacey). Ben finds himself to be a whiz kid at this card counting business and starts raking in the cash, meanwhile abandoning his best friends (one played by Josh Gad channeling an unfunny version of Jack Black) and his studious lifestyle of old. Shenanigans prevail and sooner or later, Ben finds himself in deeper than he can handle.Where the film falls flat is undeniably in it's writing. There's an old Hollywood adage that says you can't make a good movie out of a bad script and this is no more true than in the case of ""21"". The film seems to force the concepts behind card counting and blackjack on the audience through unnatural speeches that divulge too much of the info through the dialogue. For instance, Campbell is explained how Blackjack is played early in the movie, but this crash course of game rules seems more intended for the audience than for Ben and thus it fits weirdly in the movie. The script also is chock full of one-liners that fall flat on their face. The opening line is ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"" and there are other magical nuggets of word wizardry sprinkled throughout like ""you were born for this,"" or ""In Las Vegas, you can become anyone you want."" And not to mention that the nerd jokes - ""We almost had a girl at our party!"" - become decreasingly funny after the second one.The movie also seems to suffer from a cinematic and directorial standpoint. Director Robert Luketic, whose other efforts include ""Legally Blonde"" and ""Win a Date with Tad Hamilton,"" doesn't know when to stop using slow motion. The movie probably wouldn't be, or feel, as long as it did if there hadn't been such a ridiculous amount of slow motion. There was slow motion everywhere to the point where it became so diluted and lost its power as a device. Luketic also decides to sprinkle in heavy use of montage that, when juxtaposed to the melodramatic scenes in between, serves only to remind of the touching scene in ""Zoolander"" that results in a montage of frappuchino drinking and gas fighting.""21"" tries to be complex in its story and its themes and motifs but along the way it forgot what it should've been about  a team of young geniuses scamming hundreds of thousands of dollars from Las Vegas super casinos. Instead, the film spends much of it's time trying to elevate itself above a generic heist movie. The mistake in this, however, is that most moviegoers are there to see a heist movie. Luketic devotes so much of the 2 hour running time trying to build up Ben's world to the audience that the money making card counting scheme gets relegated to slow motion montage.There was little that I enjoyed about ""21"" save for the bright neon lights of the Las Vegas strip making for some beautiful shots of the glowing city. It's a shame that the film came out as it did because it featured a cast capable of so much more and a story that had potential to dazzle audiences. But instead, the movie lost itself in trying to be more than what it was and transformed into a monster of bad pacing and over emphasized emotions. ""21"" was trying to bet the house but unfortunately for itself and audiences alike, it only came out busted.",21

A couple of the guys wanted to give it a shot, so we toughed it out for another twenty minutes and by then we were ALL ready to give up on it. If it weren't for the hot girl from Blue Crush, we probably wouldn't have lasted that long. The preview and box make it look like an exciting, Vegas action film, but it plays like at best a drama, at worst, a boring documentary with some good camera work. All the actors were solid and seemed to fit the roles, but that just didn't cut it. I don't know how true they kept to the real story, but maybe that was their problem.

Under the mentorship of college professor, he and six of his friends specialize in card counting and go to Vegas.Interesting Facts About the Movie:
Although the script of the movie feels very fictional, it is based on a true story from a book (Ben Mezrich - Bringing Down The House). However, at the point of adaptation, the truth has not adhered to much. There is an article which explains this detailly for the curious ones on google.3 Good Ideas From The Movie:
Although it is not a very profound film, it has touched meaningful issues. Three noteworthy ones are as follows;Insufficient interview systems; It was criticized very well with the scenes at the beginning and end of the movie. It is really not possible to understand a person's skills in half an hour or an hour.Not knowing to stop / Greed: Possessing, winning are events that we get used to and easily lose ourselves. But why speeding up on a road where you know there is an abyss in the end? Running even knowing that you would fall from there, and eventually fall off the cliff. This was well suited to the script.It is possible to recover even when you think everything is over: You run like crazy after some things, they all go away when you think you will get it. At that moment you feel that you are losing. You think it is not possible to recover it anymore. But on the contrary, life saves you from what you don't need, and somehow it opens up new ways to achieve your goals.Scrip, Production, Acting:
Except for the issues above, I did not find the script of the film very impressive. It was a script to watch for mostly fun. The same is true for the characters. Despite this, I found the acting good. They reflected the emotions and characters on the screen as much as the script allowed. Of course, the acting of Kevin Spacey and Jim Sturgess was more prominent. Production was better than script quality. Shooting angles, lighting, music, scenes were satisfactory.General Experience of Film:
So far, I've criticized the movie a lot. But actually, not every movie has to have depth in it. ""21"" was an enjoyable movie. It has a beautiful blend of super-smart students, gambling, vegas and selfish professor. It is recommended to have fun, it also touches the some meaningful things. But it's not worth watching again.",21
231,MatijaR,bad directing,4,21 April 2008,"killed this film. too bad though. it's a really good story, too bad it hasn't been told in a better waya man would thought that Kevin spacey would carry out this film on his own back, but he's not that good in it too. not to mention a young star which i can't say is really a good actor. Laurence is OK, but i don't get what his story of a retiring counter-catchers has to do with anything. and what's with the long beginning, and his mother and friends? i mean, com'on man, we're here to see a big-shot gambling story, not his emotional path trough it all.. and again, all this things, including Laurence, could work out if they where directed in a better way, with better dialog and some original humor, not all the corny stuff everybody expects, like 'sir?' long pause, he turns slowly 'you forgot your bag' terrible! oh well.p.s. now when i think about it, spacey is actually most disappointing.",21

This is a film that starts out strong, with an attractive cast and an intriguing premise, but ultimately looses its way due to silly subplots and a muddled ending. But as the movie unfolds, the students are dressing flashy, shoving chips into the hands of dealers and making enough noise to attract the attention of half the casino's gamblers %u2014 as well as its enforcer, Cole Williams (an overweight and tired looking Laurence Fishburne).",21
233,piccahoe2k,"A bad Hollywood movie based the book ""bringing down the house""",2,10 June 2008,"This movie wasn't even close to the book, ""bringing down the house"".It was a typical Hollywood movie which mass stereotypes of nerd genius who talk about irrelevant things and can't get a girlfriend. I'm no genius myself but my brother's girlfriend's brother is a genius and he has a girlfriend.I don't why but this bother me more then the fact that there were only two Asian on the team. I'm kind of glad that there was an Asian guy and girl that didn't really fit the typical Asian stereotype...Expect for the Asian guy being really cheap..but, I laughed at that...because I'm Asian myself and I'm cheap along with my family =x. If you want a better thrill about genius college student who use their talents, then you should dump the movie and read book.BTW, in the book, the main character did have a girlfriend before all this happened =).",21
234,mistaphill,Worth checking out.,7,31 March 2008,"Being a blackjack player myself, I was looking forward to this movie and seeing the system they used to beat Vegas, though I know I'm not smart or patient enough to employ the tactics used by the card counters. I though Jim Sturgess did a good job in this role and didn't have a hint of a British accent, and Kevin Spacey was good as usual. There were of course many hokey Hollywood moments like the romance between Ben and Jill, the eventual downfall of the operation, and the transformation of Ben from bookworm to Vegas high roller practically overnight, but the movie was well made and the actors were convincing enough. One other thing that bothered me is the fact they often played at the same casino and were recognized by the dealers and casino staff, which would seem to me would make it easier for them to get caught. There are tons of casinos in Vegas, wouldn't you try and hit up every one of them so you're not recognized by the security people. Still, I enjoyed the picture, you could certainly do worse.. Definitely worth a DVD rental if nothing else.",21

Piece of crap scenes like that just completely ruined it.Then finally at the end, when he is done telling of his experience to the Harvard medical enrollment officer, he says ""did I dazzle you?""

But that very exiting fact disappears behind the many clichés that should have filled up the movie. We have seen it all before: the boy falls in love with the girl and blablabla...The screenplay itself is good and the cast is convincing as well. Kevin Spacey's performance is like you would have expected from him and the rest of the cast, with exception of Kate Bosworth, did a very decent job as well.

237,miles-185,"Not very good, actually strike that, total trash. Avoid!",3,8 May 2008,"Sorry, I'm not going to write the most in depth review ever, if you want something more in detail, have a browse, there are only 10 pages of reviews, and all of them apart from the first 2 pages (surprise surprise!) have some reviews which break down the movie very well. I just had to write something, after seeing so many reviews saying this film is amazing. Is there something funny going on here? If you can't be bothered to read any further I'll sum it up in a sentence: Don't go to see this unless you like things like: Knocked Up, Superbad, etc; I didn't pay to watch this film and I still feel robbed.There are so many things wrong with this movie, on so many levels, it's almost unbelievable, it seems like the whole thing was cobbled together with no thought whatsoever. The first ten minutes look promising, with potentially a few subplots looking to develop, but as soon as he 'wanders in' to the card counting gang and the professor... you know it's going to be... well, poo really. From there the storyline pretty much disintegrates, there's no continuity at all, and the movie doesn't really seem to actually be about anything, there's not really much about blackjack, the pathetic 'love story', or any of the 'friendships' at all.... I'm not sure what else to say really, it's hard to criticise as there's so little substance. It IS however, easy to pick the S out of the entire plot, but I won't ruin the only possible enjoyment to be had from this piece of C. when are we going to get some good movies? please!!",21
238,q_tipmann,No,2,5 April 2008,"There are three kinds of bad movies. The kind that you'll see for free on HBO or the like if you're bored enough, the kind that are so bad they're actually funny and worth the occasional viewing, and then the kind that you never want to see again. 21 is the latter. And the only reason it got a two instead of a one was Kevin Spacey since he was the only interesting part of the whole movie.You know those movies that leave you with the feeling of ""thank god that's over""? Well, 21 goes above and beyond in terms of bad moviedom and found a way to rob us of that nice, warm, and lovely feeling of accomplishment for managing to sit through the whole thing. Among the incredibly numerous cliché's in this film you find the hero of course getting everything he ever wanted in life at the end yet for some reason the director decided to play ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" during the wrap up portion and credits of the movie. Now I am all for movies that make you think and have a big message at the end but playing ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" while the main character is going over in detail how he did get everything he wanted is like saying violence is bad while shooting someone repeatedly in the head, it just doesn't work.There was one thing I will give the movie. It's predictable. I love the comfortable feeling of knowing that I will be able to predict the course of each and every scene two seconds in to them. I can't stand it when the scene where the main character becomes estranged from his best friends due to varying reasons depending on the movie that are usually incredibly childish springs on me from left field, especially when its followed by the scene showing him losing his cool and doing something stupid, I hate seeing that coming! And I wouldn't have been so touched by his mom offering him $68,000.00 dollars to pay for college if it hadn't been painfully obvious she was about to do so. And of course who would want to not know without even having to think that he was going to refuse the money and make up a lie about why he was because he was ashamed of himself? Because of course no one likes original work, we need more clichés damn it! More story arcs and more recycled characters we all have seen god knows how many times!! I will cease this ragging after I bring up one more point. At the end, surprise surprise, there is a case scene of the main characters running away from the casino security. *SPOILERS* the main character Ben gives the bag of chips to Spacey's character and split up to ditch the guards. Later Spacey opens the bag and its all fake chips and they justify this by showing Ben and his girlfriend Jill switching bags but the problem with that is simple, there was no time. From the moment that Ben had the bag to the point he gave it to Kevin he was with Kevin every step of the way and the shot of the switch they're in a bathroom or some kind of hall, calm and taking their time. It again just doesn't work.I'll admit I didn't have the highest hopes ever for the movie but I had expected it to be better then this. Just keep this in mind if you're thinking about seeing 21, you have seen this movie. You have seen it many times with many different names. But you have in fact seen it. I promise you.",21

The movie started nice, but after the first half hour I found myself looking what time it was, and how long the movie was going to last. But still I believed that this might be good (since Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne were in it) I WAS WRONG!! This movie is boring, I can't believe great actors such as Laurence Fishburne and Kevin Spacey, signed up for this junk. It's soundtrack is nice, but the way it is used in the movie is BAD, it seems like the music is forced into the movie. But the worst thing about the movie is it's ending, it's bad, maybe even child like. The only thing good about this movie is the cast, and the trailer(s), that's all. Don't get fooled, by the cast or the trailers.",21
240,michael7252003,21 seems eerily similar to the Last Casino,7,12 April 2008,"The movie was good but awfully familiar....In fact, living in Canada, there was a film called ""The Last Casino"" starting Charles Martin Smith as a University Professor who assembled a team of his brighter students and taught them how to count cards playing Black Jack. While certainly there were differences between the two films, I couldn't help but get the feeling I'd seen it all before. I did enjoy the acting of Jim Sturgess as the main character, and Kevin Spacey was chillingly evil. Kate Bosworth was good, but mostly eye candy. Laurence Fishburne had a good role as a Security consultant at the casino. I have to admit, the scenes where Jim Sturgess was showing his mind worked while counting the cards was ingenious. It gave the feeling that everything was slowed down and he could interpret the cards in a leisurely fashion, while in fact it was probably happening at break neck speed. The ending was satisfying.",21

Kevin Spacey as usual an excellent star and with excellent performance in 21. Laurence Fishburne has not given a big chance to show up but he is acting was a worth while. I recommend it for the user who are bank/casino robbery movie lover. In start it is bore but gradually it will increase your attention to watch till it ends. I gave it 7/10. The reason is that its not got the action like Italian Job. But one must watch so that he/she realize the power of human mind.",21

I am so used to being bored by various films, but this specific one was something else. It was not too slow- moving, and the twist at the end was particularly clever. The lead actor and the supporting cast are really good and hold the film together effectively. What I especially liked about it was the fact that it kept you interested throughout, as well as not having too much of a complicated plot. Additionally,the film really makes you think, instead of solely consisting of a narrative and plot. I would recommend this film to both males and females alike,as it would definitely appeal to both and is certainly worth seeing.",21
243,keithmwarwick,Interesting but not Amazing,7,11 June 2009,"Yea, this movie was entertaining but NOT a blockbuster. With a very controlled and understated performance from the young lead, Jim Sturgess, which has been woefully overlooked, ably assisted by the master-class actor himself - Kevin Spacey - the movie does entertain even if he has ridden roughshod over the book. Spacey hams it up, slightly, but that's just a little bit of scene-stealing technique the old salt is prone to do when in danger of being upstaged by a younger acting talent. There were anomalies in the plot and sometimes it seemed a bit too Ocean's Eleven a la Blackjack as the actors were shoe-horned into a formulaic over-plot that threatens on occasions to blow the charm factor out of the water - or ocean!",21
244,seruzz2003,"Not great, not bad",5,19 August 2008,"A film on card counting might seem interesting but can it really hold viewers for about two hours? Well, it depends on how interesting, original and coherent the plot is if the viewers are to be placed at an utmost priority. In addition, cinematography and atmosphere is also an important consideration no matter what the demographic of the intended film. In the case of 21, the answer given to the question posed would be a resounding no.The film follows Ben Campbell who is quite literally put, a genius. He is unable to go to Harvard because he does not have the $300000 for it. Luckily enough, one of his lecturers spotted him and took Ben under his wing to teach him to count cards. With his tutelage, Ben, with other card counters, is able to rake in the cash playing blackjack at casinos in Las Vegas. The question is, at what lengths does Ben have to go in order to keep the chick, friends and Harvard? The plot for 21 is a rather predictable one that might make viewers fall asleep if they have no control over their central nervous system. This film definitely needs more time in the editing room to make it more cohesive. Running at 123 minutes, probably about 80 minutes of this film is watchable while the rest of the time you will be cursing while fighting off drowsiness in hope that the film will end immediately. Some scenes are cringe inducing for seasoned film-goers where certain plot points used are walking clichés. An example of this is where Hollywood enforces the fact that any characters can throw away their own characterisation just to get the plot moving.Loud blaring music and fast cuts are abundant in this film much like a music video found on MTV. This film might work for a young audience in this aspect and non-young people will feel alienated while watching this. In fact, the cinematography and overuse of loud music simply makes this film look like a cheap feature film version of Las Vegas except for the lack of women in skimpy clothing. The director shows no vision at all in this weak piece which easily passes off as a Las Vegas look-alike that it's no surprise he is an unknown and might continue to be an unknown if he does not buck up his work.The casts are particularly lazy in this film as there is a lack of energy in their performance. This can be seen in Kevin Spacey who looks like he just wanted some money and thus decided to play the smart-ass character he has been doing yet again. Kate Bosworth's appearance is mostly eye candy to excite young men and as a result, an unmemorable love interest is presented to the main lead. On the less dull side, Laurence Fishburne and Jim Sturgess are probably the only ones who wanted to achieve something and they gave slightly more zest to their characters than the other casts. In the end, weak character development makes their characters only somewhat decent and not memorable.All in all, the good points from this film are probably the reason one watches a TV show like Las Vegas and CSI. With that in mind, this film does not fail outright but becomes barely watchable. It is nothing great and not downright awful. If you are a teenager and is excited by loud music, this film should mildly entertain you. Other than that, it is a missable affair that nobody cares to dwell over.",21

It's a thoroughly enjoyable movie...butAnyone who's a fan of the real story will be both offput and possibly offended. In the book Bringing down the House, the four main students are all Asian. I understand this is an American movie, so I can see why the studio would cast mostly white people...hey, it's money what can you say?The thing that irks me SO much is the time frame. The MIT Blackjack team originated in the late 70's. This incident, with Ben Campbell, took place in '94. There was no Vitamin Water and there were definitely no PSP's. We're supposedly watching the story in modern times as they face a software program developed over a decade ago!!

Sherlock did the exact thing with Memory Palace and it s---- ed big time. I tried to rewatch the movie. And I exactly knew why it didn't jive with me:-Kevin Space is an astounding actor, yet the way he tried to make a Ivy League professor charismatic superstar was just too trite. Not every professor need to be Hollywood big shot. Tone it down. Sometimes less is more.-Stupid cliches. Ivy Leagues are filled with nerds and Jonah Hill like beta cucks. Sign. Just stop. Stop.

Having read the book when it first came out, I was a bit skeptical about whether it would translate well. I couldn't have been more pleased. Was it the same as the book? Of course not (except for The Green Mile, what was?) But it was action-packed, smart, fun, well-acted, well-directed, and just plain enjoyable. Spacey, Fishburne, and Bosworth are at the top of their games and Jim Sturgess is going to be a star. The visuals were great, the editing sharp, and the score right on point. I don't know whether to stay up all night re-reading the book or hop on a plane for Las Vegas to try to win while I still halfway remember the counting system.

Why the hell did they keep going to the exact same casino over and over again to play Blackjack. I mean it's Vegas so I'm sure there's a few other places to gamble. lol. this leads me to gripe number 2. It's based on a true story so that's what really makes me mad. If this was just a Hollywood movie than fine, you tell a story for the sake of it and that's that. However if it's based on a true story and this is a loose account of how it happen than I really feel sorry for the morons that were involved and got caught.

250,e-04295,Great movie,9,22 January 2020,"I really enjoyed this movie in how the dialogue happened between characters and the bit of added foreshadowing at the beginning. I also thought that the acting wasn't cheesy which made the film seem for realistic to the audience. The only thing I could critique on this film is how some of the open endedness of particular parts in the film like: what happened to the Professor?, did he get killed?, did Ben get the scholarship at the end of the movie?, and how can the professor give Ben his credits back when he is currently getting the life beating out of him by the casino owner?One thing that I took away from the movie is that what comes around goes around. This can relate back to how the professor took everything away from Ben and left him not even being able to graduate and with no money, which led to Ben fakingly asking for forgiveness to get revenge and set up his professor with the casino owner. This movie has lots of good life lessons that the audience could take away. One major takeaway is how you can't take life for granted because it can get taken away in a second.",21
251,q-45225-97619,MIT nerd to luxury gambler,6,24 January 2020,"In the film, 21 the main summary is about Jim sturges (Ben Campbell) a very gifted- smart student from Massachusetts needing money to get into Harvard medical school, he meets a group of other very gifted students being led by one of his professors Mickey Rosa (Kevin Spacey) who is leading them and teaching them to use their math skills to win large amounts of money in black jack, going on runs and loving the luxurie life with a good twist at the end, and don't forget the intelligent Villain Laurence Fishburne (Cole Williams) as he plays the serious ""invincible"" type man as he plays in the Matrix as well. As all Kevin Spacey movies usually are, this movie is an entertaining, high stakes intense movie that keeps the audience engaged. Kevin Spacey having so much talent and successful films form the past, playing the part as the man who brings adrenaline to the movie like the Usual Suspects (1995) being one of my favorite Kevin Spacey movies. Ben Campbell being somewhat new to the movie scene plays that part very well of being the young genius who falls in love with the luxuries and thrill of winning enormous amounts of money.
Overall I think the movie is very entertaining with many scenes and action that will keep your attention and keep your heart racing, the director Robert Luketic does a great job with the angles on which he films the sciences in the casino and the detail he accounts, with the disguises they wear to High tension scenes using close up portrait shots where you can see there forehead sweat from being so nervous. The movie displays a story line that gives the ""nerds"" a praise in the movie that's very entertaining to see. The film let's you experience the thrill of winning big through the TV screen and feel as if you are there in these high anxiety moments. All though this movie has many upsides there are also some flaws in the movie, the movie seems to always come back with an intense scene ever so often to keep the audience engaged but the film also seems cheesy in a way as it feels to jump around and becomes somewhat unrealistic. The movie does a great job of portraying as something that has or could happen in real life but some of the flaws come from getting too crazy with it, as you see in the movie when the group uses their secret signal tactics to indicate something using the same ones over and over again, as in a real casino I believe they would get caught a lot earlier in their road to fame. Although this movie suffered from some flaws as all movies do, with a combination of some great actors, the thrill of luxuries and thrill that many dream about I found this movie was an eye catching movie that I enjoyed watching greatly.",21
252,kevin_shae,"Svae yourself some anguish, watch ""The Last Casino"" instead.",1,31 March 2008,"Yes, 21 has elements of the wonderful book ""Bringing Down the House"", but the core of what this bastardized film is was taken from a Canadian film by the name of The Last Casino (2005, Maple Films, Starring Charles Martin Smith, Katharine Isabelle, Kris Lemche, Albert Chung and Jullian Richings.) In The Last Casino, Professor Barnes is a broken down gambler with a serious debt to be paid. To buy himself more time he trains a group of math students to count cards and earn money for him and ends up biting off more than he can chew and his team can handle. That's about the only major difference between the two films other than big name actors in 21 and the characters in both films. Personally, save yourself the long agonizing trip, go to BlockBuster (Or go online.) and rent The Last Casino. You'll get almost the exact same movie, with better acting, a better presentation from a film made with less money by a better company at likely less than the cost of a theater ticket.Even Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne aren't enough of a saving grace to make 21 a decent watch to me and many of my film loving compatriots.

'Hollywood it' they certainly did - predictably the characters are all beautiful,there is a love affair that was not part of the original story and a revenge/power struggle that I do not believe was true to life.However,spurious as it is in parts and despite it's glitzy dressing, it holdsattention, is fantastically acted and beautifully shot.

OK: so quick question about the variable theory thing @ the beginning of the movie: The car is behind one of 3 doors. Ben chose door 1 & then Mickey opened door 3 & showed that it was a ghost (& not the car). Then, why would Ben switch to Door 2 - where does he get that extra 33.3%? The car not being behind door 3 essentially said that the car had to be either behind door 1 or 2. (So it'd be a 50-50 shot @ either door). Can anyone explain why he'd choose to change & why his probability of car being behind door 2 was 66.7%? OK - Never mind - I think I understand that by switching, his probability for winning goes up to 66.7% on avg...That was my main question but I also have to mention that Jim Sturgess is just adorable - I didn't know he was British. Also, MCAT highest score in the recent few years has been 43 - in the movie, Ben got a 44 but that's not been achieved according to AMCAS (the organization that tests MCAT).",21

257,cwrumd,"yes, this movie is racist",1,10 April 2008,"Much of white America just does not understand the systemic racism that Hollywood has committed over the years. Let's get one thing straight. The way people of different races are portrayed on film/TV DOES make a difference. It does affect the way people think. For example, after Bruce Lee made all those movies, it was assumed that Asian people were all kung fu masters even though it's obviously not true. So this refrain from people that ""it's just a movie"" has got to stop. Movies/Film help CREATE REALITY.So given that film creates reality, the systematic exclusion of Asian Americans from film does make a big difference. It means that Asian Americans continue to be made invisible and marginalized here in America. When people think of America, they don't think of Asians and a large part of that has to do with the fact that they aren't seen on film/TV. Asian Americans are 5% of the US population (over 10% in places like California and New York) and growing and somehow they are rarely shown on TV/film. And when they are, it's almost always in a secondary role or a role that emphasizes how ""odd"" or ""strange"" they are. Asian Americans are often shown as foreigners and this is insulting. Asian Americans are real Americans.Hollywood has tried to justify their casting of white characters by saying that they are ""bankable"" and that they would like to cast more Asian Americans, but they cannot because they are not bankable. This is circular reasoning. Asian Americans cannot become ""bankable"" because Hollywood studios refuse to cast them! Lastly, let's take a scenario where there's a movie about George Washington. Let's say that he is played by an Asian American. There would be a firestorm of controversy and all of a sudden white people would be clamoring that only a white man could play the role convincingly. All of a sudden the racial integrity of the actor would be essential. So hypocritical.",21

Kevin Spacey's performance was awkward the rest of the cast was scentless (even though the casting was good as far as the physical appearance of the characters is concerned), and the direction... well, I've seen it all being done before with much more success.A really mediocre film-One of my friends almost fell asleep while watching it.",21

It teaches you everything you need to know about the game if you are clueless, like I was. This movie was very entertaining , the acting was great (I was impressed with all the characters especially Ben portrayed by Jim Sturgess), yet the movie can seem slow at times. The film was directed brilliantly and kind of reminded me of the Ocean movies.

Yes there is some racism about the movie but in the film there are no racial comments or anything like that. Both views on the movie are valid and should be taken seriously but to boycott the movie ""21"" for casting doesn't seem right. It hasn't violated such racial problems as Angelina Jole's role did. This is an AMAZING movie and Jim Sturgess is an incredible actor who deserved the chance to play Ben Cambell in the movie. He and the rest of the cast shouldn't be punished for auditioning and winning a role in this movie. And anyways how do we know what the studio was thinking when they casted the lead to a British actor over an Asian one. They could've just picked any actor that they believed would play the role right. Or they could have thought that a certain race would fulfill the commercial demand. Whatever they were thinking right or wrong this movie is INCREDIBLE and deserves to be viewed by millions. This is just my own opinion I don't want to offend anyone so please don't get mad at me for posting this. I know and understand that this is a very very delicate subject(racism) and I don't like to discuss it but since it was the most talked about subject.

Kate moss, or whatever her name was, her attractiveness even felt forced. She's pretty but shes no knock out. It was very repetitive and it dragged on and on with all the thinking of numbers this kid cycled through.

I would've liked to see an Asian lead for the role but I know Hollywood can only glamorize whites, blacks and fat people but whatever I thought the acting was good. Would've like to see more time spent on the team. I mean in the book you had the development of the team, the ongoing battle with the security, team breakups, travel to the riverboats and the south, Atlantic City and lotsa drama with in the ranks.

It is filled with cheesy one-liners that beg all to obviously for the laugh. The movie is slow to build up while it drones on with boring useless detail and dialog filled with one cliché after another. It also isn't true to the actual events of which they attempt to depict. The documentary isn't all that good, but at least they don't try to come off as exciting and riveting. This movie is a perfect example of how a poorly written script and a bad direction can ruin great potential for acting, as in the case of Kevin Spacey. Also as an emerging star, Jim Sturgess isn't given a chance to show his ability through his rather static and boring character. The only saving grace and part that made me not get up and leave was the character of Laurence Fishburne. Watching him beat the crap out of people really is entertaining.

The second Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) says yes to joining a small group of MIT students on their ""weekends, and Christian holidays"" trips to Vegas, you pretty much know where 21 is going. Ben is accepted into Harvard Medical School, only doesn't have the cash to pay for school. Why a bank loan is never mentioned is never explained, but anyway. He's warned to count cards, not gamble. Think Ben won't succumb to the glitz and glamour, get a big head, only to hit an eventual downward spiral and need redemption? Presenting your first movie.21 is good-looking pulp who's main drawback is it's no better than it absolutely has to be. Entertaining though it may be, we're familiar with the rise and fall of a kid given the opportunity of a lifetime and squandering it. Quite. Another stumbling block, for me, would be Jim Sturgess. The muddled accent doesn't help, but I got used to it. He does a couple of things right, namely a scene where Jill (Kate Bosworth) comes into the store where he works, and Ben gets kind of breathless and stammery. Who wouldn't? But, I never once bought his evolution into arrogant prick  especially considering how short-lived it is. Nor was it very believable what happens to make Ben angry enough to go and get rebellious and continue playing at a cold table. Come to think, his reluctance to get on board with the MIT guys in the first place isn't clear, either, since Ben obviously has the math skills, could use the money and wants life experience. We never get a sense that Ben wouldn't entertain the idea of breaking the law (even though the whole card counting business isn't technically illegal), through his actions. Maybe these are more script issues, but Sturgess never fully sells it. He stays kind of bland and just... there.Better is Kevin Spacey, as the professor jockeying for Ben's participation. His opening classroom scene is fabulous. Mickey Rosa is a former blackjack player, now with a roving eye for students disciplined enough to steal ""under the radar"". If Spacey's given an off performance recently, could someone remind me? Other highlights: Josh Gad, as Ben's best friend. He's obviously channeling Jonah Hill, something awful, but it works (""Does the way I use it.""). Liza Lapira has perfect timing with her ""now, I need a drink"" line. And, Kate Bosworth standing against the window in one of Sturgess' hotel rooms, curtains drawn, is surely the reason man created cinema.I enjoyed 21 while it played. Is what it is.

I thought it made the card playing parts actually riveting even though i am not a card player myself. i thought the acting performances were all good especially that of Kevin Spacey's. In terms of the story. In many ways it reminded me of all the good things that was in the BBC TV show hustle. But in a much more real way. On the down side, you may see the ending coming and there is a romance part of the film that feels unnecessary. However it is a very slick film that gets away with it. I would say that it clearly the best film in this genre of film. I enjoyed it more than films such as Confidence and the Oceans 11 type films. I would highly recommend it to anybody when it eventually comes out in April!! I would have thought that they would cut down and re-edit it a bit on the basis that it was quite long. however it kept my attention for the whole film and that is not something that is also done during these sorts of films",21

It was a very fun movie to go to all in all!! I wish they would interview some authentic MIT students or talk to profs there to get more information about the school, and what it is like in real life? One more question: Why do the movie stars that are interviewed constantly (especially Kate B)never mention the students from MIT or if they chatted with any of them- tried to get to know them?

A programmer working for me, Ron Karr, had been on that team and they listed the team members' real names at the end of the book. It was the same story, with counters and betters and side stories and back stories.I didn't like the movie turning into such a different story but the ending was just clever enough for me to actually give it a thumbs up from me.This guy Ron Karr programmed for my CORE remote control.

I also found the main character to be annoying with just how awkward he was I dislike all characters in movies who are awkward this always disturbs more than mild violence because I probably can relate to it better. i felt the main character tried way to hard to achieve this role if your looking for a gambling movie definitely just re-watch the classic Rounders.,21

The book is much more realistic and exciting whereas the movie feels like a kiddie movie about gambling climaxing to a fairy tale ending.

Both Jim Sturgess and Kate Bosworth were awful. The accent of Sturgess was fake and contrived. It was obvious he wasn't an American actor and it ruined the illusion of the film for me. Also Bosworth was stiff, wooden and lacked any real emotion in her performance. She made the character seem hollow and uninvolved with the action. The only saving grace about this film is Kevin Spacey. As per usual he is very good in his role and really makes his character the star of the film. Only a shame he wasn't in it more.

281,jhabeles,"Realistic, but with anachronisms, terrific casting, loved it!!!",10,5 May 2008,"The legendary stories of card counting - dating from the 1960s Edward Thorp book ""Beat the Dealer"" - are seductive for anyone, but especially mathematically talented students at MIT and similar places. Jim Sturgess happens to bear an incredibly striking resemblance, in facial appearance and expressions, to a very well-known U.S. Washington DC scientist and administrator; how's that for casting? Kate Bosworth is incredibly appealing with that short but perfectly combed haircut - though perhaps not stereotypical, I nonetheless find her credible as an MIT student especially in the gym scene. Equally beautiful woman undergraduates have graced the MIT halls however unexpected. This is real, make no mistake. The cinematography of MIT is stunning and real, except there is little pedestrian traffic on Memorial Drive (where Jim Sturgess encounters other characters). Originally blackjack was dealt from a single deck and counting was a breeze. When Atlantic City was opened in the late 1970s, they instituted 8-deck shoes, so you had to keep the count not from one single deck but from 8 of them. There were subtle but statistically significant changes to the rules that better evened the odds in favor of the house. Nonetheless card-counting syndicates are said to have attempted to win under those rules using more advanced techniques than those depicted in 21. One aspect of 21 I did not like much was the emphasis on having to come up with $300K to attend Harvard Med. Certainly much of that sum could have been borrowed, so it was not factual as presented. An aspect of the movie I did not appreciate were the anachronisms: The heyday of this activity was prior to the introduction of 8-deck shoes i.e., in the 1970s yet the movie was set in the 2000's. Go figure. The 2.07 contest was not famous then. And, Harvard Med was much less costly in dollars. Dropped ceilings were not used in any MIT dorm room. Incidentally, the penurious student played by Sturgess would have undoubtedly lived at home, not in a dorm, rather than work retail sales at a preppy clothing store. It would have left more time for studying (or ""tooling"" -- to use the accurate MIT vernacular eschewed by the film). One other comment: I think the movie panders to the popular conception of the math ""whiz"" in that it seems no effort whatsoever is required for the Sturgess character to get up-to-speed. Certainly he would have needed to build his skills and even for the ""genius"" it would take a little while. But it's more palatable for the theatre-going public to believe that it's all talent and no hard work. That's Hollywood for you!!!",21

I could criticise the one-dimensional characters, the irritating soundtrack, or a Kevin Spacey who came across as an actor who was busy saying his lines, while concentrating on something else entirely, but there's something even more seriously wrong with this film, and it's this: The whole foundation for the movie is blackjack card-counting, yet isn't it astonishing that the fundamental theory for this is never explained. I wasn't expecting an in-depth yawning analysis, but c'mon guys, the explanation is limited to a couple of sentences of blackjack rules, and that's it!

Instead, much of the script and action was completely disbelievable, such that it spoiled the movie completely for me. Fine in a movie where you expect incredulity, but not in a movie based on factual events.There were so many 'as if' moments during the movie that I lost all faith in the rest of the movie. Having watched 'American Gangster' the other day, also based on fact, it was like night and day.The script was particular poor I thought and I actually found Kevin Spacey's performance quite hammy and suffering from the poor dialogue - particularly the scene towards the end where he is at the Alumni meeting and is pulled back into the final hustle.It all started going wrong for me when lead character Ben Campbell first walks into the 'meeting of thieves' and is propositioned to join the card counting group.

It's a shame that they didn't cut the unnecessary moments to add more detail to the critical shifts in the plot and create a more believable experience during these key moments.I suspect the book was better than the screenplay (from speaking to some whom have read it - though I myself have not).

Now, after investigating the true story on the internet, I find out that the original students were Asian. I think that's why the story lacks any substance--it's phony. It's pathetic that Kevin Spacey doesn't have the balls to present the real story. It's even more pathetic that they got an English actor to play the main character. What I realize now is that this movie is a theft of a cool true story and turned into a bland b-movie meant to stroke white mainstream movie-goers.",21
286,williamjh1737,This movie managed to ruin a great book and a true story.,3,28 March 2008,"THE BAD: The director clearly didn't understand the book or the story and tried to compensate for this by making it about the game of blackjack, which itself isn't very interesting or much of a spectator event. I also hope Columbia Pictures doesn't hire the screenplay writers to pen another movie. The book was fantastic and didn't need to be punched up or Hollywood-ified. The rule of Keep It Simple Stupid would have been a good one to enforce here. THE GOOD: Certainly a solid cast, although they were directed poorly. How the actors managed to give solid performances when handed such a dull-average-boring and horribly written script is a tribute to their talents.The movie is a great example of Hollywood thinking they're in touch with the American movie-going public. They've put a giant piece of crap on a stick and they're marketing it to us as a bouquet of roses. We're smarter than that and anyone who sees this film should be entitled to their money back.",21
287,beropetra,"Stretched out, bad acting, no plot...",1,25 March 2009,"Where to begin? Its too long, it has no plot, acting is above average, it contains many holes in the story and its SO predictable!! 1. This could be a movie that lasts 1 hour, not 1 and a half, not 2, but just one. It contains no plot and story is so stretched out.2. Acting? omg. I was wondering the whole time what the heck were Fishburne and Spacey doing in this movie. Main character - Tobey Maguire with longer hair and less acting talent turns from Mr. nice guy to Daniel Plainview from There will be blood. Of course, he is totally unconvincing as that greedy little bastard, with that face and haircut - no way you could be a bad dude.3. Editing is also dreadful, so many slow motion, I felt like watching 300 again! And then again, there are also so many time lapses...4. From the beginning of the movie u know where it leads... there are no twists, there are no interesting dialogues, no excitement, no fun... This movie lacks everything! Don't WATCH IT!",21
288,gunnarv,Hollywood ruins a good story,4,19 October 2009,"When I watched this movie for the first time I knew it was based on a true story but after watching it I had a strong feeling that the movie makers didn't follow the story very closely, I somehow felt cheated. Therefore I just had to get the book and read it. Well I was right, the movie is far off.Sadly to say there is almost nothing in the movie accurate. However, what probably annoyed me the most is that one of the keys to play a system like they do is to never ever make a counting mistake at the table. Yet in the movie it doesn't seam that any of the characters, except the main character can keep good count. In reality, all of the team members counted perfectly and practiced this skill every day.I don't understand why they couldn't stick closer to the true story and I think it would have made a much better movie.I therefore highly recommend that anyone interesting in blackjack or gambling should read the book.",21
289,Sindhu-it,a good time killer ... worth once watch,6,18 April 2011,"This story is about young and brilliant, Ben Campbell(Jim Strugess), a MIT student who strives to get a scholarship at Havard School of Medicine. He is challenged at Havard to dazzle them to give him the edge to have the scholarship. Meanwhile his math professor, Micky Rosa(Kevin Spacey) finds his shrewdness with numbers and offer him to join his five-member secret club where he trains the skill of card counting in Blackjack. With requisite to fulfill his tuition fee, he agrees to be in. Not to the surprise, he excels in the skill and start spending in Las Vegas during weekends and mints the money like rapid fire with the team. Then every wish was in his way until his ego comes up. Kevin Spacey performance is astounding. Jim is dashing in his role. All the performances are good enough for the roles. Copule of scenes are really moving. At some point of the story felt like omg!! when this is going to end. Doesn't seem like a fact- based story. Worth the single time watch. A good time killer.",21
290,deadude32,"Lost more substance than the book, takes out the real formulas and interjects synthetic ones.",6,2 May 2008,"I read the book and appreciated it greatly, i did feel it was a little light (you get to seem some more reality in the actual gambler's short essay in the back) but it at least gave some of the real data behind the cards. the degree at which the game could be mathematically gamed, etc.. The movie doesn't even say what is a low card and a high card. (face cards -1, 2-6 +1) Trying to combine 'Oceans 11' and a lame ""perfect-kid getting into college"" film into one has produced a bland nothing, you can also see how they changed the main character from a Asian kid to try to make it more appealing, in fact they totally changed the main character in order to make it a a stock rise-and-fall movie. The real life man was actually one of the few who also had a great engineering job while others were relying fully on card counting for their sustenance. And then wrapping the whole thing in the context of a college interview---ewww thats exactally the same thing as that prissy movie Spanglish. They have tried to make it more modern with reference to a job at google and dot-com millionaire. I also hate the direction of incorporating lame corporate-sponsored ad-libs into movie scripts. It humorous the famous personalities in this movie and their roles :)",21
291,nathanmayes,English Class Review of how 21 relates to education,7,25 March 2012,"21 and the Change Education Can MakeBen Campbell is a poor college student. He wants to transfer to the Harvard School of Medicine to become a doctor. With his poor background he must obtain a scholarship of some sort. When he applies for the scholarship the interviewer tells Ben to tell him something special about him, something crazy that stands out. He has nothing. At this point. During one of his classes, Ben surprises and grabs the interest of one his professors with his knowledge. This professor leads a team of very bright students who go to Vegas on weekends and times off to count cards at casinos and make a lot of money. After Ben surprises his professor someone tells him to go to a room later that night. At this point Ben has no idea what they are up to. When he finds out what it is they are doing he wants nothing to do with it. This shows that educational goals are personalized. The team uses their education for money and luxuries while Ben uses it to advance and makes money by working not something that could toil with his future. Ben is laid back and could be better known as not much of a risk taker. As the movie progresses and his education on something else changes you will see a big difference in his character.A girl on this traveling team finally gets Ben to take a different path than what he is used to. He starts to go the practices the team has and eventually is talked into going on one of these trips. He realizes the big money he is making will pay for Harvard and then some. As the movie progresses his education on card counting and making of money change his personality. He starts to dress up nicer, become a little cocky, and loves the feeling of winning. Which is a complete different person than from the beginning of the film. I feel education definitely changed him. If he was never given this opportunity he would have never been like this. His identity changes completely to the point he doesn't use his real name and changes his appearance. This movie indirectly shows that the goal of education is money. He always needed it and when he got it he was happy and lived a more satisfying life. He almost even forgot why he started counting cards in the first place. In Ben's case education was the key for him to reach his aspirations as a doctor. This movie really displays the use and change education can make. Ben goes from one person to a complete different other just because of education.Towards the end of the movie all of Ben's acquired money is stolen by the group leader. After this he realizes he forgot what he has started all of this for and how he has changed. The team, other than the leader, decide to go back on their own. Where Ben makes enough money for school and then backs out. He is no longer this craving gambler after this but definitely is not the same as he was in the beginning of the film.",21

This film has a pretty decent plot line, but overall I think the all the actors really kill it and do a great job! I would definitely love to see more films like this one in theaters. The idea of pulling students to beat the odds in Vegas is new as far as I am concerned.Overall if you want a film that keeps you guessing until the end, this one does a good job for the whole family. It was perfectly appropriate for both my young kids, me, and my wife. I will be definitely keeping my eyes open for whatever is next on the list for this group of talented actors.",21

The movie makes the viewer feel good through pleasant scenery (Vegas) and what-if-it-were-me kind of thoughts. If you can relate to college life, being around smart people, Boston/MIT/Harvard, Vegas, casinos, Blackjack and a sense of thrills and adventure, then you will definitely love this movie. The soundtrack is also a great fit for the movie. I keep getting into arguments with people over the 3-door game show host puzzle mentioned during one of the classroom scenes.",21
294,jamesgraham-479-612394,fantastic example of why some films are terrible,2,17 September 2012,"So the films all about a ""system"" to beat the blackjack dealer. So the whole plot is basically underpinned by this system. So how does the system actually work? Well we don't actually find out, because the film producers deemed us too stupid to understand, or they were too stupid to bother looking into it.Okay so, I don't know about the system. That doesn't matter too much because I can follow the psychological progression of the characters, because that's whats really of interest in a film.So what does it really feel like to win $315,000? Well we won't know, we just saw them shopping and smiling. Oh yeah, wait, every character in the film is superficial and on top of that, it's badly acted, and on top of that, the script can't do them any favours. So we can't really follow the psychological progression of the characters...So basically characters dribble out of a story that is utter drivel.The film is meaningless and I feel sorry for everyone involved.",21

He needs $300,000 for Harvard School of Medicine. To get the money, he joins Micky Rosa, a math professor at MIT and four other students who count cards while playing 21 in Casinos. After making a lot of money over multiple trips to Vegas, he ends up making mistakes and gets caught by nasty security guards. Micky takes all the money he won and his MIT degree after the goof-up. Having lost everything, Ben plans to take revenge from Micky.The cast has done a good job to make the movie both engaging and entertaining. Kevin Spacey (Micky) has given an exemplary performance by portraying the unorthodox professor really well. However, the movie does not make much sense inspite of being based on a real life incidence. The team used to return to the same casinos and attracted a lot of unnecessary attention. Even the sign language they used to communicate was fairly obvious and did not change over time. Such childish mistakes from the smart MIT kids makes the plot inconsistent.Overall, it is a good movie to watch and I give it 3 out of 5.",21
296,pag-12,An Excellent Film,9,26 April 2008,"Wow...this movie was thoroughly engaging. The acting was superb, as was the direction, writing, editing, and overall production value. It was refreshing to see a film that could have so easily turned out to be a superficial, Hollywood ""throw-away"" actually be made as an intelligent, suspenseful, and engaging film that in no way wastes the talents of those involved. I will even go so far as to say that it has all of the qualities that made 1973's ""The Sting"" a classic---characters you care about, high stakes, an intriguing plot, smart direction, solid performances, and an ending that pays off. I highly recommend this film; it's certainly one of the best of the year.",21

I can't believe Kevin Spacey decided to be affiliated with this horrific waste of film. Seriously, the documentary was more entertaining than the movie.

I am usually let down by movies that are based on books, but that was not the case this time.Although there were a handful of cliché parts of the movie, all in all it was excellently done. The visual effects were well done, and the acting on the part of Jim Sturgess, Kevin Spacey, and Kate Bosworth, was exemplary. Some people may criticize Spacey for his 'gusto', but I believe his portrayal of Mickey was stellar.The movie had suspense, a solid plot line, scattered funny scenes, and a good ending.

302,lidz_052000,So-So Gambling Film,4,12 May 2008,"This is a film about a group of MIT students who count cards in Vegas under the mentorship of their linear algebra professor, and win big before inevitably it all goes wrong. It's apparently 'based' on a true story; trouble is, I guess the true story isn't terribly cinematic so they've had to embellish it, and it's obvious where they've done so - the additions are grafted on very heavy-handedly.Certainly at the start it's not a bad film, it's quite light in tone and has some nice humorous touches. The introduction to card counting is fairly interesting, although I think the method outlined here is probably rather simplified to allow cinema audiences to follow it.A major problem for the film is that Blackjack simply isn't a much of a spectator sport; poker may not be all that great to watch if you're not playing, but at least you can craft some drama from the to's and fro's of a hand. Pontoon, though? Forget about it - it's just too simple a game.Since the game isn't all that interesting, the film must rely on the characters, and while Jim Sturgess is good enough in the lead role of the student who takes part reluctantly only to raise funds his doctorate before being seduced by the easy money, reminding me here a bit of Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal, none of the others ever rise much beyond a cardboard cutout - including Kevin Spacey, who has precious little to do here as the professor. Most wasted (and objectionable) of all here, however, is Lawrence Fishburne, playing a casino 'loss preventer', in the film for little more than a cameo, and never really rising beyond the role of a simple thug. The other gambling students are shallow and unlikeable, whereas Sturgess' old friends are geek stereotypes straight out of Weird Science.One flaw that really stuck in my mind was that for all the talk of the need to be surreptitious and under-the-radar of the casinos, the students go out of their way to get noticed, going crazy Vegas-style repeatedly, and employing ludicrously obvious signs to each other, never once varying them - if they wanted to get noticed by the casino security people they went exactly the right way about it. I very much doubt if this is what happened in reality.The twists at the end are all a bit contrived and aimed towards producing an ending that ties everything up neatly; too neatly for me, it was totally unsatisfying. The choice of You Can't Always Get What You Want for the final credits is as predictable as the rest of the film. Horrible mix, too.",21

I don't think that Jim Sturgess did..but if he did..then sweet. Kevin Spacey was amazing and the end of the movie was a huge shock for me.
