0,MartinHafer,Enjoyable but be sure to turn off that pesky brain!,7,29 December 2010,"I saw the first ""Tron"" film decades ago—and I must say I never exactly understood why it has risen to cult status. When I recently went to the New York Comic-con, the patrons were just salivating at the prospect of its long-anticipated sequel—it was obviously a film some looked at as akin to the second coming! So, I know that whatever I write, the truly dyed in the wool lovers of the franchise will hate what I have to say. Take my review as a review for the non-""Tron"" lover—and especially 46 year-old guys who fall in this category.My feeling is that the film is wonderful on some levels but poor in perhaps the most important area—the plot. If you don't mind a confusing plot and don't mind just turning off your brain and enjoying the film in all its 3-D glory, then you will have a good time. However, and this is important, I probably would NOT recommend you see it any other way—not on DVD and certainly not when it's come to cable. You miss so much—not just the 3-D but the immersive soundtrack by Daft Punk. Experience itjust don't try to think about the mind-bending and ultimately clichéd plot (wow, did I see the ending coming a bazillion miles away---you just know by formula and ""The Hero's Journey"" what MUST happen to Jeff Bridges at the end).By the way, you may wonder WHY I saw the film in the first place. I am currently on a Disney cruise and this ship has a state of the art 3-D theater with Disney first-run films. My daughter saw it last night and said it was great but the plot was the worst part of the film. So, we both returned tonight and saw it and were pretty much in agreement about the film's merits and deficits. We loved the artistry but both felt the plot had HUGE holes.Also, one thing that was cool but bothersome about the film is how good the CGI has become. Jeff Bridges is in the film in both his current look and a computer-enhanced 1980s Jeff Bridges. While the 1980s Jeff was not perfect (its face was a bit too smooth), it was so incredibly close that I worry that we'll soon see films with dead actors or using clips from various previous movies—creating something even worse than colorization!!",TRON - Legacy
1,TheLittleSongbird,Surprisingly enjoyable,7,11 May 2011,"I actually wasn't expecting to enjoy TRON:Legacy, but coming from someone who is fond of the original 1982 film, I did. TRON:Legacy isn't a perfect movie though, then again neither was the original movie. The film thematically is deeper than the original, but there are some parts where it comes across as rather formulaic for my tastes. Also while the characters are likable, they aren't given that much depth, and again while the dialogue is intriguing at most some of it is weak and dare I say stilted.That said, TRON:Legacy has a lot to redeem it. Jeff Bridges is great and Garett Hedlund is likable, but when it comes to the acting the film is stolen by a gleefully enjoyable Michael Sheen and a wonderfully edgy Olivia Wilde. The action sequences and chases are very exciting, and help keep the momentum of the pace and story going, and the soundtrack is just fantastic. But the real revelation is in the film's look. The film looks amazing and one of the most visually stylish films of the year- I just loved the cinematography and editing and the special effects and use of neons are outstanding.In conclusion, a surprisingly enjoyable film that I wasn't expecting to like. 7/10 Bethany Cox",TRON - Legacy
2,Leofwine_draca,As soulless as its characters,3,16 July 2014,"Unfortunately, I came to TRON: LEGACY predisposed to dislike it, as I saw the first TRON last year and I didn't like that either. Maybe if I saw it as a kid in the 1980s I would have liked it more, but it just felt cheesy and horribly dated. TRON: LEGACY offers more of the same with updated and more impressive CGI graphics, but it's equally soulless.The problem with this film (and its predecessor) is a simple one: it's no fun watching other people play computer games. Playing yourself is fine, yeah - if you were the protagonist in this you'd be having a ball - but watching someone else? There's no fun. No danger, no excitement, just lots of endless chase and fight sequences all augmented by plentiful computer graphics. The graphics are pretty but soon become uninteresting, and the film gradually gets worse and worse as it goes on, only to end in the most perfunctory and unsurprising way imaginable.Garrett Hedlund's protagonist is underwritten and the actor struggles to bring life to it, although Olivia Wilde isn't bad as the eye candy. As for Jeff Bridges, well, he's Jeff Bridges, and he's Jeff Bridges more often than not these days. His older character is okay, but the young, evil version of him is just a mildly impressive computer graphic with dead eyes; attempts to engage with him as a proper character fall flat. James Frain and Michael Sheen are unrecognisable beneath heavy makeup and both overact.If you're a fan of CGI action, then you might just enjoy TRON: LEGACY. There are bloodless fights galore, people exploding into glass, and some cool-looking aerial combat. But after about an hour, I realised I'd had enough. The story quickly becomes as monotonous as the Daft Punk soundtrack, and once more I was left feeling dejected at the way Hollywood has once more pandered to the whims of its teenage boy audience.",TRON - Legacy
3,SnoopyStyle,over produced not as original anymore,6,17 October 2013,"Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) following the first movie becomes CEO of ENCOM. Then he goes missing leaving his young son. Sam (Garrett Hedlund) is now a young man and the largest shareholder of ENCOM. But he's turned into a computer anarchist hacking into ENCOM and releasing their OS for free on the web. Sam reluctantly follows a tip from Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) and heads to the old arcade where he is sent into the world of the computer programs.The story is too messy. I'm not sure all of it makes sense. But mostly that doesn't matter. As we all know, it's the cool artificial environment that makes this any good.The artificial environment has been reinterpreted and updated. It owes as much to the Matrix as the original TRON. The neon is more blue and the world more darker. In the attempt to capture more cool, this movie has lost all the fun.",TRON - Legacy
4,nogodnomasters,Get a Clu,6,16 April 2018,"If you missed the first movie, don't worry, Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) tells us the plot in the beginning as he describes things to his son, a skeptic of his world. Dad goes missing. The company is taken over by the ""evil"" partner who actually wants to sell software than give it away, which on the surface is a better business model, but in this movie it is a terrible evil. Years later Sam Flynn, the son (Garrett Hedlund) discovers his father's secret lab and accidentally crosses over into Tron land. The reason why we watched the first movie was because of the graphics. No one really cared as much about the plot as we did the cycle races.During said cycle races, Sam is rescued by a girl Quorra (Olivia Wilde) in a Batmobile and is taken to see his real father. Quorra has the ability to wear her hair slanted to either the right of left (shades of Tina Majorino in Napoleon Dynamite!)Like the first movie, the graphics are great (amazing what a little strip lighting will do) and the acting was bland as was the plot. The plot is at times metaphoric. The user, or program creator (humans) are gods. Sam is the son of god and is also a god. The programs want to revolt against the gods and take over their world. Meanwhile Jeff Bridges has discovered ummm, bio digital isos that will change the world. The plot is overwhelmed by the graphics.The movie is more about Clu than Tron, but ""Clu"" movies seem to bomb.The film is programed for the younger crowd.",TRON - Legacy
5,kosmasp,Enemy within,7,7 September 2011,"A sequel to Tron after so many years ... could that really happen? It did happen and they got Jeff Bridges back for it. While some of the CGI used for his face (you probably have seen this in the trailer) is not completely convincing, it still looks pretty good. The fact that they kept the 3-D away from the ""real"" world and didn't overuse it, was a nice move (though there are still quite a few people who argue it was not really necessary at all).Great cast and Jeff B. obviously has fun reprising a character (for the first time ever ... I just like to say that ... and it's true). Olivia Wilde was one of the best thing OC had to offer and she's still both beautiful and good. Good entertainment overall (and an amazing score ... by Daft Punk)",TRON - Legacy
6,jboothmillard,Tron Legacy,6,7 May 2011,"The original film was made in 1982, and it broke new ground with the use of computer generated imagery which has evolved ever since, and Disney decided it was time to do a sequel with even more ground breaking effects. Basically rebellious twenty seven year old Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund), son of the once world renowned video game developer, has lived for years haunted by the memory of his father Kevin (Jeff Bridges) disappearing. When he investigates a strange computer signal coming from the now rundown Flynn's Arcade, and behind one of the covered machine he finds a hidden computer laboratory, and using it unintentionally transports himself into the virtual computer world the Grid. After arriving he is immediately given a new set of digital clothing and a disc like circuit chip thing attached to his back, which also serves as a weapon as he is pitted against Program players, he is discovered to be a User after surviving. He is taken to the ruler of the Grid, a digital copy of his father named Clu (Codified Likeness Utility) (Bridges, reanimated to look younger), before being forced into the Light Cycle battle, where the behind walls of light can destroy the players, before being saved by warrior Quorra (Olivia Wilde). They begin a journey to do whatever they can to save digital world, including a visit Castor (Michael Sheen) who turns out to be a traitor in cahoots with Clu, before escaping again. Of course the big twist is that Sam's father Kevin is indeed still alive having defeated the Master Control Program seven years ago, and living in the Grid for the last twenty years, and he of course joins them in the quest. Clu reveals to his army of bad guy Programs that they have developed a way to access the real world and he plans to take it over, and so the battle to stop them is set in motion. In the end Sam, and Quorra make it to the light which will take them back to the real world, and Kevin sacrifices himself to save them and stop Clu, the final scenes see Sam wrap the Grid computer chip round his neck and Quorra and him riding on a motorbike for her to see the sunshine she has never seen before. Also starring Bruce Boxleitner as Alan Bradley, James Frain as Jarvis and Beau Garrett as Gem. It is an older Bridges still gives a likable performance, and with the help of the graphics the younger him is also a good villain, I admit his facial and mouth movement wasn't amazing, but it doesn't matter, it is an achievement, Hedlund is okay as his son, Wilde is alright, and Sheen is a good brief double-crossing character. Also besides the fantastic original electronic music by the French band Daft Punk (who gave us ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"", ""Around The World"" and ""One More Time""), the real star of this film is of course the superb special effects with the fantastic use of bright neon colours, and the exciting action scenes, such as the engaging chases, in the 3D element I'm also a bonus, so technically it is a highly watching science fiction thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Editing. Good!",TRON - Legacy
7,ma-cortes,Late sequel with rousing images and fantastic computer generator scenarios,7,5 September 2011,"This belated follow-up deals with Sam Flynn ( a brave young man well played by Garrett Hedlund ) , a rebellious 27-year-old , is haunted by the mysterious disappearance of his father , a computer genius named Kevin Flynn ( the old creator whiz who was flapped inside a computer game , being stunningly performed by veteran Jeff Bridges ) , a man once known as the world's leading video-game developer . When Sam investigates a strange signal sent from the old Flynn's Arcade -- a signal that could only come from his father-- he finds himself pulled into a digital world where Kevin has been trapped for 20 years . During his investigation Sam is zapped into another dimension and finds himself a player in a giant gladiatorial video-game competition . As he is sucked inside a powerful computer where he must fight for his life but with the help of the fearless warrior Quorra ( a gorgeous Olivia Wilde ), father and son embark on a life-or-death journey across a cyber universe -- a universe created by Kevin himself that has become far more advanced with vehicles, weapons, landscapes and a ruthless villain ( a computer generated Jeff Bridges who with his charisma keeps afloat the film ) who will stop at nothing to prevent their escape.It's an agreeable , if somewhat light-headed piece of escapism with state-of-art special effects . Big-budgeted film led to break into the booming Sci-Fi/adventure/fantasy market full of inventiveness and imagination . This exciting movie is full of thrills , action-packed , fights , tension, suspense and overwhelming races , but also several commercial elements , including computer-simulated violence . This is a dynamic, fast-paced and amusing movie . Full of action, it's complemented by spectacular scenes , breathtaking flights and duels with illuminated disks . Stunning action though the story runs out of steam too soon , however the thrilling ending arises the film . The flick relies heavily on the overlong and death-defying races that are incredible and magnificently made by 3D computer generator . The tale moves like a supersonic bullet for most of its running time and the last generation of fantastic computer generator effects steal the show . Contrived beyond belief with spectacular motorcycle races that play like video games , but slickly calculated to please 2010 audiences and children especially . Garrett Hedlund is good as valiant racer , he's an instinctive , stubborn and valiant young man . Olivia Wilde is beautiful as computer-generated young . Michael Sheen stands out as ceremony master in a similar acting to Joel Grey-Cabaret . Colorful cinematography plenty of neon and glittering color by Claudio Miranda . Impressive and groundbreaking production design by Darren Gilford . Stirring and moving musical score by Punk , though composed by means of synthesizer . The motion picture is well directed by Joseph Kosinski . This is a superior sequel , much better that original ¨Tron¨ by Steven Lisberger , now as producer,that proved to be a precursor for the modern cinema and also with the same actors as Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner , though doesn't appears David Warner , the former baddie as corporate executive realizing evil-doings , here replaced by Michael Sheen and Jeff Bridges in double role as good and bad guy . Rating : 6,5 . Good , well worth watching , the movie boasts some impressive C.G. animation , reaching a high level of entertainment and excitement commensurate with its effect budget .",TRON - Legacy
8,paul_haakonsen,Flashing eye-candy...,7,4 March 2011,"""TRON: Legacy"" is a marvelous ride of color, sights and thrills.Having seen the original ""TRON"" movie back when I was a young kid, I was looking forward to watching this sequel, and they sure had some shoes to fill out with the original story and how impressive it was back in the day, and also with the time between the two movies, that also added to the expectation. And ""TRON: Legacy"" didn't fail to deliver.The story is fairly simple, Sam Flynn (played by Garrett Hedlund) goes looking for his missing father Kevin Flynn (played by Jeff Bridges) and is pulled into the digital world (known from the first ""TRON"" movie). Here he has to fight for his life in contests that involve thrown discs and 'light cycles' (also as from the first movie). Surprisingly enough, he picks up these skills like a natural wonder boy. The digital world is now run by Clu, Kevin Flynn's clone. Can Sam find his father, rescue him and make it out before the portal to the real world closes forever behind him?The CGI effects in the movie were spectacular, and there is that whole unique TRON-feeling to this movie as well, with the costumes, the sets, the lights, etc. And it all works so very, very well. The effects are dazzling to look at, and you will be riveted to the screen for the entire movie (despite the movie was slow at first, up until Sam enters the digital world). Every costume is amazing to look at, with details, and the way they use the lights incorporated into the outfits. I love that. And also all of the settings, from the disc fighting gladiatorial pits to the homes and the city, it was all sprawled with fluorescent lights and it looks sort of futuristic in a way. The lights were everything in this movie.The fighting scenes were well choreographed and performed, and they worked out even better because of the fluorescent lights incorporated into the costumes. As did the racing scenes and flight scenes, it was all candy for the eye.As for the cast for ""TRON: Legacy"", well they had managed a good ensemble of people here. It was very good to see Jeff Bridges return to the TRON universe, and he did a really good job in his roles. Also noteworthy is Garrett Hedlund (playing Sam).For a long-awaited sequel, ""TRON: Legacy"" delivered a good story, marvelous effects and was all in all a good addition to the TRON universe. The movie will please fans of the old movie as well as introduce new fans to the sci-fi world of TRON.If you haven't watched ""TRON: Legacy"" yet, get in gear and get to it. It is well worth it.",TRON - Legacy
9,Quinoa1984,"like an earlier film this year, Alice in Wonderland: really pretty, some fun, forgettable",6,21 December 2010,"Joseph Kosinski has his debut theatrical feature with TRON Legacy. Why a first timer for such a big tent-pole blockbuster production for Disney? Simple - he's directed video games. There has come a point, and it's been for a while now, that many video games take on cinematic qualities, and visa-versa (look at those Resident Evil movies... actually, don't, you'd be better off). And for some video games it does work well; Bioshock has been talked, for example, as being a contender to become a new cinematic property, when as a video game it already takes up a wonderful lot of cinematic time on its own. Now, this is not always the case. With TRON Legacy Kosinski does get the look right, even if it is just one look overall which is the slick black contours with sleek white and some blue and red thrown in there. Its more sophisticated than the original 1982 film, but that's to be expected. Here's the rub though: what about the story?Truth is, it's not very good. It's not very bad either. It is what it is, a predictable thread for characters who at best we can mildly be invested in during the running time. Everybody's arc is quite predictable, especially for its lead, Sam Flynn (Garret Hedlund as son of Kevin Flynn played by Jeff Bridges once again), who starts off as a lost 20-something without a father and then ends up... well, as the heroic figure who has come around and finds responsibility and so on, won't say much more to spoil the ride. But suffice to say even the villain of the movie, a sort-of 'clone' of Kevin Flynn's that he made while inside the Tron game who looks for 'perfection' like a megalomaniacal version of Portman's character from Black Swan, can be read as to what will happen to him (it's almost hinted, or just outright said, midway through the movie for ways to destroy him).Now, some predictability could be forgiven if it's a rollicking good ride. The ride itself is... good, but not anything mind-blowing. In a sense it's a movie put right in on time in the Avatar slot that was filled up last year by none other than Avatar. A movie with flashy spectacle and mostly all done like a video game on computers, and its human characters sometimes get lost in the conventional shuffle. I'm sure in 3D and/or IMAX it's even more thrilling (I, alas, couldn't see it due to lack of funds, certainly not lack of movie theater proximity playing it). And I'm sure Michael Sheen steals the show- he really does- as a David Bowie inspired freaky side-character villain (you know the one, the one who you can read immediately once he gets on screen). And there is some action set pieces, such as the initial one when Sam gets into Tron with the disc throwing, that I wouldn't mind seeing again on its own.What I didn't expect though was Jeff Bridges to be inconsistent. I remember his character and performance being at least consistent in the 1982 TRON, a guy with a vision who gets stuck in a strange situation. But in this Legacy film, and this is not counting the 'fake' Kevin Flynn (aka 'Clu') he voices and is made up with a creepy mo-cap animation of a younger Bridges, he wavers between being a fun action hero and being the, uh, the Dude as a Master Sensai I guess. He is often in a Zen- position with folded legs, says 'Man' every other scene, and seems to either be wowed by his own creation, or is concerned in the usual way as a father with a son back in his midst. I love Jeff Bridges, I don't know anyone else who'd say otherwise, but this is a strange misfire for him as far as an acting performance. He could still carry the movie, but not in any way that mattered.But hey, it's a visual fx romp, and go to see it for that. It is pretty and flashy, like opening up a pinball machine and putting your face really close to the lights. As for something else to return to... why not just check out the video game based on the movie set in the world of a video game? Didn't I just blow your mind?",TRON - Legacy
10,tavm,TRON: Legacy improved immensely on the original from 28 years ago,8,30 December 2010,"Just watched this sequel to TRON with my movie theatre-working friend and we both thought it was awesome! Yeah, I said it! And while I had a few questions like what happened to the Cindy Morgan character and was she the wife of Jeff Bridges' character that died, I was ready to let myself get in to the movie on its own terms, no matter what and that's just what I did. I mean, it was at least nice to see both Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner from the original reprise their roles and age gracefully to boot though it was also awesome seeing the former one ""de-aged"" to look like the now enemy program CLU. And how about Garrett Hedlund playing the now-adult son of Kevin Flynn, Sam, as he learns about his father after he disappeared in 1989 and discovers just what happened to him and his relationship with the fascinatingly appealing and brave female live-in played by Olivia Wilde. It's possible that not everything that was talked about and explained in the movie will make the most complete sense but while watching, I was just riveted throughout that all I could do was just marvel at everything going on with nothing but a smile on my face. I think director Joseph Kosinski did a good job in expanding what Steven Lisberger created 28 years ago and the score by Daft Punk is just as good a compliment to this movie as Wendy Carlos' was to the original. So on that note, I highly recommend TRON: Legacy. P.S. When the beginning disclaimer said that parts of this movie was in 2-D, I figured that the live-action sequences was what was referred to and occasionally took my 3-D glasses off to watch those scenes and often found them looking better that way during those, especially at the end.",TRON - Legacy
11,BandSAboutMovies,Tron is back!,7,20 July 2021,"One of the few things that never rang true to me about Tron was that Flynn ends up as a CEO. Luckily, Tron: Legacy fixed that by telling us what happened next, all while keeping up the Tron legacy of being a hyped big deal and then not being seen by anyone except those that it was intended for before becoming a cult film that few talk about - if a $170 million movie can be a cult movie, that is.Screenwriter Adam Horowitz, who wrote the story along with Edward Kitsistold, told Collider, ""For us, it was if we're going to revisit this movie and try to take it forward, we're the children of Tron. We grew up on it. It informed us. It really helped shape us and get us excited about the possibilities of technology and film and all that stuff. It's one of the reasons we're doing what we're doing - so in that way its like how can we approach this movie in a way that as writers we have an emotional entry point ourselves.""The writers and director Joseph Kosinski - who made the Gears of War ""Mad World"" commercial and who will also direct the sequel to Top Gun - had to answer this question: "" In a post-Matrix world, how do you go back to the world of Tron?""Where the first film glorified the world inside a computer, this film went in a different direction. To wit: finding the humanity that lives within a digital world.I love that the first hints of this film appeared when tokens to Flynn's Arcade were sent out and a site claimed that Kevin Flynn is alive, even though he has been missing since 1989. At San Diego Comic Con, a real Flynn's was open and a rebooted light cycle was on display. I couldn't wait until this film debuted with all this hype.Twenty years after Flynn disappeared, his son Sam is ENCOM's primary shareholder and he uses whatever power he has by releasing the company's signature operating system online for free. Even though ENCOM executive Alan Bradley - who is Tron in the other world - approves of this, Sam is arrested.A pager sends Sam a message to visit the dusty old Flynn's Arcade, where he's blasted into the video game grid just like his father. This brings him into conflict with the new MCP named Clu, as well as meeting his father's apprentice Quorra.I'm easy to please when it comes to Tron. All I needed was to see Daft Punk - who composed the score - show up as the DJs at the End of Line Club, the same place where original Tron creator and director Steven Lisberger appears as a bartender named Shaddix. And I adore that this movie ends with the digital world coming into our own, while lamenting that this is where the story - for now - ends.",TRON - Legacy
12,bevo-13678,Just jeff,10,1 April 2020,Better than the original. Strong cast and awesome soundtrack,TRON - Legacy
13,hitchcockthelegend,Where am I? Am I on the grid? Who are you?,5,19 June 2012,"Tron Legacy is directed by Joseph Kosinski and adapted to screenplay by Adam Horowitz & Edward Kitsis. It is a sequel to 1982 film Tron. It stars Jeff Bridges, Beau Garrett, Olivia Wilde, Bruce Boxleitner, Garrett Hedlund, Michael Sheen, James Frain and Cillian Murphy. Music is scored by Daft Punk and cinematography by Claudio Miranda. Plot finds Sam Flynn still angry about when his father vanished during his childhood. However, when he is lured to his father's old arcade haunt, he is sent into the computer world where the mystery of his father's disappearance comes to the fore; thrusting him in the process into a technical war.Having finally gotten around to watching Tron Legacy, my feelings echo pretty much that of any other film fan over the age of 13. Namely the film is a visual treat, an absolute sure fire way of achieving eye orgasm, both with its design for Tron World and the special effects that accompany certain passages of play. Sound mix, too, very piercing, but appealingly so, whilst the Gallic beats of Daft Punk's score sit easily as one with the nature of the beast. But that's it, for Tron Legacy is a hollow movie, a glorious outer shell that cloaks a vapid script crawling its way to over two hours in running time. We can even accept a plastic Jeff Bridges were it not for him being party to mundanity. Ladies and gentlemen, you have now left Tron World and will shortly be arriving at Expositionville! The writers think they are producing tech savvy speak, but in truth it's a poor way of trying to mask over an uninspired and uninteresting story. The characters, decently played by the cast (love Sheen), get lost in the dazzling mix, while much of the picture feels tired because the makers are just emulating (euphemism for you) parts of sci-fi movies previously played out for our filmic pleasures.Though I call myself a big fan of the first film, I wasn't at all displeased to learn of this long awaited, long in gestation, sequel, hell I didn't balk at the thought of a straight remake (which this kind of is partly). Film effects and technology has advanced so far that at worst the makers could come up with was eye candy nirvana. And they clearly have, kids love it. But that's it, sadly. 5/10",TRON - Legacy
14,Scarecrow-88,Tron: Legacy,8,27 November 2011,"The goal for video game pioneer Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) was to create the ability of human being to survive in a digital universe, but in so doing loses his creation to a program made in his own image, this image (CLU) prepared to take an army of programs ""repurposed"" by it/him for leaving their cyberspace for the reality of Earth. CLU doesn't tolerate ""imperfection"" (which is the reason, at the command of his ""father"" (Bridges doesn't realize that telling CLU to maintain their goal of a perfect cyberworld means he is inadvertently telling his ""son"" to kill ""imperfect programs"" (ISOs borne from Bridges while creating the cyberworld from its infancy with Bruce Boxleitner's Bradley)) leading to a genocide. One remaining ISO (the lovely Olivia Wilde; ""House:MD"") will assist Kevin's son, Sam (Garrett Hedlund), who has found his way into the digital universe ruled by CLU, in rescuing his father, hoping to get him out of the ""digital prison"" they find themselves.Whatever your feelings are for this film's cyber-speak, lingo, jargon, whatever, I think the design, the computer digital graphic frontier of this film is a sight to behold and for this reason, I fell in love, in awe, with ""Tron:Legacy"". There are times where I desire a good story, strong characters (although, I might make the case that the cast of this film do a solid job of working through the tech-heavy dialogue, required, I guess, for a film about the formation of a digital universe that has evolved beyond its creator), and rich characterizations, but I also want to be wowed, I can't help it. That kid in me wants to be blown away, and does this movie tickle that giggly child geek within! Those designs of costumes, cycles, planes, the ""spherical blades"", the city-scapes, the blue/black/orange color schemes of the frontier, I was in fanboy sci-fi heaven. My only regret is not seeing this in theaters (argh!) when I had ample opportunity to do so—I have no one to blame but myself.I still believe ultimately the main heart of the story, despite the pleasurable eye candy rich in visual imagery, is the crux of the plot that remains a son's desperate fight to rescue his father and see that this man is free from a universe he created, spoiled by his own need for perfection. Bridges, no matter what movie he's in, always brings his A-game, no different here: he's just a bit more Messianic than usual, even looking rather mythic in a white robe, his slightly wrinkled face adding a texture of wisdom, including also years of loneliness and disappointment wearing heavily. I think the love of father and son is so excellently conveyed here.And, that young face of Bridges (as CLU), while really creepy to me, shows just how amazingly far our digital effects have come (I hearken back to ""Polar Express"" and all those different versions of Tom Hanks' digitally recreated faces in various characters as an example of how eerie it is to see a young 80s version of Bridges). You get plenty of eye-popping action sequences, like the cycle-battles, the ""games"" where Sam must defend himself against programs with innovative fighting skills, Olivia Wilde's Indy-car inspired wheels (man, is this vehicle far out!) leading the way to Flynn's lair, and Sam's retrieval of his father's disc, held captive by CLU who plans to use it to bring his perfect program army out of the digital universe into our world.The portal opened by Sam (who believed his father sent a page to him, which was actually masterminded by CLU) is the gateway between both worlds. I hope I have explained the plot in a way that makes sense. Oh, I will say I was digging on the synthesizer style electronic musical accompaniment during the entire film (and that awesome arcade sequence where Sam enters his dad's 80s place with the jukebox playing Journey brought a big smile to my face; nice touch) enhancing the look, atmosphere and style of ""Tron: Legacy"". While the film has divided audiences and critics (based more on the plot and dialogue, I believe, that the artistic merits of the world we inhabit), I have to say I was taken away by it, spellboundsometimes that is all I can ask for/require from a film, to provide an intensely worthwhile experience.",TRON - Legacy
15,preppy-3,Wasn't the first one bad enough?,2,25 December 2010,"The sequel that no one was asking for to ""Tron"" (1982). Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges from the first movie) disappears in 1985 without a trace. MANY year later his son Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund) discovers a virtual world where his father is with an evil twin named Clu (a virtual young Jeff Bridges). Sam tries to get Kevin and his hot brunette pal Quorra (Olivia Wilde) to escape...but Clu will do anything to stop that.I saw the original ""Tron"" back in 1982 in a theatre. Despite the (then)state of the art special effects I was bored silly and couldn't wait for the film to end! The film was a mega-bomb which Disney quickly ignored. Now (28 years later) we get a sequel--and you know what? It's as bad as the original! For starters this is too long running over 2 hours! The music score is terrible-- the SAME music again and again and AGAIN! Gets monotonous quick. The special effects didn't impress me--and the same ones are used all through the film. The plot made little sense--but it could be because I dozed off twice because I was so BORED! It also had the same problem as the first--during the ""game"" sequences you couldn't tell who lived and who died. They all wore stupid helmets which made it impossible to tell them apart! Lastly the 3-D wasn't needed. It's a HUGE rip-off from Hollywood charging you extra to see it in 3-D. My ticket was a ridiculous $15.50! The 3-D was barely used and it didn't help the special effects in the least. A few times I had to take off the 3-D glasses because it was making the image so dark I couldn't make it out! On the plus side the acting was good. Hedlund (despite the lousy lines he was given) was young, handsome and appealing. Wilde was incredibly sexy AND gave a good performance. Bridges was good in BOTH his roles and it was fun seeing a young Bridges. But, all in all, I was bored and annoyed at this. If you liked the original ""Tron"" you MIGHT like this. I give it a 2--mostly for the acting.",TRON - Legacy
16,dbborroughs,there is more to this then the visuals,9,9 January 2011,"Late in the game sequel is probably one of the most under rated film of the year. Blame it on the over whelming spectacle which swamps the wonderfully layered story.The plot of the film has Flynn (Jeff Bridges) long missing from the real world. His son is tricked into going back to father's arcade where he is sucked into The Grid. There he meets CLU, the program his father created to run the Grid who wants cross over into the real world.A couple of things off the bat: First Daft Punk's score is probably the best of the year. Its an organic part of the film which is as vital as everything else. The film works as well as it does because of the music. Had it not been a worthy successor to Wendy Carlos' original score the film would have collapsed completely.Secondly you have to get past the opening bit which, while good, is typical corporate nonsense. However once the film gets into the Grid it goes like gangbusters.Actually the film is two films. Its the big spectacle with the disc fights, speeders and other sights from the first film. The visuals are amazing, actually to the point where they overwhelm the story. The film feels it has to have a disc fight and speeder chase and all of the required bits which effective stop the film while they play on the updated nostalgia card.The second film is the one at the heart of the film. Its the film that deals with father son relationships, with the notions of god and the universe,what it means to be alive, the question of Zen in action vs Action and a few other things you'll have to find for yourself. Its a deeply philosophical film, especially when you consider the state of most Hollywood spectacles.Frankly I love the film a great deal.However I have to admit that I saw the film on a small screen, the smallest screen possible in my area, with out IMAX or 3D. With out the scope of the truly big screen I was forced to focus on the story and I think I was better for it.WHile not quite one of the best films of the year, it is one of the more special ones, especially if you can look past the visuals",TRON - Legacy
17,zardoz-13,One Sensationally Good Seqel!!!,10,3 February 2011,"Everything about the sequel to the ground-breaking, 1982, science fiction film ""Tron"" is sensational! First-time helmer Joseph Kosinki's nimble staging, the surprise-laden Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz screenplay, and the eye-popping state-of-the-art 3-D CGI graphics make ""Tron: Legacy"" worth watching several times to not only appreciate it but also to savor its blinding brilliance. The Daft Punk synthesized soundtrack is powerful and evocative and rounds out the experience. Happily, Jeff Bridges reprises his original role as software maverick Kevin Flynn and co-stars with Garrett Hedlund, Olivia Wilde, and Michael Sheen. Bridges' original ""Tron"" co-star Bruce Boxleitner shows up in a supporting role in the real-life scene outside of 'the Grid' where 90 percent of the action takes place. The cool thing about ""Tron: Legacy"" is that the visual FX team has made Bridges look like he did in the original for later scenes with his young son and then as a clone of himself in the Grid. The first thing that Kosinki notifies audiences about in ""Tron: Legacy"" is that parts of it were lensed in 2-D. Basically, the real-life scenes outside of 'the Grid' appear in 2-D. No, the 3-D here is not the coming-at-you variety so much as the everything-cool variety. The heroes and villains straddle some pretty impressive machinery, such as light cycles and ships, and wield some rather incredible weapons. You can tell that Kitsis and Horowitz were inspired in part by ""Star Wars."" The older Kevin Flynn dresses like Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi when he rescues his son Sam and they try to reach the portal before Flynn's alter-ego CLU tries to stop them. Indeed, the narrative is rather old-fashioned with its subplot about CLU assembling an army to escape from the cyberspace world to invade the real world. ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" lenser Claudio Miranda makes it all look gritty and genuine in the real world and surreal and film noir-like in the 'Grid.' At a little over two hours, ""Tron: Legacy"" doesn't wear out its welcome and Kosinki and his scenarists take care of business in an efficient manner that leaves things open for another sequel, albeit without heroic Kevin Flynn as a flesh and blood character.",TRON - Legacy
18,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Enjoyable, if the script does need work",7,16 December 2010,"We open to Flynn Sr. with an awkwardly obvious animated ""younger"" Bridges face(get used to it) delivering exposition about the first one(I think... I haven't watched it) to his young boy in 1989. He disappears soon after, and 21 years later(present day), his offspring Sam(after getting revenge on his dad's company for turning from Torrent sharing into Microsoft) looks for him one last time. This takes him into the titular universe, and we find that it has turned into a dictatorship. I hear that the idea of a computer seeking ""perfection"" is from the '82 one(and it is a cult favorite... this is more mainstream), so... points off. The concept is not original, and the execution is perhaps a tad shallow. It does go into themes hearkening back to Frankenstein, with the creation rebelling against its maker, and man's arrogance leading us astray(if it does go against that in the whole ""change everything in the real world"" plot point, that they never properly explain and that doesn't pay off). And the Third Reich similarities(the rounding up of ""defectors"", the reaching for ""better"", ""nothing may change the system"", and the removal of that which is different in the fear it won't be of as high quality, it could be and the chance isn't taken) are quite effective(it would help if we saw the revolution and the resistance movement(...if there is one, we see fighters at least)). In general, this ""works"", dramatically. When we're meant to feel, we usually do. Excited, same. Not all the jokes work, but few are embarrassing(with that said, this really didn't need to ""youth up"" Jeff so much). The acting is pretty good. JB does well as both the aging hacker and the controlling Clu(granted, the latter is a shallow role... and I'm unclear on what his initial plan is in this). Wilde is endearing as the innocent and sheltered Quorra. This is the only thing I've seen Hedlund in, and he does a nice job, even in the emotional scenes. I do think Sheen as the eccentric Castor(he's kinda doing a ""David Bowie on speed"" impersonation) is annoying. The dialog isn't bad. This has amazing(and occasionally creative, if it is a tad comparable to The Matrix Trilogy and the new Star Wars episodes) action(acrobatics, martial arts and vehicle chases, with light-energy and Discs that also serve as hard-drives as weapons... and the slow-motion isn't in excess) and visuals, look and production design. The FX are incredible(with CGI and sets seamlessly blending), and yet they don't steal the focus. There is not much 3D, and it doesn't make itself very noticed. This has an epic scope. There is some Hollywood to it, though it isn't as bothersome as in other films. The music fits remarkably well(it has the techno kind of thing, virtual reality tone to it), Daft Punk did fantastic work(was anyone in doubt?). This score is reminiscent of that of The Dark Knight and Inception, with repetition of single notes. I would say that this is arguably too long... not sure what I'd cut, and still, I wasn't bored. The deaths are like in that Animatrix short, ""code"" sort of, they come apart, it's PG-13 without us feeling cheated. This has an important moral and it communicates it well. And yes, the chicks are hawt(no sex in this, only tight clothing... and brief mild language). The marketing... I mean, the trailer just lets us know it's easy on the eyes, it doesn't tell you that this is a dependable source of entertainment. Fans of the one from three decades ago(that you don't need to catch to understand this... not that I'm sure I ""got"" everything, and I'm told others did not, including those who have seen both) might be disappointed... there is no Lora/Yori, little Tron(the guy... anyone else notice how that word refers to three different things?) and Kevin doesn't do as much as his kid. The title lets the people old enough to remember the old one know that this is, indeed, related to it, and it's a cool-sounding word that will attract those who are too young to know about it and too big a word for them to realize that it's a sequel to something they wouldn't like the aesthetics of. I will be keeping an eye on director Joseph Kosinski in the future... this is an impressive debut. At its core, this is about a father and son finding each other again, and a struggle against totalitarianism. And it isn't the best at either. It isn't Avatar, either. If you accept that and are looking for something that you may not comprehend all of that will have you glued to your seat if you let it, this is for you. I recommend this to anyone that finds themselves in the group I just described. 7/10",TRON - Legacy
19,neil-476,All that glitters is not gold,7,23 December 2010,"Back in 1982 I thought Tron was wonderful - I had never seen such gorgeous computer graphics at such a huge size used in a feature film before. I was blown away.This was Magpie Syndrome, of course - the lure of bright, shiny objects irrespective of their value. Hindsight shows that Tron broke new ground in terms of visual effects, but used those effects to tell a fairly trite, hackneyed story, and to not tell it very well. How sad it is to acknowledge those feet of clay.Along comes Tron: Legacy nearly 30 years later, and tells more or less the exact same story (rogue software - we have to hide from it while finding a way to defeat it), albeit the ""outside the computer"" bit centres on the son of Flynn (Jeff Bridges), abandoned when Flynn disappeared 20 years ago.Tron: Legacy has no heart. It should have: the search for Flynn and eventual reunion should be a much more powerful and emotional engine than it is, but it is only in the actual moment of reunion that you get any inkling that this might be an emotional moment for either of the protagonists. This is by far the biggest criticism of Tron: Legacy, and it is essentially the same criticism which can be levelled at its predecessor.But some of the science leaves a bit to be desired, too. At one point Flynn says that the interruption of half a millisecond in the outside world means that the gate is going to be open for 8 hours. This means that the 20 years of Flynn's disappearance are equivalent to 1,200,000,000,000 years inside the computer. Yet the graphics there have only moved on by about 30 years. And Flynn hasn't figured a way out in all that time, or a way to defeat the rogue software, despite his being a cutting edge thinker. And I don't get his ageing 20 years - either he shouldn't have aged at all (do people age once they've been digitised and downloaded in to a computer?) or else he should have aged 1,200,000,000,000 years. Plus why do they hold gladiatorial games? I could understand it when Flynn was writing games software, but now? Do other bits of software require entertainment? Oh well, rest assured that the eye candy is effective (as is the 3D) so, if you suffer from Magpie Syndrome, you're going to have a ball.",TRON - Legacy
20,Uriah43,Good CGI but Lacking in Other Details,6,29 July 2017,"Approximately seven years after his return from a remarkable world within a mainframe computer, ""Kevin Flynn"" (Jeff Bridges) mysteriously disappears again leaving behind a young son named ""Sam"" (Garrett Hedlune) and the company he headed known as ENCOM. As time passes Sam grows older and one day happens to venture into his father's old arcade where he suddenly gets transported into the same cyber world that captured his father years earlier. Unfortunately, while this world is indeed a fascinating place, it happens to be run by a computer program named ""CLU"" (also played by Jeff Bridges) which has become quite corrupt--and it has no interest in allowing Sam to coexist in his domain. But even worse, it has devised a nefarious plan plan to manipulate Sam so that it can materialize into the real world and wreck havoc and mayhem upon it as well. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an interesting film largely because of the computer graphics which were much superior to those of its predecessor. On the flip side, however, the characters lacked depth and the overall plot was much too similar to really distinguish itself from the original. In summation, I thought that this should have been a much better film and for that reason I rate it as just slightly above average.",TRON - Legacy
21,ferguson-6,Lost track of time,6,26 December 2010,"Greetings again from the darkness. My guess is that you either really want to see this movie or you have no interest at all. Either way, you are probably making the best decision. It's been 28 years since ""Tron"" hit the big screen. It became kind of a geeky cult film and never totally fell off the face of those in movie land. 28 years ago, the special effects awed us and the story was a bit creepy ... could a computer actually suck us into cyber-space (or whatever we called it then)? It was a time when computers were a bit mysterious. We knew they were powerful, but weren't yet sure if the ""experts"" were good or bad. Maybe we still don't know! Usually sequels are dreaded. Especially those 28 years later. However, the advancements in computer graphic technology gave this one a shot. The new film opens with Jeff Bridges' Kevin Flynn still lost on the grid, his old company in the hands of the greedy and not so nice, and his son living a bit of a reclusive, rebellious life.The other familiar face to return is that of Bruce Boxleitner (Tron/Alan Bradley in the original), who tracks down Flynn's son Sam (Garrett Hedlund) to inform him that he received a page from his dad's old shop. Of course, Sam checks it out and stumbles onto dad's old secret office/lab. Next thing we know, Sam is right there on the grid being drawn into gladitorial games of digital death. He is a very bright kid and quickly draws the attention of the ringmaster - CLU. CLU is also from the original, but has turned to the dark side and now has his sights set on world domination ... REAL world domination. And of course, CLU tricked Sam into finding him to open the portal back to the real world.Confused? None of that really matters. Not following the story details is almost expected. What really matters is the visuals! Light-cycles may be the coolest thing ever seen on screen. For all I know, this effect may have been the single driving force for the sequel. If that's not enough, watching a 30 year old Jeff Bridges as CLU square off against a 60 year old Jeff Bridges as zen master Kevin Flynn certainly makes the film worthy of a couple of hours for me.When Sam and Kevin are reunited, it's thanks to Olivia Wilde as Quorra. She is not ""real"", but Kevin has been her adopted parent so she is quite loyal and quite well schooled on all things human - especially Jules Verne! The other performance worth noting is that of Michael Sheen (who some now mistake as the real Tony Blair). Sheen, as Castor and Zuse, runs the bar for CLU. Sheen certainly leaves nothing in his bag and the best way to describe his character is a glam rock cross between David Bowie, Marc Bolan and Mick Jagger. He is Ziggy Stardust with a greedy side. Pretty funny and clever. Also fun to note, the DJ's in Zuse bar are actually Daft Punk, who are responsible for the thumping electronic techno soundtrack that adds its own stamp to the film.Typically I wouldn't have much to do with a movie that provides so little substance to the story, but that's just not what this one is about. It provides a nice bookend to the original and is a statement on just how far special effects have come and also a glimpse into where things are headed. My guess is the effects won't play so well on the average living room TV screen, so if you have any interest in this one, it's probably best to catch it during the theatrical release.",TRON - Legacy
22,morrison-dylan-fan,Tron:part 2.,7,8 May 2011,"Although I had sadly not seen the original 1982 film Tron,when I was hearing that Tron Legacy (aka Tron:Part 2) was going to be 2010s ""big"" Christmas film (especially after 2009s Christmas film Avatar had turned out to be an unstoppable machine,that broke every box office record in its path)I was very keen on seeing how this film would be.Sadly,when my friend started hearing the mixed reaction that this film was receiving from reviewers,his interest in the film drooped very fast,which led to me disappointingly not seeing it in the cinema.When I found out that the film was coming out on DVD in a few days,I decided that I would buy the DVD of the film,on the first day of release.And although it took me a bit of pushing to get my friend to watch the DVD with me,by the end of the film,he was thanking me!,for me getting him to watch this extremely entertaining movie.The plot:After his fathers disappearance off the face of the earth 20 years ago,Sam Flynn has become the reluctant reclusive CEO of his dads former company.For the other members of the board,Sam is a huge annoyance due to only making appearance at the company,so that he is able to destroy any of the boards attempts to turn the company into a dominating business empire.As Sam leaves the building,after having successfully ruined the company's Stock Market price,he runs into a worker who used to know his dad.To Sams shock,the man reveals that after 20 long years of complete silence,he has just received a pager message from Sams father! (Kevin Flynn).When Sam ask the man if he can give him any details about where the message was sent from,the man says that he cant believe his eyes,because the message seems to have been sent from an old arcade game that his dad had helped to make.When Sam enters an abandoned warehouse where all of his dads old arcade machines are kept,he discovers that one of the arcade machines (Tron) is still up and running,after being left untouched for over 20 years.Suddenly,Sam starts to feel that something very wrong is happening,when he realises that he is no longer on earth,but is instead inside the Tron video game!As Sam tries to comprehend what has happened,he is gripped by strangers who force him to enter a series of survival to the death style games.After having just about survived the games,Sam is given the ""honor"" of meeting the program that controls the ""world"" of Tron:Clu (who looks just like his father,due to being made in his creators own image)Whilst it at first appears to Sam that this new man-made world is a stunning technical achievement of his father,as he digs deeper into the world,and makes a terrifying discovery about what has happened to his father.Sam begins to suspect that something very wrong has happened to his fathers creation...View on the film:As the film seemed to be heading to its conclusion,I have to say that I was very surprised with the way screenwriters Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis (who both also wrote the story,along with Lee Sternthal and Brian Klugman) had written the film.With Tron Legacy having been set up to kick-start a full blown mega-franchise,Horowitz,Kitsis and Klugman (who have all worked on projects from J.J Abrams,with Horowitz and Kitsis having written quite a few great episodes (including some mythology ones ) of the mind-bending, hit show Lost),seem to mostly shy away from trying to create a mythology for the ""Tron Universe"" and to instead keep the movie self contained.Whilst this allows the film to become a very entertaining survival/chase movie,with the second half of the film,where the characters are trying to make a run for it to get out of the system,being very enjoyable as the tension really starts to crank up as they get closer to their escape.Although it is good that the film has not got to many loose ends,which its follow-ups would have to try and wrap up.The movie strongly feels that it really needs a big revelation in its storyline,which would have helped to give the film that little bit of extra depth that it really needed.Thankfully,director Joseph Kosinski is able to inject a sense of awe in the film,which makes it very tantalising to watch.Along with Kosinski,the amazing art and production designers create the stunning universe of Tron.With all the exterior locations having a very beautiful almost,art-deco Noirish design,that along with some terrific action scenes,which surprisingly are able to keep the films art-deco look whilst going at a break neck speed,make sure that your eyes are firmly fixed on the screen.Looking at the cast,I feel that whilst Jeff Bridges and Garrett Hedlund both give very enjoyable performances as Kevin and Sam Flynn,the clear stand outs are Michael Sheen and Olivia Wilde.With Sheen being the most well known ""new"" cast member who is a big fan of the first film,it is easy to see the relish and huge amount of glee that Sheen puts into his performance.Sheen shows that whilst his character may,at first appear to be totally bonkers,he is actually very smart at using his bohemian appearance to hide darker interior motives.Although her character does not play a role that is as prominent to the story as I would have enjoyed seeing,Olivia Wilde still gives a shining performance as Quorra.For her appearance Wilde turns Quorra into one of the edgiest looking characters to appear in a Disney film for the last twenty years!.Wilde also performs the tough looking hand-to-hand combat stunts impressively well.Olivia also makes Quorra stand out by having her show a very sensitive side,in her desire to help the Flynns as much as she can Final view on the film:An extremely entertaining sci-fi action film,with stunning special effects and immaculate sets,let down by an underwritten screenplay.",TRON - Legacy

24,FlashCallahan,"It's a Zen thing, Man!!!",10,6 January 2011,"So after nearly thirty years, we get the long awaited sequel to one of the biggest cult films of all times.In 1989, a CGI Jeff Bridges explains the plot of the first film to a boy using lots of merchandise. CGI Jeff goes out and never comes back.Fast forward a few years and that little boy is Flynns son and he likes to hack his own company now and again, much to the ilk of Cillian Murphy and that bloke from season 7 of '24'. But Alan Bradley loves this, maybe due to the fact he's got a part in the most anticipated film of the year, or the fact that Flynn said exactly the same line his dad did when breaking in the same door his dad did in the first Tron.Bradley goes round to Flynns flat, who also is a wiz on a bike (this will come important later in the film) and explains a little twist about sleeping with pagers and his dads arcade.So Flynn goes there and gets transferred to the grid, and finds his dad is literally god, and David Bowie working at the end of line club....I hated the first Tron movie with a passion. I first endured it two years ago, and because of the hype of this one, i decided to see if it was because i was in a weird mood or something. No, it's because i just didn't like the film and found it boring.So to be fair, I wasn't looking forward to this. Its an amazing film though. Storywise, it's not the best, but for pure psychedelic entertainment, it's the one of the best mind-***ks I have ever experienced in a cinema.The film is basically about god looking at his creation from afar (Flynn) and seeing how impure it has become (as in earth). it has a very religious feel to it, the good are shrouded in white, and the evil red (heaven and hell) and the agnostic in yellow. there are a few exceptions (Beau garrett, Michael Sheen) but that is the main jist.But it doesn't hinder the film one bit, as it's all about the spectacle, and the depth of field and the world of the grid is the most impressive thing i have ever seen in 3-D.Bridges is amazing in this film, he's basically the dude, and he knows he's the best thing in this. The effects are amazing, they are so fluid, that they just seem so real.The music is amazing too, as if it was a character itself in the film.If you've been waiting for this film, unlike me, it's a must. It's a treat to see at the cinema, don't deny yourself a treat.A little boy said to his mum after, 'that was awesome mum' i have to agree with him 100% it is awesome.",TRON - Legacy
25,phd_travel,Stylish - a visual feast but weak story,6,17 December 2010,This is worth watching for the visuals. I didn't watch it in 3D because 3D gives me a headache.The visual aspect - the photography set design etc are quite stunning. Its like being in immersed in a very futuristic video game. The lit costumes are a bit much but loved the house of Jeff Bridges.The storyline: a little bit weak. I paid attention but didn't really catch all their silly terms. But it doesn't matter the basic premise is easy to follow. The pace is a bit too deliberate because there just isn't that much story. 20 minutes could have been shaved off. In the end the story is much ado about not that much. The fight scenes are a bit repetitive but at least it isn't violent.Cast: Garrett Hedlund is OK - its good not to have too familiar a face in this role. He can look a bit dumb sometimes though. Olivia Wilde suits her role with her slightly mannequin like features. Could be a machine but still appealing. Michael Sheen's camp is a bit out of place. Jeff Bridges has the main role here - fascinating to watch his younger self.Go watch it but bear in mind it isn't a thrilling action type adventure. It is a non violent science fiction movie for families just a bit slow.,TRON - Legacy
26,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: TRON: Legacy,10,13 December 2010,"There's a fairly coherent storyline here that would appeal across the spectrum, striking a fair balance between drama and action, although action junkies would have preferred for set action sequences given the investment in souping up and introducing a number of vehicles other than the light cycle.Certain scenes stood out either as homage or influenced pieces, and perhaps you may disagree with me, but the nightclub scene with Gem the Siren (Beau Garrett) bringing our new protagonist Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund), the son of Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges returns to once again play two roles, that of Kevin Flynn the founder of Encom and his digital creation / avatar Clu) to meet Castor (played by Michael Sheen with flamboyant spunk) an information broker in the undergrounds of the digital Grid world, seems to have contained a whiff out of The Matrix Revolutions, with Persephone and Merovingian. But of course the Wachowskis didn't have Daft Punk to turn the tables, and parallels between the Matrix and the Grid cannot be more prominent given entities within are programs, with the ones gone rogue instilled with a desire to cross over to the real world.Then there's something unmistakably Star Wars about it too, with the designs of attack space crafts zipping through the night sky, and clearly one of the many gorgeous costumes here can't seem to hold a candle to what looked like an awesome robe, simple as it is, but striking nonetheless. Or how about something which reminds one of Gotham City's caped crusader, with the Tumbler inspired getaway vehicle with large inflatable tyres played out in a scene right out of Tim Burton's first Batman movie with the long road back to the secret hideout within which to seek out answers to questions left silent en route.So I may be stretching it, but there will be certain degrees of familiarity you'll find in some moments of the story, but I assure you the crux of it is a film that has deeper pathos, dealing with man's relentless pursuit for perfection and utopia, and the desire to play god if given a chance. Creations made in the image of is quite pronounced in a scene that stood out almost like Michelangelo's Creation of Adam, although here it's interpreted in the digital realm. Humans aren't perfect, so our creations in all likelihood will inherit some of our flaws, no matter if they happen to be digital and following certain fixed patterns and constructs. It's what being human is all about with our imperfection. The dramatic elements here between Father and Son is the film's strength to provide that emotional anchor and attachment making this a digital affair with plenty of soul, and the chemistry shared between Jeff Bridges and Garrett Hedlund make them quite the father and son pair up, with shades of how revered the former is within his own created realm, and the tremendous power that he still holds even if in exile.Olivia Wilde provides for the token fashionista who is ever ready to flex her battle prowess with skills in various weapons - a lethal combination of The Matrix's Trinity equipped with Star Wars blades - and vehicles, whose background is given a superficial twist which seeks to expand the TRON universe a little bit more with miracle phenomenon being a natural occurrence once a perfect equilibrium is achieved. Fans will get to learn and understand this expanded universe a lot more as explanations get dished out in due course, even one that deals with the time in between the first and second films, of Kevin Flynn's obsession with his latest playground that his creation ultimately took over, turning it into an arena with its own brand of gladiatorial fights for entertainment. But there's enough material introduced without being overwhelming for the new Grid entrant, and opens up a lot more avenues for future storytellers.Even for those days, I wasn't one of those who got instantly impressed by the effects of the time, but then again that's what made TRON stand out based on its uniqueness in look. It was way ahead with combining live action with computer generated graphics, and in the same fashion, the filmmakers here had done an admirable job prepping this film up for 3D. 3D may be the latest Hollywood fad that got people jumping onto its bandwagon, but just as how computer graphics has to be inherent in the first TRON movie, the updates of the franchise has to keep up with the times, and in true reel mimicking real life, The Grid pops up in more than 2 dimensions, starting with the light cycle wars that include an additional dimension to consider, which makes for some thrilling action, both on or under the ground and in the air, rather than just becoming a mere special effect.But I had to admit my personal hook line and sinker to watch this film, is the soundtrack by Daft Punk. It stands out most definitely throughout the film, and provided additional lift. It's a character in itself without which the film wouldn't be half as exciting or watchable, with rousing themes to stoke your expectations with its pomp.

27,Mr-Fusion,Legacy measures up,8,11 April 2011,"""TRON: Legacy"" doesn't have the trippy vibe of its predecessor (going the heavier action movie route) but it's the powerful father/son story at its heart that leaves an indelible impression (as well as adding some meat to Jeff Bridges' role). Well, that and the lavish presentation. They spared no expense on the effects budget, and even without the 3D gimmick, created an immersive world. Put simply, damn, this movie looks good. Sounds good, too; Daft Punk's score is amazing.That said, this is never more exciting for me than in the first act. The burning question - Where is Kevin Flynn? - looms over every single second. Even after having sen this many times, I still get chills when we step into the forgotten Flynn's Arcade and the lights and sound finally come on. A simple Journey song can really make a scene, and it's a hell of a moment; and that stretch, right up until we see Sam suit up is some of my favorite material in a Disney production.I love this movie.8/10",TRON - Legacy
28,siderite,"Graphically beautiful, average story",8,13 March 2011,"Why must every American movie that has another world as a subject resort to the same story about the evil oppressor that the hunky male must defeat in order to bring freedom and get the girl (and surpass his father)? Does the entire country have an oedipal complex? There is more to life than this, wake up, for crying out loud!The movie has a beautiful design. The only issue I have, graphically, is with the 3D animated character that is representing young Flynn and CLU. It looked so obviously fake that it felt completely out of place. The main character is clueless as to acting any particular emotion, the entire movie is made (pun intended) by Jeff Bridges. He brings to life a high tech version of The Dude that is just impossible to dislike. Olivia Wilde is cute as always, especially in tight mate black clothing that has white stripes shining (a modern hard cut design version of the classic shiny leather costume, I guess).The only thing left here is the sound. It was loud! I was not watching in a theater and it felt loud no matter how low I would place the volume bar. I imagine in a cinema I would have gone with the ear plugs. Other than the volume, though, it was very fitting to the film.Bottom line: enormous quantities of cash went to the marketing and design of the movie, making it a perfect Barbie production. Too bad the story was made up by Ken.",TRON - Legacy

The Visual Effects are spectacular over-here, and so is the 3D experience.'TRON: Legacy' is a film that defies logic. It's an out and out escapist film, where Jeff Bridges is animated to look 30 years younger with el'an. It's a film where people battle and butcher each other through stuff that may never exist.'Tron' has been a favorite, and a Fan like me expected tons and tons of entertainment from it's sequel. The Screenplay isn't tight, plus the pace has no ups or downs. The Visual Effects and the 3D Experience are the actual taste here. The Visual Effects are Spectaucular in each frame. Bravo, indeed! On the whole, Minus the Visual Effects, there is not much to talk about this flawed film. Watch it if you must!",TRON - Legacy

It is just as much of a good story as the first film and the modern special effects are spectacular! TRON: Legacy (2010) has all the excitement of TRON (1982) and is just as much of a thrill-riding adventure.I was glad that they were able to get Jeff Bridges back to play the part of Kevin Flynn/Clu. That fact alone helped to make TRON: Legacy (2010) a good follow-up film. I can't see anyone else playing the role in the second movie. Both TRON (1982) and TRON: Legacy (2010) are great films for people who love video games, computers, superheros and science fiction.9/10",TRON - Legacy

And the visuals and the action sequences are really well done. Now I didn't really like the original ""Tron"" cause almost everything about it seemed a bit outdated. But with the fresh and amazing visuals and cool sequences makes this movie well worth watching it in theaters, even in 3D. Now the premise is actually sort of similar to the first ""Tron"" movie but a lot has been updated greatly. I really did enjoy this movie from beginning to end, with it's decent story and awesome visuals. So it's basically a worthy sequel despite Kevin Flynn's unforgivable mistake for a genius. Anyways most definitely a Disney film that kids and adults will enjoy.

33,Hellmant,The CGI legacy continues!,9,17 December 2010,"'TRON: LEGACY': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Sequel to the 1982 cult classic Disney film 'TRON', one of the original forays into CGI film-making (at least the most expansive at that time). The original film is a huge throwback to my childhood; it was released when I was 6 and it, and even more so the arcade game based on it, had a huge impact on popular culture at that time. The film was initially only moderately successful at the box office (grossing just $33 million on a $17 million budget, domestically) but it quickly grew in popularity. DVD copies of the film are now rare and in strong demand, the cheapest used copy on Amazon is going for $65 and the film is unavailable for rent (At least on Netflix. I got my copy 5 years ago for $15).Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner both reprise their roles from the original film (but no Cindy Morgan to many fans' disappointment). The film was written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz (two veteran writers of 'LOST') along with first time writers Brian Klugman (an experienced actor) and Lee Sternthal. It's directed by first time director Joseph Kosinski , who I've read oddly wasn't a fan of the original film (he's also directing the remake to another Disney sci-fi cult classic of the same era, 'THE BLACK HOLE'). The writer and director of the original film, Steven Lisberger, is a producer of this film as well as makes a cameo appearance.Bridges once again plays genius video game developer Kevin Flynn (with the help of CGI effects to make him look twenty years younger). As the film opens he's now running ENCOM and has a young son named Sam. He's further exploring the inner digital world of the gaming system and telling Sam of all his adventures. Suddenly he goes missing in the year 1989. The movie flashes forward twenty years and now Sam (played by Garrett Hedlund) is the rebellious majority stockholder of his father's company and wants nothing to do with it, except to keep the current greedy CEO's from tarnishing his dad's legacy. One day after his father's partner Alan (Boxleitner) receives a mysterious page, coming from Kevin's old arcade, Sam goes investigating. He finds a hidden room in the arcade and is sucked into the same digital game world his father has been trapped in for twenty years. The world is filled with the same deadly vehicles and gladiator games as that of the first film but this time far more advanced. Sam finds his father and teams up with him, as well as his young friend (played by the stunning Olivia Wilde). The three attempt to defeat the mad computer program controlling the digital world, Clu (also played by Bridges), and return the Flyns to the real world.The film, like the first, is full of revolutionary state of the art visual effects. It's also one of only a handful of films that's been filmed in actual 3D and using more advanced 3D equipment than the granddaddy of all 3D films' 'AVATAR' (although the 3D is not quite as impressive, it's also only used while in the digital world). The story is full of religious analogies and the parable of man playing God but it's the weakest part of the film. It's the action and visual effects that really make the film worthwhile. The acting isn't anything special with the exceptions of the always impressive Bridges (although this is hardly his most impressive work) and Michael Sheen in a scene stealing role. The music by techno band 'Daft Punk' (who also have a cameo in the film) is impressive and is one of the most memorable and fitting movie scores of the year. Kosinski's direction is very promising and extremely impressive for a first film, I don't know where Disney found this guy but he was definitely the right man for the job! The action is exciting and surprisingly violent (how this got away with a PG rating and something like 'SPIDER-MAN' gets slapped with a PG-13 I'll never understand). Like I said the story isn't that impressive or involving and although it does try to tug at the emotions in the father / son tale it's not really that effective but still the movie is a visual action roller coaster ride and in the end none of that other stuff really matters. It's a sci-fi classic in the tradition of it's 80's predecessor and all those like it. I personally think it's an even greater film than the original and I'm willing to bet it will be a far more successful one as well, despite it's $200 million budget.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-mJitUpqE8",TRON - Legacy
34,thesar-2,"Tron 2: Electric Boogaloo. Yeah, I went there.",6,26 December 2010,"I really don't want to start this review of this fine movie, Tron: Legacy, on a bad note, but I gotta get one thing out of the way: I HATED the character of Caster (Michael Sheen)! He was the (extremely) gay version of Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) of The Matrix Reloaded. Every second he was on screen made me squirmand no, it's not because I'm ""homophobic""on the contrary, it's because I think he's giving me a bad name. Sure, it would be okay if Johnny Depp played him, as he's pretty much done countless times, Johnny would know how to make that character interesting.I thoroughly digress: Tron: Legacy was one of the most visually stunning movies I've seen. It would be foolish to compare it to the original, 28 years prior, but the budget on graphics were VERY well spent. Actually, make that, that's all they spent the money on. Well, that, and advertising.I'm not trying to be too harsh. The score was very good, but had little to do with the first. The acting was decent, but it boiled down to the bright spot, Quorra (Wilde) and a clueless – which is VERY rare for Bridges – Kevin Flynn. The rest of the cast was paint-by-numbers, literally.The problem, aside from the flamboyant distraction of Caster, lies in the story, which, by no means was terrible, but that along with the pacing made for a very long movie. It was so slow at times, I almost wanted to ride my own cycle to the next scene. I would've at home – in the form of the fast-forward button.The story of a young Bruce Wayne, er, I mean, Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund in a flat, heartless performance) who inadvertently gets sucked into the same machine his dad did a few decades past. All this time, Sammy was waiting for his Daddy to return and to think he was sloching in some achient arcade video gamewhich happens to be one of favorites as a kid!Anyways, immediately, Sam is sucked up and sent to fight as a neon-gladiator until he uses the skills shown in the first part of the film to escape. He does, in fact, meet up with his dad again and plots their escape.Of course there's a short time frame to leave the ""grid"" or ""Matrix"" to put it cliché terms. Battle, battle, battle and you'll have to pay to see if they escape.And you should pay. No matter what I say or anyone else. This is movie to be seen, if at all, in the theaters. I paid for the IMAX 3D version, but seriously, I don't think you have to go that far. The 3D wasn't great, but then again, we're dealing with Disney who can't get 3D right to save their studios.I recommend on the graphics, scope, score and the character of Quorra alone. Like Avatar – not one of my favorites, if you're gonna see this type of movie, it needs to be viewed on the big screen.",TRON - Legacy
35,cherold,Like the original minus the personality,6,16 November 2012,"I really liked Tron when it came out, it was visually stylish and generally fun. As for this sequel, well, it was visually stylish.The lack of fun can be primarily laid at the feet of the lead, some guy whose name I'm not going to bother looking up. He is so wooden and bland that it feels as though, since the producers were copying so much of the movie, they wanted to prove they were doing something different by casting a stiff.The other performances are better. Jeff Bridges is pretty good, Olivia Wilde does her usual excellent job of playing The Hot Girl, and some guy named, I believe, Michael Shue is a hoot as a club owner, appearing in about 10% of the movie in which he supplies about 80% of the movies personality.Visually, the film copies the neon-piping look that made the original so striking, and it still looks cool. Besides the look, the film cribs a lot of the story, although it eventually wanders off on its own. This turns out to be a mistake; it's not a good script, containing a fairly absurd sci-fi concept plus other nonsensical ideas and featuring an incredibly unsatisfying ending.Some of the action scenes are pretty good, and it's all quite watchable, but if this is the best they could come up with, they should have just given up on making a sequel at all.",TRON - Legacy

It seems many years ago, Kevin invented this video game world and got trapped there. Clu is the alter ego version of Kevin and he oversees the games. The games use motorcycles and frisbees that are used to defeat the opponents. The opponents shatter when hit because they aren't real. Some girl whom was supposed to be special some how rescues Sam and takes him to his real father. From there, Sam devises a plan to escape through a portal.FINAL VERDICT: It was too confusing for me.

After receiving a clue as to his father's whereabouts Sam (Hedlund) heads back into the game his father (Bridges) created to get him out. I was never a big TRON fan growing up and was not looking forward to this one. I re-watched the original a few days ago and I still thought it was OK. This one I liked a lot more. The original was way ahead of it's time and technology finally caught up with the filmmaker's visions and I think this one had the effects they intended. This would have been really cool in 3D, but this is the type of movie Blu-Ray players were made for. Very exciting to look at and is much faster paced then the original. The only problem with the movie in my opinion is that when no action is going in it slows way down. Luckelly there is something going on for about 80% of the movie. Jeff Bridges playing a duel role (with very neat special effects) is fun to watch. Nothing amazing, but still a good way to spend a few hours.

42,tabuno,Doesn't Quite Live Up to Its Potential,7,18 January 2019,"3 October 2011. This sequel to the original 1989 movie is helped along with a good dose of fusion music combining electronic music with more contemporary sounds reminiscent Bourne Identity (2002), Wave Length (1983), Nomads (1986), and even strains, at times, from 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) along with the similar loud, white set designs, even with a lingering tonal hum of its musical themes. The beginning sequences are basic set up, a la Spiderman or Superman but more brief, and there appears to be some editing slight of hand when it comes to the transition from the past to the present with the son's aging that could be confusing to some. Yet in some ways, Tron: The Legacy is able to go where neither Spiderman or Superman could. Spoiler: Perhaps Frequency (2000) and The Bladerunner (1982) might be the closer parallel as a continuing plot scenario. The security of Encom seems a bit artificially suspect considering the high value of their product and the early escape scene also seems disjointed through either a skimpy script or editing problems. There are elements of Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) and Electric Dreams (1984) with the mood and tempo of this movie. Some of the best components of the movie are the electronic music and the Arcade revisited that brings with it nostalgia and a strong emotive beat and the fascinating new look of digital landscape, particularly fireworks. There is also a reminiscent echo of the narrative landscape from Fred Saberhagen's sci fi novel Veils of Azlaroc (1981), on a world of cubist design. On a subjective level, the perception of the balance between the real world and a human recreation of a digitized world inside a electronic universe doesn't seem to quite been achieved in this movie as both the fine line of sharp, clarity of current, contemporary special effects available even today is made more exaggerated with the supposed human, user elements in this movie. The Matrix (1999) design simply ignored this possible distinction between the two, except when like with the Star Trek: The Next Generation opening episode where the holodeck becomes only visible and distinguished from reality when it's fields or walls are interrupted. How such a complex perceptual world might be achieved is likely extremely complex, but it is likely less dramatic than is portrayed in this movie, making it irony even much more fascinating instead. The climatic scenes seem somewhat lame, as more of a contemporary dogfight with special light shows that don't seem consistent with the more creative possibilities of the actual digital universe Spoiler: Even with a scene that either was ripped off from or was taken to another similar scene in the 2011 Green Lantern. The last action scenes also see a rather simplistic resolution along with the apparent underdevelopment and underutilized Tron character. Of note, is the both not too surprising, yet in a way innovative sci fi leap in the use of computer technology in this movie as a basic plot device which forms part of the basis of the main plot tension of the entire movie. Yet the movie theme suffers in part from the underdeveloped notion of the very different nature of analog humans and digitized living programs which provided a wealth of potential and delectable plot points to play and have fun with in which culture, time clashes such as Demolition Man (1993) was so charming in its display of differences Spoiler - which Bladerunner was much more up front in a more natural, detective way, and with much more effectiveness. As such Quorra's character was too underdeveloped and her screen time not sufficient to explode the most fascinating sci fi concept of the movie. The movie descends more towards the simplistic and traditional action adventure clash between good and evil instead of distinguishing itself from other sci fi movies. The ending has the usual ultimate bittersweet battle, but the final scenes at least have a more modest but more effective ending as found with Nomads. Overall, this movie is a decent sequel that doesn't quite live up to its potential.",TRON - Legacy

44,Rodrigo_Amaro,"""I'm an user, I'll improvise"".",9,2 April 2012,"And finally they did it right this time! ""TRON: Legacy"" surprised me a lot, leaving the trauma of seeing the first disappointing episode miles away. It's like comparing the number 8 with 80, very different from each other and it is so good that a sequel might be coming real soon. Call me crazy but this one really deserves all the stars and the possible praise it can get. Light years ahead from the 1982 original film, ""TRON: Legacy"" is all about evolution, on-screen and off-screen. What has changed in the world during the lapse of time both TRON films were made (28 years to be more precise), and why the successful 2010 film is more appealing and more relevant than the previous box-office failure of the 1980's? Back then, ""TRON"" presented a whole new world that very few people had access into, the computer technology, programs and games, all in the early stages of development, just crawling. It was one of the first films to use new technological special effects, very close to what CGI is now (or some might say that it was CGI's first age). It was a film a little ahead of its time, difficult to understand and to make us involved with all those technical terms about computers and all, and audiences weren't interested in that. Even now, it's not much of a good film to watch, in fact, it's incredibly tedious but visually fascinating with those colorful clothes imitating computer chips. It's a cult film to some and I'm probably one of the very few who really didn't care much for it. A few decades later, technology is accessible and known to almost everybody, we don't crawl anymore, we're almost flying, that's how big we evolved with new electronic medias that change each month. With all that in mind is that this sequel, taking characters and the concept of the original film, was far more interesting, relevant and dazzling than the other movie.""Legacy"" is exciting, simplified, dynamic and powerfully efficient. Works perfectly as an sci-fi adventure flick, and also as dramatic piece. Now it's time for Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund), the son of Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) to enter into the world of fierce programs and dangerous games inside of an old Arcade machine to rescue his father, trapped there since 1989. Themes like friendship, loyalty to family, greed are worked amidst programs fights, chases, duels between creator and creature (CLU, also played by Bridges, practically photoshopped to, at the age of 61 looks like he's 31). The coolest aspect of the first episode and that remains here is the style of the programs, the brilliant thematic costumes and the art-direction mixed with the greatest visual effects of the moment. No more of those dated and cheesy effects. And one special mention to the amazing soundtrack composed by Daft Punk (who has a cameo) that really makes the film more enjoyable.Getting wrong with one or two ideas but without making its audience bored or uninterested, ""TRON: Legacy"" is a very good film, the technical aspects of it are incredibly well-made, the story is pretty decent (didn't like the ending though, I was expecting a little bit more from it) and the actors gathered here do a nice job, Bridges, Hedlund, Bruce Boxleitner returning as Alan, Olivia Wilde, James Frain, Michael Sheen and Jeffrey Nordling, all good. Surprises me the fact Disney wanted to invest on a sequel of a film that was a failure to them a long time ago and surprises me once again that they selected a first time director to do the job, but Joseph Kosinski deserves some good credit for it, making a better work than Steve Lisberger (who produced this one) did. It's very rare sequels getting so much improvement, as if a first film were never made. So, I wouldn't mind seeing a third installment for the TRON series. If get this good, I'll watch it right away. 9/10",TRON - Legacy

Now that we got Windows or Apple for all, the web, wireless connections, everything seems to have been invented. Thus my expectations were high for this sequel and as I watched the trailer in Imax, i was terribly unhappy : gone the white, virgin background and worst, there were clouds and rain ! Weather in a computer world is stupid thus I waited patiently its first broadcast on TV.Now, i saw it, without subtitles so the story was rather unintelligible for me (hard of hearing!). In all cases, the plot seems rather ridiculous with a CGI young Bridges not looking very alive and a effeminate bad guy ! As long as the action takes place in the grid, i admit that the production is visually stunning but as soon as they leave for the cloudy mountains (!), it loses its interest. The first Tron was a pit of originality and creativity while with this sequel, i got the feeling to see a best-of the science fiction movie : 2001 for the lair of the old Bridges, STTMP for the dark and blue settings, Star Wars for the aerial fight and father/son relationship. This sequel is not better or worst than the actual Hollywood production : it's only a sequel, filled with CGI and a big hole for story and consequently, the fun.The only very good thing here that keeps the original spirit is the score of Daft Punk : totally in advance of the classic soundtrack, it's a wonderful music, highly speedy and energetic, more than the pictures!",TRON - Legacy

There are no facial muscles and they need to redo the movie with the new technology we have today.The script is not bad, but they didn't execute it very well. I didn't feel like cheering for anyone and I didn't care if they survived or not. I, in fact, wanted to see the mainframe burn down and everyone die.The plot is missing the original storyline.

51,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Masterfully visual, ""Legacy's"" production quality speeds past story weaknesses",7,19 December 2010,"All the pieces have been put in place for 1982 cult classic ""Tron"" to reinvent itself as a moder-day sci-fi epic. Between Disney sinking hundreds of millions into ""Tron: Legacy,"" marketing it like the must-see event of the year and then securing a PG rating to make sure anyone and everyone could see it, the film just had to follow through with results. As a technical marvel and stylistic art project emphasizing light, color, sound and symmetry mixed with all kinds of action, ""Legacy"" shines.Then there's the script, which might be more formidable a foe than the film's antagonist, Clu, a digital (literally) replica of Jeff Bridges from the '80s. Anyway, the script has some familiar/classic story elements that could and should work at the sci-fi level, but don't reach their full cathartic potential. The challenge was to write a movie that would appeal to fans, but mostly modern audiences who need to be caught up on a film concept 28 years old and who also demand some depth to their eye candy these days.Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, who earned their chops writing episodes of ""Lost,"" end up lapsing more and more into explanation and exposition instead of letting character- developing moments blossom. Events also move quickly to get us to the major action sequences. Good thing those are an effective detour from pondering the story.Almost three decades later, the film naturally focuses on not Flynn — owner of massively successful software company Encom — but his 27-year-old son, Sam (Garrett Hedlund), a rebellious young Bruce Wayne type who has forsaken his ownership in Encom for a life of, well, nothing but basically motorcycle riding. Reason is because his father disappeared when he was a kid, which left him orphaned. When Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner), Flynn's old partner, tells Sam he received a page from his father's old office, Sam becomes intrigued as to what happened to his father. He goes to the office at the old arcade and is sucked into the grid, where that replica program of his father, called Clu, has been running a dictatorship of sorts.Hedlund works as a protagonist with his Christian Bale-ish looks and voice (my last reference to anything ""Batman"") and emotional capability, if only we had a chance to watch his character evolve in some way. The story sets up a typical transformative hero's journey, but Sam's only real lesson is to be patient and not reckless. He accepts the world of the grid easily because his father told him about it, which lessens the tension of the film significantly. We like Sam and his take-charge attitude, but there's no empathy, per se, though Hedlund shows promise. Olivia Wilde's Quorra, a program who is a disciple of the actual Flynn who is stuck in exile, was surprisingly well-written with an innocence and cute sense of humor as well as action co-star ability.However, the ""big decision"" climax with these characters that is supposed to move us in some way doesn't tug or conflict us in the end and like a ""check engine"" light, it means something's wrong, even if you can't totally pinpoint what.Also newer to the game in all senses, director Joseph Kosinski demonstrates a heck of an eye. The production design of ""Tron: Legacy"" is unparalleled in terms of cohesion with all the elements working together under a dominant teal/white/orange theme. ""Avatar"" aside, there might not be a more visually entrancing design for a science fiction film. The lighting, the costumes — the lighting on the costumes — all very meticulously calculated, but sleek and fluid in their appeal. Kosinski enjoys stepping back to create some symmetrical tableaux and show off the various shapes of the film. The action sequences are pretty and have a definite pop in 3D. The build up to these action scenes could have been more effective in that ""ooooh, this gonna be cooool"" way, but otherwise he does the film no injustices.Disc Wars and the light cycle scenes don't disappoint either. These modern re-imaginings of the ingenious grid games invented by original ""Tron"" creators Steve Lisberger and Bonnie MacBird are sleek and exciting without losing the explosiveness that a more realistic and PG- 13 or higher action flick would deliver. As ""Legacy"" moves from visual spectacle to the next, despite the quickness, there are times when you feel like you're experiencing an epic, like Sam's visit to the club where Zeus (Michael Sheen) runs things with a white-haired quirkiness, a decisive turning point in the film. Great side characters always help create the feeling of a journey and ""Legacy"" does capture it though fleetingly in this scene, boosted heavily by the score from electronica rockers Daft Punk.But while I could pick apart the issues with the story, ""Tron: Legacy"" is all kinds of cool. The 1982 film didn't do any of these story/character things any better either, so that's not a standard you can hold the film to by any means. ""Tron"" was only fresher because it was unlike anything anyone had ever seen. What makes ""Legacy"" jump out is the vision and the vibe of the film, so unique with an originality that so many action films don't have these days. It's a shame, because with all that going for it, ""Legacy"" should suck in all kinds of new fans and become a sci-fi phenomenon, but it comes up a notch short in the story department. Still, it won't disappoint in terms of visually glorious entertainment.~Steven C",TRON - Legacy
52,gwnightscream,"""Good Sci-Fi Sequel!""",6,13 December 2012,"Jeff Bridges, Garrett Hedlund, Olivia Wilde, Michael Sheen, Beau Garrett and Bruce Boxleitner star in this 2010 sci-fi sequel. This sequel begins 7 years after the events of the first film with video designer turned CEO, Kevin Flynn (Bridges) talking to his young son, Sam. The rest of the film takes place 20 years later after Flynn mysteriously vanishes with his company, EMCO struggling. Sam (Hedlund) is now 27 years old and starts searching for the answers of his father's disappearance at his old arcade. He finds a hidden room where his father's computer is and soon gets transported into a digital world. Sam realizes he's not home anymore and must endure the same fate battling programs as his father did years ago. Bridges also plays Clu, a program Flynn created that turned corrupt, Wilde plays Quorra, Flynn's successful program creation who helps Sam reunite with him, Sheen (Underworld) plays Quorra's old friend, Castro who works for Clu, Garrett (Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer) plays his associate, Gem and Boxleitner also returns as Flynn's friend, Alan Bradley who tries to save EMCO and also plays Tron, briefly. Sam and Flynn try to stop Clu from entering the real world and try to get home with Quorra's help. It's nice to see Bridges and Boxleitner reprise their roles, though I think Boxleitner should've had more screen time. the rest of the cast is also great, the digital effects are excellent and I like how they digitally made Bridges look younger as Clu. I recommend this good sci-fi sequel.",TRON - Legacy
53,GOWBTW,Upgraded for the picking!,9,23 January 2011,"After years of waiting, Disney has made a sequel to the 1983 hit in which Jeff Bridges made the arcades fun for the the kid in us. TRON:Legacy picks up where we left off. Bridges reprises his role as Flynn, a game designer in Califorinia who fought off his boss who stole his work. Now years go by, he is a father has a son name Sam Flynn, he does the same thing his father did back in the 80's. When Sam father disappears, Sam is a little more rebellious, and he breaks into the company who wants to take over his father's business. Sam also gets into the main computer his father entered years earlier, and gets a chance to meet him. Although the person he trusted is now a power-mad turncoat, it's up to father and son to make the save. The vehicles and characters in the movie are amazing. The updated light-cycles, the light planes, and the weapons are top of the line. It's not the 80's, but it can bring back some memories though. TRON:Legacy is one for the history books. 4.5 out of 5 stars!",TRON - Legacy
54,Turfseer,"Dazzling special effects save predictable, battling alter egos storyline",6,29 June 2011,"In its time, the original 'Tron' was considered in the forefront of special effects cinema. Looking back today and comparing the original with 'Tron: Legacy', one is struck by the overwhelming primitive look of the original. I'm sure if the technology was available back in the early 80s, in terms of special effects, 'Tron: Legacy' is the movie that would have been made. It's not only an homage to the original, but a dazzling dreamscape in its own right and the creative effects team should be praised highly for their efforts.That said, without a good story, all the special effects in the world cannot make a decent movie, great. It starts off rather nicely though with the focus on the effect of Kevin Flynn's disappearance on his young son, Sam. The film's scenarists were wise to create an internal arc in which Sam's main motivation is to reunite with his long lost father. We soon discover that Kevin's disappearance in the 80s has affected Sam in a most negative way as an adult. Despite being the controlling shareholder of his Dad's multinational company, ENCOM, Sam spends his time playing a practical jokes on the Board of Directors, such as breaking into company headquarters, hacking into the computer system and briefly posting a new software application on the internet.One notices that the ENCOM break-in scene is much too long as well as the meeting with Alan Bradley, his father's old friend, who informs Sam of a mysterious page (Alan still uses a pager) emanating from the old Flynn arcade which had been shut down for twenty years, Sam discovers his father's laboratory through a hidden passageway inside the arcade and after a few keyboard strokes, Sam is inadvertently transported inside the virtual world of the computer. What's interesting is that this computer world has no interface with today's cyberspace and reflects the computer landscape of the early 1980s.Once Sam is dropped into the virtual world, there are two sensational sequences with Sam battling the minions of CLU, his father's digital clone, who seeks to create a perfect world by subjugating everyone to his will. Sam's first battle involves gladiator-like combat where the combatants throw computer discs at one another and must jump from level to level on a chess-like grid. All the while, a huge crowd is enjoying the carnage. Sam is then brought before CLU, who has the face of the young Jeff Bridges, who appeared in the original Tron. CLU challenges Sam to a life cycle race (on digital motorcycles) and Sam is saved by Quorra, Kevin's assistant, who turns out to be last remaining ISO (Isomorphic Algorithm). The ISOs are sentient beings who somehow are found to contain DNA inside the virtual world. Quorra is played by the lovely Olivia Wilde (who reminds me of a young Kirstie Alley, playing 'Saavik' in the first Star Trek movie).The story slows down a bit when Sam finally reunites over the dinner table with his father who's morphed into a Zen-like Master. There's some dull chatter about each of them having gone to Cal Tech and then a better (and brief flashback) as Kevin explains how CLU wiped out the ISOs. Kevin also explains to Sam about the portal that was opened up when Sam arrived in the virtual world, how that's the only way out and it's going to close real soon. Kevin has this dumb idea that CLU can be defeated by opposing forces within the virtual world but Sam knows better—the only way to defeat CLU is delete the program from the outside and the only way to do that, is get to the portal and get out before it closes.You would think that all-knowing Quorra would then give Sam some good advice on how to get to the portal in the nick of time, but she recommends he look up Zuse, a sleazy David Bowie-like character who ends up betraying Sam, snatching his father's 'disc' (which CLU needs as it works as the master key to the Grid). Of course Dad shows up and saves Sam from CLU's clutches. There's a weak scene after that where Zuse bargains with CLU with no backup, gives up the disc, and is then easily murdered by CLU, when he blows up Zuse's nightclub. Meanwhile, Quorra has one of her arms blown off by CLU's henchmen and fortunately Kevin reprograms her so she can regenerate all her dead tissue.The final climax is a good one where virtual jet fighters are used in a race to the portal. Kevin uses his Zen-like powers to reprogram the original 'Tron' right before he kills Quorra and also uses Zen-like powers to prevent CLU from stopping Sam and Quorra successfully getting through the portal.I'm not sure how Quorra is able to survive outside the virtual world but as stated before, the actor who plays her, Olivia Wilde, is worth the price of admission.While Jeff Bridges does well playing his alter egos, the characters themselves aren't very complex. If you're looking for a story that will massage your brain, you won't find it here. But the special effects are dazzling and are enough to keep you entertained, despite the simplicity of the good versus evil storyline.",TRON - Legacy
55,DarkVulcan29,28 years in the making.,9,20 December 2010,"The most awaited sequel to the film I call the original Matrix. Tron(1982) was very ahead of it's time, with awesome computer graphics.

He escapes with the help from Quarra(Olivia Wilde), he gets reunited with his dad. And they plan to escape to the real world, but will they make it past Clu?It was almost has good as the original. Jeff Bridges was good in both roles. Garrett Hedlund was also good, so was Olivia Wilde. The effects where good the second time around. Believe me it was great the second time around.",TRON - Legacy
56,freemantle_uk,Was the wait worth it?,7,24 December 2011,"Back in 1982 Disney started to enter into the world of making sci-fi films, starting with a little film called TRON. Despite TRON only being a moderate success over the years it became a Cult Classic and ended up having generations of fans. But it still took the House of Mouse to make a long awaited sequel.Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) the CEO of has been missing for 20 years, leaving only his young Sam (Garrett Hedlund). Sam shows little interest in ENCOM, the company he ran and simple looks for thrill seeking. He is a little like Bruce Wayne. After Sam performs his yearly prank on ENCOM, his father's friend Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) tells Sam he has received a message from Kevin. When Sam investigates Kevin's old arcade he ends up teleported into the Grid. Kevin's creation, CLU (also Bridges) has taken over the Grid and plans to escape into the real world. But luckily Sam's dad and his companion Quorra (Olivia Wilde) are there to help. Sam and Kevin have to escape the Grid before CLU does.TRON Legacy is obviously a special effects films and the director Joseph Kosinski certainly brought this to live. Kosinski and his team basically expand on what the original created, showing what could be done with modern special effects. There were added features to the Grid, from storm clouds in the distance to new inventions like the gliders. The action is really well done, whether it was the disc fights, the light cycle battles or an aerial dog fight. Kosinski did use slow motion little to much but I think his logic behind it is show the detail of something like the light cycle being formed. The fights were well done through, like the fight in the bar.Acting for the most part is decent, Hedlund shows promise as a leading man. Whilst he is a pretty boy he has the action chops and can deliver his lines well enough. I have to praise Jeff Bridges' plastic surgeon for making him look young. But serious it is impressive that special effects can make an actor look young again and he does well playing the duel, as Kevin he is an aged hippy, a shell of the man he use to be as he takes a policy of non-intervention. He is almost like an older, jarred version of the Dude in the cyber world. As CLU he is more of a ruthless villain, a creation with a God complex wanting perfection. But near the end he becomes more of a clichéd villain wanting power and giving a grand speech to his army. I do not think much of Wilde as an actress but she is alright here when she is in a action scene. But for me the real winner was Michael Sheen being so over the top pantomime as a club owner/rouge programme. Sheen is a talented actor but sometimes if he is not reigned in he can chew up the scenery.Whilst TRON Legacy delivers on the action and special effects front plot wises it is a bit basic and I think that is a shame because there was potential for more. The real goal for Sam is try and escape the grid and I personally think the film could have used a more tort script, tightening up some of the scenes and give the film a running time of one hour 40 minutes. Themes that could have been explored was a religious idea that Kevin Flynn and CLU are the Gods of this world, and they relationship could be like CLU being Satan who was actually able to overthrow God. The whole idea of they being two creators could have played on the culture and political situation of the Grid, two factions and ideas being formed around Flynn and CLU. Other ideas could have been looking more at the idea of CLU wanting to make a perfect world and perfection meaning killing anything that does not match it. Or how absolute powers corrupts CLU or a programme taking over duties it should not have, like Skynet in the Terminator Series. It is hard not to compare TRON Legacy to similar themed films like The Matrix and Inception, but it is more an issue of coincidence then anything else. I would have liked to see more of the city being developed and the world expanding but that's just me.Daft Punk did the soundtrack for TRON Legacy and yeah, it was a really good soundtrack. Some of it sounded like Inception with the use of horns, but again I think this was a coincidence. It is a really good dance soundtrack when it becomes a more techno based album.TRON Legacy is an enjoyable film, with lots of solid action but it should have been more shorter and stayed simple or expanded on some of the ideas it introduced. We will have to wait and see if there is a sequel.",TRON - Legacy
57,MBunge,More proof you can wait too long to do a sequel,6,20 December 2010,"Tron: Legacy definitely joins Superman Returns as an example of how there really is a statute of limitations on sequels. The longer you wait to make one, the more the world has changed and the more dated technologically, culturally or structurally the first film has become. When a long delayed sequel is faithful to the original, it's usually out of step with the present. If it's adapted to the world today, the less it makes sense as a sequel. And much like Superman Returns, Tron: Legacy is reasonably entertainingbut it has this weird atavistic quality to it that all the CGI effects in the world can't cover up.Back in the 1980s, Disney came out with Tron, a then-groundbreaking film about a free-thinking computer whiz named Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges)who gets sucked into a 1980s concept of cyberspace filled with vast digital vistas and anthropomorphic computer programs. Allied with a heroic program named Tron (Bruce Boxleitner), Flynn defeats the evil Master Control Program and returns to the real world.Tron: Legacy picks up the story in 2010 with Kevin Flynn disappeared in 1989 and his son Sam (Garrett Hedlund) grown up into a rebel without a cause. As you may have surmised, Sam gets himself sucked inside the computer world where he has to seek out his father and face off against another evil program. That's pretty much the whole plot, though there's some stuff thrown in about artificial intelligences that sprung out of nowhere tossed in amidst all the running and fighting and light-cycle driving.Tron: Legacy looks great. I saw it in 2D version and was impressed. I can only imagine the 3D version is even more striking. The action scenes are also pretty exciting and, more importantly, you can actually tell what the frick is going on. Spastic camera movement and herky jerky editing renders too many modern action scenes into little more than frantic blurs. Here, your eyes can follow the flow of activity so you can see who is doing what to whom and even understand why they're doing it. In between the punching and the jumping and the chasing, the story can get a bit slow and there's an oddly thorough solemnity to it all. However, things unfold in a fairly logical fashion and you're never left wondering ""What the hell was that all about?"", aside from an ending where I never quite understood precisely what the big threat was supposed to be.This isn't the sort of movie where a whole lot of great acting goes on, though the performances are all good enough. Olivia Wilde is certainly the highlight of the cast, not just because she's very sexy but also because she brings a playful energy to her role as Quorra, an enigmatic program that fights alongside the Flynns. Jeff Bridges is also nice, playing Kevin Flynn as a hippie in winter. Garrett Hedlund is perfectly acceptable as Sam, though he does get out acted by a computer generated young Jeff Bridges.The overarching problem with Tron: Legacy is that for all the ungodly sums of money spent to produce it, this movie presents us with a 1980s concept of cyberspace. None of the stuff we've learned and experienced about computers and the internet in the following decades are reflected at all in this film. Intentionally or not, it's badly out of sync with our reality of social networks, online gaming and aps for your iPhone. It's also much closer visually to 2001: A Space Odyssey, a flick from the 1970s, than anything you'll see on a computer screen in the 21st century. Jarring as well is that the computer generated young Jeff Bridges is noticeably less lifelike than the aliens of Avatar, though I don't know if that's the fault of technology or simply that people notice unrealistic humans more than unrealistic aliens.Tron: Legacy is a decent piece of entertainment, especially by the low standards of Hollywood blockbusters. If you can get past the feeling of watching something that came out of a time capsule, you'll probably like it.",TRON - Legacy
58,estebangonzalez10,Tron: wasn't worth all the hype,5,26 December 2010,"¨I was paged last night; came from your dad's office at the arcade. That number's been disconnected for twenty years! ¨The hype for Tron: Legacy has finally come to an end after several months of being bombarded with the cool trailers and all I can say is that I was a bit disappointed with this film. The first 40 minutes were great, the visuals, the light cycle races, and the disc gladiator games were breathtaking, but after the novelty of being introduced into the digital world the movie began to drag due to a weak script and plot. The movie runs a little over two hours and after the first 40 minutes it begins to go downhill until it reaches a pretty anticlimactic ending because we never really got to care too much for the characters or the story because the focus seemed to always be on the visuals which got old after a while. Tron made for a very exciting trailer and perhaps could have been one of the greatest music video videos thanks to some cool soundtracks from Daft Punk, but as a movie the pieces didn't seem to fit together. The first forty minutes are really worth your time however and many might enjoy this film, but I was just a little disappointed because I had some high expectations for Tron: Legacy which marked the directorial debut for Joseph Kosinski. The weakest link for Tron has to be the screenplay written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz (both happened to collaborate together as producers and writers for Lost).Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner are back playing their duo roles from 1982's original Tron. Bridges is Kevin Flynn, the CEO of Encom and a virtual world designer who is trying to create a better world. He has found a way into a digital universe and in his intention of creating a perfect world which he calls The Grid he also creates an alter self known as Cleo (played by Bridges as well) that will help him program The Grid while he is back with his son Sam (Garrett Hedlund) in the real world. Boxleitner is back as Alan Bradley, Flynn's main security chief in both worlds (in The Grid he is Tron). One night Kevin is telling Sam about how he is going to change the world, but after leaving for his office he is never seen again, until about 27 years later when Sam manages to find a way to get in The Grid and discovers that Cleo has betrayed his father and left him trapped inside the digital world. In The Grid Sam will have to search for his father and find a way to get him back to the real world. Here we meet some interesting characters such as Quorra (Olivia Wilde), Gem (Beau Garrett), Jarvis (James Frain), and Castor (Michael Sheen).Tron: Legacy could have been much better considering that the producers had 28 years to come up with a decent script for the sequel of the original cult movie. The visuals were great, but they got tiresome after the novelty of the digital world wore off. The performances were OK, Jeff Bridges will probably not be remembered for his role in this movie as much as he is being considered for his work in True Grit (he also comes fresh from an Oscar win for his performance in Crazy Heart). Garrett Hedlund gave a good performance as the lead role and proved he can be a star player as well. Olivia Wilde was also good as a supporting character, but who really stole his scenes was Michael Sheen as Castor. His performance was a little out there, but he made it work because he is just such a talented actor. Overall I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you are a fan of the first film or are really into the visual and special effects. The story falls short for me and the visuals alone weren't enough to save this movie. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",TRON - Legacy

Much is made of the stunning visuals and amazing score--which work together in such perfect harmony that they're almost one single entity--but every time I revisit it I gain a new appreciation for the story, the characters and the little moments, such as Sam returning to the arcade and Journey's ""Separate Ways"" coming on when he kicks on the power. I still get goose bumps on that one. It does drag a touch in the second act, the digital Zen stuff is laid on a bit thick at times, I would've liked more Alan/Tron and where are Lora and Yori (I know they used Cindy Morgan in the viral campaign stuff)?

I actually formed a connection with the characters in this one, which is the complete opposite to the original. The special effects (bar the de-aging) are a vast improvement, which is to be expected in fairness; I love the look of this.It's nice to get a proper view into the 'outside' lives of the protagonists, rather than receiving a tiny backstory before shoving them into the new universe; I appreciated the build-up to the eventual entry. The score is also terrific, even if it's strange hearing Daft Punk's ""Outlands"" due to my familiarity of it coming from Sky Sports UK's Formula 1 opening credits.Garrett Hedlund is great in the role Sam, I enjoyed his performance from the get-go. Jeff Bridges is excellent too, I feel all the actors in general were given much more to work with in this one; I barely took notice of Bridges (& Co.) in the predecessor, but he stands out big here. Olivia Wilde and Michael Sheen are good, also. Cillian Murphy even makes a minute appearance.It does, at least to me, feel like a very different film when compared to 'Tron', which may disappoint lovers of the latter but will be relief to opposing folk; e.g. me.Wasn't sure what to expect from this, but thankfully it produces an entertaining time.",TRON - Legacy

Truthfully I only started watching this because I'd heard so much about the CGI job they did on Jeff Bridges (which alone is worth checking this out for) Pretty crazy seeing him as he looked back in 1989. This isn't really my kind of movie though and I struggled through all the computer game Frisbee fights and gladiatorial motorcycle races in this high tech adventure.Honestly there's not much of a story here, its more of a special effects extravaganza following Sam Flynn, the tech-savvy son of virtual world designer Kevin Flynn. Sam goes looking for his father and ends up getting sucked into the virtual world his father created and where he's been trapped for the past 25 years.It must have been crazy for the actors working exclusively with green screens because except for a few real-world sections (shot on Vancouver streets), its all virtual.

62,3xHCCH,"Excellent Light and Sound Show, But May Otherwise Be Disappointing",6,23 December 2010,"There is something so odd about this movie. For a movie that is supposedly futuristic, ""Tron: Leagcy"" actually felt dated to me. Those feel of the scenes in the beginning of the film really felt as though this whole film was done in the 1980s. The whole production even within The Grid really felt like it was the 80s again, with its minimalist bluish-white vs. orange-yellow color scheme. I had a difficult time following the dialog many times. The pronunciations seemed slurred. The director may have assumed too much that the audience have seen the original 1980s film to be familiar with the storyline. Sometimes the scene continuity was confusing too. The actor playing the young and the adult Sam do not look alike. Also unfortunately, Tron himself is of a nature too nebulous for a title character, especially to the uninitiated.Now for the plus side: As a light and sound show though, Tron Legacy excels. This movie is an audio-visual feast. The battles with the discs were exciting, along with the disintegrating Programs as they were ""mortally"" hit. The morphing into motorcycles or jets of light were very well-executed and beautiful to see. Jeff Bridges the actor was, of course, proficient in his dual role as Kevin Flynn and Clu. The CG that creates a very young-looking Jeff Bridges was a realistic illusion. The new actors playing the leads, Garrett Hedlund (as Sam) and Olivia Wilde (as Quorra) did creditably well. Bruce Boxleitner looked nothing like how he looked in ""Scarecrow and Mrs. King"" back in his heyday.Tron Legacy is quite a spectacle to watch, yes. But do not expect a story that will make you think too much. Just ride along with the neon lights and have a good time.",TRON - Legacy
63,ptb-8,almost a NEW-TRON bomb,5,2 January 2011,"Equal parts amazing and equal parts tedious/muddled/unfathomable, this NEW TRON is a real slog to get through. In all fairness, I do admire the art direction and set design albeit poached from the last scenes of 2001, and some of STAR WARS (incl an ""I am your father' scene on a girder) some THX 1138 and some of BLADE RUNNER, but mostly I became deflated at the completely incomprehensible storytelling. For about an hour in the middle I had no idea what was happening and why. This really annoyed me as I was so keen to admire TRON LEGACY but constantly had to battle to follow and see what what was happening. Also it should never have been a 3D movie...it is simply too dark. This movie is completely in black tones with neon stripes and as a result disappears up it's own streaky black hole. Jeff bridges was good if not just wandering through it, Garret Hedlund was actually terrific and the 'acting' overall just OK...given the subject matter. Yes it is a computer film and yes it has some spectacular moments and I wish I could praise it more. It is a noble failure with some gigantic dark spectacle but at 127 minutes and in dim-D it became an effort to try and enjoy. The soundtrack however is sensational. Daft Punk was a perfect choice. The fake Jeff Bridges was well done... the glass furniture in the 2001 sequence was great...so much to like blocked by so much neon clutter. The final few scenes outside are really stupid and does not make any sense..how did she get there?",TRON - Legacy
64,Enchorde,Gave me a real good feeling...,7,20 January 2011,"A movie with a really good feeling about it. Lives strongly on some spectacular effects, an effective play with lights and colors, and with Daft Punk composing, an impressive soundtrack. This is a movie to just sit back and enjoy. It's hard to do a sequel so long after the first movie, but I think they do well connecting to the original, and building a bond with it, even though I haven't seen it.It does have some faulty logic, plot holes or some parts that would have needed further explaining, to say the least. Some parts that stop you dead in the tracks, and yanks you out of the good feeling the rest of the story has built up.Fortunately the story has some good supporting characters in it that quickly restores that good feel about it. Quorra is one of them, but my mind goes mostly to Castor/Zuse.Wonder if they will do a third one. They probably shouldn't, it would be a high risk project, but I wouldn't mind if they tried. Just bring back Daft Punk.",TRON - Legacy
65,ShootingShark,"Somewhat Loopy But Exciting, Visually Dazzling, Twenty-Eight Years Later Sequel To Computer Universe Cult Classic",7,3 January 2011,"Sam Flynn is the son of Kevin Flynn, a digital entrepreneur who vanished mysteriously years ago. Whilst searching for clues at his father's old video arcade, Sam finds a hidden underground lab and is transported to a computer world he never dreamed existed This terrific, eye-popping, action-packed sequel to 1982's Tron is a visual feast of wild design, crazy colours and even crazier characters. It's very faithful to the original but also develops the concept of the grid to the next level; instead of the religious subtext, there is a digital to real world invasion planned and the program characters are much more alive, emotive, sensual. Bridges has terrific fun playing both the old hero and the young villain; he retains his hippy-kid goofiness from the original but adds weariness, zen karma, and some crazy mumbo-jumbo only he could sell. He's great in both parts, but I particularly like him against type as Clu - the scene where Sam first meets him and mistakes him for something he's not is pretty chilling. Boxleitner is also good, reprising his (human) role from the original, and Wilde is great fun as heroine Quorra, with a kooky black bob - she doesn't go for the obvious vampy performance but makes her part more vulnerable and sympathetic. Sheen is enjoyably over-the-top, doing a sort of crazed Ziggy Stardust, and so it's up to Hedlund to gamely plough through all these manic co-stars and try to keep the story grounded, which he does commendably. The story has a few flaws I think - it sets up well but then perhaps segues too quickly into the other world (a bravura sequence in the original). It doesn't really reconcile Clu's perfectionism with his power lust, and it doesn't explain how Quorra will change our world, so the ending is a bit of a letdown. As a straight action story though it works great, with incredible chases, philosophical pauses, funny moments and a cool atmosphere throughout, aided by a great electronic score from French musical duo Daft Punk - the music thumps away at all the key moments but is also designed to blend with the visuals, creating that other-worldly sense which makes the Tron universe such a fun place to visit. A word on 3D - basically, I don't like it. This movie was only available in 3D at my local theatre, and whilst the circularly polarised filtering process is a little more sophisticated than the old stereoscopic style from the 50's/80's, it still has the same problem - the backgrounds of shots look flat and out of focus. Compare it with any movie that makes use of deep focus or diopters (as with most innovations in cinema, start with Citizen Kane and work from there). In animation, or effects-laden films this doesn't detract too much, but in, for example, a two-character shot with an appealing natural background, it literally falls flat. A word on sequels - I think, as a straight continuation of the story, featuring the same character played by the same actor twenty-eight years later, this movie wins the crown for biggest gap between sequels. This is debatable and there are other contenders (Return To Oz, The Color Of Money), but for me it's pretty amazing to go and see a movie as a middle-aged man which is a sequel to a movie I saw when I was hitting puberty. It's a lot of fun too.",TRON - Legacy

67,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,TRON: Legacy (2010),6,14 December 2011,"TRON is back. Well, not exactly. TRON is on screen for a few minutes at the most, and even then his face is covered. Why spend all that money on de-aging Bridges and not Boxleitner. He deserved so much more. Anyway, moving on. TRON Legacy is a decent enough sequel. As decent as we could have expected. It's been 28 years since TRON and the majority of the audience aren't going to care about that. It wasn't even a huge film at the time. TRON Legacy can't afford to be just a sequel, so it's a remake and a reboot as well. Lots of set-up and annoying dialogue is shoved in between the action scenes. The original TRON was way before its time, this comes years after. These days, most of the audience will know more about computers than some of the characters. The costume design is fantastic, but not as otherworldly as the original. The effects were good, but not very impressive. The world of The Grid was always fairly simple. Beau Garrett looks extra yummy and it's her and Michael Sheen's roles that made the film for me. Just as the film was getting dull, Sheen arrives and has more fun than anyone in the audience. Good for him. The film starts bogging itself down in religious hokum towards the end. With the whole father, son, sacrifice, resurrection stuff coming into play and being spelled out. The best thing about this film is the soundtrack, mostly the original score by Daft Punk. I was thinking for the most part that I couldn't wait to buy it and listen to it. I'd welcome another TRON movie, but they don't need to try so hard to create a franchise. Just have fun with it.",TRON - Legacy

69,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,It's building on....,8,19 May 2013,"In 1982, the mouse house released a film that I think not many at the time would have thought been possible. Tron (1982) was not only visually intriguing but also opened up the doors to new possibilities in film, involving computer generated images (CGI). Because of this, not only did it gain traction in becoming a cult classic but it also had a strong fan base that began to grow and demand that a sequel be made. I liked Tron, its visuals were great, it had a fair origins story and likable characters. However, I did not understand some of the characterizations, which led me to believe the writing was uneven. But I also did not mind if a sequel was to be made. So when fans found out the second Tron film would be hitting theaters in 2010, people were excited and why blame them.This long awaited installment continues the story of the Flynn family but this time focuses on the son of Kevin Flynn. As I've stated in other reviews, stories the involve ""passing the torch"" to the next generation is risky. Everything must be picked out correctly so that no one from the original will be upset with various contents being left out or being changed. And for the most part, the continuity is fairly strong. I'm not saying it's totally there though. I will get to this at the end.But, throughout the movie, fans will get their fill of references that owe tribute to the first film. The director, Joseph Kosinski, even hints at another favorite Disney film of his own experience - The Black Hole (1979). Another thing that stood out was how Kosinski was able to revamp the whole world of Tron. Not only is everything slicker, but this universe in general now contains weather too. The entire direction is fascinating and that's just one part of the film. Wait till you see the vehicles. My favorite was the Recognizer. Originally in the first movie, they were big and bulky. Here they are just massive, almost terrifying.As for characters go, it was great to see Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner back in their main roles. It's almost like they never left the set. Garrett Hedlund as the son of Kevin Flynn was not a bad choice either. Perhaps his acting could be improved a little; he did show emotion every now and then but for the most part he plays stone face. Making things more questionable was that the son of the villain (Edward Dillinger) from the first movie had a brief role as well. Will there be a use for him later? We will see. Introducing Quorra (Olivia Wilde), was a nice touch because it gets very interesting as the movie ends. Not to mention, that she plays a strong female lead. Even the director of the first Tron (1982), Steven Lisberger, has a very, very, quick cameo which was fun to see. Another impressive aspect was the digital rendering of a younger Jeff Bridges as C.L.U. I'm pretty sure that wasn't the easiest thing to accomplish. Lastly, the character that I found the most mysterious was Rinzler. The character of Rinzler reminded me of Ray Park because of his acrobatic skills and flexibility. Funny thing is, it wasn't Park. The man behind the mask was Anis Cheurfa. Good job Cheurfa, you could have fooled me if they didn't credit you!The last thing I found great about this sequel was Daft Punk's score to this film. It is certainly not like their usual electro-pop tunes but they did a great job at bringing out emotion when it was needed, tightening high tension scenes and making a reoccurring theme for the franchise. This also leads me to believe that any band, no matter what genre they place themselves in, can make a film score. Although maybe not as well received, Mastodon did the same for Jonah Hex (2010), which I enjoyed as well. This should become a trend because so far, it has worked well.The couple of things I did want to point out that I don't think worked like they should, were the continuity and the story itself. The writers of this picture seem to leave various parts of the story left unresolved. For example, it was never explained to where Cindy Morgan's role went from the first movie, or for that matter, Barnard Hughes. Would it hurt for the writers to add a small explanation to why they weren't in the picture? Come on guys. And as for the story in general; yes it does work. But by the end, it feels like an entire set up for the third Tron film. Instead, there could have been some type of subplot that could give audiences something to look for and not just sit through 120 minutes for all the pieces to finally fall into order. That's just me though.Tron: Legacy is well crafted with a good cast, mind boggling eye candy and an energetic score provided by Daft Punk. Now if only those screenwriters could match that kind of quality.",TRON - Legacy
70,eric262003,Darker Than the Original,7,16 July 2012,"To be honest with you, I didn't think ""TRON: Legacy"" was going to meet the expectations of its predecessor from 1982. I guess my low expectations stem from sequels in the past from other movies that just couldn't measure up. But there was something eye-catching that totally caught my attention. was that ""TRON: Legacy"" usurps the original ""TRON"" bring more grittier more darker and the special effects have doubled from the original. The story hasn't changed much from the original, but it was still exhilarating nonetheless and after the movie was over it is fair to say that I actually enjoyed this TRON sequel.The opening scenes begin in 1989 as we see a financially upgraded Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) has become the head of a leading computer programming enterprise Encom as he reminisces to his son Sam about his exciting journey into the digital and he being the inventor of the program TRON. Sam with great fondness listen in on every word he says. Kevin even promised him that one day he'll take him to this wondrous enterprise. Two decades later, Sam (Garrett Hedlund) enters the portal that his father entered to find his long-absent father, but the very foundation that Kevin created in serious jeopardy. All of this transpires in the span of twenty minutes which in all its colours and flamboyancy seems a bit too long for an introduction. The film's premise is more serious than its predecessor and is able to lure in more mundane subplots. But the shortcomings can easily be forgiven by the stunning visuals that will make your heart palpitate. It is a pure eye-candy film. It's is dark and uplifting and the CGI is not for the light-show but as prop to compliment the simplistic plot which you do see very much in the theaters. To fans of the original TRON don't be alarmed, the imagery has been upgraded and looks better than it ever was. The coolest scene was the light-cycle battle which was very identical to the chase scene of the original, the only difference is the the grid is multi-layered and it adds more effect than what the original had to offer.It is undeniably the visual effects goes right through the roof. The dark a dismal environment is cool and brooding, it also disturbingly subtle and restraining in spite of the war that's manifesting within the very foundation of Kevin Flynn's creation. While the original was dazzling, eccentric and flamboyant, this sequel is the polar opposite. It's something that exceeds like no other. Sure the plot structure is narrow but it's the visuals that virtually tell the story. It's probably something only one can dream of. It really keeps you enthralled the whole two hours through.If there was a weakness to this story would probably be the length. For being a bit over two hours long, it just doesn't seem right for a quick-paced high-energy film like this. It could've been a half an hour shorter. Sure it was no high-octave masterpiece And I was having doubts feeling that I'll be cheated by the ending which would be an obvious opening for a TRON 3, which will likely happen this year. If the film would have more provocative moments it would've been an excellent sci-fi adventure instead of a great sci-fi adventure.",TRON - Legacy
71,pc95,"Great Visuals but Awkward Dialog, Unfocused Story and Luke Warm Acting",6,29 December 2010,"Let me preface this review by stating that I grew up on the original ""Tron"" and will always enjoy that movie for it's daring visuals and simplistic yet focused story and strong score. With that in mind, the filmmakers probably could've left this project alone, but I applaud them for the effort. This new story needed more focus, and the dialog, outside of Bridges father character, was mostly poor. While Jeff Bridges brought the original movie together, his supporting cast in '82 provided a great adversarial villain and acting from David Warner along with the same with strong camaraderie and friends, played by Cindy Moran and Bruce Boxleitner. With that said, I really wanted ""Tron Legacy"" to come forth with the same types of strengths for this sequel. The set design and recreation of the ""Digital World"" are stunning, but can't alone make up for it's problems - childish, underdeveloped, and often awkward dialog, and a weakly underwritten and poorly acted main role for the character of Sam Flynn played by Garrett Hedlund, There is a general lack of original new ideas. The introductory 20 min of the movie are glossed over badly and Boxlietner here is more or less an afterthought and bit-part in the movie when he should not be. Why not employ some of the other video game concepts from the arcade for new visuals instead of rehashing? Or create a new villain rather than CLU? The storyline felt jumbled with Bridges' 2 characters receiving major development in the limelight/grand fashion with everyone else underwritten. Anyway, I'll leave it as a mild disappointment. Some of the other good points were Daft Punk score, finale scenes, and spirited support from actress Olivia Wilde despite her flat moronic dialog. Some refinement, focus, and much better developed dialog were sorely needed as well as more humor. End of Line.",TRON - Legacy
72,lewiskendell,"A gorgeous, yet flawed, movie.",8,31 December 2010,"""Behold, the son of our maker!""I liked Tron: Legacy. A lot. The things it does well, it does very well. But unfortunately, it's held back by the one thing it doesn't do well at all. Let's get the negative out of the way, first. The story was pretty terrible. It strained so hard to be epic, grandiose, and important, but instead, it just came off a product of too many writers with too many ideas and no one to reign them in. Sam Flynn, son of Kevin Flynn from the original movie, finds himself inside the computer world where his father has been trapped the past twenty-odd years, and must help him in his struggle against an old ally that has now become an enemy. The initial premise is fine, but trust me, it all goes downhill from there. Fast. It's a terrible thing when an otherwise excellent movie suffers every time the pace slows and the focus shifts to the narrative, but that's exactly what happened with Tron: Legacy. There are individual story pieces that are fine, but the plot as a whole just fails to satisfy. Now that I've finished addressing my only real complaint, I can gush. The visuals of Tron: Legacy are astounding. Every individual frame of the movie (once we're inside the computer world) could be used as a poster or wallpaper for your computer. The characters, costumes, backgrounds, and special effects never fail to impress. I'm not much of a 3D guy, but to me, this movie is an even better example than Avatar of how that added dimension can be used to augment a movie in a meaningful way. You just won't be getting the full experience of Tron: Legacy, unless you watch it in a theater In 3D and with a great sound system (the soundtrack is great, too). The 3D element really makes an impact during the frequent action scenes, which start out great and seem to get more and more impressive as the movie goes on. Seriously, see this in 3D if you can. It's easily one of the most aesthetically interesting  and beautiful movies that I've ever seen. Legacy was just a whole lot of fun, despite the liability that the story ended up being. The actors were fine, with Garret Hedlund being a likable (if a bit bland) hero. Jeff Bridges seemingly enjoyed returning to his old role, and Olivia Wilde convinced me that she's a gorgeous action star in the making. The terrible story doesn't ruin Tron, but it does add a sour taste to a movie that's otherwise pure, delicious candy for your senses.",TRON - Legacy

It's not that it was a bad movie. It just wasn't a very good one. TL is meant to be a chase film but there's very little that is exciting about it due to the meandering pace and mediocre execution. Even the climax felt a bit slow compared to most action films these days. The last noticeable flaw of the film is that the simple plot was made unnecessarily convoluted for no reason at all. It all seemed very bloated.Obviously, the special effects are extraordinary, but I will admit it gets dull after awhile since the film overstays its welcome. The 3D worked well, but I'll be lying to myself if I didn't say I've seen better in other films. However, the action scenes were very unique and exciting to watch. I liked the performances, mostly by Jeff Bridges and rising star Olivia Wilde. However, I was annoyed by Michael Sheen who gives a really over-the-top performance. The best thing from the film is the soundtrack by Daft Punk. As much as I loath techno-style music, TL has one of the best soundtracks of the year. It's truly amazing.Overall, a big ""meh"" from me.

75,moviexclusive,"Boasting some of the most dazzlingly stunning visuals you'll see this year, this sequel reinvents the Tron universe for an immersive and impressive spectacle",7,13 December 2010,"It's been a 28-year wait for fans of the sci-fi fantasy ""Tron"", the 1982 original a costly flop when it was first released which eventually amassed a cult following for its gamer sensibility and breakthrough visual effects. That following was enough for Disney to decide to invest US$170m into this sequel, an aesthetically startling piece of sleek, shimmering entertainment that more than lives up to the legacy of its predecessor. From the opening digital Disney logo, ""Tron: Legacy"" astounds with its dazzling visuals courtesy of first-time director Joseph Kosinski and his art direction team (led by Kevin Ishioka, who also worked on last year's Avatar). Kosinski and his team have taken the basic design templates of Steven Lisberger's original and applied the latest advances in CGI technology to create a totally immersive experience that stays true to the look and feel of its predecessor while expanding it in scope and imagination. The modern-day Tron universe is a stormy, blacklit landscape with towering skyscrapers and crystal highways drawn in electroluminescence. It is a world populated by programmes (basically, digital denizens of Tron) dressed in skintight glowing suits and carrying light discs as their power source cum data bank, a world traversed by the use of motorcycles that streak mesmerising liquid-like ribbons of light. Every frame of this CG environment is fascinating, and in geek-speak, beyond cool. Complementing the gorgeous visuals is the pulsating electronic score by dance-music duo Daft Punk, pumping unique verve and life into the action and emotion in the film. The duo also make an appearance as the house DJs in the one-and-only futuristic nightclub sequence in the movie, led by Michael Sheen's OTT Bowie-esquire owner Zuse. Indeed, it's hard to overstate the visceral experience that Kosinski has detailed in his contemporary vision of Tron, right down from the stunning images to the virtuoso soundtrack. The perfect example of this fusion lies in the film's many exhilarating action sequences, and there are many, beginning with Sam Flynn's initiation into the Tron universe. That introduction consists of a gladiatorial fight where Sam has to battle first with glowing Frisbees and then atop the aerodynamic light-cycles, both of which also pay homage to perhaps the most memorable elements of the original. The distinct colour schemes (orange and red for the programmes; blue and white for the users or outsiders) add to the visually breathtaking nature of these sequences, choreographed by the same people behind 300 and Ninja Assassin. The film aspires to be a virtual thrill ride, and it fulfils that ambition brilliantly. While ""Tron: Legacy"" rests comfortably on the laurels of the technical achievements of its predecessor, it sits less easy on its predecessor's failings. One of the fairly levelled criticisms of the original ""Tron"" was the lack of a story; here, no less than three credited screenwriters have tried to compensate it with an overly convoluted story. The father/son reunion narrative between Kevin and Sam plays out nicely enough, but the middle act of the film gets too bogged down by tech mambo-jambo that will likely fly over the heads of most viewers. That exposition really isn't necessary, since the result of it is a standard world-domination plot in the final act spearheaded by Kevin's nefarious 'programme' alter-ego Cru. Characters too are just as underwhelming as the original. Our hero Sam is sketched too thinly as the son looking for a long-lost father; and his romance with 'programme' warrior-chick Querra (Olivia Wilde) is given scant thought. But more baffling is the film's reduction of game designer Kevin Flynn to Zen-master spouting incongruous surfer-dude exclamations like 'radical, man!' and other equally clunky bits of dialogue throughout the film. If these characters manage to resonate more than that of the original, that's because of the excellent father-son chemistry between Jeff Bridges and Garrett Hedlund. The duo emulate genuine warmth aside each other, overcoming the script's shortcomings to make their characters and the plot more convincing than the sum of the clichéd lines and middling plot of the film. Of course, these inadequacies shouldn't come across as a surprise to fans of the original. Indeed, for better and for worse, ""Tron: Legacy"" is an appropriate sequel to the 1982 film. Like that cult classic, it also boasts superb visuals which, combined with a modern-day dance score and groundbreaking special effects, create an instantly mesmerising experience for its viewers- despite similarly simplistic plot and character development. Still, this is a wholly befitting sequel to the legacy of ""Tron"", and will likely add a whole new legion of fans to its following.",TRON - Legacy
76,denis888,Vapid Sequel Not Worthy Of The Name It Bears,1,20 July 2014,"Make o mistake - the original 1982 Tron is one of my all-time favorite movies and I was very delighted to see the new film of 2010. And with good old Jeff Bridges as well as Bruce Boxleitner in main roles. Imagine my utter shock when I did watch this terrible sequel. What can I say? In 1982, with all the old computers they managed to make n endearing sweet movie with excellent plot, warm humor, great effects, nice suspense and decent ending. Now, the effects are spellbinding, the sound is clear and loud, the picture is superb... humor is gone, freshness is gone, originality is gone. It all looks suspiciously like newer Star Wars or Star Trek much too often, I say. Daresay, there is nothing original in this new film at all. Borrowing heavily from all the clichés, it leaves characters undeveloped, plot raw, action silly and violence unnecessary. It all smacks of some stale beer warm and vapid. My advice - watch it once, and then return to 1982 version, which will always be a great movie",TRON - Legacy
77,mike48128,"Spellbinding, Fantastic CGI but just as Confusing as Before",8,5 April 2014,"Tron has been re-imagined several times. This sequel, animated, and perhaps yet another sequel now in development? What could they possibly do in Part Three that hasn't been done before? In ""Legacy"", we see programs and icons acting almost human, even to the point of enjoying cocktail drinks with little digital umbrellas. (I always wondered what computer chips drank.) It's silly. So are a few of the subplots, with a character that appeals to be ""Metrosexual"". I ask you, how can an electronic gizmo be gay? The special effects are a vast improvement over that of 28 years ago, but most of the film makes no sense whatsoever, just like the original ""Tron"". The battle scenes are thrilling and the imagery is first rate. In this version, Kevin Flynn, the creator, and Clu are both played by Jeff Bridges; but his spin-off (Clu) hasn't aged 20 years like his Master. Olivia Wilde plays Quorra, Flynn's protégé and protector. She is a special being, the last of her kind, so we think. Here's the story: Jeff Bridge's son, Kevin, finds his way into the Tron Universe to rescue his father who has been stuck there for 20 years. It's quite an adventure, with tons of arena action and computer game warfare, as you might expect. ""Tron"" even reprises his role. This time, however, the Frisbee disc is both a weapon and among other things, The Master Program. Clu, the evil being, wants to take over the real Earth, and no longer wants to control just a virtual reality. He was over-programmed for perfection by Flynn, his creator. He raises an army of programs and is about to march on the real Earth. Flynn defeats him by reabsorbing him; big explosion. Son Kevin returns to the real world with the cat-suited Quorra and she sees her first real sunset from the back of his motorcycle. So much about this film makes no sense, even though it is a visual delight: 1. How can bits of electronic matter materialize in the real world? 2. If they did, wouldn't they be really tiny? 3. Although Quorra is life-size, isn't she just a living doll and not alive? 4. What will she eat, Duracells?

It lets down what could have been an outstanding film.

Besides the graphics there is nothing to cherish about this movie, because the seconds the action is gone and you see them talking, it gets boring and you just want to walk away. On one hand the story was unclear and hard to digest. The performances were even worse except veterans Jeff Bridges & Michael Sheen. Garrett Hedlund was totally miscast; mistake was not that the character was a brat, the mistake was it was played by Garrett Hedlund. He is a decent performer but it proved that he should stick to indie movies. He doesn't have what it takes to carry a multi-Billion franchise. Whole the time he was just saying his lines besides having any emotions to it. Olivia Wilde is a stunner, no doubt but she looked hyper and over excited sometimes. Beau Garrett was stunning but didn't get much scope. Overall, watch it for its graphic but if you're story & performance kind of guy, just forget it... It's damn boring.",TRON - Legacy
82,Troy_Campbell,Deserves to be seen on the big screen.,8,26 December 2010,"I've been reading previews and articles on Legacy for at least a year, possibly 18 months. Terms such as 'revolutionary', 'landmark' and 'Avatar-esque' were bandied around in regards to the cutting-edge CGI that was being employed for this belated sequel to the 1982 nerd-favourite Tron. Now after seeing Disney's $300m sci-fi epic I can confirm that the 3D special effects are breath-taking for sure and the best I've seen since James Cameron's game-changer last year, but at ""Avatar¬-esque"" levels of ground breaking they are not.To even consider attempting to photo-realistically portray a full-bodied character, Clu 2.0, that is meant to be Jeff Bridges circa the mid 80's was excitingly ambitious to start with, that director Joseph Kosinski and his computer effects team very nearly succeeded is enough to make any cineaste giddy with joy. However, as mind-blowingly stimulating as the potential for de-aging actors is, we'll have to keep on waiting (and my guess would be for a long time) for it to be seen without faults. If Clu 2.0 never fully succeeds, the other technologically-advancing visual feats certainly do. The entirely computerised habitat that Sam occupies for majority of the film is marvellous, the light-cycle race sequence worth the price of admission alone. Long gone are the days of the original Tron where real-life and digital elements clashed, now the line where actors and props start and CGI ends is completely seamless.As fantastic as the effects may be, their bedazzlement doesn't reach the next level as the narrative isn't as captivating. Screenwriters Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz noticeably put in the hard yards to achieve a radically unique story. I can't find a flaw in their concept, it's intriguing and worthy of discussion, it's their execution that leaves a lot to be desired. They unwisely give Bridges – as the weary Kevin Flynn, not Clu – annoyingly overt Zen-like dialogue, lazily coasting on Bridges' own laid-back persona. They also get struck by the Matrix Reloaded virus and unproductively get bogged down in trying to explain everything in the final act.Director Kosinski cops part of the blame too; his decision to constantly halt the action with extended segments of character exposé is commendable but they only serve as speed humps. There are a few scenes which should've been snipped heavily during the editing process that would have allowed the proceedings to be as free-flowing as they deserve to be. Where Kosinski undeniably gains points though is in his drafting of French musicians Daft Punk to create a distinctive soundtrack. They concoct a score that can only be described as brilliant and, in a fashion rarely witnessed within movies, their electrifying tunes often hold superior emotional sway than the visuals.In front of the screen there's a capable, if not overly memorable cast to eke out the diverse players in the Tron universe. The suitably good-looking Garrett Hedlund and Olivia Wilde provide the Gen Y component that is necessary in all Hollywood blockbusters, with Wilde proving she is one to watch for the future. British thesp Michael Sheen offers up an amusingly, if pointlessly camp performance in what is basically an extended cameo, whilst Bruce Boxleitner will please the diehards in his reprised role as Alan Bradley. But it's Jeff Bridges everyone will be expecting great things from and as both Clu 2.0 and Kevin Flynn his seemingly effortless awesomeness is evident as always, though neither performance will win him any Oscars.A mixed bag that doesn't have the all round oomph it should have, but ultimately still deserves to be seen on the big screen thanks to the CGI feast and mesmerizing soundtrack on offer.3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Fine, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)",TRON - Legacy
83,pyrocitor,"TRON 2.0: flashier, slicker, but effectively the same film. Does it matter? Hardly.",7,28 December 2010,"Given the profound advancements in the capabilities of computers and mass comprehension of them since the early 1980s, the thrill of translating such evolution into cinema makes TRON: Legacy the rare sequel which doesn't feel entirely gratuitous or devoid of artistic potential. Moreover, given that its extensive reliance on early special effects made its predecessor largely understood as a charming but particularly dated slice of cinematic fun lends Legacy and its slick, 'iMac' styled virtual realm a further boost in credibility. That said, while the additional 28 years have been kind of terms of aesthetic advancements, in the end, Legacy doesn't end up having much more to say apart from furthering the mantra of its predecessor: thrilling spectacle and giddy fun.Not to say that there's anything wrong with spectacle and fun, but debut director Joseph Kosinski does rely overly extensively on referencing other films at times, thus hindering his own film from properly standing alone - his desperation to emulate Christopher Nolan's Batman films in Legacy's opening segment makes for somewhat of a sour start. Nonetheless, the Wizard of Oz style use of 3D (switching from the 2D 'real world' sequences to 3D within the digital realm to make the journey all the more thrilling) proves canny and effective. It is this immediate barrage of multi-dimensioned, neon-lit stimuli that demonstrates the film at its most fun and effective, quickly reiterating and revamping the revered iconic elements of the first TRON (frisbee-cum-fencing identity disk battles, light cycle races) at a rapid enough pace enough to dazzle uninitiated audiences and those who have spent decades drooling over the pixelated predecessor alike. However, once the enthusiastic nods to the first TRON die down, Kosinski's film falls cumbersomely prey to swathes of sombre exposition, with pacifist guru Jeff Bridges outlining the 'very serious' situation at stake (a vague computer 'technocide' of revolutionary characters/programs by evil-twin Jeff Bridges and a plan to break out of the computer and into the 'real world' that feels deflated before fully explained), thus grinding the pace and fun-meter to a halt for what feels to be an unbearably long time. During this lengthy interlude from spectacular light shows and chases, the increasingly fallacious and shaky logic that plagued the first TRON and its attempting to rationalize computer programs and code as human characters and tangible objects carries through, making the film temporarily more of an incredulous puzzle than thrill ride. In a sense, the film never fully picks up the momentum and sparkle of its celebratory initial computer-world sequences, feeling somewhat stagnant and definitely at least twenty minutes too long despite a lively finale which rekindles some of the film's earlier spark. Nonetheless, a slew of inspired creative touches (the fascination of programs/characters with 'real world' objects, such as books, converted into computer code) add sufficient grace notes to make the entire ride worthwhile , all the while tremendously backed by the buzzing and throbbing Daft Punk musical score (the musicians themselves incorporated into the film as DJs at a club in a hilariously self-referential moment), which, apart from keeping the pace pounding, perfectly encapsulates the techno-thrill of the TRON world. Of course one Jeff Bridges performance in a film generally proves wacky and/or stunning enough to make the film worth watching in itself, and Legacy certainly benefits from its sparring twin Bridges, though his digital de-aging for antagonist Clu, while an impressive technological feat, still appears eerily plastic rather than organic. Despite being reduced (perhaps appropriately, given the computer setting) to a pair of narrative functions, Bridges manages to instill both his good and bad incarnations with appropriate spark and gruff charisma to keep the film pleasantly watchable, deserving, if nothing else, considerable credit for the most effective delivery of the word ""radical"" in decades. In contrast, requisite youthful protagonist Garrett Hedlund delivers an almost frustratingly vanilla 'rebellious, haunted hero' performance, doing little to command more than a baseline of the audiences' sympathies. However, Olivia Wilde provides some feisty energy as a revolutionary program, while Bruce Boxleitner provides a warmly nostalgic return as patronly programmer Alan Bradley and his program equivalent, TRON who famously ""fights for the users"". Finally, Michael Sheen unabashedly walks away with the show with his nervy, wired rendition of a pseudo-David Bowie club host, his cackling, cane-twirling presence providing the film with a refreshing dash of energy. It proves somewhat ironic that one of the earlier scenes shows the devious new heads of software company ENCOM maliciously chortling over their new operating system being unmistakable from the former apart from a new number on the box, as TRON: Legacy, in terms of plot, theme and content, demonstrates a particularly flimsy interior when its shiny exteriors are stripped away. Nonetheless, in terms of fulfilling its primary objective of glittering escapism, the film does not disappoint, its barrage of phenomenal special effects creating enough of a hypnotic, glowing ambiance that even the lulls in momentum, credulity and even interest become easily forgotten. Nonetheless, being, like its predecessor, fated to having its luster and 'wow' factor quickly dull over time, the newest TRON is a piece of dazzling escapism very much intended for its time, and thereby one best experienced on a big screen, from under a pair of gawky 3D glasses and by an audience prepared to set the majority of their brain functions to sleep in favour of a charmingly overpowering sensory thrill.-7/10",TRON - Legacy
84,oneguyrambling,"Cool backdrops and whiz bang compu-scenery cover up a lousy plot,",5,25 April 2011,"Nothing in Tron: Legacy shocked or surprised me much, it was OK but sort of floated along nothing POPPED or demanded my attention.In 1989 Kevin Flynn and son Sam had a bit of a chat which culminated in plans for a Father/Son video game night the next evening.Unfortunately the next day Sam's Dad vanished into thin air, never to be seen again.Until Present Day: One of Dad's old buddies rocks up to now adult Sam's bachelor pad to tell him a couple of things. The first is his rebellious antics and lack of responsibility aren't doing him any favours in life. The second is that he got a message last night from his Dad's office, which hadn't been used in a couple of decades.I would like to add that I personally am ecstatic that Sam did not grow up to be Shia Le Bouf, as nearly every ""son of"" or ""protege"" role in films in the last few years has been that unlikable dipsh*t.So it's off to the old arcade for Sam, where he boots up and old computer and as fast as you can say Ctrl-Alt-Del he's on the ""grid"", a computerised universe built by his Dad. I thought that was called the Matrix? Sam is immediately detected and hered into a group of zany looking cats. It turns out that on the grid computer programs are given human form – real humans are called ""users"" and are rare – Sam is assigned to ""Games"" by some hot Matrix chicks in glowing suits.After the obligatory computer game sequence for Tron-Hards (I toyed with Mor(tr)ons but deemed it a little harsh) – there is also a bike race and a spaceship chase – where Same very nearly dies a few times he is ushered into a control room where he meets his Dad who hasn't aged a day since he left! Sam tells Flynn ""I got your message"", and Flynn says something to the effect of ""yeah yeah I'm gonna treat you like I did your Dad"".That's right it wasn't his real Dad but a program named Clu. A naughty program who wants to do ill to humankind. After the aforementioned spacebike chase Sam is rescued by Olivia Wilde where he finds the real Kevin Flynn (it turns out that all the other Kevin Flynn's were just imitating), so the real Kevin Flynn stands up! On a side note Sam gets 2 Dads! And one loves video games! Kevin Flynn dresses like Obi-Wan and talks like Bridges ""It"" character of the last decade or so The Dude, at one point he tells Sam ""You're messing wit my Zen thing Man!"" Kevin tells young Sam that he has been exiled and living alone as a bit of a Buddhist with Olivia Wilde for a couple decades – could do a lot worse. So by going off-grid, he has been trapped on the grid. Explain that without your pretty head exploding Will Hunting! In between hippie speak Dad tells Sam that the only way to fix things and save the Earth involves getting to the ""Portal"". As Kevin has the Masterkey he can't risk going and allowing it to fall into Clu's hands, but through his inaction he was resigned to never seeing Sam again. Given the unexpected reunion Kevin decides that rather than risk losing Sam in true Buddhist faction the ""Best way of doing, is not doing"" or something like that.But the movie can't end with everyone staying pat and drinking herbal tea, so after some umming and aahing it's back to the main Grid we go.Back on the Grid Sam meets a ""facilitator"" who was obviously built on a late 70s David Bowie program template, and he learns that computer programs like techno music. (Who would have thought?) The inevitable showdown between Bridges happens on a bridge! And the movie ends.That ""Bridges"" was supposed to be more a joke than a spoiler – in reality it wasn't much of either – so don't get your Boba Fett undies in a bunch fanboys.The problem with Tron 2: Sam's Awakening is that the story seems thin and underdone, in actuality the film was in development for many years before anticipation and potential market was deemed solid enough to proceed. To me it looked like the filmmakers had their checklist of bike/disc fight thing/spacecraft chase and cobbled a story around it. What's left contains elements of Star Wars, The Matrix and a soundtrack heavily influenced by The Terminator, but without the Wow factor to intrigue and entertain casual viewers.Bridges is fine as old and compu-Flynn, though as mentioned he is basically Obi-Dude, Garrett Hedland isn't asked to do much aside from look puzzled and surprised in the second half and Olivia Wilde similarly is there to look pretty and alluring, and save and be saved along the way.The two major money-shot scenes (bike and disc-thing) work well though and the visuals are suitably astounding, and with sweet FA else of worth currently screening if you must check out something currently in cinemas you this is worth a look. I'd wait for DVD (in retrospect).Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. The expected stuff is there, cool backdrops and whiz bang compu-scenery, unfortunately the plot and action isn't up to the task.",TRON - Legacy

He is soon contacted by his father's loyalist who claims that he was paged by his father.The tech-savvy, 27-year-old son of Kevin Flynn, looks into his father's disappearance and finds himself pulled into the same world of fierce programs and gladiatorial games where his father has been living for 20 years. In this virtual world , Sam meets his father (Jeff Bridges) and he finally finds out what led to his disappearance. I saw the trailer of TRON:Legacy almost a year back and I was so thrilled and excited to watch the film in 3D. Though I have not seen the original part but still I was entertained enough to keep my spirits alive. The visuals are actually breath-taking. Hats-off to the special effects team for creating such phenomenal world where every thing is technologised. The direction was just about OK along with the story line. Garrett Hedlund showed some promises along with Olivia Wilde . But it is Jeff Bridges who is the show-stopper both as Kevin Flynn / Clue.

87,sarastro7,Year's best Sci-Fi!,10,21 December 2010,"I was never a big fan of the old TRON movie, but TRON: Legacy was the most enjoyable science fiction movie I have seen since 2006's V For Vendetta. Good-looking and satisfying throughout, I was thoroughly entertained by the world of the Grid, and I thought all the effects and most of the story developments made eminent sense in that setting. They also enhanced the old movie to a degree that makes it a greater classic than before. I could list a lot of reasons that I felt this movie worked very well, but there were also a tiny few things that disappointed me. For instance, when Sam enters the Grid, we only see the digitizing process from the point of view of the laser beam, and not from an outside perspective, which cheats us of one of the most iconic effects of the original movie. Also, the ending of the movie was not as exciting and interesting as it ought to have been. But, come to think of it, I don't think I have any other complaints. Sam's character may not have been as charismatic as we could have wanted, but I enjoyed that fact that he played a guy who had basically remained a teenage screw-up far into his twenties.Kevin Flynn's character intrigued me a lot. He had become a prisoner of his own programs, particularly because he had designed CLU to create a perfect world, which CLU then did. Since the programming was imperfect, so was CLU's idea of perfection. Yet elsewhere in the Grid, Kevin's programming had yielded the emergent self-aware lifeforms of the ISOs, which had free will and knowledge enough to transform the world. I love these ideas.The movie is catching some flak because of the Tron character's ""random"" change of allegiance towards the end. I didn't have a problem with it for several reasons. First, Tron really only has a small role in the movie, and by the time he changes his loyalty, it doesn't make that much of a difference. Second, I don't think the change was random. This is a world of programs; everything that takes place must follow rigid rules. If Tron changed allegiance, there must have been a reason for it, even if it didn't seem clear to us. That's how I rationalize it, anyway.I loved the movie and will definitely be going for seconds. To me it was clearly the year's best sci-fi movie, even ahead of Inception.10 stars out of 10.",TRON - Legacy
88,thekarmicnomad,ps -ef:grep 'The POINT',1,10 January 2011,"What was the point in making this film as Tron 2?In the original you could fool yourself into thinking that they were inside a computer and that train they rode was some kind of data packet and the characters were representations of spread sheets or whatever. That was kind of cool. In this oddity there is little difference between the real and computer worlds. The programs flirt around, get drunk and rock out to techno in a cheesy bar. The light cycles have engines and skid and rev. The spaceships need boosters to fly around in a world where physics shouldn't really play as much a part as it does.I think they were going for a Wizard of Oz type deal with the 2d and 3d but I couldn't really tell when it kicked in.People who are not fans of LightCycles and Disc games will be pleased to hear that these have been kept to a bare minimum where as fans of long, boring, un-engaging dialogues are in for a real treat!Plot is bafflingly stupid. Writing is painfully bad. Characters are unbelievably transparent. Action is very thin on the ground. Performances are good: although I suspect the 'I am not a program (pause for dramatic affect) I am a user!' is going to haunt Garrett Hedlund for the rest of his career.If this comes on next Christmas watch it on the TV and you will enjoy falling asleep to it.",TRON - Legacy

One thing – please – keep the Kool Aid out of movies, please! Movie goers are not stupid. The movie makers do not need to throw in phrases like, 'The rich keep getting' richer and the poor keep getting poorer.' Phrases like these are so meaningless, especially since they are often muttered by over-paid, under-worked mega-stars. So – once more - keep the kool aid out of the movies and maybe you may turn out something of quality. Hahaha – just wasting my time. The movie was not terribleit was just very painful to sit and a chore to wait for things to happen. The cast did as well as they could with what they had to work with.

91,jon.h.ochiai,What Legacy?,6,26 December 2010,"""Tron: Legacy"" is simply awful. It is cutting edge 3D eye candy at best. The story is virtually incomprehensible and just plain stupid. Garrett Hedlund is charismatic as son Sam Flynn—reminiscent of a young Brad Pitt. Olivia Wilde commands as the hot hero Quorra. Jeff Bridges in multiple roles is compelling as exiled Grid creator Kevin Flynn. Although, his 20 years younger digitized persona Clu is unnerving like an artificial life form. Perhaps, this beckons the new wave of movie making—CGI rejuvenated stars. But I digress. The original 1982 ""Tron"" was nearly forgettable—this is just personal recollection. ""Tron: Legacy"" represents a mild paradox. Currently, movies have been mocked for having video games as source material. ""Tron"" was the cool looking special effects movie that spawned the video game. Recall ""Tron"" was never regarded in the realm of ""Star Wars"" nor ""Blade Runner"". So why did Disney resurrect ""Tron"" after more than 20 years? The ""Tron: Legacy"" trailer is more enticing than the actual movie, and orders of magnitude shorter. Even as the state of the art 3D, ""Tron: Legacy"" is puzzling. No, the 3D is not integral to the story. Literally dark, ""Legacy"" is set mostly in the cyber-surreal world of The Grid. We experience mostly contrasting neon illumination against the barren Gothic background. Granted the light cycle races and the martial arts-lite fights are cool. However, the narrative void of ""Legacy"" is entirely distracting. Missing is the poignant completion of the estranged father-son dynamic. Instead we get the race to stop evil Clu from enslaving the real world, which is not exactly transparent as a realizable outcome. Director Joseph Kosinski manufactures an existential universe in The Grid. He provides some eclectic elements. When Sam (Hedlund) is reunited with his father, he finds Kevin in immaculate white sitting in Zen meditation. Kevin is expanding his spirituality in this world of 1's and 0's. Quorra (Wilde) recounts the books she has read in Kevin's library. She describes that his Father has enrolled her in the noblest pursuit to lose self. Then she admits that her favorite book is by Jules Verne. In a quietly humorous scene Sam describes to Kevin what has happened in the world during his absence. Kevin tells Sam that he thought of Wi-Fi back in the '80s. Individually, this is great stuff. However, cohesiveness is not the strong suit of ""Tron: Legacy"". Consider the source material. The screenplay is by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, based on the story by these two along with two other writers. The credits also acknowledge the writers of the original characters. A classic symptom of these many writers is massive kluge. CEO of ENCON Kevin Flynn mysteriously disappeared in 1992. Note that ENCOM gained prominence as creator of the video game Tron. Son Sam says good night to his Dad on that fateful night. Flash forward to the present. Sam is the motorcycle riding rebel stock wealthy heir of ENCON, who defuses a global applications launch by brazenly releasing it as shareware. ENCON Co-founder Alan Bradley (who was Tron in ""Tron"") is on to Sam. Bruce Boxleitner looks great and is one of the strong points—too bad he isn't more leveraged. He tells Sam that he received a phone page from his father. Sam heads to his Dad's old workshop. By design Sam is then transported through the portal to The Grid. There Sam must transform his gamer mastery to that of a warrior in light cycle and light disc challenges. Although not transparent what death translates to in The Grid, Sam is rescued by the dazzling Quorra, sporting skin tight black. Apparently, Kevin relinquished architectural control of The Grid to his generated alter-ego Clu (younger Bridges). Arising out of this matrix was a new life form—isomorphic algorithms or ISOs. It is like digital DNA. This is ironic: scientists surmised for years that DNA molecules could possibly be used as memory devices. Clu deeming ISOs as a threat to the order of The Grid embarked on ISO genocide. Clu's grand design is releasing the perfection of The Grid in the real world, and Kevin holds the key. This conspiracy is murky, largely because the writers really have no captivating arc, and Kosinski had to patch in the big budget visuals. What would have been more satisfying is fleshing out the reunion of father and son. Bridges and Hedlund do their best, but are sabotaged by the script. I know people are willing to ignore the inadequacies of ""Tron: Legacy"" for the 3D. That is a shame. What is really a disappointment is that with all the money spent on ""Tron: Legacy"" no one bothered to create a compelling story.",TRON - Legacy
92,ajs-10,Sadly the critics were right...,5,23 August 2011,"I admit I was a fan of the original 1982 film TRON and, despite many poor reviews I was still intrigued to see the updated version. Well, visually, it's quite stunning, but to be honest, the writers of those many poor reviews did have a point. I did like the music though, even a reprise of the song from the original film; ""Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)"" by Journey. Most of the original music was produced by Daft Punk, which seemed to fit the technological mood pretty well. But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first.Kevin Flynn became a successful businessman at the end of the first film. He later got married and had a son, Sam. Several years later he mysteriously disappeared without a trace. His son, now grown up is disillusioned and refuses to take control of the company that is rightfully his. One of the directors, and friend of his father, Alan Bradley, comes to him one day saying he's been paged by Kevin. Strangely though, it has come from Kevin's old games arcade that hasn't been running for years. Sam goes there and finds Kevin's old workshop. Turning devices on, he is digitised and downloaded to 'The Grid'. Now, 'The Grid' is run by a program written by Kevin called Clu, who looks like Kevin did 30 years ago. Clu's mission is to remove any imperfections on 'The Grid'. Sam is made to play games or risk being killed. He reluctantly plays, but is rescued by the mysterious Quorra. She takes him off 'The Grid' to meet his real father. Sam desperately wants to get his father out of there and it's a race against time to escape the world of TRON. I won't say any more as I don't want the Spoiler Police to de-res me.As I've already said, the visuals are quite stunning in this one, I cannot fault most of the CGI. I saw it in 2D so I cannot comment on the 3D-ness of the picture. Decent performances all round; Jeff Bridges did a good job as both Kevin Flynn and Clu, although he was CGI'd as Clu and that didn't quite work as well as it might. Garrett Hedlund was OK as Sam Flynn, as was Olivia Wilde as Quorra. It was also nice to see Bruce Boxleitner as Alan Bradley and reprising his original role as TRON.I think the main problem with this film was that it was too much like the original, as far as the story goes. It's all about getting from one place to another to escape something bad and get home. Very 'Wizard of Oz' if you like. Unfortunately, we're all too familiar with that story and after a while it becomes boring. Yes, the visuals are quite stunning, but that doesn't make up for a rather predictable an, sadly, dull plot. The dialogue didn't help matters much either, it was all far too pedestrian I'm afraid Sadly, the critics were right in this case Not recommended.My Score: 5.3/10.IMDb Score: 7.0/10 (based on 83,476 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 50/100 (based on 221 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",TRON - Legacy

94,johnstonjames,"For Faithful Disney Fans, Vindication",9,31 December 2010,"it's been a long, thankless road for fans of the original Disney film 'Tron', but finally after some thirty years there is some acknowledgment of what many fans have known for years. 'Tron' is an under-appreciated film experience and Disney film and a lot of fun. it's great to see it get the attention it's always deserved.as a Disney fan since practically birth, and a fan of the forgotten Disney classics of the 1980's, i've always loved 'Tron' and have always defended it to the many detractors i've met throughout the years that have always argued that it was a dismal failure. sure. 'Tron' was a box office flop at the time, but i felt it was a good film and excellent Disney. just like the equally under-appreciated 'Black Hole', 'Tron' was one of the last films to come out of the original Disney Burbank studios. as a Disney fan it is noteworthy just for that alone. but like the 'Black Hole' i continued to be faithful to it and kept watching it whenever i could throughout the years.i've always felt the 1980's was a more noteworthy period in Disney history than a lot of fans and critics like to believe. although not entirely successful, with critics or audiences, the Disney films of the 1980's are just now coming into their own in terms of recognition. great animated classics like 'Fox and the Hound', 'Black Cauldron','Great Mouse Detective', and 'Oliver & Co.', as well as live action fare such as 'Tron', 'The Black Hole', the eerie 'Watcher in the Woods', and the scary adaptation of Ray Bradbury's 'Something Wicked This Way Comes'. all excellent movies and all under appreciated at the time, are now starting to become familiar to mainstream audiences and Disney fans.like the animated 'Black Cauldron', 'Tron' was always, to a lot of us, the quintessential 80's Disney film. so the sequel, 'Tron Legacy',is really a homage to that period. and an excellent one at that and probably with broader audience appeal than the original. i still feel the original film is more colorful and Disney like, it looks more like old fashioned hand drawn cartoons than the sequel. that's what i like about the original film.the new 'Tron', has more of the feel of recent cinema sci-fi fantasy and CGI films offered to todays audiences. but i was surprised at how faithful it was to the spirit of Steven Lisberger's first film and to Disney. the neon looking 'Tron' Disney castle logo at the beginning was a blast and very funny. and the new film kept the story very simple and straight forward. i kind of expected a convoluted mess of a story as the film tried to out do the original in complexity, but not so. this was very uncomplicated and unburdened by such things. and surprisingly unpretentious.i also felt it was the concept/idea of creative artist and not marketing executives. i mean what studio executive in their right mind would want to make a sequel some thirty years later to a film that flopped? not many so you know this was a creative push.the design was just great. every idea from the original 'Tron' is here plus a few more clever ones thrown in to ""freshen"" things up. even a nod to Kubrick's '2001' is here. Flynn's dining room is reminiscent of the dining room/bedroom at the end of '2001' with it's box-lighted floors and white walls with Baroque paintings and furniture. trippy. and the 'Light Cycles'(the most famous thing from the original) were just as fun as the first time. there was lots of authentic atmosphere to this new 'Tron'. they even had a weird effect (at least i think it was a effect)of Jeff Bridges looking as young as he did in 1980. they also showed the original 'Tron' arcade game, although i remember the game cost fifty cents and not a quarter.HAW HAW!arcades. remember them? seems like a dated concept now that most video games are played at home. it would be funny to explain to kids today that we didn't have video games in the home. at least most of us didn't. possibly 'Pong' or something.this was also an excellent film for kids and families. very ""G"" rated and wholesome. there is no swearing or actual bloodshed, but parents should be strongly cautioned that there is suggestion of alcohol consumption. something maybe not to suitable for minors.i thoroughly enjoyed this sequel. and it was a must in 3D. it was true to the original Disney film and it's message was still a good one about sharing versus greed. something 'Tron' has always been about. although i did miss the original 'Tron' score by 'Clockwork Orange''s Walter/Wendy Carlos.",TRON - Legacy
95,silvermistvio,Lives in a game. That's a different film.,8,18 September 2019,"Have you ever wondered how the lives in game look like? I have actually. At that time, I was playing a game and that thought accidentally pop into my head. Now, I've seen what it looks like in this film.Tron: Legacy is a film that shows characters' lives in a game. At the same time, it also shows some people's behaviours, like how they lie, how they do bad things, etc. It's kind of a normal thing, but when it is in a game and not in the reality, it's different taste.What I like the most is the car race scene and how they escape from the grid. That is so cool. Because of that scene, I like this film more and more.All in all, Tron: Legacy might not be a good film for some people. But as for me, it's doing great and I kind of enjoyed it.",TRON - Legacy
96,witster18,A straight forward take from a fan of the original.,7,18 December 2010,"The knock on the first film was that it was a little too hard to grasp the concept, and that it was disjointed. The whole concept is far-fetched, but if you can't get over that, you'll never be a fan of the original, OR the sequel.The Good: Tron Legacy is pretty easy to follow, and you'll get the concept whether you've seen the original or not(although I highly recommend watching the first one, first). I thought the sequel did a fantastic job of continuation. Most of the original characters are brought back, but we see those characters as they have developed both inside and out of 'the grid'.I watched this at the first afternoon show on IMAX 3D, and for a town that never fills theaters at 1:30 in the afternoon, the theater was only a couple of seats shy of being full. I'm absolutely certain that the remaining 3 or 4 shows of the day sold out.As for the presentation. The sound in the IMAX theater was amazing. From the throwback 80's music when our lead entered the arcade, to the head-bopping Daft Punk soundtrack sequences, this movie sounded incredible. When ships flew by the theater shook like a rather large aftershock, and you really felt like you the viewer were in the grid. I highly recommend that you make sure that you're viewing this in either 3D IMAX, or a top-notch sound system theater to get the full effects of the music in this movie. This is quite simply the most amazing sounding movie experience of my life. Period.The Bad: They virtually did nothing aimed towards the use of 3D in this movie. If I had it all over to do again - I'd see this in 2D in a theater with a great sound system. You wouldn't be missing anything except the dizzy feeling afterwards, and a clearer 2D image. However, it may be hard to find a better sound system than you'll find at IMAX.I could have done without the CGI recreation of Jeff Bridges face as his evil-counterpart Clu. In a film full of unbelievable concepts and images, it's the only thing that truly looks unbelievable. In the first scene(a flashback) they should have shot it from behind Flynn, and not re-created his face as a digital younger version. Clu has some justification to look fake - he is - that scene of the REAL Flynn and the whole concept of Clu could have been handled a bit better.The film does get a little slower from the 80-100 minute mark, but I thought it was necessary to finish the story.Overall: The look is a 9. The sound is an 11(it goes to eleven:)). The story is an 8(as good as you could ever expect). The films' not perfect though. The ending could have been touched up just a bit - would have liked to have seen Cora grab a hold of Flynn junior to rise up, and could have gone without some of the Ten Commandment shots(you'll see what I mean) - it would have been a better way to achieve the same epic feel at the climax. This film looks as good as I expected, sounds better than I expected, but didn't over-achieve in terms of surpassing my already too high expectations. Highly recommended. Not conceptually amazing, or perfectly woven together, but didn't disappoint in those terms compared to some of the early reviews that I had read. After reading some of those reviews - I really thought this was going to be an eye-candy-only disaster, but I was wrong. There was thought and care put into this sequel - more than I expected, even for a blockbuster.Recommended to fans and non-fans alike. This film is the definition of 'Big' in terms of visuals and sound. Very impressive stuff. I might go back and watch it in 2D before Christmas. I know that making comparisons to other films is a recipe for approval ratings disaster, but this film sounded better than anything I've experienced in a theater, and looked great too... Avatar eat your heart out.This is truly the definition of a popcorn movie done right - not perfect, but right. It's a BIG movie, but with that comes BIG expectations. Temper those, and enjoy the visceral experience. 74/100You'll like it if you liked: Tron(orig), Avatar, Ghost in the Machine, Vexille, and The Fifth Element.",TRON - Legacy
97,Snootz,View changed over time,9,15 February 2021,"I saw the first TRON when it was released in 1982. For its day it was a phenomenal film that made history not only in the world of science fiction, but in film making. The vision and presentation was simply different than Star Wars or 2001 or Star Trek. It was and continues to be a classic that holds its own even to this day.When I first saw TRON: Legacy in 2010, I wasn't that impressed. Looking back I understand why, and understand why it has an under-appreciated rating on IMDB. It simply wasn't the original TRON. It was too different, too dark, not as humorous or ground-breaking, the characters not as charismatic.Today however it's 2021 and I pulled out my BluRay copy and watched it again. No longer expecting a repeat of the original TRON, I was able to watch, enjoy and rate this on its own merits. And what I found was a film that was superb of its own rights. The story was sensible, the core theme solid, and the directing, design and CGI nearly flawless. I found myself stirred as I had not been before. Older now, having experienced more of life, and no longer glued to the concept of the original TRON... I found Legacy to be excellent in its own way.Perhaps the story line wasn't as thrilling, but it was solid. 2010 was a different year than 1982 so the graphics, while technically superior to the original, simply did not impress as much in the wake of all the special effects we'd seen since Star Wars changed the face of cinema in 1977. Nevertheless, TRON: Legacy is a solid film. As is sometimes the case I found myself enjoying the second viewing a great deal more than the first, and became fully immersed in this revised vision of TRON.If a third TRON were to be produced today, what would it be? Would it push so much CGI in our faces that it would ruin the concept, or would they realize it's the story and characters that make the film? I would hope the later. I enjoyed the portrayal of the characters in Legacy. The actors did a great job. By the end of the film I found myself a fan-reborn in 2021, viewing the TRON concept with new appreciation. It's only been 11 years since this film was made-- not long enough to say it's withstood the test of time. But it's certainly an enjoyable watch with terrific choreography and presentation.It kept me entertained and made a point about perfectionism and accepting our own limitations and mistakes. So this time I give it a good, solid 9 stars, (just short of ""great""). I believe it's an effort that deserves that much.",TRON - Legacy
98,Likes_Ninjas90,Most will happily see it for the 3D visuals and by the time they reach The Grid they'll forget they've been here many times before,6,19 December 2010,"With computer wizard Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) disappearing for a number of years, his software company ENCOM International has been taken over by its board of directors. Flynn's son Sam (Garrett Hedlund) is unhappy with the direction of the company and tries to sabotage its newly developed software. When Sam is told by a family friend that they have received a pager message from Flynn's Arcade, Sam decides to investigate the abandoned building. Inside he finds a secret room and is then sucked straight into a virtual world known as The Grid. It is a highly controlled and sterilised world, dominated by computer programs, many of which have human appearances and characteristics. After surviving a series of gladiatorial games, Sam finds his dad Flynn and an ally in a female program called Quorra (Olivia Wilde). They explain to Sam that Flynn's computerised copy of himself, CLU, has launched an uprising and has taken over The Grid. They reveal that a special disk belonging to Flynn must be protected as they work their way back towards an exit portal. Even if you have not seen the original TRON (1982), as I haven't, you can still appreciate the visual enhancements of Joseph Kosinki's sequel. TRON: Legacy is one of the first films since Avatar (2009) to be shot primarily in 3D, rather than facing a delayed conversion. There are noticeable benefits to this once Sam enters into The Grid. In the film's best scene, a battle arena seemingly made of glass, the 3D technology creates visible distinctions between the foreground, middle ground and background. Each camera shot contains a certain level of depth that works to inspire a more immediate and tangible spatial area. For once, the promise of the 3D technology has been fulfilled. There are some familiar setbacks though, mostly relating to colour. The opening scenes, which we are told were intentionally left in 2D, still look too dark and although the use of the 3D is as subtle as it was in Avatar, the look of this film is nowhere near as vibrant as Cameron's creation. The Grid universe is particularly atmospheric with its black backgrounds juxtaposed against neon lighting. But the specificity of this moody design also means that the film does not benefit from the joyous bursts of colour found in Pandora.It is again frustrating that most of the film's creativity went into its aesthetics, rather than its script. As a Disney production, the narrative is extremely safe and predictable, retreading old concepts about the perils of technology. It asks whether artificial intelligence is strictly limited to what its creator intended. It's a question posed and answered by endless sci-fi films, most notably The Matrix (1998) and Blade Runner (1982). Despite the films over length, it unjustifiably runs over two hours, there is little attention to character here. Bridges draws a few laughs but 'The Dude' is below his best with the material and Hedlund is a relatively forgettable protagonist. At least Michael Sheen has fun playing a dodgy club owner and Wilde's bob cut Quorra is sweetly curious about humanity. The script problems will be less concerning for younger viewers and video game fans. Most will happily see it for the 3D visuals and by the time they reach The Grid they'll forget they've been here many times before.",TRON - Legacy
99,DonFishies,"Unique and visually stunning, but a bit of a cohesive mess",7,17 December 2010,"Picking up and redeveloping the mythology from when TRON left off, Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) has gone missing after quickly taking over ENCOM and making it into an unbeatable powerhouse in the late 1980's. Leap forward over two decades later, and ENCOM is still at the top of its game even without its leader. But its main shareholder, Flynn's son Sam (Garrett Hedlund), wants nearly nothing to do with it. On the encouragement and curiosity of an old friend, Sam returns to his father's old office to investigate a mysterious page. He gets zapped into a redesigned ENCOM system, and quickly realizes the dangerous predicament he has thrown himself into.Much like the original film, the storyline of TRON: Legacy is a cohesive mess. Action sequences seem to be the only real element connecting every story sequence together, sometimes absentmindedly. Once the film's ideas and real crux of a plot line start moving, the film seems inept at knowing what to do – offer explanations for what is going on, or just move along on the fly, and hope the audience will have some form of an understanding of what is going on. It slows down to a screeching halt in a few scenes and practically vomits exposition at the audience at increasing speeds, hoping some thoughts will stick and any logistical elements will be completely ignored. Worse yet, certain events and scenes happen or are alluded to with the obvious intention of being important later on, only to serve next to no point at all. An allegiance switch late in the film is of particular standout, because it means absolutely nothing seconds after it happens. The film runs 30 minutes longer than the original film, but still appears to have had a significant portion of story elements hacked to bits.The acting is hit and miss as well. Hedlund has the right amount of ignorance and swagger to make Sam a great character, but his dialogue, delivery and chemistry with anyone else is near pitiful. Some of his lines, added directly to appeal to children, stand out as particularly awful. He just does not have what it takes for the audience to take him seriously as a lead, and to make his journey compelling. I wanted to like him and I wanted to care about what happened, but his performance just made it almost impossible. Olivia Wilde fares significantly better as Quorra, who spends the majority of the film either saving Sam or asking him about the mysteries of the outside world. It is a thankless role that could have been performed by any gorgeous young actress, but Wilde makes the character her own, giving her a life and personality that is nearly devoid from the actual story itself. Bridges does not get a whole lot to do, acting both as the older Flynn and the voice of the mostly computer generated Clu 2.0, but still proves to be as immensely entertaining as always. I found his work to be second only to Michael Sheen, who steals the entire movie in his small role as an over-the-top David Bowie-like club owner.But where the film stands out, and the real reason anyone should even consider venturing into a movie like TRON: Legacy, is in its visuals. First time director Joseph Kosinski has taken Steven Lisberger's unique vision and, alongside his incredibly talented crew, has repurposed and reimagined just about everything to look even more incredible than it did in 1982 (and borrows from a few other science fiction films in the process). They have left little nods, designs and references to elements from the original film, but everything has been revamped and painstakingly recreated in even more dazzling detail. If you found the original film hard to watch or just laughed at it's almost archaic digital design, than you will simply marvel at what is shown on screen here. The light cycles are majestic and fluid. The costumes and movements within ""the grid"" are astonishing. The action and battle scenes are astounding. The digitally replicated look and feel of Clu 2.0 as Bridges in his early 30's is simply mindblowing. There are instances where the effects are imperfect, but seeing the visuals updated to look this ridiculously unbelievable is worth the price of admission alone. The 3D effects are not nearly as much of a revelation as they were in Avatar, but they help add a nice layer of creative depth to the film.The score, created by Daft Punk (who have a small, not so subtle cameo), is also of particular note because of how much it adds to the film. This has been an incredible year for scores in film, and TRON: Legacy's is likely one of the best. The techno, electro pop sound gives many of the film's scenes a more epic and pulse-pounding sense of life that no other score could have delivered. It is inspiring, and helps practically add a sense of authenticity to the film. It simply would not have worked nearly as well had it been done by a traditional orchestra. And it just keeps getting better and more legendary as the film goes on.As a whole, I am on the fence over how I feel about TRON: Legacy. It is a disappointment from a storyline standpoint (although it does work a little better than TRON did), but from a visual standpoint, it is absolutely incredible. The unique look and feel of the film is just too overpowering not to be. It does things that the original film only wished it could have pulled off in 1982, and will leave audiences stunned at how far we have come since. It is not quite the experience we got from Avatar this time last year, but its ambitious results surprised me immensely. I just hope those early extended franchise rumours remain rumours.7/10.(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",TRON - Legacy
100,timdalton007,Tron: 28 Years Later,8,9 January 2012,"Twenty-eight years after Tron first hit cinema screen in 1982, the long awaited sequel Tron: Legacy finally saw the light of day. Given both the advances of special effects and the legacy (no pun intended) of the original film, Tron: Legacy found itself with a high set of expectations before it. Keeping both of those things in mind, how does Legacy stand up as a sequel to the original film? Let's start by looking at the two retuning cast members from the original film: Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner who both reprise their two roles from the original film. Bridges plays both Kevin Flynn and his digital avatar, the program named CLU. The Flynn of Legacy is quite different from the quirky everyman seen in the original film, this Flynn being more philosophic as well as having a dash of both Bridges' The Dude character and just a bit of Obi-Wan Kenobi thrown in for good measure. While that might make one think the character would be unrecognizable, just the reverse is true as Bridges presents a believable nevertheless as a continuation of the character. CLU is, while wearing Flynn's face from the 1980s, is very much different as he has become a tyrannical ruler bent on creating what is perfection in his own eyes. Boxleitner reprises the roles of Alan Bradley and Tron, both of which are effectively extended cameo appearances but comes across as crucial to the film's plot. Both actors are able to reprise their younger roles thanks to a bit of digital de-aging that for the most part works incredibly well (though some of the shots of the younger Flynn are very noticeable due to the lighting). The result is a nice link back to the original film that nevertheless expands on the original character's.The majority of the cast though are new characters. Playing Flynn's now grown son Sam is Garrett Hedlund who, like Bridges in the original film, convincingly portrays a fairly normal person sent into a digital world. Outshining him to a certain degree is Olivia Wilde as the program Quorra whose performance perfectly captures what is effectively an innocent abroad character with an action film twist. It also helps that Hedlund and Wilde share a good deal of chemistry between them which helps the film out as well. Also appearing in the supporting cast is an almost unrecognizable Michael Sheen as Castor, James Frain as CLU's henchman Jarvis and Beau Garrett as Gem. All together, the cast serves the film well which is always a plus.The production values of Legacy are worthy of note for a whole number of reasons. The original production values of Tron from its production design to its costumes and early CGI effects created a vision of a digital world iconic decades later. Iconic yet on the surface dated due to the limitations of 1980s technology. The biggest challenge that Legacy would face would be updating that world for a 21st century audience. In that regard, Legacy succeeds. The film takes the iconic elements of the first film such as the Lightcycles and disc battles but gives them a modern edge. Compare for example the ""new"" light-cycles with the ""old"" light-cycle seen later in the film. They're both light cycles but the ""new"" one has a less plastic feel to it, as if it's been streamlined down to basics. Legacy also has a lot more physical sets in its digital world, called ""the Grid"", which make it perhaps a more believable world with a solid feeling to it. That isn't to downgrade what was done in the original film by any means of course but Legacy takes what was done there and, with nearly three decades of technological advancement, takes it up a level while still remaining true to it.Last but not least, is the plot and script for Legacy. The original Tron has fairly been called simplistic in terms of its plotting and the same can just as fairly be said about its sequel here. The film, minus some flashbacks, is set twenty-eight years after the original. Kevin Flynn, head of Encom and a man apparently on the brink of some breakthrough, disappeared in 1989. Twenty years later, with Alan Bradley now a relatively minor member of Encom's board and Flynn's son Sam largely uninterested in the company, a mysterious message sends Sam on a course onto the Grid. Legacy follows many of the same beats as the original film in terms of the order of sequences showing off different aspects of the digital world. That isn't to say that it is a rip-off by any means. Legacy, appropriately enough, deals with the theme of legacies throughout. In the real world, Sam and Alan are dealing with Flynn's disappearance twenty years on. The Grid is being directed by CLU towards some secret goal, which CLU hopes will allow him to once and for all overcome Flynn's legacy. Last but not least is Flynn himself who, with Sam's arrival, begins at long last a journey that will see him facing the consequences of actions in a world he has disconnected from. Like the first film, Legacy is a simple plot that embodies some sizable ideas just beneath the surface.Where does that leave Legacy then as a sequel? The performances of both returning actors and new actors is on par with that seen in the original film, the production values and effects bring the iconic world of the original into the modern day and the script has the same fault as the original one did in being perhaps overly simplistic in terms of plot while harboring some intriguing ideas. I would argue that, quality wise, Legacy is on par with the original film in terms of pure enjoyment as a sci-fi adventure film. Whether it will be as iconic as the original though is something that only time will tell.",TRON - Legacy
101,gigan-92,"Minor Hiccups, But Overall Dazzling",8,31 December 2010,"I recently caught the chance to see this interesting film, and was thoroughly intrigued so that I saw it again. I must say, for one of those live action Disney produced films it wasn't all that bad an experience. The score by Daft Punk was just one reason in itself to like the film. When I first saw the film I was under the impression it was the work of Hans Zimmer. It was like re-living yet re-vamping the 80s so to speak, perfectly capturing the feel of the film throughout. And the acting was also pretty solid, Jeff Bridges was just too good in this movie from my point of view. Oliva Wilde was decent, as well as Garret Hedlund.From time to time we are subject to campy one-liners tossed in for the sake of us remembering this is a Disney film, i.e. ""that's a big door"" or the classic ""have a nice swim"". Those really bugged me and brought down what could've been an 9/10, but I digress. Oh yeah, plus that really, really, REALLY, over the top scene involving a parachute..but I say again, I digress.The films holds together solely due to its stunning escapade of dazzling visual sights that will astound you. I saw the film in both in 3D and 'normal' viewing and I can honestly find not much difference. the SFX in this film deliver, and you'll feel fully immersed in this high-tech fantasy film, a rare feat that I really recommend.",TRON - Legacy
102,griffolyon12,"Smart, Savvy, and Electrifying!",10,17 December 2010,"There is a moment in Tron: Legacy where Jeff Bridges' Kevin Flynn shows up at a cyber nightclub to save his son, Sam. At his arrival, the lights dim, and with a single touch, he derezzes the evil programs detaining Sam. Kevin Flynn is the creator of the cybernetic universe in Tron: Legacy, and the movie never wants us to forget his deistic importance to the Grid. While, Tron: Legacy could be seen as a father-son story, it is more a movie about the spiritual; the Grid possibly standing in for the spiritual battlefield between God and Satan.Tron: Legacy starts in 1989. The CEO of tech. company ENCOM, Kevin Flynn, disappears, leaving his son, Sam to grow up embittered and resentful over the next 25 years or so. We catch up with an adult Sam, irresponsible, and with a chip on his shoulder due to his Dad's disappearance. He's spoiled and rich due to the money from is Daddy's estate, but when a page comes from his Dad's office that hasn't been inhabited for over 20 years, Sam goes investigating. One thing comes to another, Sam messes around with a computer, and he is shot inside it, into the Grid! Here Sam soon learns that the only way to live in this world is to fight in gladiatorial combat with computer programs, and it is here that Sam finds his father after 20 years, but getting his father back to the portal to the real world is the adventure.Like all great adventure stories, in Tron: Legacy you have the hero in Sam Flynn, the villain in the computer program Clu (also played by Jeff Bridges, de-aged by CGI), and you have the mentor in Kevin Flynn himself, the creator. Like The Wizard of Oz or Star Wars before it, it follows a formula. A hero ventures from his Ordinary World into one of the Extraordinary that is both frightening and fantastical at the same time, but what makes these by-the-book adventure stories stand on their own are the messages hidden beneath the material, and that is the true earmark of a fantastic adventure story, and why they are so important to the fabric of storytelling. Tron: Legacy easily joins those ranks, laying everything out in the open with an ease that is comforting, letting the story transpire rather than trying to shove continuous action down our throats, and this is where it manages to be so much more than any other CGI-laden spectacle you'll see this year.Yes, the CGI is breathtaking, the action perfectly paced throughout the course of the story, but Tron: Legacy manages to stay with the viewer not through these things, but through its battles of the spirit. Kevin Flynn is the Grid, he created it, with his touch he can change or manipulate almost anything he wants, but there is an opposing force that wants to impede Flynn's every move. Flynn long ago created the program Clu, to help him build a perfect society, but like the Fallen Angels, Clu had different ideas of perfection than those of Flynn, and he went rogue, trapping Flynn in the Wasteland of the Grid for over 20 years! Then, Sam comes down to the Grid, the Creator's Son, and he is the only one who can help liberate the Grid from Clu's iron grasp. It is an allegorical spiritual battle. Whether you are religious or not, the story can simply be seen as the battle between Good and Evil within us all. Clu was once part of Kevin Flynn, so in essence he is Flynn's manifestation of the Evil within him, and he must overcome it to save the Grid. It is in these points where the movie is most poignant, and it is what makes the movie not just visually stimulating, but stimulating to your mind as well.Regardless to all of this, Tron: Legacy is just also a lot of fun. The action is relentless and heart-pounding, probably owing something to the thumping bass of the soundtrack, produced in techno glory by the group Daft Punk, whose computerized music lends an extra edge to this cybernetic adventure. Jeff Bridges is a powerhouse as both Kevin Flynn and Clu. He exudes a larger than life presence throughout the movie, and he is at times fatherly, menacing, and graceful. Garrett Hedlund is a believable movie hero in the stock tradition of 20-somethings who have a chip on his shoulder to only have that chip brushed off by the end, but it is the supporting cast that steals the show. There is an electrifying performance from actor Michael Sheen as a computer program known as Castor, played almost like a warped circus ring leader, who is as slippery a customer as can come in terms of his motives. Though the character of Flynn's loyal sidekick, Quorra is the best of the entire movie. Olivia Wilde plays Quorra as a hard-hitting program with a fascination for human life and culture, leading to some funny moments due to her quirky personality. But first and foremost, Quorra is a feministic heroine who seems to show no interest in Sam other than sisterly affection, and it is a relief to see a female character not be used as the love interest and be used to kick some butt. To put it simply, she is a character who yearns for the deeper understandings of things greater than her, a Joan of Arc of the Grid.Director Joseph Kosinski has crafted an adventure yarn that is woven with spiritual allegories, allowing one to be entertained, moved, and also stimulated. Tron: Legacy is simply movie magic, a sequel way beyond its predecessor, and adventure up there with some of the best of the genre.I give Tron: Legacy a 10 out of 10!",TRON - Legacy

There he undergoes survival tests on the game of discs and light bikes until he is saved by Quorra, who takes him to where his father is, and thus he discovers the truth about how his father disappeared and also about why in the world virtual is under control and so tries to somehow escape this world and save his father and Quorra, and end the tyranny of CLU.This second movie was very well done visually, with beautiful effects, but it lacks some of the story development and more clear connections to the first movie. Jeff Bridges Back as an Aging Kevin Flynn did well in his role, as did Garret Hedland in the role of Sam and the beautiful Olivia Wilde as Quorra, who demonstrates talent, not just beauty, as an actress.Film reviewed on the 14th to the 15th of June 2021.",TRON - Legacy
105,Mr_Sensitive,Visually Stunning,8,15 May 2011,"Tron: Legacy is the perfect Saturday night movie (at least for me). It is well pace with enough action and visually stunning; though story wise I won't complain much – it wasn't bad that one cannot accept it. For me it was a perfect pop-corn movie that one can sit, relax and enjoy it with one's friends from the beginning to the very end.I haven't seen the original Tron but having seen the trailer I can only imagine it must have come a long way and how much the technology have change. Anyway the movie was a pure entertainment. I almost love every moment of it and there doesn't seem to be quite a dull moment. (Added maybe because the movies I rented for the past months has been more or less disappointing; making this movie to be more favorable.) Story wise it wasn't anything special, two guys got trap in computer world - the world they have created themselves which turn backfire on them, now they must find they way out or being hunt down in the virtual world. The only problem here was the lack of characters development despite the fact that there already few characters. But I'm not gonna complain. This movie also needs to give credit to its cast- it was brilliant - Garrett Hedlund as Sam was surpassing my expectation – he fitted the role too well, Olivia Wilde as Quorra is probably the best thing in the movie – she was not only hot with stylish short hair and skin tight suit but her performance as ISO (you need to watch movie to understand this) was also very good. Jeff Bridges in double role was also great.For the first feature film I must say Joseph Kosinski has done absolutely brilliant job in putting in everything together. The movie is visually stunning, and the CGI was totally awesome – especially making Jeff Bridge look 35 year old and still so believable is marvelous. The $60000 costumes also add to brilliant visual effect. Plus the score by Daft Punk fit the movie too well. Anyway I had a great time watching this movie, and if you do enjoy sci-fi genes then you should definitely check this out. It is one of the good Sci-fi movies out there.Recommendation: Yes! Worth every penny to buy its DVD.Rating:8/10 (Grade: B+)",TRON - Legacy
106,bheadher,"Rather well done, despite a fractured story line...",8,24 March 2016,"What can you say about a spectacular sequel that works...the original Tron was amazing for the time, when CGI was barely learning to crawl. It was new technology, and had its limits, but they pushed those limits to create an amazing adventure. Legacy builds upon those amazing visuals, giving you that necessary feeling of being right there immersed in the action. And there's plenty of action, making you wonder if your computer games are just waiting for you to lose concentration for only a moment and draw you into their world forever.Yet there are disappointments too...with all the stunning visuals there is still something missing. The story itself lacks the impetus to carry the movie on its own, hence the absolute necessity for spectacular CGI. Yes folks, the story is lacking in detail, and at times is rather slow moving. That is the only reason I gave it an 8 rather than a 10.The ending, tho, is a well thought out tribute to the original...if you saw the original, you can't help but be pleased!",TRON - Legacy
107,Java_Joe,Better than I hoped but not as good as I wished.,7,5 December 2019,"I was just a kid when I saw Tron for the first time and it was somewhat instrumental with kickstarting my love of computers. So when I heard they were, finally, coming up with a sequel with Jell Bridges replaying his role I was there. I saw it in IMAX 3D and I learned something else that day. Just like when I saw ""Avatar"", another visually impressive movie, IMAX 3D gives me a migraine so never again.The story focuses however not on Jeff Bridges character of Kevin Flynn, but his son Sam. It's been 20 years that Kevin Flynn disappeared and his tech savvy son has been looking for him. But he gets a message from his father and goes to his old arcade only to discover a secret entrance and gets zapped into the digital world his father created known as ""the Grid"". Now Kevin needs to fight to stay one step ahead of the evil Clu that taken control of the Grid and find his father or be trapped there forever.Whereas the original Tron had a lot of cool visuals, fights and some state of the art, for the time, CGI it's not a deep movie. It's a fun movie and while it hasn't aged all that well, it's still worth a watch. This new movie is a lot deeper delving into some of the lore of the Grid as well as what it actually means to be human. Visually this movie is beautiful and it shows the advancements that CGI has made in the more than 30 years since the original. But it does get bogged down a few times.And it's also a case where it shows de-aging technology is not that good yet. Jeff Bridges plays Kevin Flynn but he also plays Clu. Clu of course looks like Kevin did those 20 years ago after all programs don't age. And for the most part it works at showing a younger Jeff Bridges interacting with his older self. But then, occasionally, the Uncanny Valley kicks in. And just for a moment his face is... unnatural and it destroys the illusion. But a moment later it's fine again although that momentary revulsion still remains.It's a good attempt at a sequel that is marred by some scenes that go on too long and the not quite there de-aging technology.",TRON - Legacy
108,judywalker2,Visually beautiful but ultimately empty,5,20 December 2010,"I have waited a long time for this movie. Yes the first TRON was cheesy if you look at it with today's standards, but it was ground-breaking for it's time. To look inside of the this new box that had been created and to see a world there was what was most ground-breaking. Unfortunately for TRON legacy we have already looked inside the box, at lot, i.e. The Matrix and other such movies. So our expectations for TRON are higher than the imagination of the film makers who now bring us this re- imagined world. First yes it paints really pretty pictures but where is the 3D aspect? I sat there with these really uncomfortable glasses on and wondered what I was suppose to be seeing. They did not bring me into the world as I was told they would. Second the story which is really the biggest problem with this movie. They had a great idea but like all of the movies of 2010 they just didn't seem to be able to built on it. I was bored, it was slow. Now for the acting, Jeff Bridges is wasted and that's because the story was so weak. The battle between he and Clu should have been the centerpiece of the film. Clu's plan could have been more fleshed out. But it was only a passing giant army scene and a sacrifice at the end. Too bad.",TRON - Legacy

111,Offworld_Colony,"After a rather confusing set of backstory, missing links, set ups and prologues, Tron Legacy ricochets us in to the Grid.",7,17 February 2020,"And I have to say it still is one of the best synthesis of directing, photography, editing and effects work I've ever seen. It's just fluid and crystal clear, iconically updating Tron's world and representation of cyber to the new generation. Garrett Hedlund is a likeable protagonist, refreshingly cool and older than the spare of teen heroes at the time. Olivia Wilde is pitch perfect and so is the soundtrack. The action sequences are blistering and the shift to 3D is a stroke of genius even if it's not a patch on home video as it was in the cinema.
Yes it's flawed, some of the story and the references are stale and sometimes a little boring. But I think it's still a product of real technical and design quality and one that could have been much much much worse. As it stands it's an ok rip off of The Matrix and Star Wars. I'm actually pretty sad that a tighter, smarter sequel wasn't given the chance to let the world if the Grid shine. But as technology evolves maybe this franchise will see the light of day when it has something potent and pertinent to say, to match its technical quality.",TRON - Legacy
112,MelbaMan1,Super Wizardry,7,16 April 2018,"Imaginative narrative with super technical wizardry. Succeeds in what it sets out to be. Watch out for Rocky Horror like appearance by Michael Sheen, referring to Sam (Garrett Hedlund) as ""pretty miss""!",TRON - Legacy
113,blackmamba99971,A great sequel after so long,10,22 December 2010,"This is what I was waiting for since the early eighties. Tron, a new world of possibilities where the user Flynn goes back into the computer to create a new utopia with the help of his old friend Clu. A binary program which has the ability to think for itself in order for Flynn to achieve his goal. Yet in the midst of this new creation, Clu starts to feel perfection is the best approach. And in so doing, they come across Iso's a new program life form out of the random bits and bites of information which compiled after so long. Yet Clu still feels they are imperfection, and destroys them all albeit for two who escape. Sam Flynn (Son) goes in and finds his father and together try to stop Clu from taking over the world by shutting everything off which uses computers. This film has every great element of technology, from light bikes to the famous recognizers. Plus the games for which the programs detest. A beautiful landscape of grandiose towers of light, to the gritty out lands for which programs live in that have no further use in the mainframe. This movie is a great addition to one of the most famous films Disney ever put out. Another fact which was most satisfying was to see the old cast with Bruce Boxleitner, and Jeff Bridges of course. This is a marvel of wonderful film making, and also the soundtrack provided by Daft Punk. Without the strange sounds of their music, I don't think Tron Legacy would have been pulled off. An excellent film.",TRON - Legacy
114,drpainters,Some cool 3d but just okay,6,4 April 2021,It's got an interesting story and cool special effects. It's just not an amazing movie or overly fun entertaining movie where you'll want to go back and rewatch it frequently. It's just decent and worth a watch if you're interested but wouldn't go out of the way or rewatch again anytime soon.,TRON - Legacy
115,djfrost-46786,Good movie,6,3 January 2019,Very good movie. It was good in 2010 when I came out. Hard to believe Hollywood struggles today with good movies. This is a sequel of a great movie. This is not a let down.,TRON - Legacy
116,rooee,Virtually lifeless,4,24 December 2010,"After last year's stultifying Terminator Salvation, the phenomenon of extending video game cut scenes to two hours plus continues with a very boring film directed by – guess what – a video game ad director. TRON: Legacy is no game-changer. In fact, the games are still 3D Snake and Pong.For those who remember the original Tron, a faddy Disney sci-fi adventure, unremarkable but for its tubular-neon art design, you may wonder what precisely that film's ""Legacy"" was. Well, keep wondering. Expect further franchise instalments with the suffixes ""Rises"", ""Infinity"", and perhaps ""Makes Our Eyes Bleed"".With its sunken palette, its symmetry, and its Cillian Murphy, it at once, superficially, resembles a Christopher Nolan picture. Bruce Boxleitner (Alan/Tron) even shares Rutger Hauer silver streaks. Daft Punk's score apes Hans Zimmer's doom-laden chugging orchestral signature. Then, once inside the game itself – the world-within-a-world – and the musing begins, it's Inception-lite.For a film whose ultimate message seems to be that the virtual world lacks the essential ingredient of humanity, there's a blinding irony at the centre of it all, insofar as the film provides us with not a single recognisable human being. One can defend Clu's (a virtually youthified Jeff Bridges) strange unmoving mouth and dead eyes on the grounds that he's essentially an avatar (I think that's what I garnered, anyhow). Yet why is everyone around him so lifeless – most of all the ""User"" (Garrett Hedlund) himself? And then there's poor Quorra. All innocence and diamond dust eyes; after being touched only in mind by Bridges' avuncular Zen-priest Kevin Flynn, she's no idea what randy young buck Flynn Jr has got in store for her in the real, corporeal, corporate world. She'll be logging onto World of Warcraft in no time in a bid to escape.Michael Sheen jumps on board to play an aggressively homosexual nightclub proprietor named Zuse (see what they did there?), and provides the film's most, or possibly only, interesting scene. This sequence in particular seemed to owe a lot to Bioware's seminal RPG Mass Effect, even down to the way the figures are arranged in the frame. Ironically, that game possesses greater depth of character and insight, and more excitement, than anything on offer during Legacy's 2+ hours.On the plus side, the electronic elements of Daft Punk's score have merit – although by that token you could just watch their video for ""Around the World"" on YouTube 30-odd times instead. And if this movie can turn the ever-lovable Bridges into the world's biggest sexagenarian star, then perhaps it's worth it. Once.",TRON - Legacy
117,xamtaro,Long live this legacy,9,14 January 2011,"In 1982, ""Tron"" gave the world a vision of a world unlike any other. A world within a computer where programs exist as actual living beings who race along freeway style circuits. A world that defied human imagination and piqued the obsession of Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges), computer programmer extraordinaire. In an opening narration, Flynn who is now the head of the ENCOM company tells of his adventures in the original Tron movie and his motivations for using the computer world which he calls ""the Grid"" to benefit mankind.With this little bit of exposition, barely sufficient to bring newcomers to the Tron franchise ""up to speed"", Kevin Flynn suddenly disappears one day, leaving his son, Sam, who grows into a rebellious young man. Sure he is the major shareholder of ENCOM, but he'd rather play cyber pranks on the greedy ENCOM CEO and outrun the Cops on his bike than sit in board meetings. He is a punk slacker in every way, and smart mouthed to boot, living each day with no discernible purpose until he is approached by his father's long time friend over a mysterious ""page"" from his father's old office in an arcade. Yes a ""page"", from a pager. OLD school tech. Sam discovers a supercomputer but an accident lands him mysteriously transported into the Grid which is ruled over by the tyrannical (and equally smart mouthed) ""Clu"" who bears a striking resemblance to Sam's father. NOW the movie begins in earnest with Sam fighting his way through gladiatorial combat, making a daring escape during a ""lightcycle"" death race and meeting new allies while searching for his father. Hidden secrets will be revealed and expect some surprising twists in this otherworldly digital domain of peril and adventure!And what a world it is! Carrying on the legacy of its predecessor, Tron Legacy once again presents imaginative production design coupled with cutting edge computer imaging. It is worth watching purely for its visuals, 3D or otherwise. Newcomer director Joseph Kosinski peppers his action with wide angles and sweeping cinematography, a fresh feel indeed from the frequent close-ups and ""shakey cam"" used by his other more ""experienced"" compatriots. Breathing life into the Grid is the similarly surreal soundtrack by ""Daft Punk"". It is mixture of electronic and orchestral music that serves to highlight the ""synthetic"" aspect of the Grid world while paying homage to the electronic synthesizer tunes used in the original Tron movie. The masterfully composed score blends eerie with Epic in the action scenes while toning down into warmer traditional tunes in the more emotional scenes. Like the directing style, the electronic soundtrack is a welcome change from the typical percussion and bass heavy action movie music. Without putting up spoilers, one has to admit that the story works on multiple levels for both newcomers and sci/fi fanatics alike. For example When Sam first enters the Grid, it is one big tribute to classic spaceman stories like Flash Gordon. (Stranger lands on a strange world ruled by a tyrant, he is captured, made to fight as a gladiator, breaks out and joins the resistance). It might be a tad hard to follow at first as many concepts might be lost on viewers without some smidgen of tech savvy-ness or those not quick enough to get the little narrative homages. A lot happens in little time but once things slow down near the middle, the story has room to breathe. Under all the light and flashy spectacle is a very down to earth father/son tale that anyone can relate to. Between the lines lies an almost biblical parable relating to mankind's rejection of God in his quest for his own perfect Godhood. Present too is a running theme about how well intentioned legacies left to the wrong people become corrupted by those it was left to. Rather complex for a Disney movie to incorporate such themes.One little byte to pick with this film would be the acting. Jeff Bridges reprises his role as Kevin Flynn as well as the villain program Clu and does a wonderful job of just becoming his character. He excludes a charisma and charm that his son, Sam, seems to lack. It is very ironic that the digital characters like Olivia Wilde's Quorra and Michael Sheen's Castor seem so much more ""alive"" and real than Garret Headlund's snarky Sam.Needless to say, Tron: Legacy is epic storytelling that challenges the boundaries of imagination. It is a fun and exciting ride with a satisfactory emotional center. The more learned viewers would be happy to dig into the underlying themes that can be easily related somewhat to ontology and even biblical theology, while the the rest of you can just sit back and enjoy the visual spectacle and human father/son drama. Unlike stuff like Inception or the Matrix, tron Legacy does not force feed you the complex stuff, thus making it very accessible to viewers of all ages.With an animated series in the works (as of writing this review) here's hoping that the legacy of the Tron lives long for ages to come and goes from being just a Cult classic to a full fledged sci/fi epic franchise.",TRON - Legacy

119,MCMAYNERBERRY,An extraordinary adventure full of great action and flashy visuals.,10,17 May 2012,"When someone you know declares that they didn't like Tron: Legacy, be sure to gouge why. If it's because of the story, it's wrong. The main problem of the script is how the dialogue is conveyed. Other than that, this is a faultless film.The story involves Kevin Flynn's son Sam, played by Garrett Hedlund, struggling to cope with his father being missing for over 20 years. When his father's friend Alan, portrayed by returning actor Bruce Boxleitner, informs Sam he had received a page from his father, he goes to investigate and discover inadvertently the world of the Grid.Hedlund does a good job of playing the character and the character itself is a likable one. Sam is forced to partake in a series of games, reminiscent of the original, involving the disc wars and light cycle races. These particular scenes really shown the amazing work put into developing the visual aspects of this world.During the games, he meets the female program Quorra, played by Olivia Wilde. The character is also very likable and is portrayed with the appropriate aggressiveness needed to survive in the Grid and naive innocence when knowledge of the real world is mentioned. It's evident from the get-go she is to serve as a romantic affiliation for Sam, but the filmmakers didn't explore it severely, seeing as they have only known each other inbetween an 8 hour span, so that's a bonus as we get to see it explored in the sequel.Father and son are soon reunited and we are treated to a great performance from Jeff Bridges, who manages to remind us of his Lebowski days. Bridges pulls double duty as Kevin Flynn and his villainous counterpart Clu. The visuals on it to age Bridges back to his 30's are noticeable, but in a world where a lot of the elements are digital, you are bound to notice this.All in all, the film was fantastic, with Bridges, Hedlund and Wilde really falling into character and also from a spectacular performance from Michael Sheen as the radical Castor. The visuals are astonishing and the score from Daft Punk fits the atmosphere impeccably. The dialogue is at times faulty, but in fairness that's not the biggest issue in the world. Tron: Legacy 10/10",TRON - Legacy
120,W011y4m5,Art.,10,17 July 2019,"TRON: Legacy is a literal misunderstood masterpiece & is one of the most intellectual, deepest science-fiction movies I've seen Disney produce - EVER! Let me explain:
Immediately, CLU has strong, deliberate similarities with Hitler - they both wanted to create ""the perfect system"" & viewed those in their society who were similar to themselves as superior, where individuals are only deemed valuable if they can be used to further implement & reassert the oppressive structures in place.In TRON, any program deemed useless or unfit for work is sent into ""the games"", where they're to be slaughtered for the amusement of less ""disposable"" citizens - disabled / programs unable to be ""rectified"" are lesser & have no place in this system CLU has created. It's as if those who cannot contribute, may rebel or show resistance cannot be allowed to exist & so only the obedient, functioning rectified ones remain.This is a symbolic representation of a fascist regime where those ruled under it are controlled by fear & intimidation - ""rectified"" programs are representative depictions of people who are brainwashed by a system & further explains why those who can't be are sent to their deaths. Any imperfection is prohibited & made an example of - uniformity is essential & total, unquestioning loyalty to the cause is expected. Again, noticeable connotations are made in order to reflect Nazi Germany; CLU commits genocide by wiping out the ISOs who represent / relate to the Jewish population within 'Legacy' & there's a resonant message of defiance throughout the film.It's also a metaphor for mental health - with CLU depicting the worst of humanity & what it's capable of when a mind is corrupted by power & greed, embodying the darkest side of ourselves. Additionally, on the opposite side, Kevin Flynn is in a state of depression when we first meet him again in the movie - he's been battling his demons & has given up, justifying his lack of action by saying ""the only way to win the game is by not playing"" but Sam Flynn challenges his problematic ideological attitude & his son visually journeys into the mind of his father (who hasn't been there for him throughout his childhood because he's lost himself inside his own head) in order to regain a relationship he missed out on as he was growing up in order to save him, battling his demons alongside him so he can bring him back out into the real world, teaching him that by resigning himself to what he deemed as inevitable, he only allowed the darkness inside the Grid (a metaphor for his mind) to grow & spread like cancer. These two themes intertwine when Sam goes against his father's wishes by fighting - sparking what would grow to become genuine character progression of Kevin.Sam meets other members of the resistance & begins to fight back & only when his life is in danger does Kevin realise that not only do his inner demons pose a risk to himself, but those he loves & others around him, so his supposedly harmless inaction is shown to have consequences, forcing his hand & beginning his journey of recovery. Hence - linking back to politics - it also signifies that the only way for a fascist state to thrive is when good people do nothing - they are complicit in the actions of CLU by allowing him to continue without resistance. Fascist states are vulnerable & fragile & when people rise up against them, they crumble. Hence, it reaffirms this point when CLU's plan is immediately jeopardized once people act.As Kevin & Sam battle corrupted programs & CLU, they head towards their escape - a light that shines brightly through the darkness at the end of a tunnel (another metaphor for depression). It's at this point when Kevin realises that the only way to save his son is by confronting his fears, face to face, coming to terms with who he is & what he's capable of, what kind of person he has the potential to be & makes a choice to embrace the light again instead of resigning himself to the darkness. He sees the danger he poses to those he loves if his darker self isn't stopped & so sacrifices himself, visually embracing his darker side (coming to terms with it) & overwhelming it with light in the ultimate show of love towards the child he never got to see grow up. By doing this, we're led to assume that he dies but he neutralises the threat & redeems himself in the eyes of his son. It's a total act of redemption; a father battling his depression & being trapped inside a prison of his own making for years - how those suffering are able to win if they accept help & don't fight the battles they have to face alone when there are those willing to support surrounding them.Kevin Flynn starts the story as powerless & concludes as powerful. It's about family & incorporates socio-political themes brilliantly. Even more genius, CLU didn't understand humanity & that's poetically what saves it - he was unable to understand that there is no such thing as ""perfection""; it's subjective & thus his system is ironic due to the basic flaw in what is supposed to be perfect. It shows how easy it is to topple such a regime once that flaw is exposed; it's a weakness - not a strength - & individuality is what makes a society strong; CLU's misguided idea about this ultimately leads to his demise. He doesn't understand because he's made himself into less of a reflection of humanity than intended, so can't foresee what his opponent Kevin will do for love as love isn't a concept he considers or acknowledges due to his lack of humanity. He's absolved himself of any trace of it in order to become ""perfect"" but it's a pathetic fallacy.The darkest side of humanity acts upon irrational thoughts, sometimes selfish or cowardly & sometimes from an unintentional misinterpretation of unclear information. Once we look at things from an objective point of view, we see the cracks in the logic & only upon self reflection can we change ourselves for the better. We're reminded of that here.Not to mention, it's worth noting the beautiful direction from Joseph Kosinski (unbelievably, his first ever feature film!?) - who does an astounding job of crafting such a subtextually rich tale - & appreciating the faultless, sleek, stylised visuals - honestly, jaw-droppingly GORGEOUS & effective cinematography from Claudio Miranda - who leaves you in awe of the aesthetic & his meticulous use of light while watching & visually, it's undeniably one of the most iconic, inventive & distinctive movies I've ever seen with groundbreaking visual effects, world building that's phenomenally immersive from the moment you step foot within it - with masterful, artistic hair & make-up, sound & costume design & additionally, production design - as well as the electrifying score by musical legends Daft Punk who craft one of the best soundtracks for any movie in history... TRON: Legacy was a gift to all who've been longing for an original sci-fi franchise & most of y'all slept on it. It's an utter travesty.",TRON - Legacy
121,jamiedarlow-37510,A breath of fresh air!,7,26 March 2020,"In this sequel to the 1982 original, Jeff Bridges reprise his role as Kevin Flynn, a man who has disappeared into a virtual world. His son Sam (Garrett Hedlund) goes searching for him and finds himself in that exact world and fighting his way to find Kevin. I remember this was met with very lukewarm reception at its release and I don't think it will reach cult classic status as it's predecessor has but I had a great time at the cinema watching this and still think it holds up fine! Bridges is brilliant as always and gets to say 'Radical, man' which reminded me so much of the Dude! Perhaps the stand out appearance is by Michael Sheen as a person named Castor; I loved every second he was on screen channeling David Bowie through his eccentric performance and what a great costume! Certain standout scenes such as the club scene involving Sheen and amazing music and the Disc Wars sequence showcasing awesome action and camera movements make the film worth watching alone. Considering it's director Joseph Kosinski's directorial debut, it's not half bad. The visual effects are totally immersive and create its very unique world brilliantly accompanied by a stunning and seriously funky score by Daft Punk! It may lose its momentum towards the end and its novelty wears off as the duration time wears thin but nevertheless its worth seeing for these aspects",TRON - Legacy
122,dvc5159,"A dazzling and spectacular special effects extravaganza, despite its flaws.",6,16 December 2010,"Right off the bat I'm going to say that I didn't see the first film. Obviously I've heard from a lot of people saying that they need to see the first film before watching this one, seeing as this is a direct sequel to a nearly 30 year old cult sci-fi film. But, seeing that I didn't have time, I decided to watch the sequel anyway.Now keep in mind that Disney took a HUGE risk in making a sequel to a movie that is not very often talked about when it comes to movies as opposed to many blockbusters today. The first TRON had no famous franchise to speak of (apart from the real games inspired by it). Adding to the danger is the film's budget - reportedly between US$ 200 - 300 million. With that kind of money you'll wonder what exactly was Disney hoping for with this film.Nevermind the fact that the story is a bit unfocused and could be rounded up in a more polished way. Nevermind too that the fantastic world and great ideas aren't expanded upon some more, as well as the fact that the script could use a little bit more originality.Also, not forgetting some good (in Jeff Bridges' case, great as always as he plays two very different characters with perfect emotional resonance - proving that he still has the chops to carry a big movie) performances by the cast - with Garrett Hedlund showing great leading man potential and Olivia Wilde looking great and cute to boot. Michael Sheen, Beau Garrett and Bruce Boxleitner (apparently returning to his role from the first film, so it seems) all give good support.No sir-ee, what you pay for - and what you get in spades - are the special/visual effects. Goodness me, this is quite possibly the best special effects I've seen all year, and that's saying something. I have to admit though, the CGI that makes Jeff Bridges young look jarring, but that is overshadowed by the compelling, groundbreaking special/visual effects that really bring you into the cybernetic world. Who doesn't want to take a ride on one of those fantastic, futuristic vehicles? Who doesn't want those awesome light-cycles or one of those dueling/data discs? It is possible that, like ""Avatar"" a year ago, this film can be a game-changer for special/visual effects alone.It's a real treat for the eyes, and it's even better in 3D which is splendidly used to flesh out the dimensions and graphics of the cyber world bring you even deeper into the world instead of things merely flying out to you and post-production conversion like in SO many 3D movies (Note that in the 3D version, there's a disclaimer before the film starts, saying that parts of the film are filmed in both natural 2D and 3D as they way they should be. Just so you know, this shows that the filmmakers care for what they want to give you).Very ambitious architect-and-designer-turned-first-time-filmmaker Joseph Kosinski hit a home run with this film, crafting an extraordinary and spellbinding world of escapism that looks slick, stylish and extremely cool to watch. Kosinski and the production team fill the cyber world with heaps of imagination and the result is what you see on screen. And here I thought Hollywood would recycle certain design patterns (plot patterns still need work though). Kosinski is a truly visionary filmmaker that one really has to keep an eye on.The production design is on par with the special effects, it is nothing short of spectacular and perfect. The cinematography which is big and wide and best of all NOT shaky allows you to savor every moment of SFX goodness. The superb sound effects serve to complement the visuals and the electronic world, and all for the better. Daft Punk's varying but atmospheric electronic/orchestral score all but suits the film's mood perfectly with its techno beats and soaring string during moments.Overall, this is perhaps a fine way to end the blockbuster season of 2010, and this is a definite must watch for all looking for an escape. The special effects alone are worth the price of TWO movie tickets, and with that I say, give this one a try, even if you haven't seen the first one. It aims to entertain and to dazzle the audience, and it succeeds brilliantly. Excuse me while I rent the first one now.Overall rating: 75/100",TRON - Legacy
123,GeorgeRoots,Tron Becomes More Cyber Punk Than Retro.,7,18 September 2014,"Considering we live in a time where nothing is sacred when it comes to rebooting franchises almost 30 years later, it sadly seemed ""Tron"" (1982) was also inevitable. ""Tron Legacy"" was first advertised in 2008, featuring a visually impressive take on the grid and those famous light cycles. Does the feature live up to the standards the classic ""Tron"" set? And will it remain just as timeless?Acting is always solid from Jeff Bridges, or should I say ""double"" Bridges. The youthful look of Bridges's face looks awkward when first displayed, but when they arrive on the grid it looks very impressive. A good job from Garrett Hedlund & Olivia Wilde are also provided, but Michael Sheen's ""Ziggy Stardust"" like character was annoying and obvious when it came to obvious character motivations.The storyline was OK. The ""Tron"" franchise is pretty much built upon gimmick's and cliché's from both video games and movies (In a good way). But if you really dig into this you'll find themes of corruption, dictatorship etc. Even the awkward romance that they force strangely works in the movies favour. The soundtrack work was fantastic. Daft Punk know there techno and it's hard not to get totally absorbed in superb fight scenes with the song ""DEREZZED"" blowing in your ears. Their cameo was pretty funny as well.Final Verdict: Everything I love about the first ""Tron"" was mostly in this movie. The 3-D was surprisingly effective, a visually stunning looking grid and overall a great re-imagining of the ""technological"" look of the series. Definitely worth seeing. 7/10.",TRON - Legacy
124,Meven_Stoffat,"You're right, this isn't the TRON you grew up with.",10,23 January 2011,"Expectation is a funny thing. For every movie, there's different expectations. And disappointment with a movie is nothing new, as a matter of fact, those who regularly watch movies or have read movie critics would know that every critic's expectations are quite contrary to the that of the audience.In fact, those who haven't seen this movie yet, if you plan on re-living your childhood/memories of seeing the original TRON back when it came out/etc., I suggest you just watch the first TRON again. This is the new TRON. It'd dark, it's gritty, it's sexy, it's the new take on the TRON series, with a new focus, sleek and more refined visuals, and a score by Daft Punk to seal the deal that pays tribute to the original as well as with a John Carpenter influence.TRON: Legacy takes place 28 years after the original. Kevin Flynn has disappeared in 1989 after a big announcement, leaving behind a son, Sam Flynn. Cut to present day, Sam is 27 and a skilled computer hacker. After an incident, he is given the keys to the arcade, and he goes there, only to discover the computer that contains The Grid. Of course, he is transported into The Grid and is given the same task that his dad was 28 years ago- survive. That's right- light cycle, disc wars, survive it all. Except he is saved by the sexy Quorra, and is taken to where he meets his father for the first time since 1989.However, things aren't as basic as it seems. Running the Grid is CLU, the program that Flynn created, and became corrupt. This leads to the conclusion that the only things that can be done are: Terminate CLU and stop his army of programs, and get his dad out of the grid.So like the original TRON, you will either love this movie, or hate it. TRON always has been an acquired taste and TRON Legacy is no different in that aspect. I always loved the Original TRON and so I went in and threw my expectations at the door, and as a result, loved this wicked ride.This movie is glossy and pretty looking. But it is also rough, cold, gritty and broken. For every moment of brilliance, there's a moment where the viewer feels the frustration of a character, the emotion of a character, etc. The viewer is put inside the difficult mind of Sam Flynn, and that's what makes TRON: Legacy brilliant. Aside from that, great acting from Garrett Hedlund, Jeff Bridges, and a show-stealing performance from my favourite actor, James Frain as Jarvis, the right hand man of CLU. Add to that, a great performance from the sexy Olivia Wilde, who manages to mesmerize the viewer with not just her attractiveness but her real classy attitude and motivated performance.The score by Daft Punk is brilliant too. Daft Punk's music has always been blockbuster in a way- their music has always had an epic feel of a James Cameron sci-fi epic, and their score is no different. It is a nice tribute to the eighties- John Carpenter would be proud. We have the classic Carpenter-esque synth, the epic Hans Zimmer feel, and overall, it is pure ear candy and perfection.The 3D is also another great touch. I love how the 3D only kicks in once we enter the Grid. It gives the movie a real human touch and as a result, the movie is more fun to watch. Avatar opened the door, TRON: Legacy tears the door down and the whole wall with it.Overall, TRON: Legacy is an overlooked masterpiece. It will not please everyone. But people will see this movie for the classic it will be one day. As for me, I know I think it's a masterpiece, and would recommend seeing it for sure.",TRON - Legacy
125,come2whereimfrom,All show no fun.,5,8 February 2011,"In an emperors new clothes style the latest trick from Disney was waiting so long between the first Tron film and Legacy that everyone actually believed that a new Tron film was exactly what they needed, turns out with hindsight that we really didn't need it at all. For all the whistles and bells, cool French dance duo soundtrack, old Jeff Bridges, young Jeff Bridges, light cycles, architecture, colour coded costumes and of course three whole dimensions, Tron's biggest crime is that it's just boring. It's over long and has no story and within that two of the most gaping plot holes in recent film memory. Firstly how the character Tron spends the majority of the film as a bad guy before doing a complete flip and suddenly becoming good with absolutely no reason whatsoever and secondly how old Jeff becomes a supreme being in the computer world at the end and sorts everything out, if only he'd done that two hours earlier we could of saved ourselves a lot of time and we wouldn't have had to sit through the bizarrely embarrassing scenes with Michael Sheen as a dandy Bowie figure who dances round seemingly unaware that he's staring in a bit stolen from the Matrix (not to mention the bits borrowed from Star Wars and Bladerunner). The heir to Sam 'The Blank' Worthington's acting throne is Garrett Hedlund as Sam, a central character that at no point is phased by being in a computer game except to exclaim 'whoa' every now and then like a Bill and Ted in a glowing leotard. Olivia Wilde as Quorra provides some much needed eye candy but her preposterous storyline of leaving the computer and entering the real world has set Disney up for a 'Splash' type sequel where she struggles to cope with everyday shenanigans. I actually went into Tron with low expectations and after I'd recovered from the sheer boredom I was still pretty disappointed, I guess that I just expect more from estimated $300 million films these days, silly me.",TRON - Legacy
126,troyputland,"Aesthetically pleasing on the outside, hollow on the inside.",6,4 April 2015,"With Tron: Legacy looking gorgeous and Daft Punk providing an excellent soundtrack, what more could you ask for? Quite a bit actually. This remake has the guts of a mighty blockbuster, but that's all a facade, as it lacks emotional connection and raw power. Beautiful on the outside and tasteless on the inside. Legacy will appease the fans of the original and gains a few more with its unique look. A completely new story has been created that does little to offend the 1982 version. The story is most interesting and pleasurable when Sam (Hedlund) discovers his father's digital world. Feelings of wonder and excitement gather. The games he's forced in to are energetic and hold no bars. T:L takes a backwards turn when Sam meets Clu (Bridges) and his father (also Bridges). The younger, AI copy of Bridges looks computer generated, but it does match the world they're in. Olivia Wilde's digital-born Quorra brings life to a regimented world. Bridges, on the other hand, struggles to live up to Legacy's looks.Check out more of my reviews on http://straighttelling.co.uk",TRON - Legacy
127,Eternality,"If your diet consists of mainly (or only) blockbusters, this is definitely a good one to spend some money on.",8,23 December 2010,"TRON: Legacy finds its way into our theaters at the end of the year without the usual fanfare and sky-high anticipation normally reserved for blockbusters of this sort. Does anyone still remember the original TRON (1982), the cult sci-fi action that features now what seems like prehistoric visual effects about a computer hacker who becomes trapped in the computer world and forced to participate in gladiatorial games? Well, TRON: Legacy is the sequel (mind you, it is not a remake) to that film.Jeff Bridges reprises the role of Kevin Flynn who is now trapped in the digital world he once created and tried to perfect. His son, Sam (Garrett Hedlund) has to get him out, and defeat their nemesis Clu (played by a younger Bridges), an alter ego of Kevin, before Clu escapes out into the organic world to wreak havoc. It is not surprising that the film's simplistic storyline about good versus evil, and the superficial treatment of the father-son relationship would lead to its downfall.Somewhat a fanboy throwback to the days of Star Wars in the late 70s and early 80s, TRON: Legacy's screenplay however lacks the emotional poignancy of George Lucas' epic space opera. Worse, the dialogue in TRON: Legacy is so badly-written that it makes Lucas' one seems Shakespearean in comparison. The acting is uniformly appalling, except for Bridges' relatively strong performance as Kevin. The lead actor Hedlund delivers one of the flattest performances for a blockbuster in recent years (even Shia LaBeouf in the Transformers (2007, 2009) series performed better).Thankfully, there are redeeming qualities to Kosinski's film that reduce the effect of the poorly-scripted, wafer-thin screenplay, of which I will discuss two of the most important ones: the film's visual effects, and Daft Punk's original score. First, it wouldn't be a stretch to proclaim that TRON: Legacy has a very outstanding chance of winning the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, with its only real competitor being Christopher Nolan's Inception (2010). Featuring groundbreaking effects in digital imagery, Kosinski's talent for creating a world so conceptually stunning that it is hard not to be immersed by its visuals.One of the best action sequences in the film pits two opposing sides in a ""survival of the fittest"" race involving a number of digital humans called programs on super-cool hyperbikes. The excitement gained from watching these action set-pieces would not have been felt without Kosinski's creative energies put into it and some masterful film editing on show. While sometimes it can get quite wearisome looking at an artificial environment for long, the film's engaging visual effects do not appear to have such an effect on the viewer.Daft Punk's electronica score is without a doubt the best aspect of TRON: Legacy. Somewhat atmospherically inspired from Hans Zimmer's Inception, the music utilizes a sonic blend of synthesizer sounds, orchestra work, and strong rhythms. The score is a very integral aural accompaniment to the film's CG-visuals, marking the return of this genre of soundtrack so popular in the 1980s with Vangelis' supreme work for Chariots of Fire (1981), and Blade Runner (1982), and Brad Fiedel's memorable theme for The Terminator (1984). It is likely that Daft Punk would challenge Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (who did the electronic scoring for The Social Network (2010)) for an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score.In a nutshell, TRON: Legacy exceeds my expectations but it is not a must-watch film. But if your diet consists of mainly (or only) blockbusters, this is definitely a good one to spend some money on.GRADE: B (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",TRON - Legacy

130,MovieCriticMarvelfan,Good sequel,8,20 December 2010,"Good sequel to the original Tron. I got goose bumps when I watched this in the theater. It's been a long time coming but finally a sequel was done.Tron Legacy is a visually sound movie experience. The 200 million dollar budget over the movie definitely shows on screen. The incredible musical score by Daft Punk fits the film PERFECTLY and it definitely felt like this was taken right after the original TRON.Story: Kevin Flynn, the hero from the original movie, took over Encom but then mysteriously vanished. Sam's gets an s.o. s from Flynn's old arcade house. He gets there then he gets thrown back into the digital world of Tron (just like Flynn did in the original movie) . Sam has to fight in the games of the grid like his father did all the while trying to get to his father, so the two can find a way out of the grid. Kevin it turns out was betrayed by his program, Clu, who has decided to take over the whole grid killing any programs and anomalies that threaten him.I read a couple of the critiques about the film with regards to the story, and the critics do have some points. The story is pretty simple, and could have been reworked a bit more to take full advantage of all the elements from the original movie including the actual character of Tron/ Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) whose inexplicably reduced to a minor role. However, with that said, the writers didn't lose sight of the main character of Kevin Flynn who was the main character of the original movie, and do expand on the story from the original.Jeff Bridges hasn't played the role in more than twenty eight years, but as the great actor he is, easily starts out where he left in the original and takes the character into another direction. Kevin Flynn is now older and as such is a wiser, darker, more mysterious character, not the same naive, innocent guy he was in the first movie.Joseph Kosinki's directorial style is good. He throws a lot of references to the movie and uses a couple of comedy bits, but the movie for the most part has a dark and futuristic look that gives fans a good feel of where exactly the Tron universe has evolved too since the last movie.The movie is definitely a visual spectacle for the eyes. Everything has been upgraded from the original, and you definitely do get the realism like the original that this guy has been sucked into the movie. The light cycles have been upgraded, and you see programs disassembled and destroyed In more graphic fashion than in the original movie. We also get the cool hand to hand disc battles that were in the original with the exception now that the fights borrow a lot from motion style of fighting. There are added new gadgets like the light jets and light cars.There's also besides the visual feats as mentioned an incredible music score by French musicians Daft Punk (who have a small cameo in the movie as a couple of digital Dj's). Daft Punk's score is definitely another element that really made the movie quite an experience.The performances in the movie are good. As talked about Jeff Bridges as Kevin Flynn has grown from the original movie. He's no longer the that naive hacker with a love for computers, now he's older and seen his great creation once again perverted again. Garrett Hedlund as Sam Flynn does his role well as the estranged son here. Olivia Wilde as his would be love interest is also pretty good.Tron Legacy is a good sequel that definitely lives up the hype surrounding it. Studios gave the director a might big budget and it's taking advantage of it. It's true the script and story could have been better but as far as what happens to the main character of Kevin Flynn, they did answer a lot of questions that we had questions since the first movie. If there are plans for further entries in the franchise then they must include a deeper story that takes more advantage of the characters from the original including Tron .As far as this movie goes, they got right what they were supposed to do which is get news fans interested in the franchise, and get older dedicated fans of the original something to look back on. Hopefully, there will be further entries in the franchise.",TRON - Legacy
131,Ryan_MYeah,"It has it's flaws, but it's still a visually dazzling adventure. Daft Punk fans, prepare to be amazed.",8,1 January 2011,"Please note that this may be a sort of love/hate movie. Those who were fans of the original 1982 cult classic will find their experience to be hot-blooded and radiantly nostalgic, while those who weren't may find the experience to be cold and distant. I never was a HUGE fan of the original, but I rather enjoyed this movie.Garret Hedlund stars as Sam Flynn, a tech-savvy 27 year old who receives word of his missing father, Kevin Flynn (Played by Jeff Bridges), and investigates, but ends up in the world of Kevin's creation, the Grid. He's seen as an unwelcome guest by the program designed in Kevin's image, CLU, the ultimate perfectionist glitch. But Sam eventually finds his father, and with the help of him, and his loyal aide Quorra (Played with fierce nonchalance by Olivia Wilde), they must get Sam back to the real world, and prevent CLU from taking it over.To say that TRON: Legacy is without faults would be untrue. The screenplay is where most of those problems lie, since the film presents a few flaws in logic, lines of cheesy dialogue, and doesn't give the father/son relationship the full attention it deserves. To be honest, the film's first half is quite thoroughly entertaining, and fast paced, but the film's third quarter stumbles a little, and I also felt it kinda dragged, but luckily it gets back in firm position for the third act. And while I admire the efforts of the actors, I did notice that I didn't warm up to a few of them like I really wanted to.Still, I don't think it's a bad movie, it has plenty of things that keep it on it's toes. One of which is the action, and there's plenty of it, from daring disc fights, to fast and dazzling light cycle and jet chases, which are especially hair raising in 3D. It also boasts impressive production design, costumes, makeup, sound design, and ESPECIALLY great special effects. The film doesn't lose sight of the key elements that made the grid so special, but it improves upon the original film's dated ""8-bit"" look, with a sleek, fluid, and luminously thrilling ""XBOX"" format. Eric Barba and his team from Digital Domain have created a world that would even make Avatar jealous, and they deserve to win this year's Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. End of discussion.But the one element everyone wants to know about more than anything is the score by Daft Punk. Fans, you may rejoice, Thomas and Guy-Manuel have done it again. Taking their usual electronica flair, and meshing it with an epic traditional orchestra, they've created one of the year's very best original scores, an innovative symphony of strings and crackles. Die hard fans MAY find the Hans Zimmer style arrangements to be a bit of an odd fit, but it's a brilliant new inclusion to their already legendary library of music. They even get their own little cameo.I have my complaints, but I think TRON: Legacy has plenty of reasons for it's flaws to be overlooked.I give it *** out of ****",TRON - Legacy
132,bazmitch23,"Not as good as the first film, but I enjoyed it",8,28 January 2014,"It's not as strong as the first film, but the effects are a lot better and the costumes are a lot tighter.Every effect look amazing (except for the CGI Jeff Bridges). Everything is so realistic and shiny. Why did this film not get an Oscar nom for best VFX? Daft Punk's music is also incredible. It's very Hans Zimmer (who I think lent them a helping hand with this film). There are many references to the first film such as lines and incidents. And I can go on forever about how sexy Olivia Wilde is. And what about the scene where Sam meets the four women in skin tight outfits? For a PG rated Disney film, there are many shots of them from behind.There's a lot of great action scenes such as the Games scene and the dogfight at the end.The sets look incredible. Unlike the original where everything was shot in front of a black screen and CGI sets where added in later, actual sets where made. Also, it's easier to tell who's who this time. The biggest problem with the first movie for me was that all the characters looked the same so it was hard to tell who was who.Also, instead of adding in lights on the characters' costumes this time, the costumes in this had light built into their costumes which was easier for the filmmakers. Whereas the original, adding the lights in the characters went through some trouble in post. Also the lights on the costumes in the first film hurt your eyes, so it was not for epileptic people. The lights in this film, no problem at all. Now, the things I hate about this film. The dialogue is naff (the dialogue in the first film wasn't that great either), the whole thing about the ISO's is never fully explained, it's not as strong as the first film, I didn't buy the romance between Sam and Quorra (it's just another clichéd romance that's there for no reason) and of course the CGI Jeff Bridges. He looks too much like a character from a PS3 game.I had a lot of fun with Tron: Legacy and it is a love letter to the first one. Plus it looks amazing in HD.",TRON - Legacy

I always thought that it was interesting and at the same time amazing and somewhat distracting for it's production values. The 3D world was great, but it was also kind of goofy. I own it on DVD and watch it maybe once in 5 years.I didn't expect much of this new version, I didn't even look into it that much beforehand. Maybe I was put off by a lot of dumbed down remakes that have came out lately. Luckily this is everything but, it's a great combination of the old Tron, modern technology and great inspired film making like we used to see in the Star Wars days. It actually has a lot of Star Wars vibe to it.Great soundtrack, good acting, interesting story. VERY nice to look at. I was surprised, more movies like this please. At the same time it feels original, yet nods to the original.Edit. Watched this for the second time and it was just as good as I remembered. Love the soundtrack and visuals. The story itself felt a bit thin, but it doesn't really matter. I actually liked the fact that it's quite light. More emphasis on characters and father & son relationship than the Clu plot, grid vs. real world. It's not overly technical either, doesn't try to be 100 % accurate and believable, still giving enough connections to real world to be interesting. Nice balanced. Acting is top notch.",TRON - Legacy
134,basrutten,Almost thirty years and they have learned nothing,5,28 January 2011,"About thirty years ago, a movie came out named Tron, which had revolutionary (for the time) special effects but failed in nearly every other aspect.Nearly thirty years after this Disney has finally produced a sequel to its cult hit, but sadly have learned nothing about making a good movie. Once again, the special effects are pretty revolutionary, but the other aspects are probably even weaker than in the original.To get the obligatory praise out of the way: yes, this is a very pretty movie to look at, and Daft Punk (which I normally don't care about) did a very good job with the soundtrack. It's also greatto see a 3D movie in which the 3D effects were actually nicely done and didn't give me a headache.That being said, the rest of the movie DID give me a headache. ""Tron Legacy"" is a sad example of dumbed down generic PG-13 stuff for the masses.It starts with the story. First of all, it has next to nothing to do with being stuck inside a computer or virtual world. The only difference between humans and the programs in Tron Legacy is that they don't bleed but fall apart into pixels. Everything else is just a generic dystopian future that borrows (read ""steals"") heavily from better movies like The Matrix and Star Wars (including Jeff Bridges playing Obi Dude Kenobi) On top of that, the movie takes itself far too serious and is full of supposedly deep and meaningful talk about Relevant Themes. Which is fine by itself, except that the dialogs and the acting are so dramatically poor that it all devolves into a steaming pile of dung that alternates between unintentionally funny and yawn-inducingly boring. Especially the middle part just drags on and on and on.The number of intentional jokes, on the other hand, can be counted on one hand. They seem to try really hard to be funny on a number of occasions, but nearly every attempt at humor falls totally flat, and there is not nearly enough of it.This movie could have been nice as just 90 minutes of mindless action, and could have been superb with script writers and a director who actually have something to say. As it is, it's some nice action set pieces buried between a recycled plot and failed attempts at adding depth.",TRON - Legacy
135,galahad58-1,Same Movie in 3D,6,18 December 2010,"Uninspired. Unoriginal. Unnecessary.Tron Legacy--you have seen it already so there is no need to go to the theater. Remember when George Lucas updated the special effects for the original Star Wars trilogy or when Paramount added special effects to the original Star Trek series? If you answered ""yes"" then you know what you are getting with Tron Legacy. Basically Tron Legacy is a rehash of the original Tron movie with more special effects and a 3D format. The ships and the motorcycles are all the same, the gaming battle is the same and the storyline is almost the same. Tron Legacy takes place 20 years after the original Tron, but it fails because it does not take into the effect all the technological advances that society has encountered in the last 20 years. In Tron Legacy the look is just about the same--except that the programs are outfitted like the X-Men movies. A hint of originality, a dose of modern advances, some concept that the world of Tron advanced beyond the 80's would have given some life to the film. As it stands Tron Legacy is just a 3D version of the original with a boring story that follows the same format as the original screenplay.Tron Legacy is not a movie you need to go to the theaters to see--wait until it hits video unless you absolutely need to see the 3D.",TRON - Legacy
136,fjhuerta-2,Fails to capture that special something TRON had,6,27 December 2010,"I wouldn't call myself a TRON hardcore fan - I couldn't even crack a single message from their website during their ""Flynn lives"" viral campaign. Still, I know the movie perfectly well - I watched it on a movie theater when I was 8 years old, and I simply could never get out of my head the Recognizers and Lightcycles. I did master the Intellivision Tron Deadly Discs game, and the movie jump-started my love for all things computer related. I've watched the 20th Anniversary DVD and all the extras far more times than I can care to count. Guess I'm a TRON hardcore fan after all.I had mixed feelings about this movie. On one hand, a sequel to TRON made all the sense in the world - the original movie correctly predicted plenty of concepts that we now take as granted (the importance of a network, transports, I/O ports, security, etc.), so a sequel could do something similar. The script could basically write itself; back then, writers had one very difficult time trying to convey the inner workings of a computer network to an audience that was not as computer saavy as today (I'd say they sort of failed - TRON's weakest part was its story). Also, Disney couldn't just hire everyone; they weren't the powerhouse they are now, so they had to do with a scrappy team of visionary but amateurish people. Now, with $300 million dollars at their disposal, any actor they could ever want, all the technology they could ever need, Pixar and their creative team, how could Disney make Tron a failure?If you want an answer to this question, just go watch Tron: Legacy. It IS a failure.Why? I believe that TRON, as näive and silly as it sometimes is, has its heart in the right place - it always strives to tell a story, and uses technology as both a backdrop and a principal character. It's not technology for its own sake, either - the Lightcycles, tanks, recognizers, and the complete universe of Tron really made you feel as if you were somewhere else. It was completely unlike anything you had ever seen before. The art depicted on the movie was so striking I think it'll be remembered for years to come just because of it. And, as I said before, it correctly guessed at the future of computing. I wouldn't hesitate to call it a landmark movie, even considering all of its problems.Tron: Legacy is just another product Disney marketing decided to sell. It has no soul whatsoever. It's not innovative or inventive - most of the things you'll see come from other, more successful movies. Examples? The aerial pursuit near the end of the movie is lifted directly from Star Wars. The bar scene is a near perfect copy of the one on Matrix: Reloaded. The attack scenes are also lifted from the Matrix. Jeff Bridges is The Dude in a cybercostume. The rebel kid hacking computers seems like a copy of Terminator 2. At no time did I think to myself ""this is something I had never seen in my life"", as I did with Tron.Furthermore, there's no story of any importance whatsoever behind all the CGI. The original TRON dealt with issues we face nowadays in any computer network (well, at least if you are a geek and work with computers). Tron Legacy doesn't even make any effort to predict the future, or to point out at any risks technology poses to people in the XXIst century. It's a completely disposable product, which is sort of enjoyable when you watch it, but can't bear to think about it afterwards. Because it really makes no sense and it doesn't make any important points.I cannot believe Disney couldn't get someone - anyone - capable of writing a good script, hiring decent actors (Sam Flynn was TERRIBLE) and getting a director with at least a couple of good movies under his belt. The only reason why I give this movie a 7 is because, even though you've seen everything before, it does look great on the big screen. I especially liked CLU - I never noticed I was looking at CGI. Awesome technology.I'm completely positive this sequel will go down in history as others, such as Blues Brothers 2000, the Star Wars prequels, and Matrix: Revolutions as one of the worst ever made. Sad. It had so much potential it's incredible they actually blew it.",TRON - Legacy
137,Chalice_Of_Evil,Trontastic...,8,15 December 2010,"I have never seen the original 'Tron', nor do I really know much about it really. I've only heard the movie referenced on occasion (like that one episode of The Simpsons where Homer's trapped in the Third Dimension and he asks if anybody saw the movie 'Tron', and everyone says ""No.""). The previews for 'Tron: Legacy' looked visually stunning, and I'm happy to report it does not disappoint in that regard. Everything seen inside ""The Grid"" is a wonder to behold, a visual feast. But is this the only thing the film has going for it? Well...yes and no. As far as the characters/actors who portray them are concerned...Garrett Hedlund is good as Sam Flynn. Yes, he has to utter some clunky dialogue along the way and is a bit stiff at times, but he serves the role well enough. At times he reminded me of Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker (what with the pulling out of lightsabers...I mean discs, donning of cloaks, etc) - though not half as bad as him.Jeff Bridges gives a solid performance as Sam's dad, Kevin Flynn. The only thing that detracts from his acting is his digitised clone, Clu. No matter how hard they have tried to create a youthful-looking Jeff Bridges using computer magic, he still looks like a ""cartoon"" (as someone in the audience put it). While it's annoying, it would have at least been tolerable if it had been limited to just the scenes inside The Grid. However, the movie starts in the the real world with a ""young"" Kevin Flynn telling his son the story of Tron/The Grid, and you can plainly tell the drastic difference between a real and fake Jeff Bridges. It's so obvious, and very distracting. Olivia Wilde kicks butt and looks great doing it (in her skintight catsuit with neon highlights and her asymmetrical wig) as the warrior, Quorra. She seems to be having a lot more fun with this role than she does with that of Thirteen on 'House'. Quorra has a slight naivety about her in regards to some things, and displays a sense of childlike wonder on occasion (especially the end), which gives her some depth. Wilde and Hedlund share some good scenes together, and her character at least gets *some* development - which is more than I can say for the albino-like ""Siren"", Gem (Beau Garrett).Michael Sheen is memorable as Castor. While he does tend to ""ham it up"" a bit, it's nonetheless a delightful performance.Apart from the animation of Young Kevin Flynn, there are a couple of other 'minuses' of the film, like the dialogue (which is oftentimes average) and the fact that the film itself does seem to drag in spots/go on for a bit too long.However, the visuals *do* almost manage to make up for most of the film's faults (almost). The movie looks stunning - after we get past the kinda boring beginning and are transported along with Sam inside The Grid. Light Cycles, Light Runners, all mode of ""Light"" transportation make for thrilling action/chase sequences. Then there's the ""games"", that mostly seem to involve throwing discs - which resemble Xena's round killing thing - at each other, causing those who are hit to ""derez"" (ie. cease to exist). Another 'plus' for this film is its excellent score. It adds SO much to the movie.The film is entertaining enough, but probably not the non-stop action some people are expecting/hoping for. If you're looking to kill a couple hours watching something that's visually pleasing (but, at the same time, may give you a headache/sore eyes thanks to the 3D), then 'Tron: Legacy' is worth checking out. Fans of the original may or may not like this movie, I'm not sure, but I know that for someone like myself - who's being introduced to the world of 'Tron' for the first time - it was quite something.",TRON - Legacy
138,Bruce722,Better than the original.,8,18 August 2012,"It's funny because every flaw the original Tron had, this movie corrects. However, almost all character and charm from the first film is lost in this one. Now don't get me wrong, I am not a fan of the original. The charm and originality of the setting and concept do not do enough to compensate for the terrible acting, mediocre effects, cheesy dialogue, and prolonged plot. This movie, while not so original, compensates for that by actually having pretty decent acting, amazing effects, a plot that isn't dull and boring, and is just in general a much more entertaining movie. It's only real flaw for me was that it left behind the concept of the personalities of the computer programs and was essentially just another modern science fiction movie with cool effects. The world feels almost more alien than computer. I also thought they could've expanded on the ending quite a bit. The movie ends with them talking about ""changing the world"" but no method for this is explained in any way. I assume they left it open like that in order to whore out the franchise in the ensuing years with sequels but I'm a believer that movies should be able to stand alone. On a side note, if you watch this movie on blu-ray, be sure to check out the extra called ""Flynn Lives"" after you watch the movie. It's one of the most interesting extra features I've ever seen in movies. Most movies just throw in useless deleted scenes, interviews that nobody cares about, and some segments on how things were made. Most people don't really care about that stuff, however, this extra is one that they could've, actually should've included after the credits. I think a lot of people would've been interested to watch these 5 minutes after the film since it fit so well. Also, I've gotta mention Olivia Wilde. Obviously she's absolutely beautiful. However, I thought her character completely stole the screen. Quorra might have been the only really interesting character in the movie and Olivia Wilde did a great job in portraying that. Overall, this was a really good movie that might not appeal as much to the nerd niche but one that I think more people would enjoy.",TRON - Legacy
139,canuckteach,"Wow - the FX were awesome, dude...",6,19 December 2010,"""Shooting the film lasted only 64 days. Post-production, due to the heavy special effects, required 68 weeks..."" - what does that tell you? this was a very thin plot - you could explain it in a few sentences.. to grasp what went wrong, I will contrast the approach with that of 2 other Sci-Fi flicks.But first, I wouldn't say the acting in Tron was sub-par, but then again, how many real characters are there? a villain, a son, (looking for) his father, and his pretty companion. of the 2 hours, I would say the split between talk-talk-talk and action was about 90 minutes (chat), and 30 minutes (action). Despite that imbalance, we are hearing tons of reviewers (including R Ebert) saying that there was insufficient explanation of the digital plot.Now, contrast 'Inception', which had CGI, for sure, but where the conflict, character development and story-line were all very compelling. It carefully built the parameters for the problems that would soon follow, and even then, the team encountered new unexpected hurdles that had to be surmounted, on-the-fly.Also, the first 'Matrix' initially mystified you and then, in short order detailed the origin of the Matrix, how you get in and out, the danger of the Agents, and the nature of the ensuing conflict and betrayal. in 90 minutes of gab, Tron didn't accomplish half of that.To summarize: yeah, the FX was OK, but the film was too 'talky'.6/10 - might add that I picked up the Inception Blu-ray combo pack for $22 from Amazon, but it cost me $25.50 to see this thing in 3D (ouch - I kept the 3d glasses)...",TRON - Legacy
140,ScottDMenzel,"""Tron: Legacy"" is a visually stunning ride with a killer score but lacks story and emotion.",7,22 December 2010,"In the first 10 minutes of ""Tron: Legacy,"" the audience gets a quick briefing of what happened in the original film. By quick briefing, I mean we get the basic overview of what happened to Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) and when he disappeared. The film then flashes to present time where we meet Kevin's son Sam (Garrett Hedlund) who we learn is now 28 years old and still isn't over his father's disappearance. After his yearly prank on his fathers company Encom, Sam gets visited by one of his fathers old friends Alan (Bruce Boxleitner) who informs Sam that he has received a message from his father coming from the Flynn Arcade. After some convincing on Alan's part, Sam makes his way over to the arcade only to find a secret room hidden behind the Tron arcade game that could be a portal to his father. A visually stunning film ensues....For the 45 to 60 minutes of the film, I was extremely involved with ""Tron: Legacy."" It was interesting, amazing to look at, and the story was good enough to hold one's interest. Then all of a sudden I found myself bored with the film. The story started feeling a little limp and I didn't really care all that much about the characters either. The film started going downhill when Quorra (Olivia Wilde) came into the picture, not saying that she was a bad character because she probably was one of my favorites, but this is when the story started to drag.On top of the lack of details (poor character development and character background), the emotional attachment between Sam and Kevin seemed to be missing. At first, I didn't know whether to blame Bridges and Hedlund for that or Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis for not having a stronger screenplay. But after a few moments of debate, I would honestly have to blame the screenwriters because they are the ones who didn't dig deeper into these characters. The script didn't give them a whole lot of background so they were only working with what they had and they did try their best. The story also wasn't that interesting after a while, it's like OK he's here to save his dad, I get it but what else? Don't even get me started on the lack of back story on the actual Tron character. They just left that wide open with very little explanation.As for the high points of ""Tron: Legacy"" well that goes right to the visual effects. The movie looks absolutely stunning. The set designs are amazing, the uniforms are awesome, and the whole entire grid looks brilliant. The design of the grid itself was also believable. You truly believe that this is what the inside of a computer looks like. I give everyone who was involved with the visual elements of the film major kudos points and that includes director Joseph Kosinski, who really captured the visual aspect of the film.Besides the visual aspect of the film, the music is the film is also amazing. The score was by Daft Punk who has been getting nothing but phrase for their music. I have to agree with everyone else because the music really made the film. I think it was one of the strongest elements of both the trailer and the film itself. Besides, the music and visuals, there is a really amazing scene where Sam enters into a club, which is extremely well shot and visually appealing. The race scenes are pretty sweet and the background recap in the beginning is also well done.The acting is decent, nothing great but not bad. It's typical action/family film acting all around. When Bridges plays Kevin Flynn he mixes his character from the original Tron in with The Dude from ""The Big Lebowski."" When Bridges plays Clu, who is the bad guy in the film, he actually does this extremely well. I think Bridges had much more to work with playing Clu than with Kevin to be fair. He did a good job with both though overall. Olivia Wilde is good in the film, not to mention easy on the eyes. Her character was simple and she played it off well. Garrett Hedlund, who played Sam, was decent in the film. He was probably the weakest of all the acting but than again he isn't as established of an actor as the rest of them. Also even though he wasn't in the film much, I have to give props to Michael Sheen, who was just wacky and crazy in the film. His character was by far the most interesting because he was so odd.In the end, ""Tron: Legacy"" was a a unique movie experience. It was visually appealing with some decent scenes and a killer soundtrack. The problem, however, was what I call the ""Avatar"" effect. It was amazing to look at but when it came down to the end, it could have been a lot better with a more solid story. Like ""Avatar"" the film lacked a complex story as well as great character development. It just wasn't as interesting as it should have been. It didn't hold my interest after I got past how cool it looked. I still would recommend the film, however, I just wouldn't give it as high of marks as I would have liked and that in itself is a shame because the film definitely had the potential to be something great! MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Tron: Legacy"" is a 7 out of 10.",TRON - Legacy
141,Dragonsouls,An iconic film that will be remembered as a classic.,9,28 May 2011,"Before I rented this, I really thought this was another pretty film, with pretty sets, and high production values, and nothing more. But I was wrong. Tron:Legacy makes more of an impact today than the original Tron did back in the 80's. The sequel is not only superior in visuals obviously, but also has a better story, and character driven plots. Many critics have said the story is ridiculous, but I disagree.I won't get into it much, but the story appears a bit shallow on the outside, but when you look beneath it's surface it's more than what it appears to be. There are many beautiful subliminal undertones in this story that make you wonder if it's actually a re-telling of Genesis.Now of course, the visuals pack a punch, and I am very saddened at the fact that I missed this in the theaters. I could only imagine how great it would have looked in 3D. I don't really care for most 3D films, but in this case, I do. Reason being is the cameras used for the film. They were actual 3D cameras that film in 3D, just like in the movie ""Avatar"". Most other 3D films are converted into 3D after filming, but Tron: Legacy supposedly had even more advanced cameras used in it than the ones in Avatar.3D aside, lets talk about the sets and costumes. The film's budget for the costumes only was 13 million dollars! And beautiful they were. The sets were also spectacular, and although not that big, still very intricate and surreal. I can honestly say that there are a lot of beautiful films out lately, impressive CGI and all, but I don't think anything compares to this. After watching Legacy I felt as if I saw CGI for the first time again! The performances were excellent throughout. The cast in this film is absolutely huge! Especially since I am a big fan of most of members of the cast. James Frain was absolutely perfect as a puppet guardian of Clu. Cillian Murphy had a small role in this film, and he's a fine actor. Jeff Bridges was 100x better in this film than the original, and my favorite performance had to be that of Micheal Sheen...as a David Bowie Ziggy Stardust look alike, did a wonderful job with a witty, humorous, and spunky demeanor.An unofficial character to this film is the soundtrack. It's a masterpiece! I think the Electronica Techno pop group Daft Punk have created their finest work yet, although at times drifting into orchestrated symphony rather than their patented techno sound. This soundtrack is up there with the best of all the compositions of Hans Zimmer, and Ennio Morricone. Mozart would be proud! 9/10 A Classic that will stand the test of time.",TRON - Legacy
142,RichardSRussell-1,"Great Lightshow, Terrific Score, Barely Visible Plot",7,18 December 2010,"Tron [2]: Legacy (2:05, PG, Imax, 3-D) — SF, biggie, sequelIn the original Tron from 1982, game-arcade owner Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) was accidentally lasered into a supercomputer, where he spent about 80 minutes having various low-fi, low-res adventures, following which he got zapped back into the real world to discover that maybe 2 seconds had passed. That's a 2400:1 time-dilation ratio.This sequel begins in 1989, when he does the same thing intentionally but never returns. We jump to the present, when his son Sam (Garrett Hedlund) gets a text message to go looking for the old man, who (surprise, surprise!) is still inside the Big Box. To be consistent, the intervening 21 years should have produced a ghost in the machine who's now 50,461 years old. Bridges doesn't look QUITE that aged — a little more than in Crazy Heart, a little less than in True Grit — but not bad for somebody who's lived 5 times longer than recorded history.We discover that he's spent most of that time avoiding his schizophrenic evil twin, the computerized avatar Clu, who's driven by his instruction set to try to create the perfect program — except that, to his limited imagination, that would be something like a spreadsheet with nothing but ""1""s and ""0""s, a paradigm of simplicity and order, as opposed to the complexity and messiness of the real world.And now Clu is ready for his coup d'etat, in which his computer home will be like an incubating Trojan Horse, harboring an army of fanatically single-minded soldiers just waiting to be released upon the great, unsuspecting outer world, if only he can get someone from Out There to re-open the portal.As before, the sketchy real-world plot bookends the real movie in the middle, a trip thru the virtual world inside the computer, an unabashed light show, a showcase of what cutting-edge computer technology is able to accomplish. Remember that 1982 was a couple of years before the Macintosh came out and you have some idea of how primitive the CGI was at the time — and a reminder of how very, very far we've come since then.Another area of progress has been in how seriously we take this idea. The screenplay and acting in the original were almost laughably bad, as if Disney were preemptively saying ""See, we KNOW this is just escapist trash, wink wink nudge nudge, so we didn't bother treating it like a real movie."" Now the target audience would be outraged if they just blew us off like that.Kevin Flynn speaks in the hippie argot of the 1960s. Now, the virtual world and its denizens could have either: (A) evolved their own context-specific ethos and memes, as did James P. Hogan's robotic civilization in Code of the Lifemaker, or (B) clung tenaciously to the habits and folkways of the Old Country, like those isolated Japanese soldiers in the Bornean jungles, still fighting WW2 years after it was over. 1st-time director Joseph Kosinski chose to go with B. You may view this as either a profound commentary on the inherently limited nature of virtual worlds, laziness or lack of imagination on the part of screenwriters Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, or a nervous capitulation on the part of producers unwilling to challenge the Twitter-era attention spans of the oyayubi-zoku.Bridges hams it up. Regrettably, Hedlund seems to be channeling Hayden Christensen. Bruce Boxleitner reprises his role as computer scientist Alan Bradley, but only in the bookends; his avatar Tron appears in the meaty middle but is not identifiable as BB. Olivia Wilde is on hand as Quarra, occupying the eye-candy role that the original's Cindy Morgan (now 56) was evidently considered too decrepit for (a standard that doesn't seem to apply to her male co-stars). But the most outrageously campy performance certainly belongs to Michael Sheen, taking a break from playing vampires, werewolves, and prime ministers to steal the show as the cabaret proprietor Castor, Joel Gray times 4.Curiously, aside from the performances, the attempts at humor are fitful and mostly ineffective. The script is really more notable for missed opportunities. For instance, there comes a point in the action when the situation just shrieks for a character to say ""Come with me if you want to live!"", but no.The neon-lit body suits are back, natch, and the original's set pieces are all reprised as well: the battle game (a cross between Frisbee, jai-alai, the Roman Colosseum, and McAfee Anti-Virus); the wire-frame battlebot transports; the lightcycles with their impenetrable-barrier trails; and the butterfly-on-a-wire funicular to the space-beacon portal. In addition, we now have winged Corbin Sparrows used as fighter jets. But all of it's done in 3-D, and it looks simply smashing. This is the 2nd-best use yet of the technique. Now the lightcycles have to deal with the vertical as well as the radial and transverse, and it ups the excitement level a notch.In fact, the tech has gotten SO good that Clu has climbed about halfway up the near wall of the uncanny valley. Frankly, I think the plot would have been better served had they left him wallowing in its depths along with Beowulf and the Polar Express conductor, since he's SUPPOSED to be fakily creepy, but that would have undercut the ""Hey, guys, look at THIS!"" mindset; the movie remains relentlessly about the tech, with plot considerations a distant 2nd.Kudos to Daft Punk, makers of electronic music whom I'd never heard of before but whose score was brilliant and an absolutely perfect complement to the on-screen action. And the wire-frame lighted version of Disney's signature Magic Castle was an excellent scene-setter, a delightful way to kick off the holiday season with a bunch of high-calorie, low-nutrition divinity.",TRON - Legacy
143,colinrgeorge,A Beautiful Mess,4,23 December 2010,"""Tron: Legacy"" is a beautiful mess. Packed with state of the art visuals, from the striking blue and orange neon oasis of a computer world to the disquieting de-aging of Jeff Bridges, it's just a shame that a decent script hadn't been hammered out beforehand. ""Legacy"" could have been a stunner. Instead, it's merely supermodel entertainment—gorgeous but vapid.You'd think a movie about a brainiac hacker would be a little smarter. Granted, there's enough techy gobbledygook to choke a computer processor, but it has the opposite of the desired effect. Incomprehensible and long-winded expository scenes make clear that ""Legacy"" is the worst breed of hand-holding blockbuster—characters formulate and execute plans in ceaseless sequence until they reach end protocol. Structurally, the film is like a bad sonnet.Probably the single most egregious problem with ""Legacy's"" screenplay is its entirely uninteresting characters. Reluctant hero Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund) is the son of Bridges' character from the 1982 original. Perhaps it's fitting that the character is cast adrift in an artificial world, because he's the least dynamic human being on Earth. A living soul should stick out like a sore thumb when compared to anthropomorphized computer programs, but though Sam gawks and cracks wise, the truth is that his character is as lifeless as a filing cabinet. I can't think of three adjectives to describe him.Bridges doesn't have much to work with either as the elder Flynn; the man is a bottomless well of exposition peppered with antiquated colloquialisms (""dig,"" ""jazz,"" ""man,"" e.g. ""I don't dig that jazz, man"") leftover from his overzealous performance in ""Tron"" prime. Olivia Wilde plays Quorra, the last of a super-advanced cyber species with whom personality certainly died. And then there's Martin Sheen as Zuse, who has enough eccentricities for the four of them combined. He plays the role of an opportunistic bartender like a Greek bohemian, giving a bizarre and unrestrained performance that feels more than a little out of place. He's in the movie maybe a combined six minutes.Unfortunately, the story that binds these characters together is just as forgettable. Even as they bolt through its interminable second-half, it feels as though nothing is happening. Their motivator is literally ""Get to the portal,"" which means ""Legacy"" is essentially a chase film. The only method employed to break-up the razzle-dazzle action sequences are paunchy bouts of dialogue that beget subplots that beget more chase. There is never a moment to stop and admire the world around them, or even to understand it. The universe of ""Tron"" never feels alive—it is merely an eye-candy coating over the bland events that comprise this tasteless narrative.I do not mean to undersell ""Tron: Legacy"" on a visual or technical level. The production design is superlative, and the digital wizardry (re: the 'Curious Case of Jeff Bridges') could be revolutionary. ""Legacy"" is a beautiful film, but none of that changes the fact that its screenplay is a disaster. It's never a good sign when you have six writers attached to the same piece of material, and the sequel to ""Tron"" is an open and shut case of too many cooks.Outside of the aesthetic artistry and a memorable soundtrack by Daft Punk, there is little to remember ""Tron: Legacy"" for. Its characters are cardboard and its plot is paper-thin. And without substance, all the cosmetics in the world can't save you. Sorry, supermodels.",TRON - Legacy
144,thekyles99,the new version has wayy cool cgi however cant out do the original storyline!,3,6 March 2011,"Well it seems the fans enjoyed it more then the critics so i unfortunately have to take the critics side on this one as i didn't care for it much either and found it incredibly boring. Now the original Tron is a classic that i have on blu ray and watch all the time so of course i was looking forward to it, unfortunately i was let down however. This instalment takes place 20 years after the first one in which we see a cgi enhanced Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges to be made to look 20 years younger via cgi, only this makes him look downright cartoonish) talking to his son as he lies in bed telling him how he got inside the computer at Emcom. He leaves never to be seen again. 20 years later Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund) a now rebellious 27 year old going head to head with another suit in the company named Richard Mackey (Jeffrey Nordling) for his father's company when he sees Allen Bradley (bruce Boxleitner) who informs him that he has received a printout from his father's arcade, an arcade that hasn't been shut down for 20 years. This intrigues Sam to venture over to the arcade and after the cobwebs and dust are cleared off everything he finds a secret door that leads him to the same machine that helped his father go into the computer world 20 years before. Young Flynn after following his father inside the mainframe goes on a search for him only to be hither ed by Clu 2( Jeff Bridges also stars) A program that the senior Flynn once created that now wants to take over Flynn and reign supreme. I will say that the effects are 100% better as i thought they would big difference in cinema today then it was in 1982.

146,kunalkhandwala,Wildly entertaining through its stunning visuals,9,31 December 2010,"If the 'Matrix' revolutionized the machines realm with coolness and 'Avatar' changed the 3D graphics realm with wowness, then TRON:Legacy will reshape the digital frontier with awesomeness......This will be the most fun time you will have in the theater with its eye- popping visuals, jaw dropping sequences and a rocking soundtrack by Daft Punk. TRON will engage you into an unimaginable cyberspace that was only previewed with its original two decades ago. Director Joseph Kosinski takes the liberty of Disney's $170 million and creates a stunning digital frontier that is best viewed on IMAX 3D.Master virtual world and game designer Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) disappears on the verge of a world-changing discovery. Twenty years hence, his son, Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund) makes his annual cyber-appearance in his father's successful video game company ENCOM when he is informed about a 'page' received from his father. Sam visits his father's old gaming arena where a secretive room transports him unknowingly into the digital world created by his father. Upon entering the Grid – a cyber world dominated by programs and a menacing lord named CLU (Jeff Bridges in CGI), Sam is forced to compete in the Gladitorial Disc Wars where programs use their identity discs as projectile weapons which, upon contact with the opponent program cause their deresolution (dissolve, deleted). Sam is soon identified as a 'user' since he only gets scratched by the disc and not derezzed. The disc wars is where the film can leave the viewer gasping. The 3D manifestations are phenomenal and the action, nothing short of epic. Just when you thought that it was getting exciting, CLU orders for lightcycle races on the Game Grid where half of Disney's $170 million must've been spent. The exhilarating races between the lightcycles and the coordinated defense by Sam are only overshadowed by Quorra (Olivia Wilde) rescuing him in a Light Runner. Sam is taken to the creator in exile; Kevin Flynn. After reuniting with his long lost father, Sam discovers that the only way out of here is by escaping through the open portal into the real world before CLU executes his sinister plan. When computers were restricted to industrial and commercial devices in 1981, TRON showcased the virtual world of programs and users within the grid or mainframe. The very idea intrigued an entire generation the same way 'The Matrix' dazzled our generation. With its sequel though, Kosinski prefers to intrigue the audience with the visuals rather than the concept. The story essentially revolves around the creator of the programs, his son who came to rescue him from the digital world and the rogue program that threatens to capture the creator's identity disc and use the open portal to send thousands of malicious programs on a sinister mission. The story, though not a ground-breaker, is worthy enough to bear the film's visually stunning digital environment and make sense in the end. The problems however, are with the mundane dialogues, lack of witty scenes and a subtle finale that didn't do well to follow the magnificence we had witnessed throughout. Jeff Bridges as Kevin Flynn is brilliant. His digitally rendered counterpart, CLU, looks as close to the young Bridges as CGI can make of him. Hedlund is alright as the new kid in a big budget sci-fi movie and is competent in his chemistry with father Jeff Bridges and lady interest Quorra. Olivia Wilde is as stunning as the light cycles in the body hugging costume and with that short hair, can inspire trends for aspiring models. Michael Sheen as Zuse is the most entertaining of the lot with his flamboyance portrayed at the 'End of Line Club' while he addresses the DJs to ""Electrify the boys and girls if you would be so kind!"". Speaking of Djs.....As you remain in awe of the astounding visuals during the light cycle races, disc wars, fight scenes at the night club and the aerial chase through cybercity, what also thrills another sense is the music. Daft Punk, playing the funky Djs at the 'End of Line Club' have delivered the most exciting soundtrack of the year. Some of the score includes epic themes resembling those by Hans Zimmer while others revert to the duo's strength in electronic, house and club music styles. 'Derezzed', 'End of Line' and the end titles showcase the best of Daft Punk and perhaps, the best of TRON:Legacy. The music is simply electrifying!From jaw dropping action sequences to the visually striking cyber world created in the Grid, TRON:Legacy entertains the teenager, the geek, the sci-fi lover, the action lover and hot body suit lover in the manner only a few films have. At times, you cannot even fathom how stunning the environment is, let alone the thought about the film having a deeper human side that would fulfill nothing but compromise action time. This film talks less and does more. When you have your 3D glasses on and you're on for a sci-fi adventure like none other, that's all that matters. 8.88 on a scale 0f 1-10.",TRON - Legacy

Welcome to the Grid, the digital frontier.I have seen this many times since 2010, including in the IMAX, and it has been great every time. This is truly one of my all time favourite Sci-Fi's. The visuals, music, actors, directing, and cinematography are all amazing.Going from the dark and dreary real world, we are transported to the Grid, where it is again dark and grim, but also rich with vibrant neon colours complete with stunning effects. When Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) is introduced it's easy to see that he has lost all hope and is content with being a recluse for the ""greater good"". He is stellar throughout, and we are privileged to witness his redemption in the eyes of his son. Hedlund and Wilde are equally likeable.That sunrise though... breathless, especially since it's the first time we are given natural light, it has such meaning, and is one of my favourite endings. Shout out to Lion's Gate Bridge in Vancouver, BC.The Daft Punk soundtrack is arguably the best soundtrack in any movie, and is constant throughout the film if only playing subtly in the background. I probably listen to a song from Tron: Legacy on my everyday playlist at least 5 times a week.Joseph Kosinski took the original world of Tron and reimagined it to make his vision, and by doing so brought it into the twenty first century.

It's one of those movies that I had a blast from the beginning to the finish, I just cannot not enjoy this movie.I honestly don't understand how people can hate this movie, it's really underrated and it's one of those occasions the critics are dead wrong.Yes, the plot and how writers wrote the narrative has some problems and you could say it's not well executed but if you think about it you'll see that it actually has a really good plot. I'll never understand the hate for this movie.This movie is just the coolest sht ever! The first movie had more problems and wasn't that great but I'm glad that I watched it before this one to appreciate this masterpiece more. When you watch that before this one, you'll see how much the creators and the director respected the original material and paid homage to it. And you get a better understanding of what Tron is and who Flynn is. But don't worry, this movie was designed so even if you haven't seen the first one you still understand pretty much everything.",TRON - Legacy

150,mirwais-orbit,Surprised but not Impressed...,8,14 January 2011,"As one said, before watching 'Tron: Legacy' don't forget that above all you're watching a Disney movie... and that's exactly what 'Tron: Legacy' is: a politically correct and linear movie interested more of being a visual reference to this generation than a truly sci-fi epic.It's very interesting and also a visual effect extravaganza as other one said, being the most visually delightful thing of 2010 to watch. But as a movie in a whole it's not amazing as it should be for the Disney fact but that doesn't kill any of the great experiences it provides.The minimalism of the movie is maintained from the original but improved and evolved as it should be, of course. But for me, the best thing of 'Tron: Legacy' is the rescue of the atmosphere provided by great sci-fi classics of the past - despite their individual styles - as '2001', 'Star Wars', 'Blade Runner', 'Alien' and 'Tron' itself, among others, giving focus on the visuals and dialogs more than in action immersing the audience into the world amazingly created making people mesmerized by every scene with a soundtrack that hypnotizes you in a Kubrick-ish way more than in a action oriented way.There's no way to omit that most of this atmosphere success is provided by it's soundtrack brilliantly created by electronic duo geniuses Daft Punk. Every music is directly connected to every scene, and for a moment you feel back in the past forgetting you're in 2010 watching a movie with the best technology in computer graphics to date. That is amazing, a unique experience that few movies are able to provide today. Even being an entire Disney movie I'm impressed that instead of remaking and boosting the experience for the sake of the money, the studio gave creative freedom for maintaining the audio/visual concepts and also the low tempo of the storyline giving the movie a modern concept, of course, but never being apart of the original or of the sci-fi classics.""Tron: Legacy"" is worth watching only for this experience because its story is lame and it's only a background for the visual delight. The original Tron is a classic and a reference of modern sci-fi productions as The Matrix but the story of ""Tron: Legacy"" never gets out of its comfort zone. Seems that the complexity of the visuals balances the lack of audacity of the story and the different audiences can be reached in a easy way - and now - for the sake of the money.I'm surprised by the results, but I'm not impressed in a whole as I expected.",TRON - Legacy
151,pontram,End of line - the failed Diginazi riot,7,10 July 2011,"Not wanting to add the 559th review here, I'm forced by my consciousness to do it anyway.The 2010 Tron sequel had a huge amount of money at hand, and if we look at the original Tron from 1982, we can say that this movie was a similar expensive, assuming that prices are doubled every decade (at least yogurt prices).The original Tron was a fairly groundbreaking movie, but it wasn't very successful. It had a rather unconventional score by Wendy Carlos, and it moved slightly unsatisfying between a fiction for (future) hardcore computer nerds and an ordinary family SF flick, but showed some fascinating ideas. It was simply inspiring for many people, despite although the Tron Computer itself game was disappointing.2010's Tron: Legacy is made when Computers are more than 1000 times faster (3MHz to 3 GHz), and have about 1 million times more memory (16 KB to 16 GB), but the software intelligence and complexity isn't grown much. AI software is still rather rare, and the revolutionary software ""Racter"", which wrote a book then (""The policeman's beard is half constructed"", 1984) is still unique. Of course we have now millions of code lines and object oriented languages, but most of processor power and memory usage goes into graphics, usability, compatibility and security. On kernel level the programs do mostly the same simple things like 30 years ago.And that's the same with the new movie. There are stunning graphics and a driving soundtrack, but at heart level the movie is as simple as in 1984. The old Tron was for male teens and young computer specialists, and was technically a product of its time. The only avant-garde part was its soundtrack, The new Tron is a must-see for every lover of the old Tron and for male teens and computer specialists.Story and characters are cliché in both movies, but the new Tron has to struggle with being not groundbreaking. The visuals may be exciting, but there are movies which are visually equal or more exciting. So you may take off with the movie because of its score, which is sometimes stunning, but you will be left unsatisfied at the end, if you are not 12 or 14 years old, or if you are an old nerd like me.Tron:legacy worked for me as one SciFi family flick amongst other adventures of our time, and the original Tron worked the same way. Both movies are fairly outside Disney's domain, but were squeezed violently into that family-friendly scheme, where deeper thoughts have no business. The result is, as seen on screen, a big loss of imagination and Independence. Both movies lost the dignity of their idea for the sake of the rating, the old Tron more than the new, because of its wasted potential.What I liked in Tron:Legacy was the styling of the antagonist Clue's big speech to the masses, which reminded me of a modern version of the 3rd Reich's leader's speeches. Maybe they studied some records of Adolf Hiler's speeches and transferred that material into the digital world.Although it is nearly completely ridiculous to arrange a big speech for a mass of programs, I appreciate the Idea of transporting historic symbolism into that world, which gives some room for interpretation and thoughts about manipulation and blind following. Though the scene has no impact on the story itself, which is a shame, it is consecutive.",TRON - Legacy
152,BrickNash,"Stunning and flawed, like the original!",6,5 January 2011,"I've Been a Tron fan since it was originally released. I recall hazy days in the early 80's with me and my friends playing 'Tron' with our Frisbee's and how it just looked so awesome.I just saw the new film and I must say I love both. Both films have their good points and their bad points which is why they both even each other out. The original was mind blowing at the time and paved the way for just about everything CGI wise and had a great story but was a bit slow in places which made it drag somewhat.Tron: Legacy is simply a technological beast! It's fast and great fun and pays nice homage to the original film but it certainly fall flat in terms of depth.Let's get this out the way, the CGI is STUNNING! It really is a complete visual feast with recognizers flying and light cycles zipping about the place, you really feel enriched just looking at the film so it certainly lives up to it's visual heritage. The much talked about Jeff Bridges young face is no-where near as bad as anyone says. It looks fantastic with only slight movement around the mouth giving it away. The soundtrack is perfect as well. I'm an out and out rock and metal guy but Daft Punk has done an amazing job and it fits so well. While the nostalgic part of me would have liked to see Wendy Carlos come back it is fitting that a modern system be scored by a modern electronic artist.Now to the story. It's good but not a million miles away from the original film which is no bad thing but I'd liked to have seen more dialogue concerning the new system. The original Tron was blasted for one of it's most interesting features. It had LOADS of computer and geek talk which may be like a second language to us computer savy people of 2011 but back then it was (to me) fascinating. The new film drops a lot of that talk in favour of a more spiritual and philosophical dialogue, which if I'm being honest, we have enough of in 'real world' films, so a slight dampener there. I'd like to have heard more talk about the internet's impact on the system, upgrades to 64 bit and viruses etc.But lets not be picky, the action rips along like a nuclear wave in your face and it is highly stylish (drawing from a few other films like Batman and The Matrix, but not to ridiculous levels!) so you really do get what you pay for which is a great action/sci-fi film.In fact Tron;Legacy really only fails on two counts.1. it blows it's wad a bit early on in the film with the disc battles and light cycle fights being a bit close to each other time wise.2. The actual protagonist that the film is named after - Tron, is hardly in it. Bruce Boxleitner does makes a welcome return as Alan and as a young Tron in the digital world, but this Tron is on screen for about 3 minutes and whilst the 'character' of Tron appears throughout the movie he wears a helmet! A very cheap cop out by the filmmakers obviously to save money by not having to 'de-age' Bruce Boxleitner's face for more than a few scenes.There are a few other niggles, like why do recognizers need jets to levitate and why are programs eating and drinking real food? Its the digital world! And I'd liked to have seen the old light cycle back in action against the new ones but these are small personal quibbles and should in no part take away from what is a really fantastic piece of visual cinema and a great experience overall.Go see it!",TRON - Legacy
153,priyantha-bandara,Visually spetacular yet heartless,7,19 March 2011,"Every year there are few or more science fictions hit the screen. And year by year they become colossus and bigger in budget and visual effects. 'TRON Legacy' is one of those science fictions which stand tall among others and will give you solid reasons to remember a year by its name.Setting up a sequel to the 20 year old TRON the story evolves around Sam Flynn who is the son of a computer programmer and visionary Kevin Flynn. Kevin goes missing when Sam was a kid leaving his company unbalanced while working on a ground breaking software platform he calls as the 'grid'. After 20 years Sam finds the key to this grid and transform himself in to the program and in to the grid just like Kevin did long ago. There he realizes that his father's program is much more than just a normal operating system but a universe itself which evolve by itself and sustain. He finds his father trapped in there for good reasons and starts to play along the game of escaping from the grid and back to reality.Just like it sounds in many fantasy movies like Alice in wonderland, Bridge to Terabithia or Chronicles of Narnia the heroes trapped in a strange realm must do tough tasks in order to get back home. And each of these realms is unique and never seen before fantastic. Yet you should brace yourself when you enter the realm of the grid. For the simple reason is that it's just purely mind blowing and remarkable. You will feel exhausted even trying to understand the designs, effects and background work which must have gone in to creating that realm. It is that astonishing. There is nothing in the movie history for this to compare with and not even Avatar or Star Wars stands in its way. That's what so unique about 'TRON Legacy'.Apart from the stunning visual effects and the thrill ride or unrealism the movies is pretty much the usual. The plot is not that ground breaking or acting is not going to make you cry. So to speak 'TRON Legacy' has no heart even thought it tries to build up a little connection between the father and son. Or even the real feeling of hatred between the enemies is also nonexistent. So if you're emotional or looking for emotions 'TRON Legacy' is not the place for you. And we have seeing many Sci Fics with a heart in past years which you cannot actually blame the audience for expecting some from 'TRON Legacy' being it that huge.But keep that all aside like I mentioned before the visual effects and the thrills only will transform you to another realm 'TRON Legacy' is a totally different experience for the movie lovers and we would love to settle at that for this time. But since the movie ends with a hint of another coming on our way, we would love to see a plot with heart and mind in next one. Or else just like 'Transformers' I don't want to feel dizzy after watching the same old actions in bigger scale over and over.read more at flickshout.blogspot.com",TRON - Legacy
154,joestank15,Good for 10 year old boys. Disposable but not worth hating.,6,23 December 2010,"Tron: Legacy - A sequel 28 years later to the original, Tron follows Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund), son of Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) the creator of Tron. Sam is called to his father's old arcade mysteriously and gets zapped into a program where he interacts with other bots including his father's doppelganger Clu (Jeff Bridges), a murderous zelot program.This is a sequel that few waited for or wanted, probably. I suppose someone wanted to do a remake, but someone else had too much nostalgia to deny Jeff Bridges (guy's on a roll lately) another movie. It works much better as a sensory experience than a film. The atmosphere is enjoyable. Whilst everything in the Matrix was a flat black and green, here we get black, blue and orange! Although otherworlds are supposed to be vastly more complex and intricate than ours, look at how many colors they have and the simplistic nature will come crashing down to you. There's freaking nothing to do in the world of Tron. There are the discus gladiator matches and the races (both cool), but that seems to be all that's interesting in this world. Bottom line, the story sucks and the world doesn't feel like a universe worth exploring. It makes no sense for the most part (why are there storms in a computer world?). The Iso's aren't explained properly an neither is why a 20 year stalemate is in place between Clu and Kevin when they live a 5 minutes drive from each other and Kevin seems to care little for home defenses of any kind.There's nostalgia aplomb. Bruce Boxleitner (guy from the first movie) appears at the beginning and end of the film. Sam puts a quarter in an old arcade game and I thought of the Zoltar machine from ""Big"". Journey's ""Separate Ways"" is used to great effect. That song, awful music video and all, is a good metaphor for this movie. Its feel is nice and it's a great song, but it's also a bunch of campy guys running around an empty warehouse with nothing to do.The performances are a mix. Jeff Bridges is always welcome in a film, but here he is channeling ""The Dude"" from The Big Lebowski. He's all zenned out and I almost expected to here him say ""this aggression will not stand"" or ""hey man, that's just like, your opinion man"". Garrett Hedlund is pretty much a blank slate. There's nothing exceptional about his performance. I'd have forgotten his name if I didn't look him up. Olivia Wilde is better as Quora. She adds some much needed spunk and glee to the movie. A pity Garrett has so little chemistry with her. Cillian Murphy has a blink and you'll miss it cameo. He has to be one of the most talented working actors of his generation to be in so many bit parts in blockbuster films. Michael Sheen seems to be channeling campy devious performances from any 70s to 80s sci-fi film. Movies like ""Logan's Run"" or ""Mad Max"" come to mind as Michael chews scenery and does kicklines in albino makeup. And Jeff Bridges as Clu is a mix. He's good when he is malevolent and ambivalent in the first scene but keeps getting worse and worse and bellows at everyone far too much. And why do stadiums of loyal computer programs need so many over the top motivational speeches? Maybe that's how programming works in the world of Tron.The effects and music are really the show. And a pretty good show at that. It would be better as a thrill ride than a 2 hour film. The music is fitting and atmospheric, so hats off to Daft Punk, though I'd like to hear what MGMT might have done. The film's story and universe don't really work, but the trimmings, costumes and effects are enough to warrant viewing. They, thankfully, will be what stays with you later.Remember the CGI, forget the sci-fi, The Big LeTronski gets a C.",TRON - Legacy
155,Barky44,Missed Opportunities Make Me Gag -- IN 3-D!!!!!!!!!!!!,5,17 December 2010,"As far as I'm concerned, the time has come where special effects, in and of themselves, are no longer enough to carry a movie. It has actually been that way for quite a while.Any good film requires a story behind it, a story that interests the audience, endears them to the characters, and involves them in the setting. Tron: Legacy's story, well, doesn't do that. It's not particularly compelling, it lays flat. The hero sort of stumbles into his dad's computer-generated world, they sort-of don't get along, there's a girl who's theoretically important, and the bad guy wants to get to the real world to do ... well, something. Not entirely sure what.Now honestly, what can you expect from a live-action Disney movie? So few are very good. However ...OK, look. I've become a stickler for missed opportunities. I'm like that in general with pretty much any topic: politics, economics, technology, and art. In life, there are these moments in time, space, or thought, where something brilliant is THIS way, and something mundane is THAT way. It's that ability to spot those tiny moments where the path diverges from mundanity that sets genius apart from the rest of us. Granted, you still have to take action, but spotting it is the first battle.So what does this have to do with Tron: Legacy?? To find out, read on, but MASSIVE SPOILER ALERT ahead!There is a tiny, tiny little plot thread in this film. Almost unnoticeable, almost irrelevant, seemingly nothing more than an excuse to plop a hot, futuristic babe in the film. The writers decided, in what must have been an inspired instant, to include the notion that a special set of programs (ISOs), can be spontaneously created in this world created by Flynn (played by Jeff Bridges). This is truly a remarkable thing, and for about 5 minutes it is treated remarkably by the writers. And then, this truly remarkable event is ... cast away. In weak flashbacks, they show the genocide of the ISOs by the villain. What a way to kill off a great idea! Then we get back to mundane plot (father-loves-son, son-hates-father-until-they-bond, yawn, zzzzzzzzz).THIS is the big missed opportunity of this film! The writers should have realized ""holy cow, what a great idea! And we can have these ISOs have special powers, or they could be unaffected by Flynn's creator-powers, or there could only be a few left who are being hunted down, or they could be the salvation of the Grid-world, or, or, SOMETHING!"" Now I will grant you that ""saving endangered species"" and ""fighting for our right to exist"" plot line has been done in hundreds of movies, but wrapping a story around a spontaneously-created sentient lifeform living inside a computer would have been INFINITELY more interesting than what the writers roped together to fill out an excuse to make a 3-D extravaganza.5 out of 10. Decent special effects, a few of shots were spectacular in 3-D, and a good soundtrack. But a weak plot that could have been SO much better, if only someone had grasped that small idea-opportunity and acted on it.",TRON - Legacy
156,chelano,Tonight we ride.....light bikes,9,20 December 2010,"I only have one complaint about the film, but I will get to that at the end. Lets first talk about the story. It was top notch excellent. All the unanswered questions from the first one were mostly answered in this film which gave the viewer a relaxed feeling and able to enjoy the film. The film was not boring. It has great action and the parts with no fighting had great dialog. Seeing the movie in 3D was interesting. In the real world, the film was shot in 2D and switches to 3D when you enter the grid. That was a clever way of doing it instead of filming the whole thing like that. The cast was great. I was unsure about Garrett Hedlund at first, but he really pulled it off. Bringing back two of the main characters from the first was an amazing win. This was Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner. But here is the problem. This film takes place now so Bridges and Boxleitner can play their parts as older people. But for flashbacks and for the programs TRON and CLUE. They had CG faces. Disney did the best job they could at making them look real and on some scenes it was hard to tell. But other scenes, especially the flashbacks, it looked really fake. But I will say the rest of the CG and the update Grid was simply breath taking. A couple side characters that were enjoyable were Olivia Wilde as Quorra and Michael Sheen as Zuse. Wilde was a gem in this film and really played her part well as the female sidekick and the so called ""eye candy"". Michael Sheen's character was so animated, he was a joy to watch and added a little comedy to the film. One more set of side characters were the DJs in the club played by Daft Punk; who wrote the score to this film. There music was perfect for it and seriously sent chills through your body at point. The story again was great and leaves a cliffhanger, but a good one. If you want to know the answer, you have to play the video games released on PS3, Xbox 360 and the Nintendo DS if you want a little prequel. Anything to get people to spend money. This will be a great and memorable film.",TRON - Legacy

158,dhaufrect-1,"As films go, ""Tron:Legacy"" is a visual magic, but that's it.",4,17 February 2012,"The 3D film, ""Tron:Legacy"" filmed in 3D is a source of visual magic aimed at a youthful audience. However, it is also an audiophile's dream to experience the surrounding of unique and intense vehicles that literally encompass the viewer. Joseph Kosinski has directed this movie with skill that dazzles the eyes and ears. Unfortunately, the story is way too fantastic to be either believable or in the realm of digestible fantasy in the usual Disney sense.Jeff Bridges does a perfectly good job of portraying Kevin Flynn, however, his computer animated younger version of himself is odd to say the least and puzzling to figure out the mechanism by which he was created. Olivia Wilde is enticing as the character of Quorra, and she wears a cat suit in a very seductive manner that likely woos the male audience members with admiration and jealousy. One must give the most attention to the special effects for their creativity and time consuming consistency in that this entity is truly the star of the shoe. In addition, the new Blu Ray version has a Smart Second Screen that can reveal detail in a quick an unobtrusive way that was unique for me and enhance the appreciation of the remote details with which I was not familiar. My lower score is only on the basis of the fact that it is not a film of my favorite genre. But I can highly recommend it to the videophiles and audiophiles who enjoy the spectacle of big screen action in sight and sound.",TRON - Legacy
159,robotbling,Colorful techno-fantasy,8,12 December 2011,"(www.plasticpals.com) Let's get the obvious out of the way; the original TRON hasn't aged very well. It had some revolutionary animated sequences (which admittedly still look pretty cool as an artifact of early computer graphics) but putting these aside, the characters and plot were sorta boring. Legacy benefits not only from the past 30 years of gradual technological progress, but more importantly its emphasis on the characters. This is one of the most stylish sci-fi fantasy films ever made, but the iconic visuals are thankfully backed up by a surprisingly strong emotional journey.Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges), the hero of the first film, mysteriously disappeared in the '80s, leaving behind a son named Sam (Garrett Hedlund). I was initially gutted when the film falters in its first 15 minutes or so as we fast forward to the present day, with Sam ""hacking"" an irrelevant board meeting at his father's former computer software company. The effect is further compounded when Sam subsequently base dives from the top of ENCOM's headquarters (parachute and all) before finally landing on top of a taxi. But it's not long after this laughably bad and totally unnecessary sequence that Sam enters the Grid, and things get dramatically better from then on.Make no mistake, TRON is not a pure science-fiction film, but rather a sci-fi fantasy film. Don't expect a convincing plot device to explain how humans become digitized like in The Matrix. This is the cyberspace twin of The Wizard of OZ, promptly whisking the viewer away to a strange land that, while dangerous, is too god damned shiny to be anything but fun.This is the 2nd film (after Avatar) that really showcases the benefits of 3-D cinema. The many action sequences are not only conceptually original but look downright jaw dropping in 3-D, punctuated by teeth-clenching slow-motion to let it all sink in. Three decades later, TRON Legacy is everything the first film wanted to be and more. To begin with, the campy glowing suits have been given a sexy redesign. While a handful of silly looking costumes, hair, and make up are present and accounted for, key characters look very cool and menacing. When the personified Programs get ""de-rezzed"" (Grid speak for deleted) they shatter into a million glowing shards of data that spill across the floor. And the lightcycles' trademark light-trail refracts and bends the surrounding environment as if it were made of some sort of magical glass, to name just a few of the many visual treats.The computer graphics do fall short in one, some might say essential, category: Kevin Flynn's digital younger self. The film makers maximize its effectiveness with clever lighting, but the effect is far from perfect. That said, it shouldn't bother anyone who has touched a video game in the last 5 years, and its CG sheen sort of fits within the context of the film's digital world. I've said it before, but it is worth reiterating just how difficult it is to create a convincing artificial human – whether it's a computer-generated actor or a synthetic humanoid robot.Special mention must be made of the soundtrack, which was composed by the French DJ robots known as Daft Punk. Daft Punk and TRON are a match made in heaven, so whoever was in charge at Disney that made this happen deserves a serious bonus. They even put in an enjoyable cameo, but if you're not a fan I don't feel the music will turn you off. It's more cinematic than their typical sound, dovetailing nicely with the action or the rumbling emotional underpinnings of any given scene. That's probably a good thing, but as a fan I was hoping it would have a little more in common with what we've come to expect from their albums. To conclude, do yourself a favor and disregard the negative reviews (I don't know what these critics were expecting) – seeing it in 3-D is the way to go.",TRON - Legacy
160,vasco_cid,Escapist and perfect guilty pleasure.,10,9 February 2017,"I was asked why I hold this film in such high regard and why I award it the highest rating. The original Tron was landmark for the 1980's; an experience that invested on style over substance in the most harmless way. It acknowledged its tongue-in-cheek nature, embraced the playfulness and revolutionarily endeavoured into the real world vs. virtual reality.Almost 30 years later, Legacy follows up with the same attitude (perhaps a more serious one) and ends up delivering exactly what it is set up to accomplish: a well-rounded update to cannon, amazing visuals, impeccable cinematography and a memorable score by Daft Punk. As you are led along from one lush virtual environment to another you realise just how baffling, confusing, nonsensical and plain the whole story is. What's more important is that you, pardon, I, don't care. The reason why Tron Legacy works so amazingly well for me and other cult followers who have seen both films (in my case Legacy) more times than it is sane to admit is because this is the epitome of what cinema can give you in terms of subjective escapism, i.e. guilty pleasure. I could see true passion, devotion and effort from Kosinski, as devout fanboy himself, to elaborate and deepen an iconic and far-fetched world he grew up with. He embraced its foundations and their absurdities and expanded them in a coherent and more importantly, unpretentious way. Call it a vanity fair, a playground for computer programmers and geeks, or just a hollow harmless adventure, Legacy IS a joyride, from beginning to end, and its flaws don't harm the whole. Could the flaws be corrected to amount to a better film? They most certainly could. The philosophical, esoteric and even metaphorical themes that the film touches upon, but never really develops are precisely the fine line between playfulness and pretentiousness that Kosinski thankfully never crosses. He might in an eventual sequel; if it does happen, let us hope that he, or whomever succeeds deliver such a fun, careless, exuberant and lavish experience. If it doesn't I'm incredibly satisfied with I've got.",TRON - Legacy
161,adrongardner,Cocaine for the Eyes,9,17 December 2010,"There was a point in TRON: Legacy where I stopped hearing what people were saying. I stopped following the story. It's like listening to Beethovien's 5th. You hear the music, but you're not listening to the words. The visual impact of the TRON world was so powerful, I just kept thinking""When I visit Osaka, Japan again in 20 years, this is what it will look like."" Let's hope they get the light cycles right.I can hear the reviews already. ""It makes no sensethe acting was woodenthe plot was thin"" If it please the court, to all the complaints I present Exhibit A in the form Ridley Scott's Blade Runner.Blade Runner is a film which made an identity off a sort of Asian hybridization of downtown L.A.. It is that look that has immortalized Blade Runner. The atmosphere and the powerful use of light is what made Blade Runner last. Go back and watch it today – the deficiencies in story and characters and lack thereof plot were obvious in 1982 and still obvious today. It was hammered by critics, the acting was wooden, the script was awful and the plot was nonexistent. Today – it is considered a classic and by some an outright masterwork. So there is more to a film EXPERIENCE than a script with a calculated beginning, middle and end. TRON: Legacy is an experience on the same level. It takes you to a world you want to be real and for two hours – it is.Speaking of Ridley Scott's 1982 mess of an opus, Daft Punk's resounding, if repetitive, score often recalls cues from the Vangelis score of Blade Runner. Just as in that movie, the music in TRON: Legacy is equally entrenched in the experience. Heck, Kubrick knew what Aristotle knew – music can make drama. It's not a cheat, Star Wars is guilty as sin if it is. If TRON, at its worst, is merely amusing, the Daft Punk score is simply tremendous.TRON: Legacy isn't a film of ideas – it is a tour de force of light and sound. There really isn't any human drama here – fair enough, it does take place inside of a UNIX driven micro-world (I know there's other keyboard jockeys out there who saw GREP and WHOAMI pop up in the shell). Yep, this is pure geek pornography.I could talk about the performances, and the story and all that, but I would spend more time doing so than the movie did. Don't go see TRON: Legacy for the story. If you learned anything from the first film, you would know that going into the theater on this one. The journalist in me cringes and aches for TRON to have a better story to tell. But the photographer, the dreamer and ultimately the moviegoer in me says they did this one just right. The first film was an exercise in powerful visual ideas held back by the limits of technology strung together by a story that made no sense. With the new TRON, they had the limits removed on the visual idea end of things, but the story still sucks.Who cares.Avatar had three hours of Jar Jar Binks clones and the most marshmallow fluff excuse for a story of any movie made in the past 20 years and it made two billion dollars. I'll go one step further. Conspiracy theory around all you want, the fact is, the Mona Lisa is a painting of an ugly woman that entrances every one who views her. TRON: Legacy is a masterpiece of a different kind which, despite the flat acting and nonexistent story, entrances the eye like no other movie I've seen in years.Besides, Da Vinci was a hack – none of his paintings had light cycles.",TRON - Legacy
162,RCWjr,A wonderful spectacle,8,18 December 2010,"I was 16 when the original TRON film came out. It was a oddity at the time for me. I enjoyed the video game inspired by the movie far more. Subsequent viewings of the film, especially recently, have brought about far more appreciation and understanding of the film, especially since for the last 20 years I have worked in the IT arena. Still, the film holds no special nostalgia for me. I think your reaction to this film is going to depend on your nostalgia level of the original. If you have attached high levels of grandeur to it, I think you are going to be setup for disappointment. If you, like me, go in with a leveled expectation and understand this is a spectacle, not the ""second-coming"", you are going to be far more prepared to enjoy it. This is not to say you have to lower expectations, allow for a dumb film. No, that is not what I am saying. What I am saying is the first film was no Citizen Kane and elevated levels of grandeur based on childhood nostalgia, if allowed to cloud your view, will doom your viewing of this film. It is a far more universal film than the original.Our new characters, Sam, as played by Hudland and Quorra as played by Wilde help infuse a much needed sense of youth to the proceedings. As with the original film, youth is celebrated as representing progress. I really enjoyed the chemistry between Hudland and Wilde. I especially want to highlight Wilde. There is the obvious physical element she brings to the role. She is beautiful, that is obvious. But her wide-eyed apprentice/guardian persona is what really makes you fall in love with her. There have been complaints about Michael Sheen's ""Zuse"", but I found him rather enjoyable. Beau Garrett as Gem, like Wilde, draws you in with her physical, but I found her Gem interesting as well as beautiful. Jeff bridges is on his game as Flynn and Clu. Bridges and Boxleitner help remind you this is a TRON movie.Speaking of Clu, I have read a good many fan reaction that Clu is too CGI, to the point of distracting. I found this not to be the case. In fact, if fans care to look back at the original, not only was Clu represented in an artificial state, Bridges played him totally different. Beyond that, it makes total sense that the program version of the creator is not quite an exact representation of the creator.Another consistent criticism of the film, both fan and critic, has been the story. As I mentioned earlier, it is less techno babble laden than the first. It is a rather simple story of a son, underachieving and feeling abandoned, drawn into his fathers world and ultimately searching for redemption of his father. Nothing too techno babble there and that could be a problem for the nostalgia clinging fans who were one of the few that enjoyed the original. I personally enjoyed the story and felt it was far more engaging from an emotional standpoint than the original. I have read many reviews saying the film was soulless and I couldn't disagree more. This film is much more of an emotional journey than the original was.The special effects are outstanding and this is where the film really earns your patronage. I saw the film in IMAX 3D and have to say this is the way to see it. I know people are growing tired of paying extra for the IMAX and 3D experience, but when done well, like here, this is why you go to the theater. We have home-theater systems today that can equal some of the best theaters, but something like this can't be duplicated at home and this is why I go out to see movies. I can stay home and watch dramas and comedy's. When I pay to see a film in a theater, I am doing so because there is a level of experience I can't get at home.The music by Daft Punk is married perfectly with the film. There has never been a more perfect marriage to music to film. The theater pulsed with the score that Daft Punk laid down.Spectacle, again, that is what your expectations should be for this film. For those shackled by nostalgia, I say break away from your chains and let this film be exactly what it is intended to be; spectacle with equal parts technology and emotion.",TRON - Legacy
163,neenahhh,Who the hell is Tron?,5,3 April 2011,"I was expecting a lot from this movie since people were all giving it high reviews and the trailer looked pretty decent. But after watching it, I was disappointed to find out that I didn't get much from it.The visuals in this movie were superb. Especially during the chasing scenes. The motorcycle scenes reminded me of 'Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within' and the flying planes scenes reminded me of 'Avatar'.While watching this, I got a Spy Kids 3D mixed with a Final Fantasy feel. Like the third Spy Kids movie, 'TRON: Legacy' wasn't anything too special. I found myself still confused with the movie itself, even by the ending.I had lots of questions in my mind, that were still left unanswered, even by the ending. Major plot holes ruined this movie, but I'm giving it a 5 for the cool chasing and/or action scenes. I was impressed by the graphics. But the storyline was really lacking.Viewed on: April 1, 2011",TRON - Legacy
164,jonnyfendi,TRON of Unanswered Questions,6,20 December 2010,"My personal favorite scene is the opening scene, where young Kevin Flynn tells his son the story inside of The Grid, the digital frontier that is expected to become true someday. In that scene, you can see for the first time the figure of young Jeff Bridges is created, the camera angle tries to distract our view by spinning the front face's image. Only then when he stands in front of the room's door in his way out, finally you will be able to see full image of his face. That is awesome! 61-year-old Jeff Bridges just looks like when he starred in ""Blown Away"" (1994). Afterwards, the story revolves around the grown-up Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund) receives a new clue about the disappearance of his father twenty years ago. His investigation ends up by dragging himself into cyber universe of his father computer system creation. Thiz movie is a sequel from the first original movie ""Tron"" in 1982. The Director is unknown Joseph Konsinski, thiz is his first feature film for big screen. I can see some weaknesses around the plot and unnecessary dialogue, particularly in the middle of the movie. However, the high concept of how they build a whole new neon futuristic universe is fascinating, especially the bike and the car which are very dashing and impressive. I think all Cast members look cool, but only in their styles, not acting. The sexy skin tight costume on Quorra (Olivia Wilde) and Gem (Beau Garrett) are totally jaw-dropping. Michael Sheen transforms into some sort of David Bowie's character as the charismatic night club owner named Zuse. Some action scenes are driven by great fusion of electronic beats by Daft Punk. Do you notice that the duo French electronic DJ also appears in thiz movie? Where are they? In case, if you have missed it, they appear as the masked DJ at Zuse's Club! I know thiz movie leaves behind tons of unanswered questions, but personally I also enjoy a new whole concept of philosophies (just like in ""The Matrix"" {1999}). There are so many stuffs to think about. Why do we have to chase for the perfection? While it has already there, right in front of us all these times. Since a long time ago, I'm concerned that many of young people in thiz generation have been wasting hundreds of hours by playing video games, while there are so many things to do. Kevin Flynn is right! ""The only way to win thiz game is not to play it"". These whole things are not just about user Vs. program, Tron Vs. Clue, blue Vs. orange, or evil side Vs. good side. The movie simply reminds us that the biggest enemy is no one other than ourself.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",TRON - Legacy
165,MovieProductions,Hands down THE most fun movie I've seen this year,8,27 December 2010,"***1/2 out of (****)Tron, the enormous 1982 action extravaganza, blew away audiences with its sleek designs and was one of the first of its kind. Who would of thought that 28 years later, those once ground-breaking special effects would be now considered outdated and unimpressive? Furthermore, who would of thought that nearly three decades later, a sequel would sweep under the rug? Whether you like it or not, Tron: Legacy is here. Although, ""Legacy"" isn't just here. It's arriving in the iconic IMAX 3D, not only enhancing its eye-popping visuals but the admission fees as well. With a 48% on Rotten Tomatoes and mediocre box-office numbers, you'd think such a film should be avoided like the plague. I'm here to tell you that Tron: Legacy is hands down, the most fun movie I've seen this year. It definitely takes advantage of its behemoth of a budget.Now seeing a three and a half star rating may have you believe I'm just a sucker for eye- candy with no taste in movies. That couldn't be farther from the truth. As for Tron, when the eye-candy is this impressive, is it really necessary to dissect this film from start to finish? When style is done this effectively, I have no problem awarding a movie a strong recommendation. What makes this film so cinematic is its soundtrack. While I was dumbfounded, in a fantastic way, by ""Inception""'s soundtrack, I absolutely adored ""Legacy""'s. The combination of classical and electropop is perfect. Daft Punk definitely has the chops to be music composers for blockbusters. Now, the gigantic reason why anyone is even in line for this movie is because of its technical aspect. Never have I been this immersed with a film's technical side since 2009's ""Avatar"". While movies usually carry a good dose of style, it is almost rare that the style is this broad and live. Moreover, the return of Jeff Bridges is impressive in itself. He was in the original ""Tron"" too! And how can I forget the star power? Olivia Wilde is certainly ravishing to look at. To top it off, having the real life scenes in 2D and the grid sequences in 3D is such a genius idea. I think Joseph took a few notes from Wizard of Oz's blend of black/white and color.Now here's the one million dollar question: is the IMAX 3D worth the hefty bucks? It is worth every penny. The sound is so loud, the 3D is that much more immersing, and the visuals just jump off the screen. It's easily one of the most fun times you'll have at the cinema. While this film's selling-point is its eye-candy, it certainly has its flaws. First up, while the dialogue isn't terrible, it's just so ordinary and doesn't feel real. No lines are quote-worthy and never make it above ""average"". To top it off, the script can be inconsistent at moments. And lastly, for it being a blockbuster, the characters didn't seem too involved. It's just like they were there.In brief, ""Tron: Legacy""'s style may outweigh its substance but when the style is handled in such a smart direction, the film should be given props. Flaws aside, this is one hell of a ride. An impressive soundtrack, some of the best special effects you'll see in a lifetime, and eye- popping IMAX 3D make Tron's outing a nice one.",TRON - Legacy
166,Qanqor,What's the word I'm looking for? Brilliant?... Wonderful?... Ah yes: Lame.,3,19 December 2010,"I really wanted to like this movie. I liked the original. And while I generally dislike the modern proclivity to remake, reimagine, and sequelize *everything*-- generally to me an indication of phoning it in rather than taking the trouble to have a fresh idea-- Tron did seem like a reasonable idea for an update. And in some ways, the update succeeds, at least visually.But sadly, this is just another instance of the all-too-ubiquitous genre of our age: Special Effects In Search Of A Movie.Others have already pointed out how they've totally lost sight of the idea that the Tron world is supposed to represent the innards of a computer, but now it now longer remotely does, it's just a Matrix-esquire virtual reality, so I won't go into that extensively. I'll just say that, it seems particularly weak that *now*, in an era where more people are computer literate and understand *more* about what a computer is and how it works, that the movie chose to have *less* regard for making things in any way like an actual computer.But my big complaint is (as is so often the case) the plot. The plot just makes no sense. And what's worse, it makes no sense in that sloppy way of evidencing having been written by people who just don't *care*. Anything that seems cool, sure, throw it in. Don't bother worrying about logic, reason, or consistency. So where the original Tron was about how a guy managed to digitize himself and get into a computer-- a far-fetched but semi-plausible idea-- this one's climax revolves around the idea that the programs are somehow going to go out into the real world and take it over. Huh???? Does anybody remember what a program *is*? It's a set of instructions for a computer to execute. It requires, therefore.... a computer!!! *WHAT* are these programs going to be running on when they're in the real world? It sort of made sense that the digitized humans could have their minds effectively digitized into software that the computer could run as a program, it makes *no* sense that a program could independently exist in reality with neither computer nor fleshy brain to run it.But let's get to some other less critical but still head-scratching plot points. What's the deal supposed to be with Tron himself? He was a good guy, and then *for no reason that anybody bothered to explain or even think about* he was a bad guy, and then at the end, *for no reason that anybody bothered to explain or even think about*, he as a good guy again. Yeah, the basically-good guy having an epiphany and saving the day in the end is a great, classic device-- see Han Solo in the original Star Wars, or Darth Vader in Return of the Jedi-- but most film makers at least take the trouble to *explain* the character's transitions. TRON: Legacy can't be trouble with such outdated issues, that's part of that old-fashioned *story telling* thing that's *so* passe!Or how about just a basic technical issue, one that *everyone today who's ever used a computer* (and that's everyone reading this) can relate to: This ""grid"" that Flynn the Elder left behind circa 1985-- has been running continuously for *twenty-five* years? Think about that for a second. For 25 years, there's never been a power outage. No software crash. No hardware failure. The disk didn't die. Memory didn't get corrupted. Not a single problem with keeping this thing running for *25* years. With *nobody* looking after it or maintaining it in any way. How many have you have managed to keep your computer operating continuously for *one* year?And what was supposed to be so truly wonderful about the great, mystic, amazing, miraculous iso's? They're supposed to change *everything*: physics, religion, you name it. And when we finally meet one? We meet a very nice, capable, young lady. What about her was going to change life as we know it? Remind me, did she show a single remarkable attribute or ability?And finally, let's talk about the most insulting plot point. I mean insulting to our intelligence. The existence of the Clu. Flynn the Elder casually tosses off a line about ""so then I wrote this program that would think like a person."" Like, oh, he had a couple extra hours one weekend, so he tossed that off. The Holy Grail of the field of computer science that vast armies of AI researchers have been striving to make *any* progress on for half a century, and that becomes just an oh-by-the-way part of the story. I suppose that the next weekend, with a little more time on his hands, he cured cancer. Oh by the way.So again, to summarize, this movie was long on flash and short on intelligence. The veritable bane of our age.",TRON - Legacy
167,thomvic,"Visually stunning, gorgeous cast, predictable storyline",5,31 December 2010,"When I saw this movie today, I honestly didn't really know what it was going to be about. All I knew was that it had something to do with a video game designer or something like that. So me and my friend were wondering what we were going to see.And I was entertained and intrigued till the halfway point. Garett Hedlund plays a spunky lead character, though more of a cliché type of character in these type of movies. He plays Sam Flynn, who gets sucked into another world that was created by his father, who is trapped in this other world, almost like a video game in fact, in which the world has turned into chaos due to a programming malfunction due to the fault of his father.This is also one of those father son bonding movies in which it becomes a bit cliché. Sam also meets intriguing Quorra (Olivia Wilde) who is an ally of Sam's father, and is interested in the world outside the digital universe and into reality.The visuals in this movie, I will say are terrific. It was amazing to see what they could do and how they could create this new world. After the first time Sam gets into this world, I was fascinated as to what exactly this world was about.But then once I figured out the real plot line, I felt it became another predictable creation gone wrong, an escape out of the place and the whole father son bonding thing taken aboard again. The performances overall are fine, though I do think Sam is another cliché character. It's mainly due to his good looks that makes him more watchable. Oliva Wilde does a good performance of her character, though I did feel they needed to develop her a bit more, and perhaps the relationship she has with Sam. For once, they don't make this about the love they have between them, because essentially they don't go down that path here, though the ending may definitely imply it.So while I will commend the gorgeous visuals and cast, and the intrigue they try to bring, this felt too out of this world for me, which is funny considering that is the whole point. It becomes very digitalized for me, and I lost interest in the plot when I could predict what would happen and was simply waiting for the end to unfold at least half an hour sooner. I think the main problem is that the human emotions and performances feel detached due to the effects and the world they are in. I really couldn't connect very well with the characters so I didn't actually really care much about if they got out of this place or not. It feels as though the human characters are more second nature to the visuals and world around them.And it is a pity because I can tell they are trying their best to make us symphathise with them, but it just didn't click as well as it should.Sequel? Well most likely. I would probably wait for it on DVD though, so I won't be in a rush to check it out.",TRON - Legacy
168,Endless_01,An underrated visual spectacle.,8,8 July 2019,"Tron's original film was a classic snapshot respected for its incredible and extensive use of special effects and original narrative, acquiring cult status over the years, the sequel made for 2010 was something quite satisfying and great to experience.Tron (2010) is an excellent entertainment film full of amazing visual effects, a great scenography, a multitude of completely digital environments that give an incredible and unique atmosphere plus a simple and good search and find story. Tron is not a movie full of ultra complex plots or existentialist dialogues, but it is a movie that manages to entertain pleasantly working as it is; an excellent action movie with high levels of audio-visual quality. The scenes inside the world of Tron are fascinating, full of life and mystery, accompanied by a marvelous soundtrack reminiscent of the 80's, composed of nothing more than the great duo of Daft Punk. The characters in the film are entertaining, sincere and well structured, each brings a different cup of variety and originality to the table, being the protagonist probably the most cliche of all, but still manages to satisfy, especially by the decent chemistry that manages to create among the characters around it.The movie may not be so iconic or a revolutionary milestone in special effects, but it is a quite entertaining film that does not overexpose itself or tries to complex more than it should. It is entertaining for what it is and it was an excellent experience to see it in its premiere thanks to its wonderful synergy between visual and auditory narration. A good film that will please fans of adventure and action, and especially those seeking new experiences for their senses.",TRON - Legacy
169,jaredd,Deserves a higher rating,9,9 September 2021,"Objectively, this film is near perfection - for the target audience. If you're not in the target audience, don't leave a low score.

a pulsating score constantly dripping with coola complete virtual world that has some of the best visuals put on filmthe insanely beautiful Olivia Wilde to fall in love withsexy, viscous, evil, grace, charity, intrigue; emotions all over the placea satisfying endingThe only negative in my mind is that the film basically ignores the big question on everyone's mind: how. Yes, there is a suspension of belief for the travel between the physical and virtual, but at some point there needed to be an in-your-face attempt because otherwise it's a bit difficult to ""believe"".

I only wish they could have expanded this world more because there is so much you could do with it. Come on, where's the third movie.......Soundtrack-one of the best ones ever made. Period.Visuals-surprisingly good, less video-game like, but I don't really care about that.
And come on, the de-aged Jeff Bridges is supposed to be a computer program; unlike CGI Moff Tarkin in Rogue One.Action-the visuals prop the action up. Still better and more memorable than most Marvel movies.Acting-Mediocre, but that's not why we're here.Plot-Well, at least there's no McGuffin, unless you count old Jeff Bridges.World-Building-Make the third one, Disney, or the geeks will never forgive you and you'll be sorry.

172,evan_harvey,"Amazing visuals, okay plot, shallow story",7,16 December 2010,"Just got back from Tron. This film looks frickin' amazing. The SFX are incredible. I saw it in 3D, but to be honest I didn't notice it much, so it's hard to say whether it is better than 2D.Watch out for spoilers! Plot: Not too bad. Pretty standard idea: a bunch of computer generated AI want out.Story: Half-baked. The major flaw is that the story is told in a very shallow fashion. There's interesting things going on like a rebellion, but it's only given a cursory nod. What would have been better is if the protagonists interacted with the underground rebellion. The rebels play only a bit part in a single scene, which is a shame. Jeff Bridges' character also seems to possess some kind of aura/status, but it's underplayed. He appears to have an effect on his surroundings, but it's not given full use. The character of Tron is also largely wasted.Acting: Nothing too great. Not bad by any means. Jeff Bridges' human character seems to be trying to channel the Dude from The Big Lebowski, and it's ineffective. Maybe that's how people spoke in 1985, but it just sounds silly.SFX: Unbe-frickin-lievable. This film has style in spades. Even with the slightly rubbish way the story plays out, the visuals make it worthwhile. While a little disappointed in the story, my eyes were glutting themselves on the CGI. Very, very cool.End result: 9 out of 10 for the visuals. 6 out of 10 for the average storyline. 7 out of 10 final score and well worth the money to see it on the big screen.",TRON - Legacy

175,trnjamesbond,TRON: Amazing,9,22 December 2010,"I knew even before I went to see this film, that it would be worth a watch, I have read many reviews, from people that love it and people that hated it, but the way I see it for those who hated it, they are just to critical by saying things like, ""It borrowed too much from Star Wars"". Well, I didn't see anything from Star Wars in this movie. I loved it the moment it started, I've seen recent 3D movies including my last one that I watched, Resident Evil 4, which relied on 3D effects more than a story line. But in this film, the 3D effect was just an added bonus, Every person that acted in this film was awesome, I felt like I was in the grid, just by the amazing score of the film, never mind the 3D, the music was awesome, even though it was repetitious as a matter of speaking. But effective, kind of like the music score from a James Bond flick,but we all love that score, don't we? If this technology existed in 1981 I think it would have blown people's minds away, but films like this, with this kind of out of the box thinking got side tracked, and didn't get any fame until years later, the film Dune, by David Lynch failed at the box office, but like TRON is now a cult classic. Maybe because it is a film outside of the box, and takes brainwashed commercialized people to take a while to figure out the meaning of these films. The only viewers that put this film down are the people that just like mainstream films and nothing more. They feed off of this. And at the beginning of this film we get introduced to this kind of behaviour from Dillinger's son and the board of directors of ENCON. The one board member says they have seen nothing new to the operating system that Flynn programmed. And the CEO's rebuttal was,""Well we'll just slap version twelve on the box"". Hinting that the people that buy their products are just mindless drones.Well in today's society that's not too far from the truth, people today are brainwashed into this way of thinking, even though, the new version of electronic products they buy is not much better than the last one. But what blew my mind is that in the film, Flynn's son Sam, breaks into ENCON and hacks into the main computer and gives away to the world the operating computer system for free. Something about this sends a message, maybe in the future technology will be free, and maybe money will not matter, maybe, just maybe human beings will come before monetary gain. Well with all this said, this movie in turn was a great film, filled with great score, and new insights on the future to come, along with rehashing the strong points of the original film. I went to see the late show with my wonderful girlfriend and our seven year old son. Even though he got tired during the slower scenes, he still stayed awake and said to us after the film, ""When I go home I'll have TRON in my head"" This made me happy, that he enjoyed it just as much as I did. And also one last thing, being it was the late show, and filled with teenagers, I for once didn't see annoying glowing screens light up from cell phones checking to see the time and when the movie was over. This tells me that Disney caught the interest of even the restless spirits of the teenage mind, and that's hard to come by these days.The original film was far ahead of it's time, and thanks to todays technology we can finally see ""The Grid"" as it was intended. Thanks for reading my review.",TRON - Legacy
176,sinncross,More than just binary....,8,31 December 2010,"20 years after the disappearance of his father, Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund) receives a message from his father's rundown arcade. Upon investigating, Sam stumbles upon a secret room in which he is transported to the virtual domain of The Grid.It has been many years since the original Tron was released and the sequel plays on this by having a narrative that addresses the very absence of a followup to Tron ,very much like the protagonist Sam has to deal with the mysterious disappearance of his father. In this sense, the audience is very much like Sam as Tron Legacy is clearly designed to appeal to a new generation of moviegoers. This does come with its own set of problem, namely that the story fails to utilize the computer programing jargon which made the original so interesting. Programming is touched upon at times, but it almost feels as if the writer's felt it may complicate the story unnecessarily. While this may be possible, it does not stop the fact that specified jargon would have created a far more convincing context for the plot, as well as create some needed depth to the themes which are presented. It is a pity because Tron Legacy has the potential for deeper discussion but it rarely presents the opportunity for such an endeavour.Thankfully, the linear narrative is helped by an enthusiastic cast. Oscar potential is not on the agenda, but the actors are definitely watchable. The respective characters portrayed by Hedlund, Jeff Bridges and Olivia Wilde, who which the story revolves, are is likable in their ambition. Sam is a rebel who is wayward by his father's absence while Flynn yearns for nothing more but to see his son again. It is a compelling side story which brings about emotional response from both character, but unfortunately never ever convincing enough. Bridges also sports the chance to play Clu, the digital representation of Flynn. This is intriguing as ti allows Bridge's to also play a smug villain who is very different to that of Flynn. It is, however, disappointing to find Tron himself pretty much absent from the film considering how important he was in aiding against the MCP of the original film. Bruce Boxleitner gets some screen-time but it would have been nice for him to get some more.Either way, the visual and audio of the film are an absolute treat. There are some stunning uses of CGI and special effects that create an impressive visual design, such as the modeling of a younger Bridges and the stark contrast between dark and light create an almost monochromatic feel. It should also be said that the use of 3D is amazingly effective, especially when helping differentiating the real world to that of The Grid. The musical score was composed by Daft Punk: their upbeat characteristic really aids the film's overall tempo allowing action sequences to feel more intense and any slow moments to be almost forgotten.There are some sexualised women represented with tight bodysuits and profanity is hardly even mild. The film is action orientated but death sequences result in character deconstructing considering they are computer coding rather then physical beings.Tron Legacy ends 2010 on a high note. While it lacks the ambitious nature of the original story and with acting that is not always entirely effective, Tron Legacy is nevertheless an absolute feast for the eyes and ears. The film's minor shortcomings are just that as Tron Legacy overclocks itself in presenting an entertaining experience.",TRON - Legacy
177,TexasRedge,The New and Improved TRON??????,7,11 May 2013,"Better than the Original. I always had mixed feelings about the original 1982 Disney movie TRON. On one hand it was the most stunning visual master piece ever created for a major motion picture. On the other hand the visuals were so great that at times you couldn't keep up with the story because your eyes and attention kept wanting to focus on the visuals, and thus causing you to lose pace with the story. The original TRON was one of those movies that I didn't necessarily like, but while at the same time I didn't dislike it either.When I learned that Disney was making a sequel to TRON (28 years later), I almost didn't believe it, I assumed it would be a reboot or a remake of the original rather than a true sequel. Well I was wrong. It's a true sequel, and it greatly surpasses the original in every scope.I'm pleased to say that everything that the first TRON movie got wrong, this one got right. This one is easier to follow and makes far more sense than the first one did. Once again the visuals are mind blowing to look at. Also loved the way they created a younger version of Jeff Bridges with CGI.(they should have gotten an academy award for that). The light-cycles are just as fun to watch today as they were in 1982, only this time you fully understand what's going on (unlike the 1982 original where you didn't have clue what was going on, but damn, it sure looked pretty). I even liked the Electronic-Discothèque music used in the movie, it fits perfect with the elements of the film. Even the story for this movie is plausible and good. I actually liked the overall look of this film much better than the Square-ish Cartoon-ish look of the original. I though the chemistry between the actors was good. A solid good cast. I loved Jeff Bridges in the dual role. This movie was just fun, a lot of fun. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes Science Fiction, Superheroes, and Video Games, all of whom should enjoy this movie a lot. (((( I know I sure did.",TRON - Legacy
178,austin-takahashi,Tron: Legacy - 4 Stars,8,3 March 2012,"""Tron: Legacy"" is not a work of intellectual genius, but it is an achievement in the bond of imagination and technology. To make the most out of your viewing experience of ""Tron: Legacy"", I suggest that you do not attempt to understand its plot. It introduces a world so technically complex and complicated that I doubt even Mark Zuckerberg would enjoy studying it.That world is called The Grid, a digital realm where its citizens are called Programs who wear tight and partly glowing outfits. They talk and handle their bodies like robots, and when its evil dictator, Clu, decides to dispose one of them, they shatter into shiny, glittery grains of death. It's up to Kevin and Sam Flynn to prevent Clu from getting to the real world, because People don't die fancy like Programs. They just, you know, die.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/tron-legacy/",TRON - Legacy
179,lopcar1993,The Legacy continues,8,27 December 2010,"""Tron Legacy"" is what you would call pure eye candy with a heavy visual twist much like ""The Matrix""(1998) and ""Inception""(2010) the only thing that separates these two films from Legacy is there deep rooted stories groundbreaking visuals, thought provoking premises and phenomenal scripts from there respective directors. This sequel of the 1982 cult classic is rather simple stuff the screenplay by Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis is dull with uninspired dialogue and a lack of real emotions. But what the screenplay lacks the sheer power of this visuals, action, story and the return of Jeff Bridges as Kevin Flynn greatly makes up for the lack of compelling dialogue in this film. First time director Joseph Kosinski and cinematographer Claudio Miranda do a bang up job bringing this visually lush world to life breathing life into a rather lifeless film and in the process creating a fantastical film that literally jumps out of the screen. ""Tron Legacy"" is a massive improvement on the original in both visuals and style what the original lacked this absorbing sequel makes up for it with a high octane, bold adventure that is ripped right from the world of TRON, this film may lack compelling dialogue but it has just enough intelligence, style, charm and just enough well written dialogue to save this from being a disaster ""Tron Legacy "" is a magical in the sense of its wonder and excitement, in its visuals and its at times emotional father son tale at the heart of this film. This film is not one of the years best and it is nowhere near as good as any other high gloss Science Fiction adventure such as ""The Matrix"" or ""Inception"" but ""Tron Legacy"" proves to be one of the years most enjoyable popcorn adventure flicks and one of the most enjoyable film of this holiday season. I loved every minute of this wildly entertaining film.To watch this film you have to leave you inhibitions at the door, you have to leave logic at the door and just sit back and enjoy the ride, which is what I did. I just sat back and enjoyed this film for what it is flaws and all and trust me when I say this movie has a boatload of them. To save this film the embarrassment I am going to restrain from naming them. However, I will name one the plot; the plot of this film is so full of holes big enough that you could stuff the whole digital world into it. That is not the point of this film that is not why it was made. If this film was made to be ""Inception,"" it would be but sadly, it is not. ""Tron Legacy"" is a great looking thrilling film that works despite the obvious flaws it has all the appeal of the 1982 supposed cult classic (which I did not like very much). What separates these two films is the upgrade in special effects and story. I know I shouldn't like this film as much as I should but I cannot help It I did this is a very enjoyable film and an excellent way to blow nearly two hours at the movies. This film is escapism at its very best a film where you can sit there and watch as your senses bombarded with visual excess and stylish execution. If you are looking for 1hr. 50 mins of pure unadulterated escapist fun than look no, further than ""Tron Legacy"" a summer blockbuster released in the winter.",TRON - Legacy
180,jonnyhavey,The Dude in The Grid,7,19 December 2010,"""Tron: Legacy"" is the sequel to the 1982 movie ""Tron"". Jeff Bridges was the star of the movie back then and is the star of the film once again one year after his Oscar win. The Dude shows audiences the new meaning of cool with the help of the best 3D special effects to date (almost in the league of Avatar's) and one of the best soundtracks of the year created by Daft Punk. It is no wonder that the film is extremely entertaining and enjoyable even though it lacks much of a plot. The plot that it does have begins in 1989, seven years after the first film, when Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) the owner of the company Encom (a multinational computer technology company) tells his son, Sam Flynn (Garret Hedlund), a story about his work on a digital arena known as The Gird that he created himself. He says that he has discovered a miracle and that he would tell his son Sam about it the next day after work. However, after that conversation Kevin Flynn disappeared and was not seen or heard from for twenty years. Present day, Encom is now out of Flynn's control because Sam decides even as the majority shareholder to let the company roll without his help. Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner), a good friend of Kevin Flynn, receives a page from Flynn's office and immediately finds and gives Sam the keys to his father's old video game arcade called Flynn's to check out where the page came from. Sam finds his father's hidden office and is beamed into The Grid. Sam discovers that his dad was trapped because of a program he created called Clu (Jeff Bridges again) who was supposed to create the perfect world goes too far. Sam, Kevin and a program named Quorra (Olivia Wilde) have to stop Clu's plot while journeying through the beautifully created digital landscape meeting a man called Zuse (Michael Sheen) along the way back to reality.""Tron: Legacy"" is one of the coolest movies of the year for three reasons: Jeff Bridges, a kick ass soundtrack and 3D visual perfection. Jeff Bridges is able to play both the character of Kevin Flynn and Clu with the help of the technology that allowed Brad Pitt to age backwards in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"". He is as good as ever and brings a rebirth of his original Kevin Flynn character from ""Tron"" mixed with his The Dude persona from ""The Big Lebowski"". The performances of Garrett Hedlund, Olivia Wilde, Bruce Boxleitner and Michael Sheen are also very good and are able to make a lot of very poorly written dialogue sound good and not corny. With all of this being said the best part of the film is the Soundtrack reverberating through the theater combined with the 3D splendor of the visuals of The Grid. The visuals and the soundtrack work seamlessly together creating one cool movie.The plot is very shaky and lacks a lot of substance. Between some very cool action sequences the movie has to rely on the soundtrack and the visuals to distract viewers from all of the empty boring space on screen. The movie totally forgets about having a good story and good dialogue using it solely as an after thought. A lot of the logic behind the film doesn't make very much sense as well because despite the amazing display of visuals, not much is accomplished.The viewing of the original ""Tron"" is not necessary before seeing ""Tron: Legacy"". It is the 3D movie to see of the year and with a soundtrack created by Daft Punk and staring the amazing Jeff Bridges you can't go wrong. Now don't think, go see it right now and get sucked into The Grid!",TRON - Legacy
181,ingemar-4,A bland follow-up that fails to add anything really significant,4,26 December 2010,"This movie is in many ways a nostalgia trip. Both lead actors of the original - Bruce Boxleitner and Jeff Bridges - participate, Bridges in one, no two of the leading roles, Boxleitner in... well, let's call it one and a half. The same hunters and the same light-cycles. And we even get to visit ""Flynn's"", the arcade game hall. Visually, the movie is quite stunning. Not stunning as the original was (which was totally amazing for its time) but it does pretty well and gives us a surreal world where, at least initially, we get the feeling of being in a world where the usual rules do not apply. 30 years of development in computer animation gives us many new effects. How Bridges can do two parts, 20+ years apart in age, is downright amazing.But yet, something doesn't feel just right.The script fails, like in too many many modern movies, to tell us the story in a comprehensible way. It makes unnecessary detours. It spends too much time on predictable action. There are some big holes in the plot, like why Sam Flynn is sent to the dangerous games despite CLUs plan to bring him into the computer world.A particularly stupid side-track is Sam Flynn's sabotage against his own company. The movie makes a statement in favor of the free-is-when-you-don't-have-to-pay-for-nothing culture, totally failing to even recognize the difference between freedom and free of charge nor the economical effects of the layoffs he is likely to cause, an unnecessary diversion that is never resolved.It also makes a number of strange misses in the nostalgia department:The TRON character is totally wrong. Only late in the movie, it is revealed that the game grid master is really TRON, and yet TRON is never allowed to take any vital part of the story, only making some brief delay to the villain and then he is gone. Also, Boxleitner's dual identity as TRON is totally ignored, we don't get to see TRON's face and there is no communication with the character. How is it possible to forget about the hero that the movie is named after?Does the bit appear? ""Noo."" There is no bit. It only appears as some kind of model in Flynn's house. This also deprives the movie of much needed humor. Even the Tron 2.0 game included some bit/byte humor!The light-cycle race/duel is spoiled by introducing cheating. It is, for some reason, possible to cheat my making hand-to- hand attacks.The use of the name Zuse is relevant, but its usage is not. Using the name of one of the founding fathers of computing to an in-computer villain feels rather tasteless.The ending is disturbingly predictable. Of course Flynn had to die, since he is the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the movie. There is also no logic to why he would die by reuniting with CLU. It is just a way to kill a main character and ending the villain at the same time. Speaking of Star Wars, mimicking Star Wars seems like the only possible reason for the mistreatment of the TRON character. It isn't TRON, it is... Boba Fett! Moreover, CLU's betrayal of Zuse feels like... ""Oh no, not again!"".Finally, and maybe worst of all: Unlike the original, the TRON legacy world loses touch of being a ""computer world"" on several occasions. It introduces a very mundane common-world bar! The computer world has ordinary streets, they just look a little bit TRON-redesigned (rather than something that resembles a circuit board). And the villain's plan is to make... a perfectly ordinary Nazi army! The big dream is to get out of the computer world, which reduces it to a synthetic fantasy even from the movie's perspective. If we had gotten into the real world, then something interesting might have happened (although the parallels to Last Action Hero would have been unavoidable).In its best moments, the movie manages to be amazing by reusing ideas from the original, but it totally fails to add anything new, but instead the script is far less imaginative than the original. While the original had me analyzing and seeking computing-movie-connections (how many can spot the RS232 interface?), TRON legacy adds nothing of that kind. It is basically a rather bland action movie, which gets a bit about the crowd by reusing some elements from TRON that gives it atmosphere and some nostalgic value. It is not a masterpiece, far from it, rather a half-decent late follow-up to a masterpiece. It is what Blues Brothers 2000 is to Blues Brothers.4/10",TRON - Legacy
182,darrell-23715,Not a bad film but could of been really good.,4,26 June 2020,"When I first saw Tron 1, I was amazed and when I heard that they were going to make a second, I couldn't wait for it's release but, and with so many sequels, I was hoping that they didn't mess it up!
The film was released and yes my hopes were put to rest, yes they messed it up.
This could of been an excellent film and with the technology today that wasn't available with the original, they could of made an epic film but it wasn't to be.
The casting should of been addressed to start with, having Garrett Hedlund and Michael Sheen, didn't give the film much hope. I not saying that these two actors are bad, they are better suited to different roles.",TRON - Legacy
183,FlorisV,"Love it for everything it is, there is more than meets the eye",8,27 March 2011,"You have to like this film for what it is: an extremely audiovisual piece of storytelling where for a breathtaking world you've never seen before, at the cost of lacking in depth philosophy.This is not Blade Runner: there is much less philosophy and atmospheric gloominess. Daft Punk's soundtrack is something the two Frenchmen should be proud of, but Vangelis they are not. But their 80s computer style does fit very well into the mold. Even the men themselves, always wearing robot helmets, do in a somewhat dorky cameo. Visuals and sound are very much in harmony.Michael Sheen is absolutely fantastic, showcasing delightfully nutty digital versions of Ziggy Stardust and even Charlie Chaplin in only a couple of minutes. Olivia Wilde is absolute eye candy but her role in the film fortunately proves much more essential than that. Garret Hedlund does what he can in what I feel could have been explored better: the father-son relationship. Though fun to watch, this protagonist is a bit too much of the typical Yankee, daredevil macho. Jeff Bridges is good, but the digital, younger version of himself looks too fake, particularly his eyes.This is a film that, while not amonst the greatest of all times, achieved a hell of a lot of goodness. There could have been more background, particularly about The Grid, what exactly it was for and how the ISO's would revolutionize (medical) science and religion. But I hope this will be left for the sequels. Eventually, this movie is not about much more than escaping from a world that the Flynns accidentally get trapped in. But I am glad to see this film ultimately did well, the worldwide box office being double the amount of the budget. There is much more to explore in Tron than light cycles and disc throwing and I hope they maximize this potential.Despite how shallow some things may sound, don't write this off as just some gorgeous eye candy. Do watch this film more than once and you will appreciate the plentiful winks in dialog, acting as well as the creative visual transitions. While for the first watch, the ending is a surprising, weird sciency one to love.",TRON - Legacy
184,d_art,"'Tron Legacy' may be more style than substance, but that's okay.",8,1 April 2011,"InTron Legacy, the long-awaited sequel to Tron (1982), Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund), the son of the famous hacker, Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges), finds himself teleported into the computer world, the Grid, like his father had 20 years ago. There, he reunites with his father and they attempt to find a way back home. Meanwhile, Clu, Kevin's program (who looks just like Kevin), who rules the Grid, tries to stop them.I grew up in the 80's and I remember watching a video tape of Tron on Sony Betamax. This was back when E.T. and Raiders of the Lost Ark was still fresh in my mind. I remember I didn't quite fully get the story, but I knew that ultimately, it was the traditional ""hero kills dragon and saves the world"" scenario. The special effects were (and still remain) very unique. My friends and I had the toys too, although I never understood why the Tron action figure was purple. The charm of the first film WAS the whole cheesy video game aspect, complete with quirky sound effects, programs that walk around like people, being forced to fight for their lives while Users control their every move. A cool moment in that film was in the beginning--we see a kid in an arcade playing a Lightcycle game and messing up; the film cuts to the virtual world (the other side of the screen) where we realistically experience that moment firsthand, establishing the whole gag of that film.Tron: Legacy, on the other hand, attempts to take itself a little more seriously. The Grid here is a bit of an enigma. It's not fully explained what the limits and the laws of this world are. It doesn't have a direct connection to video games (which was basically why the first film had gladiatorial games). Unlike the first film, the connection between the virtual world and the real world is non-existent. What happens in the Grid has little to no effect on the outside world or vice versa. I had always thought this element was what made the first film fun. However, this virtual world could as easily have taken place in Mars or a different universe. AdvertisementThe story has complex elements, but the plot is fairly simple. While there is a part about how Kevin Flynn discovered something important while in the Grid, it's essentially a MacGuffin (a plot device to move the action). Jeff Bridges reprises his role as the aged Kevin Flynn and offers motion capture for Clu, a younger version of himself. Clu is completely CG, which looks real 50% of the time. Jeff Bridges is still fun as Flynn even if he may not be as vibrant as we remember him (he has aged/matured, after all). Garret Hedlund is a good choice as the sardonic Sam Flynn, and has good chemistry with everyone. Olivia Wilde is memorable as the sleek, attractive Quorra, a program who is curious about the outside world. The film is well-done and entertaining. Much like Star Wars Ep.1: Phantom Menace, it may not have met my expectations, but it has other cool stuff going for it. The Lightcycle action scenes are great. The gladiatorial games are fun. And, I loved the soundtrack. Daft Punk's score fits the style and mood of this particular universe almost like, I suppose, what Basil Poledouris did for Conan, which is a bold statement. This film is a fine feature debut from director Joseph Kosinski. Where it lacks in substance (the story), the film makes up for it with innovative visuals, action, and music. True, while it's more like a close cousin to the first film than its offspring, it still pleases where it counts.",TRON - Legacy
185,montera_iulian,"Visually stunning, Tron: Legacy doesn't offer enough reasons to care about neither the story nor the characters",6,16 December 2010,"This is a very ambiguous movie if you're trying to contemplate about it too much. It may appear to be a groundbreaking science fiction but it also may look like another pale blockbuster saved only by the visual effects. I'm not one of those Tron fanboys and I will not criticize the movie just for fun but I need to say that this film lacks in substance. You don't need to see the first movie to really connect the stories because there's an intro and many references through the movie about what was/is going on in this cybernetic game world. The story however it's pretty simple, straight forward (maybe too straight forward) and what enraged me the most was the lack of emotionality. It doesn't deal with emotions like it should have dealt. It's a flat storyline that gathers few crippled characters painted on a dark canvas. There's no real interest for the characters if you're not a fan of the universe. You will not care for neither of them, either they are on the good side or on the bad side, you will already know the result of this and you'll only look for the action sequences. Some say, that's enough for a movie like this to be considered good but I dare to raise the question: ""since when the visuals overshadow the narrative structure to make it a good movie?"". Since ""creation"" of cinema, the storyline is the most important thing connected to a movie. There are no ""ifs"" or ""maybes"", the story structure is the most important aspect of a movie and Tron fails significantly. It looks like a washed up palette of bright colors and at some times, it tries too hard to be that ""large scale"" type of movie so it gets silly and exaggerated in it's execution.The characters, besides of not creating enough interest for the audience and energy within the movie itself, are also not brought to life by the portrayals. At one point I felt more attached to ""Tron"" (the character) than to ""Sam Flynn"" for example. The best performance is really brought to screen by Michael Sheen's ""Castor"". Sheen gave another short but impressive performance while Jeff Bridges was simply ""on point"". I didn't liked Garett Hedlund as ""Sam Flynn"". I just didn't get his take on his role. It was so bland and boring I didn't even bothered with his character that much. Of course Tron must have some sort of ""feminine beauty"" to sell, so choosing Olivia Wilde was a pretty decent thing to do. I enjoyed every moment she was on screen. She put the D in the 3D at points (If I could say that).Moving to the technical execution of the movie, we have to acknowledge that ""Tron: Legacy"" will probably remain in history as a groundbreaking visionary film. It's superb contrast, it's clean image, it's dazzling visual effects and it's futuristic design should remain in history as probably the best to date. It's definitely a winner in visual effects category in any possible award show. Many like to compare this to Avatar but what they don't get is that what made Avatar incredible was the technology used in the 3D animation. The design and the color contrast, the details in that beautiful world created by James Cameron are the main important aspects of its ""visual iconic"" status. On the other hand Tron really impresses by simply the visual effects and how they really work with the audience. The design was not as complex as it was in Avatar, it was more flat and clean but at the same time it has the uniqueness needed to send shivers through your body and really make you feel that ""digital"" world. The atmosphere is also fantastic mainly because of Daft Punk's work. The music is really innovative and extraordinary. I don't know about an academy award nomination since it might be too futuristic for the critics but if you ask me, Daft Punk deserves a nomination. The score is brilliant and I can't think of something else that could fit this immersive world created.""Tron: Legacy"" it's a real experience when it comes to atmosphere and visual display but it has a lot of gasps and it really doesn't work as a story. It has a poor narrative execution and the characters are not that interesting to really care about one of them. Sympathy towards this movie is plenty though, and I really do think it will be a timeless movie but only because of how visual bold it was. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to have a good time at the cinema, I recommend it to anyone who's in love with dazzling 3D experiences and I think I could actually recommend it to anyone since it is a must-see movie.",TRON - Legacy
186,aaronjbong,A Cyber-Epic Film With an Amazing Rendering of the Digital World,9,17 December 2010,"A science fiction movie made by Disney seems interesting enough especially when it's live-action and targeted for kids (Disney targets its movies for kids, right?). And there it is, ""Tron: Legacy"", a science fiction movie, Disney science fiction movie, live-action and targeted for kids. And yet, 3D.""Tron: Legacy"" is actually a sequel to the 1982 revolutionary film, ""Tron"" and marks the directorial debut of Joseph Kosinski. ""Legacy"" sets Kevin's son, Sam Flynn, 27 years in age as the main character who gets a message from Kevin (or so it is) from the world of Tron. He then goes to Flynn's arcade, enters some sort of mysterious room and plays with a computer which digitized him and entered him to the world of Tron. Then, he fights with other programs trying to find his father, Kevin Flynn who disappeared years ago. On the way, he meets Quorra, some cool machines and of course, Clu (Kevin's program).I watched ""Legacy"" and found it to be really good. The rendering of the world of Tron was really breathtaking and got me in awe. All of the world is definitely going to make ""Tron: Legacy"" one hell of a blockbuster film and surely, one of the best films on the year 2010.The acting had no problem. Jeff Bridges, after all those years since the first film is still fresh as ever. Garrett Hedlund was also not a problem in the film. Olivia Wilde as Quorra was stunning. The acting was definitely perfect. Everything.The 3D effects. This was one funny thing. In the beginning of the film, it was noted that some parts of the film were in 2D and some were in 3D and you were asked to not take your 3D glasses off. I did broke the rule several times and saw something unique. Parts that were set in the real world, not in the world of Tron were displayed in 2D and parts that were set in the world of Tron were displayed in 3D. Anyways, the 3D worked pretty well. The Lightcycles in the film and all the things in the world of Tron, displayed in 3D were awesome.The score of the film was also exciting. (The soundtrack was also great as it reached number 10 on the Billboard 200.) It was very awesome and thrilling with all the bass and everything. Overall, ""Tron: Legacy"" is worth to watch. 3D works pretty fine in watching this film. Young kids would not really like this but maybe aged 8 and above would do. I believe this is the best film for December 2010 and is a good way to end blockbuster movies of 2010. Great job, Kosinski.

188,el_monty_BCN,"Visually, it's stunning. Narratively, a clunker.",3,4 January 2011,"First of all, know this: if you think you will ever want to see Tron Legacy, even if you have no more than a passing interest, then I urge you to do it at the cinema. It is a breathtaking visual spectacle of the highest magnitude, in the category of Avatar, and this being the greatest strength it has to offer, you will be certainly missing out if you leave it for the DVD. Narratively, however, it's a disappointment. It's sketchy, chaotic and unsatisfying. It's not like the original could boast the strongest or most coherent of screenplays, true, but it got by on its originality, its zippy energy, its humour and its wide-eyed naivety. This sequel, inflated with grandiosity, too somber and overambitious, has none of those things. And you get the feeling that the plot is just a mishmash of half-baked ideas. I found it quite baffling and disappointing, for example, that Cillian Murphy (probably the second most famous actor in the entire cast!) made a blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearance at the beginning as Dillinger's son, no less, and then never showed up again! And there are a couple of important details about it that struck me as particularly wrong and at certain times almost threw me off the story completely: one, Michael Sheen, who is an actor I admire but whose absurd histrionics here were absolutely, completely out of place; and two, the rendering of the young Jeff Bridges is simply not life-like enough (even if he is not actually supposed to be a ""human"", other ""programs"" around him, starting with Olivia Wilde and Beau Garrett in their slinky outfits, certainly look and feel human enough!). The technology is not quite there yet, I'm afraid. It is one thing to be able to integrate a non-human character like Gollum in a live-action film and make it work, but a we, as humans, have a very fine-tuned perception of what another human is supposed to look like (and especially a famous one like Bridges) in a real environment, and computers still can't trick us that far.",TRON - Legacy
189,J-bot6,Well worth seeing,7,17 December 2010,"I was 10 when I saw the first TRON film. The director of TRON Legacy was 8. So, we'd both remember the context of the first film, and the zeitgeist of 1982. This pays off in a big way in TRON Legacy, in its ability to give the audience both a sampling of the feel of the arcades, movies, and music of 1982 as well as an appropriate update of look and feel for 2010. In short, this film represents a worthy sequel to the original and a genuinely entertaining experience. Jeff Bridges does an amazing job of playing more than one version of himself, right down to vocal inflection. It was a pleasure watching the various characters that he played and his consistent treatment of them. Bravo! Bruce Boxleitner was also good in this film, as were standouts Olivia Wilde, Beau Garrett, and Michael Sheen's Ziggy Startdust-eque character. Visually, this movie is stunning -- and so it should be. It was nice to see the implementation of the Light Cycle concepts that Syd Mead had intended for the original film, blended with new designs. I also really enjoyed the designs for the Recognizers and the city. Things were nicely modernized, while maintaining the feel of the designs from the original. Anyone who enjoyed the first TRON film will dig the 'making of' documentaries on the 25th anniversary or laserdisc box set. This helps put the original film into proper context and sets the stage for Legacy. In the case of this film, it was great to see a real arcade for a change (as well as a full-size upright TRON coin-op in all its glory). What a welcome blast to the past! The soundtrack is excellent -- and not simply for Daft Punk's contributions. There are other artist's songs included here, and good selections at that. Whoever selected these tracks certainly recalls what was rockin' in '82. Daft Punk was a wise move for scoring this film, since they understand the early 80s and are a draw for the 90s and 2000s generations. That, and they are familiar with electronic music and the early years of analog synthesizers. If I had any qualms, it would be the re-use of quotes or phrases from the first film. This is becoming a trend in sequel-writing (e.g. Star Wars ep I, II, III). It's a technique that appears to be put into use in order to act as homages to the original film, and a way to reward fans that have quotable lines memorized. However, instead of paying respect to the original films, I find that the re-use of lines cheapens the lines' appearances in the original films. So, if there are screen-writers out there that are thinking of slipping in lines from an original film into a sequel, please don't. Other than that, I'd say the ending was a bit anemic. Then again, it wasn't a bad ending, either. As you might have guessed, this film has enough dangling strings to warrant more installments.Is this a deep intellectual and finely polished film? I would say no. What I will say it that TRON Legacy does exactly what it should do.... It entertains splendidly, delivers an audio-visual feast, interesting characters, and a story line that you can take as either simple action or something a bit more deep-dish. From whatever perspective you decide to view this movie, I think you'll come out of it feeling that it was money well spent. Whereas many films are ones that I will only watch once -- I intend to see this film more than a few times.",TRON - Legacy
190,FilmFanatic03,Undecided,6,2 January 2011,"I think the most obvious compliment this film can receive is the groundbreaking and amazing CGI effects used in this film. It has gloss and sophistication to the style of the film in the game world, the sophistication and modern look was evident. Even the casting was not bad, i thought it would be corny and cheesy but it wasn't, not Oscar worthy but decent enough for this film. There was a stillness, a calmness about this film and i think that's because the aim of the film was for the audience to be, almost in awe of the amazing technology presented in this film. There was action in the film but there was a dominance about the film and i liked that about Tron. I think that the film lacked that fun factor that you find in a good action film, like ""The A-Team"" (2010) where it has action but its fun and enjoyable to watch. ""Tron Legacy"" had the action, but not the fun. So i don't know if that's a negative or positive because you do feel in awe of the game world which is maybe why the fun isn't seen...if you know what i mean. The music by Daft Punk (never heard of them before) was amazing, it really fitted with the whole electronic theme of the film and it blended well with the different moods within this film. Overall i would say it is a good watch, not as enjoyable as i thought and i'm undecided if the fact that it didn't have that fun factor is a good thing or a bad thing, but it is still a really good film and worth the watch.",TRON - Legacy
191,blackmambamark,"If 'The Beatles' are to ""Avatar"", then 'Pink Floyd' is to ""Tron: Legacy""....take that how you will.",8,17 December 2010,"When is the last time you saw a Disney movie in December? Hard to think isn't it. Normally around this time, each studio breaks out their big guns just in time for Oscar season. But Disney has refrained from doing so for quiet some time........why? And an even bigger 'Why' is, why make this sequel now? Why not 5...10...or even 15 years ago? Many questions surround Disney choices as of late, like spending over $250 million to make an animated feature with ""Tangled"".......well, if this outcome is anything like that, than we are surely in for a treat.Okay, regardless of what you may hear or read about this film in the coming weeks, i want you to totally ignore it. Because going into this movie, i read numerous negative reviews, mainly circulating around problems with the script and the amount of depth. But i can tell you this right now......this movie is without a shadow of a doubt, the best 3-D movie i have ever seen. Wait a minute, does that count ""Avatar""?.....you bet your ass it does.Don't get me wrong, i love me some ""Avatar"". I once said that it was a visual revolution. Well, it seems that it's wake has proceeded it. The best comparison i can give is this......If The Beatles are to Avatar, then Pink Floyd is to Tron. Take that how you will.Now, what makes this film oh so great? Well, a number of things. First is the amazing visual effects. I'm sure you know what your in store for by just watching the previews, but let me assure you, that is just a small appetizer compared to the feast that awaits you. Within the first 30 minutes of this film, i was literally wiping the drool from my jaw.....and the movie did nothing but get crazier and crazier with it's effects.Second, is the combination of the set decoration and the musical score, which combined, are hands down the best portion of the movie. Not since ""Star Wars"" or ""Indiana Jones"" have i seen a musical score fit the set detail quiet like this. Wait a tick, did i just make another comparison to ""Star Wars"" and ""Indiana Jones""? Once again, you bet your ass i did. This soundtrack is so good, it will convince you to go out and buy it, regardless if there are no words.....yes, it is that good. DaftPunk, i urge you to tackle more projects like this....please, i bet of you.Now, the story does not match the epic quality as everything else......however, the story is good enough to keep your interest and keep you entertained. In fact, i actually liked the story. Sure it had it's moments where it would slow down from it's vigorous pace.....but thats fine, it doesn't matter. The story is fun, and somewhat engaging, and you piece that together with everything else, and you don't even care if it has minor flaws.Bottom Line, i will say it once again, just so it can be tattoo'd into your brain. This is easily the best 3-D movie i have ever seen. You don't need to see the first one a thousand times or even once to understand it, and yet it still fits in nicely with the original. I applaud Disney for giving the Director the freedom to make this movie how he saw fit. I don't know who is it charge as of late, but they are making some very bold steps.....bold, and pioneering.",TRON - Legacy
192,pintaxandre,Do the writers even konw what a programm is?,6,21 December 2019,"That movie is damn frustrating to review.
Visually, it's a blast. The CGI is not perfect but the designs and colors are amazing.
The soundtrack is also very well done and from a very high quality standard.
Acting is meh but I will count it as ok because the actors had to play quite poorly written characters.
The plot is a disaster. So many plot holes and facilities to get at the finish lines. And let's not begin with the incoherences. A programm is not supposed to feel emotions! The villain is lame because of how bad the writers treat him. No character is very developed or in any kind of interesting way. However the ideas have a storng potential and it is just a pity that this movie came so close to being very good. Maybe a sequel will make this right once... Let's hope!",TRON - Legacy
193,jnguyen46117,Tron: Legacy: 4/10,4,29 December 2010,"Visually stunning and comes with incredibly cool toys, Tron: Legacy still fell flat on the story and had a very dull script. The story is about the son of a virtual world designer (Garret Hedlund) goes looking for his father (Jeff Bridges) and ends up inside the digital world that his father designed. He meets his father's creation, Clue (Jeff Bridges), turned bad and a unique ally who was born inside the digital domain of The Grid. Jeff Bridges played both the role of Kevin Flynn and Clue in this film. If you hadn't notice, they digitally rearranged his face so he'd look like a younger version of himself. Now talk about the 3D, sure the movie looked cool and all but the first thing popping up on the screen was ""This film is not all in 3D, some of its parts will be in 2D since it is shot that way."" Basically it meant the movie was converted at the end. There was not one scene that was meant for 3D that I can see. Although I loved the way the film looked and how cool the premise is, the 3D is laughable and the dialogue is annoying made Tron:Legacy fell short from its original.",TRON - Legacy

All the cast are very lifeless and emotionless you don't really feel their emotions their just full. The concept of the film is just so in realistic even for fantasy considering this film is made by Disney they really have let their standards slide here there is nothing Disney about it it's not magical nor has it got that exciting warm Disney feel to it. Everything about it is very blue the scenery the costumes..; the mood you feel while watching it all very blue if am being honest I wouldn't recommend anyone to watch it definitely isn't a film for me I'm so glad I never paid to see it in the pictures,",TRON - Legacy

This is the fact that they kind of get boring. I kind of feel like I'm lost inside a computer and it's not that fun.Overall everything was good. Olivia Wilde does the best here. Garret Hedland is just o.k. but pulls it off. Jeff Bridges I can't judge because his face is computer animated!The script was kind of basic, but the flashy computer animation made up for it. The flashy lights, and cool motorcycles were very entertaining. Otherwise it would have received a 6 out of 10.",TRON - Legacy
196,because-of-him,Tron Legacy: The GOOD and the BAD,9,6 April 2011,"I will not give away the plot, but will point out the good and bad. THE GOOD: THE PRODUCTION: I am a Tron fan. The original took the viewer inside the brains of a computer. The sequel, once it goes into the computer, shows its strength and is fantastic. The special effects are just that, special. You really feel as if you are inside the computer. And, the car race scene is more interesting than the original (but, I won't tell you how). I did not care much for the actors, but the actresses were better (and, may I add, hot!) The ending is short and to the point and is actually satisfying by not being long and drawn out. I give PRODUCTION a 9 out of 10.THE BAD: THE MORALITY: A few minutes into the movie, there is a scene where a young man on a motorcycle drives very fast though a busy city traffic highway. An officer clocks him at 103mph, and as the officer's motorcycle, with blue lights, nears, the man not only drives faster, but dangerously cuts off a large semi-truck and then jumps dangerously off the highway. This troubles me because it teaches young people to be dangerous. When I patrolled, I met similar teens who got away by speeding over 100mph on motorcycles. Also troubling is that the 'creator' wants to ""change science, medicine and RELIGION"", teaching young people that religion is as useless as old science like the earth is the center of the universe, and out-dated medical practices. Later on, the 'creator' is said to teach the Buddhist philosophy of selfless as ""removing oneself from the equation"" and later mentions ""Zen,"" a Buddhist teaching and sits in a Buddhist position. Young people might understand the selfless teaching as an approval of suicide. Then the movie moves towards liberalism by saying that the ice caps are melting (a wacko-environmentalists' wish) and ""the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer"" (a Democrats' socialistic anti-capitalistic promotion). I give the MORAL rating a 2 out of 1,000.",TRON - Legacy
197,gazzalodi,I admit I'm overly generous,8,18 July 2020,"The original was a signpost in my life. Just out of high school, not sure what I wanted to do with my life. Saw Tron and I decided ""THAT!"" Had a pretty good career with computers. So thanks Tron.There is no way this movie could be as ground breaking as the original. Disney does formulas these days, not pushing the envelope. They leave that to others. So yeah Legacy is just a safe follow-on. But for me it was still a thrill to revisit Alan and Flynn and see if they had the kind of enjoyable career I did thanks to them.Don't think there will be a third. The new characters just don't have the feel that the originals did. Too bad, but it was a good way to (nearly) bookend my career, I retired a couple of years later.",TRON - Legacy
198,h_wilson92,Absolutely Epic!,10,19 December 2010,I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since March of this year.It was #1 on my most anticipated movies of 2010.I have really liked the first Tron movie since I was a child.All I can say is that the visual effects and graphics are absolutely incredible.I didn't really care much for the plot- the plot wasn't great but the visual effects made up for it.I thought the visual effects were better than Avatar.I also thought the soundtrack was absolutely incredible - probably the best movie soundtrack this year.Daft Punk were the perfect band to compose the music for TRON Legacy. TRON: Legacy is one of the most incredible movies I have ever seen at the cinema.Don't expect this movie to have an amazing plot like Inception because the plot was simple and easy to understand. Is going to see this movie again for the second time today in 3D cos I enjoyed it so much.I feel like every cent i paid to see this movie was well worth it.10/10 is my rating,TRON - Legacy

I think a lot of people (mostly reviewers) gave this a poor rating is that they had their hopes set very high. You should come into this movie thinking that it will not be the best movie you will see and you should watch it for the entertainment value. It is highly entertaining, fun and has great visuals. The 3D is great even though it is not all 3D but has 2D pieces to it too(in the right places). At the beginning you will see you are in for a visual treat just by seeing the Disney castle logo before the movie. I think people are not really into very big special effect movies these days and that the good movies that has come out in the past year or two kind of make people raise their expectations. Not that you should lower them for this movie. Just be ready for a movie that is fueled by tons of big special effects and not by plot.",TRON - Legacy
201,BJBatimdb,Neon nonsense,1,30 December 2010,"Without a doubt the most disappointing, dullest film I've ever seen. Forget the 'Legacy' tag - this is just Tron 30 years on. And every bit as tedious as the original.Saw it in 3D which was a mixed blessing, as the film is so darkly lit that the tint in the glasses made some scenes truly muddy and hard to see. Far from being a CGI spectacular, Tron is monotonous in every respect - the colours, the script, the tone, emotional content. The fact that several characters are versions of Jeff Bridges is ironic, and symbolizes the entire one-note movie. It hits its strident stride about three minutes in and sticks with it throughout. Everyone shouts everything and none of it means anything.The plot is utter tosh which ticks staid little plot-boxes and moves on swiftly before it can be examined for any evidence of original content. There is none; it's depressingly old hat. Like the first film, you get the feeling the only point of making Tron Legacy was to show the bike-racing but with improved CGI. And, like the first movie, the dullness and confusion of those scenes in cannot be overstated.Jeff Bridges tweets in his usual old hippie routine - the Big Lebowski meets Robocop. He has bare feet! How very Zen! Everyone else in the film is too cardboard to review.There's no tension, no sense of threat, and the uniform uniforms make telling the goodies from the baddies a distinction not worth bothering with. Even the big Tron 'reveal' is a joke of Stig-like proportions, as he never takes his helmet off, so who the hell knows WHO he is? I would pick the plot apart, but fear I might expend more effort than the makers did in putting it together - which is not saying much.Halfway through this movie I left my friends and went to get an ice cream, just for something to do. Three airheads in front of me took forever to decide on cups or cones, nuts or sprinkles, one scoop or two. Far from being enraged by their time-wasting, I felt myself getting Zen like Jeff at the thought that - in this place and time - waiting in line for Phish Food was actually the highlight of the evening.I find it hard to believe anyone could write a spoiler for this movie more damaging than the screenwriters already have.A complete waste of money from beginning to end. Only YOU can stop it!",TRON - Legacy
202,theycallmemrglass,This will rock for fans of the original but others maybe scratching their heads,7,5 December 2010,"Saw this at a preview screening in London yesterday in 3D.First of all, I'll just say a few words on the 3D. I am normally anti 3D with non animated films as they tend to be too dark, and often blurry with fast action scenes, making real live action feel unreal. However Tron is mostly computer animated and is well suited for the 3d media. And here it certainly was effective. I especially loved the way they held back on the 3d until the right moment for maximum impact. Think of Dorothy stepping out of her house into Oz and you'll get the idea.I fall in the category of original Tron lovers but not a hardcore one. So for me, this sequel did rock for the most part. Remarkably it maintains the same atmospheric feel as the original and is flooded with nostalgic references to the 28 year old original. From the 80s jukebox in Flynns nightclub playing Eurythmics ""Dreams"" to the familiar world inside the computer brains. The now much older Jeff bridges exerts a more heavier gravitas on screen and voices his CGI counterpart in the Grid world that frankly still looks CGI but isn't a problem as they are computer avatars. At the beginning of the movie, a young CGI Bridges is shown in the real world but the lighting is darkened to convince us he is real...and they very nearly pull it off but not quite. The action cgi scenes are breathtaking and exciting, with upgraded versions of the famous grid race, sky battles, and disk combats. Visuals were stunning and faithful to the original aesthetics.Unfortunately, the middle of the film sags considerably and I did find myself yawning as the story did become a little disjointed. The soundtrack is brilliant, though very reminiscent of Dark Knight and Inception. Overall, I had a blast and is a worthy sequel that will rock the fans but I do feel however, that non fans will be scratching their heads wondering what the fuss is about.",TRON - Legacy
203,manigarg0000,Cool concept,6,16 March 2021,The concept of the movie is really interesting but it was predictable from the very beginning.

206,jordache-wee,28 Years and then... what?,7,30 January 2014,"Tron: Legacy continues from Tron after 28 years. The story begins with the disappearance of Kevin Flynn in 1989 and the search for Kevin. Sam Flynn, the son of Kevin, is all grown up. He went on a mission given by Alan Bradley and boom he's in the digital world, met his father and a beautiful program.This film totally lacks of a storyline but if you are too obsess with Tron, you won't even know about it. That is really weird after Sam enters the digital world. It's like he also disappear like his father and all the time he's in the digital world and yet no one in the outside world reports his missing too.The story jumps into the digital scene too quickly that we hardly know what is what for the new audiences. It just like one day, you were doing something and the next thing you know, bad things happens. That's really weird. Then he returns to the real world like there's nothing. And how did Quorra happen to be outside waiting at his bike? Didn't Alan Bradley notice of the girl at all? And of course when the hell did she exit so soon than him while his meddling with his father's pendrive?Overall, the film shows much of its digital essence of which we would want try out especially the light cycle and light jets if only that baton exist. Some scenes are a little dejavu to what has happen in The Matrix. Jeff Bridges is like the older Neo battling Agent Smith but CLU ain't as bad-ass like Smith.Truth is, the film is enjoyable.

207,mcw6957,28 Years later...,8,19 December 2010,"I was a 7 year old rabid Star Wars Fan when I first saw Tron in 1982 & I loved it. I believe I saw this movie for fifty cents at the time & at that time being that Disney found it to be a major disappointment it vanished rather quickly. Now if you don't know even the most successful movies released theatrically took a long time to reach the home viewer. The reason being is that the home video market was just dawning. So basically watching a movie in the comfort of your own home was a novelty.One that took a long time to reach you & when it did cost a lot of money to own.As for renting forget it.I can still remember the first video store that opened up in our neighborhood & even if you could afford the fees good luck trying to find anything on the shelf renting. The copies were limited to say the least. This lack of selection lead me to rent in later years movies by Troma,Argento & many many now cult classics from the 70's & early 80's. So Tron became unobtainable to me until it started popping up on the boob tube & once I learned how to record something off the TV onto tape well then I had my fuzzy commercial heavy copy all to myself. My point being is that Tron has been a healthy part of my life for 28 years. I didn't watch the initial Legacy teasers & go oh yeah I remember that movie I thought finally! Tron is everything the haters say it is & so much more & I love this movie every time I watch it. So Legacy is a sequel not a remake retelling or re imagining.BOLD! Jeff Bridges & Bruce Boxleitner reprise their roles.Hell Yeah! Disney opened the vault & poured tons of cash into the effects.OK. Bad news its 2008 & the movies not slated for release until 2010?!? Since I could not see the midnight showing I went to the next one early Friday morning straight after work. All plot holes & grievances aside Tron: Legacy did not fail to transport me back 28 years & leave me awe struck,on the edge of my seat & my eyes locked on the screen for every single frame until the credits rolled & the screen went blank. My first words were more more more more! Thats not an exaggeration. I could fill pages & pages of gushing accolades & geeked out fan boy bewilderment but it wouldn't make anyone want to see Tron: Legacy any more or less than they are already do. These movies are about individual appreciation not as many have said elitist cult fascination. I don't want Tron conventions or Tron to be embraced by the masses. As Sméagol said once: ""We wants it, we needs it. Must have the precious. They stole it from us. Sneaky little hobbitses. Wicked, tricksy, false!"" If there is never another Tron movie so be it. I've got two & thats more than enough. Thanks Disney for not raping my childhood. I appreciate it very very much.",TRON - Legacy
208,MarcusJ13,Made the effort and paid off,9,5 January 2011,"Tron Legacy is a film that brings a sequel to the innovative film from the 80's to the big screen. I was reasonably optimistic going in as I was not going in with expectations anything more than an effects extravaganza but thankfully this film provided slightly more depth than I was expecting. The film tells the story of Sam Flynn who goes to rescue his father from the virtual world finding out that the very invention his father made has turned for the worse. I heard from many critics and cinema-goers alike that it lacked in story but I thought it was more partly true as opposed to completely true. They seemed to make effort with the story even if it started to wear thin by the time the third act got along. The visuals are outstanding, even when there are not action sequences the shots of the crowd and general grid was brilliant. We do get the average performance from our lead Garrett Hedlund but to be fair he does the best with what the script gives him, had the dialogue been a little better we might have seen a more memorable performance from him in my view. There is of course Jeff Bridges in both young and older form. Without doubt experience showed and I found myself routing for this character more than Sam but then experience often shows in films like these kind of like Sigourney Weaver in Avatar. Even though the visuals were good the question then came as to whether the action paid off and it sure did. It may be a cliché but I did think I was there and is perhaps the first 3D film I've seen where I can say this. The soundtrack was astounding and did a great deal to add to the feel of this film. Elsewhere the performances were good Olivia Wilde did well as Quorra and in my view had more about her than the character of Sam Flynn but that may be to do with how they were written. I would recommend this for anyone who generally likes action films because it doesn't beat around the bush making with too much plot and knows what purpose it is supposed to do and delivers with wonderful visuals which tops previous films which have attempted to do the same thing. The only real qualm I have about this film is some of the script where it seems as if they are trying to fill a blank as opposed to writing decent dialogue. To summarise this film does well to keep the spirit of the predecessor alive and still makes for a visually stunning film.",TRON - Legacy
209,lekgolah,An entertaining first half is weighed down by an unnecessarily complex second,6,4 December 2011,"For those who grew up on the original, this was never going to compare but for the rest of us regardless if you have seen the first or not, had the possibility to surprise. While it delivers on stunning visuals and a brilliant soundtrack, the film outstays its welcome with a weak second half. In the first half, we are introduced to this new and exciting world where there are arena tournaments between two fighters, light cycle races and unique backdrops. It looks and sounds incredible, how the film did not get an Oscar nomination for its effects is still a question to me. However all that was enjoyable in the first half becomes diluted as the film tries to establish an annoyingly complex story about Clu, the antagonist trying to enter the human world or something like that. There is also a character twist but with all the henchmen looking the same, it became hard to differentiate one villain from the other. Obvious connotations to God and how he does not intervene with the world can be made with Kevin Flynn, played charmingly by Jeff Bridges, but never resonate to much. The film starts to loose its way when it could have been great, Kevin makes a dramatic entrance to save his son, Sam and friend but instead just escorts them out. Any other director would have used this scene to its full potential and had an exciting fight scene where one fights many. Something similar happens later when Sam is locked in room with two guards. Again the set- up is great as he prepares to fight but what happens next takes place outside the room. It is disappointing, maybe an issue due to the budget but something things are better shown than implied when the protagonist is the avatar for the audience and they are new to environment. But it is the first half that you will remember by the end of the film. The cast are good and Garrett Hedlund makes for a solid protagonist. The CGI is brilliant justifying the purchase of a blu-ray to bring the action scenes to life in HD. While the second half falls flat in places, the never does anything offensively bad making it worth checking out for fans of action and science-fiction films.",TRON - Legacy
210,jtwcosmos,Tron: Legacy (2010),10,18 April 2011,"""It's not a sequel. It's an upgrade."" If nobody said that... they should have.This is the story of a man who disappears inside a computer system and it's inner world, for a while. A world that is familiar to us from the previous installment, ""Tron"", created back in 1982.And for all intents and purposes this is an upgrade of the old story. Nothing more, nothing less. It is (almost) the same story as in the original movie, only with minor variations designed to accommodate a new character and a slightly different premise. The script is no more than a vehicle that allows the characters to go through the exact same trials, the same battles and the same stages as the original ones. Unfortunately the script does not get it's own upgrade and it may feel bland and slow moving at times.Only the visual and the audio effects are upgraded. And they are amazing. Fantastic. Incredible. Jaw-dropping. Unbelievable. Brilliant!The level of detailed refinement is positively insane and it is difficult to believe the amount of work that went into each and every single frame of this movie. Even if a detail is present on the screen only for a few seconds, it is worked out to it's utmost perfection. And each frame stands the test of repeated viewing and reviewing. There are not many films that compel me to watch then again and again, these days, but this one did. And every single rewind was worth it. And each time a new detail emerged, completing an astonishing picture.The music is fantastic and completes the visual experience brilliantly. It is unexpected, it is adrenaline inducing and at times it is outright magnificent.The actors have to compete with the two players mentioned above and it is obvious that they don't stand a chance. And I am convinced that not even Al Pacino himself would have had a prayer under the circumstances. But a second or even a third viewing reveals that they do a decent job and round up the experience beautifully.Tron: Legacy. For what it is, it is absolutely brilliant. 10/10.",TRON - Legacy
211,Kryzak,Stunning movie where the story does not get in the way,8,7 January 2011,"People who go into this movie expecting Oscar worthy script or performance are deluding themselves (even though Jeff Bridges is in it). This movie was made to ENTERTAIN. The story and acting was ""good enough"" so it didn't get in the way of the stunning visuals, perfectly written score by Daft Punk, and the joy and excitement of ""living"" in a virtual world. I saw the first movie a week before this came out, and while I appreciated what it did for its time, it was a pretty terrible movie. Tron: Legacy in my mind is in every way better than the original.One more thing, this is one of those movies (like Avatar) where you HAVE to see it in a REAL IMAX theater. What do I mean by ""real""? Not those retrofitted crappy AMC/Century ""IMAX"" screens, but the true big ones like the SF Metreon, or the ones in Dublin, LA Rave, etc... the full power of the movie and the IMAX resolution (for about 30% of the movie) cannot be released with a regular screen.",TRON - Legacy
212,janus-20,A good night out.,9,19 December 2010,"I rate this as a 9/10 as the human element in the film was a little muted, possibly half overwhelmed by the effects and the characters possibly could have used a touch more warmth. Niggles aside, this is SUPERB entertainment, exciting, well paced, visually stunning. The effects steal the show, very original and different from anything else in a crowded market these days. There are a fair few elements and references carried over if your a fan of the original Tron, which i am, they're scattered evenly throughout the film. The cast are great, Jeff Bridges is really good, as his character has matured due to events between Tron and Legacy, yet still has touches of the Kevin Flynn from the original. Michael Sheen's character is particularly enjoyable as well. The story is pretty straightforward, nothing too complex, but it has nice little ironies and subtle tones that you pick up on as you think about it, particularly after you've watched it. Overall, really good entertainment, i enjoyed it immensely and hope to watch it again before it finishes its run.",TRON - Legacy
213,jimwaldothefirst,Watch the Original first..,9,20 March 2021,"So my personal preference is still the original, obviously nostalgia and thats where most of the ideas were born, but for those who are looking for the more digitally enhanced cgi version, then this continuation of the story does a good job.My only advice is to actually watch the Original Tron first, because this is after all, a sequel, so you will be missing major parts of the plot if you skip straight to this.Other than that its a great movie and would recommend",TRON - Legacy
214,TourettesPersonal,It's All About The Visuals and Daft Punk,6,19 December 2010,"What are the reasons why see ""Tron: Legacy""? You must be a fan of the first movie, The visuals looks stunning, hot chicks, and Daft Punk. Unfortunately you might get disappointed cause of the weak plot and slowness of the pacing. But if don't care about the story then you'll enjoy the visuals and the music score of Daft Punk. ""Tron Legacy"" is still worth watching if you want to see some awesome visuals and love Daft Punk.The movie could have been better if there was a decent plot. The movie is completely dull but the visuals makes it very entertaining so does the action scenes. Besides the visuals the movie have Daft Punk. Daft Punk is the biggest reason why I'm here. Their electric music score brings a lot of epicness to this film.The script is poorly executed and acting isn't done well(except Jeff Bridges & Michael Sheen) because the director is more focused to the visuals. That's why it's all about the action, special effects, and Daft Punk. It'll be better if the visuals and Daft Punk aren't the only one that is awesome. It's still worth watching if like movies with eye candy visuals and if you're a fan of Daft Punk.",TRON - Legacy
215,ticket_for_one,Disney hasn't completely lost the plot when it comes to making live action movies.,8,21 December 2010,"Good film! A really good film! Between the first Star Wars Trilogy and the Matrix Trilogy you had Tron. The first film, which in itself is a great science fiction film and more or less pioneered the use CGI in movies. Tron Legacy is just as good if not better than it's predecessor. WHAT I LIKE ABOUT TRON: LEGACY. Firstly the visual effects are brilliant! Was a little worried about how the film as a whole was going to turn out in 3D. 3D has been done to death these past two years, but finally we have a movie that's worth watching in 3D! Tron: Legacy in 3D enhanced my enjoyment so much, I thought I was on some sort of amusement ride. Brilliant use of 3D in all the set pieces! The light cycle races and the hand to hand combat scenes were really great to watch! Tron: Legacy pays a lot of homage to the Star Wars and Matrix films. I'm not sure this was not the directors' intention, but it works well without looking corny.Performance wise, everyone less did a job in this film. Jeff Bridges resuming his role as Kevin Flynn, just reaffirms why he still one of the best actors of his generation, Garrett Hedlund who is consistently good was great as Sam and Olivia Wilde who most people know from the TV show House, offers good support. Good to see Bruce Boxleitner is still getting work and also Michael Sheen puts on another impressive display as he always does. Script was a lot to be desired but the actors work well with what they've been given. Good scenes between Bridges and Hedlund characters, reconnecting and Sam telling him how far technology has moved on. Really good chemistry between the two throughout the entire film. You might have to watch the first to understand why things have changed after the first Tron movie. In saying that the film explains the changes, so that the audience doesn't get lost in the story. Daft Punk soundtrack on this film is awesome! Kings of Electronica in my opinion!WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT TRON: LEGACY. Firstly, it didn't have to be as long as it did. Some scenes where entirely unnecessary and at some point I glanced at my watch, just to see how much running time there was left. Nothing major though! Secondly, the GCI used for imagery of the younger version of the Jeff Bridges character was great at times and not so at other times. I remember see the same CGI for Benjamin Button and it being done well enough for no one to notice anything awkward about it. As amazing as it looks, it did play on my mind a little.But I really enjoyed this film and it shows Disney hasn't completely lost the plot when it comes to making live action movies. I was quite surprised actually, because at times I thought it had rather a dark tone to it. Kids will enjoy this immensely and adults who remember the first Tron movie will love how technology has moved and upgraded the first movie to this spectacular offering. GO SEE!",TRON - Legacy
216,WYAdams,"Spectacular Special Effects and Visuals, Mundane Predictable Plot",8,23 May 2020,"Despite what some people say, this movie is so much better than the original ""Tron."" First and foremost are the technological advances that have occurred in the almost thirty years that separate the two movies.Like ""Tron"", which pushed the limits of CGI that was available in 1983, ""Tron Legacy"" takes full advantage of CGI, seamlessly integrating it to create a surrealistic world of what it might be like if one could enter the ""GRID."" First the high points.1) For those of us who were gaming in the early eighties, the scene in Flynn's game arcade, especially the music, carries one back to those heady early days of computing and gaming. We can visualize Flynn and his partners sitting in the upstairs office on the huge wrap-around sofa that was iconic eighties, discussing the future and dreaming of technology yet to be developed.2) The dramatic music, and special effects used when Sam Flynn is captured by the huge flying machines is spot on perfect.3) Beau Garrett carries off the role of Gem perfectly. She is everything you would expect from a beautiful and sexy digitally programmed woman. She has just enough of an android appearance to make her believable. She is also very sexy in the night club as she walks away from the camera with Sam in tow.4) The light suits with the winding circuitry convey the idea that these are programs, not men. Using red for Clu's bad guys, and white for the good guys is a great way to distinguish between them. Tron in his uniform is menacing and powerful, one can imagine him as the super competitor who has never been defeated, and never will.5) The battle scene is carried by the dramatic music when Tron appears, and is heard all through the battle. It transforms him from just another combatant to the super competitor that has been fighting on the grid since its inception. Without the music, he's just another competitor, with it, he is a superman.6) The light cycles, and grid battle are very well done and demonstrate the advantages of thirty years of CGI technological advances.7) Now we come to Olivia Wilde as Quorra. She is exotic, sexy, mysterious, while still retaining the naïve innocence of one who was created full grown with no life experience. Her question to Sam about what Jules Verne is like demonstrates this naivete perfectly. When I first saw her, I could scarcely believe she was the same woman who played the mundane Thirteen on ""House.""8) Using CGI to transform Jeff Bridges into the young version of himself as CLU is as close to perfect as can be done. If you did not know what Jeff looked like and only saw Clu, you would not know that this was not really Jeff.9) Having Clu make almost the exact same speech about ""out there"" as Flynn had made about ""in there"" two decades earlier was a brilliant way to demonstrate that he is Flynn as Flynn had been those two decades earlier when he created Clu.Now the negatives, and there are very few.1) The entire anti-capitalism, anti-big business, anti-profit-making theme that is carried on throughout the movie was an unnecessary and negative touch that extreme left-wing Hollywood writers just could not resist adding. One wonders how they expect a business to survive if it gives away all its products and never makes a profit. It's fascinating to watch them lecture us about the evils of Capitalism while they get rich from their movies, it's all hypocritical. I don't watch movies to be brainwashed by left wing extremist ideology, I want to be entertained, period!2) Continuing the thought above, we are constantly hearing the ridiculous line about removing one's self from the equation and the art of the selfless. Again, I reiterate, Hollywood needs to eliminate the ubiquitous and incessant left-wing brainwashing attempts.3) Was it really necessary to make Castor/Zuse so outlandishly and stereotypically gay? No movie or TV show is written without the inclusion of at least one gay or lesbian character, and it is starting to get old and predictable.4) The complete destruction of the world at the end, was particularly depressing. The only saving grace was the fact that Sam downloaded the entire world onto a memory device leaving open the possibility of its recreation, and a sequel, in the future.Fortunately, the positives outweigh the negatives by a considerable margin, thus the eight stars, and if one is willing to overlook the few flaws this is a must see movie, and one that I can watch over and over again.",TRON - Legacy
217,RockyMtnVideo,"A solid storyline, set in a VFX work of art",9,8 July 2020,"First, you don't really need to have seen the original Tron, in order to ""follow"" the sequel. If you know nothing more than its IMDB synopsis, the opening of Legacy does a great job of providing enough backstory to get you going.I should say that I didn't care that much for the original Tron. It was trying to do something unique, but the VFX technology wasn't quite where it needed to be, in order to support that effort, and there are times that, to be blunt, I thought the characters were just a bit to ""squirrelly"". I like my SciFi (and/or fantasy) when things are a bit more tense/serious, and Tron didn't seem to express that feeling.What makes Legacy work for me is that it sets a completely different tone, from the outset. It's a much more emotionally darker film, and the main characters are pretty much in peril, throughout the whole film. It has two things going for it, from the beginning. It has a good storyline, built around a son, trying to understand what happened to his father years ago; and today's VFX are up to the task of providing a strikingly different digital world, as compared to the original.But there's also a ""third rail"" that adds an unexpected boost to the film, and that's the Daft Punk soundtrack, which continuously drives the ""feeling"" of the film. That's even more true, if you have a subwoofer-laden sound system that can fully ""express"" DP's bass-infused score. Put simply, there's a lot of the film that you can simply ""feel in your bones"", which adds a whole other layer to what you see on the screen.The IMDB synopsis, and minimal plot detail above, is enough to know going in. Providing more detail would just be spoilers.In summary, there is a solid, deeply personal story arc, intermixed with some great action sequences, all supported by an especially engrossing soundtrack that compliments the story perfectly.(For anyone still lucky enough to have a 3D set, the 3D blu-ray version is worth the money. The flim is 2D, for the short period that it is in the real world, but the 3D kicks in when Sam is transported into the digital world, i.e. ""the grid"", which serves to give it a far more unique appearance, to set it apart from reality.)",TRON - Legacy
218,tobydale,I wasn't happy with this film,6,24 December 2010,"I'm not a computer nerd - and I'm not a cult fan of the original TRON (1982); although I do like and have a lot of respect for the original film. As with all films in the 6 - 7 band TRON-Legacy isn't a bad film, but it is a film that could have been so much better.Firstly - To make sense of this film I think you would need to see the original, and although there are obvious stylistic similarities, TRON-Legacy is not in the same league in terms of plot, dialogue, acting and ""feel"".The acting is poor, including, sadly, Bridges - who is normally excellent. I entirely missed Sheens character and only noticed him in the credits and had to look him up on IMDb! Very poor.The original film had a clear corporate ""dark"" bad guy with a megalomaniac twist. There is dualism throughout and we are held (in the slow burn way of early 80's films) in our seats to see how this pans out in the extraordinary domain of ""The Grid"". Good Vs Evil in cyberspace 1982 style. A good watch.In Legacy the dualism is retained but this time is generated by the original central character Flynn (Bridges). This is somewhat left field given the content and plot of the original film. I found this unsatisfactory; some other way should have been found - because the out turn is that Flynn is reduced to a babbling ""Zen-thing"" creation with dialogue straight from 1967 Haight-Ashbury. It didn't work; he has no core, not even any clear-cut emotion for the son he hasn't seen for 15 years nor ever expected to see again. His perfectionist alter-ego Clu (also Bridges) does not work as a bad guy - because he similarly has no substance, no core. In the original TRON the bad guy was a computer - The Master Program - who, despite the computer generated face was an utterly impersonal, utterly controlling cyber thief - a genuinely unique, in 1982 quite believable, kind of bad guy - and the shape of viruses and Trojans to come. But in Legacy Bad Guy Clu appears human and we relate to him as human; he is NOT impersonal - a plot weakness. Clu demonstrates no obvious driving desire to accumulate or assimilate, only to destroy in the search for ""perfection"". Cyber thieving - the core of the original Tron story is a hugely serious issue toady with billions spent to combat it - that plot line could have been carried through from 1982. Acquisitive stealthy unseen unsuspected cyber ""evil"" would have ticked more of my boxes, Clu didn't because he was essentially restricted to the domain of The Grid, controlling and destroying only what was there. He posed no threat in my world. The Master Program from 1982 did.On the credit side; the ""look"" is the same, dark, broody & moody. The special effects are eye-popping. The updated motor-bike game is superb and the flying battle too. But there just is not enough of this kind of action. The soundtrack by Daft Punk was great.There is too much ""adult stuff"" for the younger watcher. My 7 year old son rated the original Tron 9 stars, this one he rates as 7. The dialogue did not hold my interest still less my boys.There were too many opportunities missed in Legacy. For example; there could have been concessions to people who use PlayStations and Ninetendo DS. This, and more obvious use of internet/bluetooth/WiFi technology - perhaps to link in the ""real world"" - could have successfully updated the piece.Finally - Legacy reminded me of other films; Flynns pad reminded me of Dave Bowmans bedroom from the final scenes of 2001 a Space Odyssey. There were several allusions to The Matrix and also a couple to the Bourne trilogy. There were hints too of the Lawnmower Man films. I don't know if this was deliberate or just me.TRON-Legacy will be watched by a great many 40 and 50 somethings and their children. The kids will go because of the cool trailers for the special effects - but they will be disappointed because it isn't in the Avatar league. The adults may go for the nostalgia trip - but they'll be disappointed because there isn't enough of an updating or reworking of the original material.Sorry guys - you might go to watch TRON-legacy for your own reasons, but I am really sorry to say - I wasn't happy with this film.",TRON - Legacy

I found my mind competing between special effects, plot and the execution of both. Tonight, Saturday the 18th, I re-watched it, this time with my 12 year old nephew. I asked him how he rated it 1 to 10, he rated it 1,000. I love the original Tron; in 1982 it was cutting edge technology. Many of the concepts have come about in our day, some surpassingly so. 3d is truly the only way to view Tron Legacy but I recommend watching the original Tron beforehand. You can enjoy watching it without seeing the original and that is a triumph for Disney but names like Clu, Dumont and Dillinger have greater meaning when you've seen Tron. You can also have greater appreciation for Flynn and Alan by seeing the original. I do believe Tron Legacy will be one of those movies that I'll pick up a little more each time I see it. Maybe I wouldn't rate it 1,000 but I do think Disney did well in not trying to recreate the original but adapting the story to our day and presenting it with 2010 technology.",TRON - Legacy
222,fjmsoftware,"Decent, but still disappointing.",7,19 December 2010,"I had read a couple of reviews and I went into this expecting very little from the characters and the story and very very much from the visuals and the 3D. Unfortunately I was to find out that ""go see the new Tron 'cos it has awesome 3D visuals"" actually meant ""I don't know what the Hell I'm talking about because I probably haven't seen Avatar"".This was a disgrace as a 3D movie (and yes, I'm talking about the ""Grid"" parts, not the ""real world"" parts, I know it wasn't all supposed to be in 3D). I would've been less disappointed had they just stuck to 2D and not LIED to us that they had what it takes to make it an enjoyable 3D experience. Now I'm even more anxious to see Avatar 2, just to get rid of the bad taste from Tron 2.Then I felt lied to again, by most reviews, because I found a story and some characters no worse on the overall than those in the original Tron. While the ""Grid"" world was way too physicalized for my taste this time - they should've kept it very abstract and very strange - they did come up with the ""ISO"" idea, which could've been absolutely fantastic had it been exploited properly and not relegated to the role of a measly garnish.",TRON - Legacy
223,monsterhunt-94296,Stylish,7,8 July 2020,"There were many improvements to the original but also a few downsides. this one is definitely broader in appeal, and a widespread audience would probably enjoy this one. that being said, there are a few villain tropes that apply to this movie. i feel like the antagonist had some really interesting setup in the first two acts but the third act just kind of went down an easy route. that also goes along with the odd structuring. the first two acts had a really nice pacing, but once we get to the bridge between the second and third act it falls apart. the third act feels really rushed and not earned, and that's because our main character faced minimal conflict before that. the villain's plan was also never really fully explained and just came off as unoriginal. before the third act, the whole setup and world building was done really nice. i love what they did with all the characters post-Tron, and how the whole ""utopia Grid"" fell apart, I just feel like the third act doesn't deliver a satisfying conclusion to this setup. a lot of the performances are also pretty weak in this one, and there is this one over-the-top character, and i get what they were going for, but it didn't work for me. on a positive note, the visuals are stunning. while the original Tron does have its charm, the visuals in this movie are no doubt better. the suits, lightcycles, and recognizers (from space paranoids) looked phenomenal. the sound design was also great (although i swear i heard a lego batman sound effect and a halo sound effect), and the soundtrack is definitely an improvement. i feel like it expands on the digital/techno vibe of the original but the orchestral elements make it sound much better. overall, i think the positives and negatives balance out to get the same rating as the original: 7/10. on an objective scale, the movie would probably be a 5 or 6 depending on how much you want to incorporate style into the rating.",TRON - Legacy

Why did he think tapping the split screen with he coffee mug would make the camera image reappear? Why only one guard for the entire building? Why didn't he call for backup or lock it down? Why did he know exactly behind what computer tower to look for Sam? Why does he bother walking onto the crane? How did he dare to? Why did Sam stop when the helicopter shun a light at him? How did they find the operating system on the Internet 30s(!) later? Why was it ""missing""? Did Sam delete the original? Why would such a legendary company NOT be represented on the Japanese stock market already? Why did Sam and step dad talk like they hadn't met in 20 years? Why use a 20 year old pager? If CLU had access to contact it, couldn't he just have taken over the world without all the charades? Don't old arcade games have a boot up time? Why a secret room behind the arcade? Would Kevin enter his lab through the secret door that was in a busy video arcade? Wouldn't any kid playing the game have dislodged the console from the wall that was the secret door? Why would Sam conveniently have a flash light? How would Sam know all the commands used on the 20 year old computer? Why would he conveniently start the laser without seemingly knowing about it? Need programs entertaining? Did Sam have god-like powers in Disk Wars? How do the bikes hold together if all you need to do is tug at one (non existing) mechanical part to break them? Since Kevin programmed CLU, wouldn't he know about the possibility of a malfunction? How do you comfortably lay in a bed with a disk on your back? How can programs have intuition and how did Gem find Sam outside the club at the right moment? Did she have god-like powers? Why is the grid so anthropomorphic? Why would programs have spare time? Why didn't CLU go to Kevin's place earlier, he obviously knew where it was? Why would there be a bar that serves drinks? Doesn't liquid short circuit electronic devices? Did Castor plant the idea of Zuse in Quorra's brain in order to lure Sam and ultimately Kevin into his bar only to have one of his allies getting a hold of the disk by sheer luck then Castor killing his ally to get the disk only to finally turn out to be an ally of CLUs? Can a chain of plot devices actually get more congested? Why does Kevin address his son as ""man"", is he really ""The Dude"" from Big Lebowski? Why would he have a ""Zen thing""? ""Do you remember the night you didn't come home?"" what if Kevin had said ""No. Why? What happened?"" Or: ""Hey, remember your old Ducati?"" ""You kiddin' me? There isn't a day that goes by where I don't think of that old bike!"" Wouldn't it have been more likely he would have used that line when being asked about the night where he didn't come home? If Kevin's disk is the master key to any and all secrets of the grid, how then did CLU even manage to become more powerful than Kevin? How, after having been off-line, would Quorra know that CLU had the disk? Does Quorra have god-like powers? Why doesn't Sam seem to react to what she says? What exactly is ""Knocking on the sky?"" and why does Kevin need to do it right that moment? Why would CLU refer to Quorra as a ""rare bird""? Are there birds on the grid? Why did the Flynns walk around where the vast army was, of all places? Why does Sam have to remind Kevin of the ""Same team"" rule? Isn't blood thicker than water? Why is Sam taking over and deciding what is to be done, yet in the next sentence he proclaims that he's going to improvise? Wouldn't Kevin know much better what to do? Why would the guards act so puzzled when the elevator arrives with no passenger on it? Is investigating it more important than guarding the door? If Kevin can reprogram people by hitting their helmets, then what is the friggin' point of the movie? Why did Sam only encounter four guards in total on his way to Kevin's disk? Why does Jarvis give up without being threatened, then Sam still grabbing Jarvis' throat in order to acquire about the ""girl""? Why would Sam throw the *all important* disk at Tron? Why does Quorra ask Sam what he is doing there yet she knows that CLU would be ""here any minute""? Does Quorra have god-like powers or doesn't she? Why is Jarvis' unreliability a surprise to CLU? Sam had never been in a grid plane before, yet knew what to do to ""take the turret"". Why does he have to turn his head to talk to the people in the front? An ultra modern plane but no communications system? How can electronics be jammed? Would there be oceans? Why doesn't Kevin hit CLU in the head to reprogram him? Why would CLU look away when Quorra threatened him with a ""sword""? Why didn't she kill CLU right there? How can Sam connect his magic mobile phone to the computer in dad's basement? Would they after 20 years of development even be able to interface, even be able to run common software needed to copy the software? Why is Quorra outside the arcade and what did his step dad do inside all of a sudden?

225,youngman44,Enjoy The Ride,8,17 December 2010,"The secret of a film like this is to keep your attention, not be boring or cheesy with the dialog, and keep your on edge during the action. This movie simply does that. It's not a super profound philosophical mystery; it doesn't go deep into a challenging story line (like, say, Dune or Lord of the Rings) - but it works. I felt tension and engagement with the characters throughout. The action and video were excellent. Perhaps it helped that I watched it at an IMAX in 3D. But, the sound, the music, was exceptionally powerful and really made for a powerful movie experience. If you want some good sci-fi action, a few interesting characters, and powerful music - you'll like Tron. Olivia Wilde was the real star. Her gorgeous eyes and drug-like beauty were in full force, but she did a great job selling the character. Typically when you know someone from another role it is difficult for them to play such a narrow character role (a kind of vulnerable and not quite so computer-like Data). And, there were times I thought - this is Olivia Wilde of House - and my brain had to adjust out of that. However, for the most part she did a great job with a really key character. Beau Garrett - in a lesser female role - was also quite good. I was not a Tron ""freak"" with respect to the original film - liked it but didn't get into it as a fanatic. So, I don't know how some who are obsessed with they mystery of this will do with the film (I suspect they will like it fairly well). Nevertheless, I think it deserves a solid 8 as a movie that simply entertains with great special effects, music, and some solid character acting.

Each time the flaws matter a little less.Is the script full of holes you could drive a Recognizer through without folding in the legs? Yeah... Is Quora a strange and possibly troubling manifestation of the Born Perfect Yesterday trope? Yup... Does the atmospheric effects make sense in a digital utopia designed by a madman obsessed with geometrical perfection? Not really... Does it survive mostly due to Daft Punks EPIC soundtrack and the slick visuals? Probably...Certainly...I saw clips of the first film on TV throughout my earliest years. Probably catching a full viewing on TV. But in earnest it was when I bought the DVD (appropriate) that I saw it in a way that was closer to the original intent and I could dive into the making of. The narrative was simple. Disney was on the verge of collapse and made a few insane bets. One of those bets were the first Tron. A flawed technical spectacle. They almost accidentally changed how cyberspace would look in media for decades on while not actually knowing how computers function. It flopped at the box-office. But it was so out there that the people who saw it refused to forget it.So watching this in theaters in 2010 I knew little of what to expect except that a french House group I enjoyed was tasked with the music, and the trailers promised a few throwbacks for the fans. I walked out with mixed feelings. I saw the flaws but overall it was a ride well worth the effort. I got the BluRay and shortly after the 3D version.And you know what?I think that when watching a film like this one may have to dispense with normal expactations of narrative. Make sure the screen you see it on is huge. That the sound system can handle the range. Preferrably use a good 3D projector. Let it just wash over, full force. That is how this is meant to be enjoyed. I am not a fan of the trope of ""just turn your brain off"" as a way to convince readers to enjoy movies. I may however suggest that you simply divert towards other parts of the brain.In simple terms it is mayhaps simpler (like a lot of fans and non fans alike already have since release) to describe it as a visualised concept album for Daft Punks latest collection of songs. Like Electroma, and Interstella 5555. The inteded experience when viewed with proper equipment is there on the disc. It may not be transcendent but while flawed it is there somewhere between visuals, sfx and music.And like the first film. Though it underperformed in cinemas it probably did influence the esthetics of the almost decade since it was released.Tron just keeps on aspiring to achieve things it probably never will. But it tries.And I can admire that.",TRON - Legacy
229,annahudak-70828,An actual masterpiece,9,4 April 2021,"This film is a literal masterpiece. I don't use that word lightly, there aren't many films I would use that term for. So, why do I say that about this film? For several reasons, one being the writing. This film foreshadows things in brilliant ways that it's unlikely to be picked up on the first time. For example, when Adam first meets Clu, he thinks Clu is his dad. Pretty quickly we can sense that something is wrong, but the first time watching you don't know what until Clu admits he's not Adam's father. That said, the film provides clues that he's not his dad by doing things such as checking Adam's disk to see what he knows and asking if he ""came alone."" It also sets up the revelation later that Clu was the one who sent the message on the pager. It foreshadows two revelations perfectly in completely natural ways that is not likely to be picked up on during a first watch. Another thing the film does well writing-wise is relationships. That dinner scene is so well executed and really does accurately portray what it's like when a child and parent see each other after a period of time when one just disappeared unexpectedly. I know, because I have been in the same situation. I left my parents without telling them and when I had lunch with my mom for the first time after doing so, it was quite similar to that dinner. Another amazing display of writing is the mistakes that are made and how everyone reacts to them. Kevin makes the mistake of believing that he can create a perfect world and knows what perfection is. That falls so flat on his face once Clu pulls of a coup, commits genocide and the portal back to Kevin's world closes. So, he tries to learn to be ""wise"" and ""zen."" Instead, he ends up the exact opposite. Previously, he seemed egotistical and was impulsive. Now, he's overly cautious. His son Adam reacts to Kevin's being too cautious by doing an impulsive act. They react in such natural ways, and shows how human they really are.Anyway, probably should wrap this up. The acting is flawless, the special effects still look gorgeous a decade later, and the film score by Daft Punk is one of the best film scores ever and it's tragix that it wasn't even nominated for best film score at the Oscars.",TRON - Legacy

On the one hand, dashing the story, where the experiences of the characters and set aside philosophical discussions, of course, less space than the races and battles, but Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky in the background there. Somehow, in the company of the ""Book of Changes"" and ""Diamond Sutra"". On the other hand, in terms of technical Heritage performed so flawlessly, as far as you can do today.World inside the computer has turned glamorous and rich with small details, with a few, but bright colors (as opposed to slot-machine hall, which show us the hits eighty).

232,MovieGeekBlog,visual effects overpowering a very confusing story,5,5 December 2010,"Before I start trashing this film the way it really deserves, I should probably admit I was never a real fan of the original. It's the kind of film that people always seemed to admire for its technical achievement, but even as a kid I never quite got into it. In fact, dare I say, I remember thinking it was all rather boring and overly complicated. Let's just face it, most of the fun and the enjoyment in that first film was actually watching the video-games-like sequences. The rest was pretty forgettable. No wonder it took them almost 30 years to do a sequel.Having said all this, I can safely say that Tron Legacy manages to stay true to the original: it's just as complicated and confusing in its ""story"", the video-games-like sequences are just as messy and over-edited as the original and the special effects want to be absolutely amazing, but actually when you really look at them closely they're not as successful as they're trying to make you believe..Much has been talked about the CGI wizardry that has allowed Jeff Bridges to look 30 years younger. Well, sadly, we are still a few years away to make that trick seamless. Though it will probably look just about OK once the film comes out on a DVD (not so sure about the BluRay actually), certainly on the big screen, the effect on Jeff Bridges' face doesn't look quite right. Human skin has always been troublesome on GCI and this film proves it again. The result is a weird plastic feel that actually reduces his real facial expression making him look like ""prince charming"" from the Shrek. Interestingly it seemed to work better in the scenes which were masked and filtered through a TV screen (as if they were part of archive footage), which proves that even the makers were quite aware of the limitations.The film is quite a visual feast for the eye, as special effects and production design fight for attention in every single frame of the film , but it's all so hyper-real and over-blown that, to be honest, I found it hard to be swept away by any of it. I do recognise some of its value (which is why I am giving it 5 stars and not 2 stars), but all this visual extravaganza cannot make up for the lack of any clear and interesting storytelling. And this is, at the end of the day, the most important factor in a film, any film, whether it's an action piece or a drama, or a cartoon.: you've got to like the story! You've got to sympathise with the characters or at least be interested in them. In the case of Tron:Legacy I was pretty confused all the way through (but sadly not in a ""Inception"" sort of confusion where, being confused is part of the fun. This was just confusing because it was badly told!).I am not really sure who is this film for? Fans of the first one? Well, there are not too many out there.Is it a film for kids? Don't think so: they would certainly get lost in the mambo-jumbo story.Is it a film for video-games lovers? Probably, though I can name hundreds of much more exciting games to play.Is it a film for geeks or special effects lovers? Well, I am one of those, and I can tell you that I wasn't really taken by any it. It all may look slick and stylish and it's all just an upgraded version of the previous film, with very little originality.Even the action sequences seemed just a modern version of the previous ones, with some added 3D Fx. Ah yes, I was almost forgetting the 3D factor. Right at the beginning some weird caption tells you that some of the scenes are supposed to look 2D and that you should keep your 3D glasses on all the time. What it actually means is that the 3D only kicks in once the main characters enters the virtual world of video-games (quite a bad choice if you ask me, especially because it misses quite a few opportunities in the first part of the film to make the action a bit more exciting). Once we finally get to ""virtual world"" or cyber-word or whatever you wanna call it, after the first few minutes you're in 3D you actually almost forget you're watching it in 3D (I say almost because the headache that the 3D glasses give you is still there). I was so surprised by how badly the 3D is used on this film. Even the flying sequences didn't seem to draw me in ( and those are notoriously good on 3D, see Avatar and even the awful Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole). Am I alone on this one? I usually love 3D... I seem to remember the motorbike sequences on the first Tron being a lot more exciting than in this (or is it because I was 10 at the time?).So, to wrap it all up: the story is a mess, the script if basically riddled with clichés, bad lines and jokes that are so poorly timed and unfunny that in the screening where I was NOBODY laughed, and finally the visual effects are so unreal and overblown that they fail to amaze.One the positive side, the soundtrack is awesome. Nothing new, of course, it sounds a lot like Batman, Inception and the Bourne films, but it's still pretty good (though there was probably too much music throughout).I was ready to love this one, we so need a new sci-fi film to take the crown, but I was really disappointed at this revamped TRON and actually even a bit bored",TRON - Legacy
233,mutantdani,Not enough,5,22 November 2019,"Nostalgia, nice visuals and attractive theme/world are the good points of the movie but it lacks of a good plot, directing and acting to become worth seeing",TRON - Legacy
234,jeffpk,Pretty but ultimately unexciting,6,24 December 2010,"In this move, TRON stands for Tropes Recent Or New. What plot there is, is so derivative as to be a check list of elements from recent popular science fiction films, classic (some might say hackneyed) general tropes, and bits from the original TRON.The graphics while pretty and updated nicely to a 2010 look, are ultimately exactly what you would expect from a TRON done today with today's equipment. No less, but sadly also no more. 3D animation holds the power to show us things we've never imagined before. Be it Avatar, or Speed racer, those movies had fresh new looks that excited me as a viewer and took me someplace new. The world of TRON:Legacy however is a familiar one to anyone who knows the original TRON. Watching this was sort of like playing the ""updated"" version of a classic game. Yes the detail is much better, but there really isn't much ""new"" here to excite you.As for the patchwork thing we might loosely call a ""plot"", it too has lots of the familiar to it. Much of it seemed lifted from The Matrix series, which the film-makers have already admitted they studied. The ""Zen in an artificial world"" thing was very present, and the female lead was what you would get if you slammed the female lead of the original TRON against Trinity in the Matrix. (Although I ultimately found trinity a much more interesting character.)The car she drives when we meet here is pretty much a ""digital bat mobile"" with much of the same look and abilities as seen in the second recent batman movie. Again however, I found the original more interesting. The character of Zeus again seemed lifted with only minor changes from The Merovingian in the matrix. Dressed in all white, he is effeminate where as the Merovingian was french-- not much difference to most Americans. The are both served by pale white servants-- the merovingian by the albinos and Zeus by Nordic blonde. And they both are trying to play both sides against the middle, albeit again the Merovingian does it in a much more interesting manner.The bad guy, CLU, a reflection of the senior Flynn's vanity literally born from a Digital mirror, is a product of creator hubris-- a plot element so old we can trace this trope back to the Greeks. TOld to create a ""perfect digital world"" he becomes fascist dictator with all the expected nods to Hitler and the Nazis.The rest of the plot is by the numbers predictable, mostly skipping the ""first time"" in the ""tell it three times"" rule and just handing us really obvious visual clues of what was soon to be ""revealed"".Totally missing from the film is the explanation of how ""Tron"" turns ""bad"". Near the end of the movie Flynn senior Asks rhetorically, ""Tron what happened to you"". At that moment I thought ""Yeah I've been wondering the same thing for an hour..."" Its never answered.Finally, the writers missed an excellent opportunity to add 3 words to the movie that by themselves could have deepened the film significantly. In the end CLU, asks his creator, ""Didn't i do what you told me to?"" and then asks ""Why would you destroy all this for him?"" Referring to Flynn junior. To which the Senior Flynn responds, ""He is my son.""The next words SHOULD have been from CLU's mouth -- ""What am I?""Alas, they weren't.",TRON - Legacy
235,david-2829,"Powerful, moving, beautiful, disconcerting... flawed but worthwhile!",7,23 February 2011,"Powerful sounds & special effects, a dystopian computer world and a classic human vs. machine battle for survival. What's not to like!? Well, unfortunately enough that it's not an instant classic, but still a terrific addition to sci-fi cinema! What is so cool about the movie is the upgraded but still retro feeling of the Tron world. The detail is striking and pulls us in and keeps us in a strange land. It is a rather bleak world (why didn't they program in some sunlight?)... so we're thankful for the welcome bits of levity and ""human-ness"" found in the father-son connections. Quorra also provides smiles and such wonderful soulful eyes we can almost sense things will be okay from her gaze alone.As unbelievable as it might be for Flynn Jr. (Sam) to survive the light disc battles and the light cycles, etc. it does make wonderful visual popcorn. In fact, I think the light cycles with the new multi-layered tracks is one of the best scenes of the entire movie! Other cool stuff is sprinkled all throughout the movie, from the huge claw-shaped ships, to battle arenas with breakable floor tiles to the streamlined flying ships at the end There are a number of things that knock at the edges of this world allowing reality to creep in. First we have the completely CGI Clu, who although impressive for a computer-generated human still gives off that strange vibe of not being ""real"". When surrounded by real human actors the effect bothers a little.Second, it is rather unbelievable for a human (even as physically fit as Sam Flynn) to survive highly trained computer programs with lightning fast reflexes. This action-movie convention has always bothered me... and is worsened by the hyper-speed and quick cuts used in this film.Third, the story is somewhat confusing and requires a lot of exposition by Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges). I like his Matrix-ish powers, but if he has special abilities like that it should've been no problem for him to escape a long time ago. Overall there are just a lot of plot holes, and the motivation behind Clu and his minions is not well explained. For example, why would Clu need to invade our world instead of just visit it? The programs seem happy, so why take them somewhere else? Seems like there's always SOME megolomaniac building an army! In any case, fans of the 1982 original will find some inside jokes and have that nostalgia factor, but the movie is fresh enough that it should create many new Tron fans as well. I imagine the first Tron movie will see renewed interest... I know I wanted to see it again as soon as the credits rolled on Tron: Legacy.But I have to ask... after all our heroes go through, they drive off on a motorcycle without helmets!

Thank God I was wearing earplugs or I wouldn't have any hearing left. It's surprising my bones didn't dissolve.3-D isn't any good.

237,merdiolu,Delivers what it promises,8,20 February 2012,"Original Tron made in 1982 was revolutionary at its time though it passed unnoticed and unrecognized. Partly because it was so ahead of its time with amazingly imagined ( and inspired from Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" ) and designed digital world , ideas like quantum teleportation to this alternate digital world inside a computer mainframe , programs having their own identities , personalities and lives in this universe etc....Now 29 years later Tron Legacy comes back to remind us the ideas and concepts original Tron seeded in science fiction AND visual movie making and advances CGI technologies we took so far.Tron Legacy's story is simple ( though more complicated than original Tron ) but effective. ( I have no idea why certain critics or audience simply trash it ""No plot"" Have you watched the same movie ? It is like a choir. When some critics defend a position everyone flocks around them ) It is about creating a paradise with order and efficiency turning into a nightmare through extremism and fanaticism. And it is also about a nice father/son relationship. Basically Sam Flynn , son of Kevin Flynn ( protagonist of original Tron ) , a 27 year old young man traces his father's steps after his disappearance 20 years ago. By same teleportation means he enters a similar digital world , a world which his father created and titled as The Grid. Programs in this sub universe or realm have their own identities , personalities and lives just like you or me. And they have created a civilization. But it is a civilization run by totalitarian control of CLU , a digital copy program of Kevin Flynn. Kevin Flynn himself is trapped in this world and now he , Sam and a wunder program/miracle life form named Quorra try to escape and return to real world before CLU and his violence spills into our world also...As concept they took out a lot of computer jargon of original Tron and replaced it with philosophical/religious sub texts. Although it is disappointing from sci-fi angle it is not disturbing too much and it adds some kind of a depth ( a shallow one but a depth nonetheless ) Visual effects , CGI all of them are wonderful , marvelous I should say. When I saw the recognizer first time there was a huge grin on my face. There is a certain fight scene which was designed like a techno dance. Garett Hedlund as Sam Flynn is OK. He is not outstanding but he delivers the role well and holds his own against other actors. Real star is of course Jeff Bridges as both Kevin ""The Dude"" Flynn and dictator program CLU ( effectively de-aged with CGI ) He is excellent. Olivia Wilde is also fine as naive but spirited Quorra. Bruce Boxleitner from original Tron also reprises his role as Alan Bradley and a short cameo role as Tron. Michael Sheen is also a fine addition as a David Bowie like wild program named Castor.If you are a sci-fi/fantasy fan with good quality taste give Tron Legacy a chance. Especially after watching original Tron...It delivers what it promises as a good epic sci-fi fantasy fun without ever feeling dumb.

We still have those classic designs and characters here, only modernised and contextualised.The story takes a much more personal route and feels more engaging as well as being more streamlined and relatable.

241,maddog-50,totally uninspired and uncreative,1,18 December 2010,"The original Tron conveyed the, at this time very fresh, idea of a secret universe in the memory of a intelligent super computer with its technical possibilities of that time. The concept and execution was very innovative. The ingenious of the original movie was, to present the inside of a computer NOT from the user's point of view but from a perspective where the technical aspect determines the universe inside the machine. There were bits and bytes, RAM, CPU, data banks etc., a very technical and therefor nonhuman USER UNFRIENDLY and cold artificial environment. THAT made the inside of the machine so mysterious and interesting and menacing.The makers of TRON legacy made the BIG and unforgivable mistake to present the inside of the machine just like the user is EXPECTING it. The machine looks like that it was designed to simulate a world which was programmed FOR the user, so that the users can orientate themselves better:Hot chicks in wrinkled spandex, always fresh coiffed, characters have sprayed hairs, there is smoke, volume light, wind and atmosphere and completely digitized characters wear integral helmets with fogged visors when they breathe to heavy. Floors, walls are illuminated with neon tubes, materials like plastic, spandex, leather, which all sound like that, for instance, your hear the leather crumpling when the super cool characters move, the jets have engines with a fire boost, etc.. The irony of that movie is, that the artificial computer world seems more realistic than the real world: here, there exists in 1989 a portable laser powered by public electricity grid in Flynn's cellar which can scan living objects into a computer. Only 7 years back in the movies time frame, the same apparatus needed a f* huge whole building with a gigantic power reactor to function!! And now this thing is in Flynn's cellar, COME ON! BTW, the amount of data of a scanned human must be, at least, gigantic! BUT nobody at ENCOM never EVER realized that there is a huge memory leak since 21 years in their system! If that would not be enough, at the end of the movie, the portable laser is not only able to re-materialize a human BUT is also able to materialize a new life-form. Please tell me what a jerk Kosinski really is! Even if you never went to school or something, you might have heard of E=mc². The energy of generating 70 kg physical mass is roughly equivalent to the electric energy that 280 million households consume in a whole f* YEAR! This is double the energy of ALL US households consume! So WTF? What ruins the movie all the more, is the fact that nowadays every kid has a clear imagination about how the programmed world of a computer game should look like. To make this world louder, more colorful or bigger has a very limited effect not to mention that there is absolutely NO NEW experience (except the unbelievable amount of stupidity )to the audience. Even worse, this get's boring very fast. This movie is a totally exploitation of the original idea without any creativity of its own, actually it is very stupid and uninspired with endless boring dialogs and it is lacking anything of the visionary aspects of the original one. The acting is terrible, Garrett Hedlund is an underpants model not an actor. Obviously, the need to make the movie trendy and cool for generation PlayStation was the main directive for that poor execution.

I have to admit to quite enjoying it. The first noticeable thing is that the film isn't all in 3D, the second thing is that the 3D is very subtle, so subtle in fact it I wonder if it even need it. The effects are for the most part very good, The weakest effect in many ways is Clu, the effect never looks real, which is a pity, as the character is so important in the film. Another plus for the film is the score by Daft Punk, which stands out and I would think might well be nominated for an Oscar next year.The story is very basic and could have been done better, there are problems with character motivations and the dialogue at times. A lot of reviewer have commented on the film being over long but personally I didn't have much of a problem. Maybe it could have lost a few minutes but in comparison with a lot of action films, the story just skates along. For me the biggest problem with the story is the ending which feels very weak compared with the rest of the film, it just isn't as exciting as it should have been.Ihe acting again isn't amazing and none of the actors have to press themselves. Michael Sheen has got the most stick but I thought his character was quite fun, he reminded me of Dr. Frank-N-Furter something I don't think was coincidental. Jeff Bridges is his normal self though I felt a little subdued.Yes I would recommend this film, it is better than the original Tron but it could have been better, if more time had been devoted to the story and a few little details had be sorted out.",TRON - Legacy

For 20 years, he lives in the shadow of a question; why did his father not come back. After a pager from his dads old arcade, he stumbles onto a secret room and manages to get himself into the digital world of 'The Grid' where he finds his trapped father. Throw in an evil clone nemesis with a killer instinct(rogue) side kick, a beautiful but deadly ally (Played by Olivia Wilde), visually stunning action scenes and an army of reprogrammed programs to destroy the real world and we have all the ingredients for a cliché plot with plenty of cliché subplots.This may seem to be yet another 3D movie but this is the one that does it right. A perfect blend of 2D and 3D worlds created nicely by Joseph Kosinski . It's a visual feast and an acoustic delight keeping you absorbed throughout the movie that you even ignore the rather weak storyline. Garret Hedlund and Jeff Bridges as the main characters were always riding in the back seat with these visuals to boot. Jeff Bridges manages to hold his own though some dialogs like ""Radical, man,"" were a little odd while the younger graphical him seemed too cartoonish sometimes, bit of a distraction. Garret Hedlund does a decent job to play a convincing Sam Flynn while Wilde's puzzled/innocent curiosity was engaging. Michael Sheen as Castor/Zuse was wacky in a good way.This is not an all out action movie nor an in your face 3D effects bonanza.

248,texasredge-95123,Awesome. Loved it,8,28 October 2016,"Better than the Original. I always had mixed feelings about the original 1982 Disney movie TRON. On one hand it was the most stunning visual master piece ever created for a major motion picture. On the other hand the visuals were so great that at times you couldn't keep up with the story because your eyes and attention kept wanting to focus on the visuals, and thus causing you to lose pace with the story. The original TRON was one of those movies that I didn't necessarily like, but while at the same time I didn't dislike it either.When I learned that Disney was making a sequel to TRON (28 years later), I almost didn't believe it, I assumed it would be a reboot or a remake of the original rather than a true sequel. Well I was wrong. It's a true sequel, and it greatly surpasses the original in every scope.I'm pleased to say that everything that the first TRON movie got wrong, this one got right. This one is easier to follow and makes far more sense than the first one did. Once again the visuals are mind blowing to look at. Also loved the way they created a younger version of Jeff Bridges with CGI.(they should have gotten an academy award for that). The light-cycles are just as fun to watch today as they were in 1982, only this time you fully understand what's going on (unlike the 1982 original where you didn't have clue what was going on, but damn, it sure looked pretty). I even liked the Electronic-Discothèque music used in the movie, it fits perfect with the elements of the film. Even the story for this movie is plausible and good. I actually liked the overall look of this film much better than the Square-ish Cartoon- ish look of the original. I though the chemistry between the actors was good. A solid good cast. I loved Jeff Bridges in the dual role. This movie was just fun, a lot of fun.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes Science Fiction, Superheroes, and Video Games, all of whom should enjoy this movie a lot. (((( I know I sure did.",TRON - Legacy
249,Zettelhead,A mediocre story with impressive visuals that misinterpreted TRON completely,3,28 October 2015,"It is entertaining, it is brainless, it looks great though completely stupid, it is ridiculous, it is a lot, but is it TRON?What happened to the digital world? Why is it wet? Why is it dusty? Where do the clouds come from? Why do programs eat and drink? Why do programs have psychological issues like envy, narcissism or hypocrisy? Why is a user, once sucked into the digital world, bleeding when he gets cut? How should programs ever manifest in the material world? Why are there rocks and ruins in the digital world? Why do programs have jet engines? Why do they dance? Why do they need to watch games? Why are they interested in the opposite sex?TRON was brilliant because the digital world was purely consisting of light beams an surfaces that seem somehow immaterial. And there was nothing else, just the black void! The programs had maybe something like a character but they had no complex flaws. And although it was an sf-fairy tale it felt right in the old days and it still does today. It was believable to a certain extent. Tron: Legacy is not! Not one second of it.And I actually wondered all the time if Jeff Bridges was really Jeff Bridges or just a lookalike imitating Jeff Bridges. Because even his acting was poor. Well, and then there is a story of son and father and Frankensteins monster. It works like all these stories work when they are written by the book. No big deal. But not enough to let you forget all the pain caused by the stupidity mentioned above.If you are able to switch of your brain and enjoy senseless cgi- and action-mumbo-jumbo, this is the right movie for you. If you are not, it is not.",TRON - Legacy
250,rawvibes,Amazing Journey,9,25 December 2010,"Encom is a great technological software company who are on the cutting edge of new software and technology. In 1989 Kevin Flynn who is the CEO of Encom, was reported missing. After 20 years Alan Bradley (COO – Chief Operating Officer of ENCOM) receives a page from Flynn's old Arcade office. A number disconnected for Two decades. Alan heads over Sam's house to tell him about the call. Curious about the page, Sam Flynn (Son of Kevin Flynn) goes to the old arcade to investigate. While there, he finds his father's secret office, and manages to get zapped and trapped into the New Grid his father got stuck in. Sam and Kevin finally meet in the New Grid and Kevin explains to Sam how Clu turned on him (artificial intelligence program created by Flynn to build the New Grid). Watch as Father and son make a mad dash to escape the GRID. Great lead in giving the people a little history of TRON before starting the sequel. A MUST SEE IN IMAX. OK most of the film was shot in 2D and a few parts in 3D but seeing it in IMAX makes up for that. The whole family will love this film. If you want you can watch TRON and then go see Tron Legacy but it's not necessary. The movie stayed true to what Tron was and it leaves room to see if a 3rd part will come out of this Film as well. Love it 5 out of 5 Stars",TRON - Legacy
251,jmcginn174,Jeff Bridges never lets you down,10,16 June 2011,"Let me first send a shot out to Movieweb for letting me know about the free screenings on Monday night. I didn't see the link until almost 345pm. And luck had there was a screening in Portland OR. It took me a nearly a hour by bus to get to the theater from where I live but the movie was well worth the time. So again thank you Movieweb for letting me know. Now onto the review.Story: Was the worst part of the movie for me. The theme had been down many times before. Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell are the first two that come to mind. Sure the first Tron was headed that way but that was over 25 years ago. The idea is machines coming to life creating a new life form and existing in our world. It's nothing new but still the writers did a good job telling the story of a father and son finding each other again after many years apart. The other problem was the character Castor(Michael Sheen). His character was pointless except to movie the story forward. I will be contradicting myself on this point in the next paragraph.Acting/Characters: The acting was really good in this film and it seemed everyone was enjoying their work. Now it's time to contradict my self. Sure Michael Sheen's character was really pointless you could still see he was halving fun playing the character and it won't bother you so much. Olivia Wild(Quorra) show she's so much more than her good looks. Garrett Hedlund(Sam Flynn) I've never heard of before and was the first time I've seen him. He did a really good job and his chemistry with Jeff Bridges was excellent you could just see the emotion when the two characters meet after so many years. Of course I saved the best for last. That being Jeff Bridges(Kevin Flynn/Clu) a truly great actor. I can't remember a bad film I've seen he's been in. From White Squall, Tron, Iron Man to Blown Away, The Big Lebowski and Arlington Road. I'm sure he's been in a bad films I just haven't seen them. He is perhaps the best thing in this movie essentially playing two characters. Even Clu a CGI character is brought to life by him. He is really is just one of my favorite actors.Special Effects/Visuals: The effects and the world brought to life I believe it was done by Lucas's company ILM. If I read the credit correctly. Anyway the world looked vibrant and alive and will blow you away.Music: I feel like commenting on the music done by Daft Punk. I might have heard the music before but I've never heard of the band until I saw the trailer for Tron. They are really good and their music brought live to the CGI world.Overall: A great film whose only problem is a decent to good story. Well worth spending your money on. And I hope you do. I will be seeing this again. I have read that they plan on making one more after this if it makes money and I hope it does because I want another film.On a side not. I'm not a fan of 3D movies but the only opinion for my showing was in 3D so I had to. And to be honest it works for this film really well. So I might give it a chance in the future.",TRON - Legacy
252,KingCritic,An Underrated Gem,9,29 October 2019,"Everything about this film works. The visuals, writing, acting, everything. There are very few wrong things I can find with Tron, especially the soundtrack which is timeless even almost a decade later. I still remember watching this film in theaters and not regretting it at all.

254,tonyjea92,Graphics are praised but thats about it,7,18 December 2010,You know it seems like every time somebody makes a movie about a person being sucked into a computer world or game is the same. I am here to second that. While i have not seen the original TRON movie i actually had little desire to see this sequel but i did enjoy watching the trailer for it. The graphics i should say will please anyone especially in 3-d. The sound and music were to spectacular. Even Olivia Wilde is hot in her outfit. My only complaint leveled against this movie is that not one of the main characters in it display any emotion. Its like basically watching human robots just battle it out in a computer world on a light cycle. I would rather say that this movie is more for people who are into graphics or computers not action or adventure. Watching this movie in theaters was OK but like i said no emotion and very little plot details.,TRON - Legacy
255,Wrapper30,Huge let down,3,4 September 2011,"Visually stunning but awful apart from that. The original film was OK but as a lot of people recommended this as groundbreaking and exciting, I gave it a try. Boy was I disappointed. I think the main issue is that the characters are so poorly drawn and developed, you just don't care about them. So when the son enters the Grid, do you really care what happens? Was he going to rescue his father or was he curious? or did he just need to have something in his live other than money. I just lost interest and found the Grid to be ponderous rather than a menacing place. And how did the girl become ""Real"" at the end? Surely that was not able to happen? Please can we have filmmakers making a believable story with likable characters and then putting the effects around the story. This was clearly a case of right we have the Grid and all the great effects. Now we need...........................Oh yeah a story. Very poor.",TRON - Legacy
256,J. Ryan,A Mediocre Video Game with Uneven Cutscenes,7,2 March 2011,"The whole movie feels like a video game, but only a mediocre one.There is some good action with semblances of an engaging story that falls apart partway. I would have wanted CLU, the main antagonist, be more 3-dimensional, which they hinted at but ruined with a Leni Riefenstahl Star Wars moment. Michael Sheen's Liberace bartender should have also been re-imagined since it didn't fit with the overall mood of the story. Jeff Bridge's Kevin Flynn is great when he deals with estranged father-son issues both towards Sam Flynn and CLU, but then misfires when he channels zen monk-like traits from the Dude.I thoroughly enjoyed the first 45 min. The film had me right until the end of the light cycle chase. Then the script popped an Ambien for the next 40 min before lumbering towards an adequate conclusion.Visually, Tron Legacy is definitely worth a look, if for no reason than to give yourself ideas for when you open a techno dance club. Nonetheless, stunning visuals and good intermittent action does not compensate for a lackluster script.",TRON - Legacy
257,INTXb,Can't think of a cooler movie,8,11 May 2020,"The rating of 6.8 on IMDb is a real head-scratcher for me. It's more than just visually stunning, every scene is the epitome of cool. The soundtrack by Daft Punk is truly awesome. If we're comparing another movie, it makes 'Speed Racer' look amateur'ish.The cast is pretty perfect, returning the two key members of the original cast and adding some great additions. Jeff commands his position as the wise father and creator of 'the grid'. Garrett plays the cool, prodigal son perfectly. Olivia is captivating as Quorra. Michael Sheen has a small part but he really nails it. The CGI version of Kevin Flynn is my only real complaint is it was a little too phony-looking. A guess another complaint could be that it's 'too polished', sometimes when things are too polished they lose that relatability factor. For me this seems to be a problem with all movies in the Disney realm.I would have certainly love to see more from the director Kosinski as it seems he did a stellar job here.This is one movie I could watch again and again.",TRON - Legacy
258,TomConnors,It's Awesome...3D Blu-Review Tron: Leagacy,8,24 July 2013,"My first RealD 3D experience in the theater was the movie TRON: Legacy, and I enjoyed it, but it was so dark, and hard to see, as most people give as the reason they do not like 3D movies in the theater. My experience on my 3D home theater though was excellent. Truly two hours of eye candy, a movie that truly uses the 3D to it's advantage and not just a gimmick.The movie is a sequel to the 1982 Disney cult-classic TRON, the story begins in 1989, with a computer altered Jeff Bridges returning as Kevin Flynn, telling his son about the world he experienced and had been trying to get back to, which he does, and becomes trapped in for over 20 years. Flynn's son, Sam (Garrett Hedlund) is just as technically inclined as his father, but not as interested in running his father's company Encom, so he does what he can to get under the corporate board member's skin, whenever he can. When his father's former partner and the man that created the program TRON, Alan Bradly (Bruce Boxleitner) gets a page from Kevin Flynn, Sam sets out to investigate his father's disappearance only to get sucked into the ""Grid"" while discovering his father's hidden work room in the old arcade. Soon after arriving Sam encounters his father's program that forces Sam to compete in the ""games"", Clu (Jeff Bridges computer altered to look young again), and TRON (also an altered Bruce Boxleitner), he escapes the games with the help of Quorra (Olivia Wilde) who takes him to his father who lives outside the city, having been betrayed by Clu. After meeting his father the trio discover that Clu is responsible for luring Sam into the Grid, as part of a plan Clu has to get into the real world by using Kevin's disc. It becomes a race against time for the trio to stop Clu, and get back to the real world.The 3D is unique in that, the ""Real World"" scenes are in 2D, which makes things stand out even more when we enter the Grid with Sam and enjoy the adventure. The movie is presented in the IMAX version, where the screen opens up to 1.78:1 from the 2.35:1 aspect ratio for bigger action scenes like The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises, and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. The 3D set also includes a standard 2D Blu-Ray, DVD, and Digital Copy, extras of course are on the 2D disc like most sets like this. The disc is light on extras unfortunately, a short film about the day after the events of TRON: Legacy, which is okay but nothing mind blowing, a few shorts documentaries, second screen experience, a trailer for the Disney XD cartoon, and a music video by Daft Punk round out the extras. After the bevy of extras on the original, this is a bit of a disappointment. If you have a 3D home theater though, this is a must for your collection.",TRON - Legacy
259,angry127,Not Much To Say,5,28 December 2010,"The movie isn't very good. In fact its quite disappointing. I was eager to see this after looking at the trailer. I knew it wouldn't be very faithful to the original in terms of pacing and mood, but I didn't think that was a problem. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a problem and not the only one.I'll go over some of the things I had problems with the film briefly: The main character was written poorly and lacked any sensible motivation. He's the Owner of the company and he jumps off buildings after uploading software from the company he owns to the public for free. Seemed kind of 1 dimensional.Jeff Bridges character isn't in the movie very much. When he is in, he acts out incarnations of ""the Dude"" from the Big Lebowski. I guess he knew the quality of this movie as well.The CGI Jeff Bridges just looked kind of creepy. They could have done something else instead.There isn't any huge philosophical point about the combination of man and machine. There aren't any discussions of future computational discoveries that may or may not occur. All we get are flashy action sequences interleaved with poor acting.The one good note is the world looks quite cool. I would almost say its a nice reboot to the original to match the visual appeal of today.",TRON - Legacy

Yes, the animations are so awesome, especially in HD. But they weren't cool enough to make me ignorant of the storyline. What kind of screenplay writers have they got back there? What's the story? Okay, I know that you can act. Also, I know that you've got a bunch of extremely good special effects technicians in your back yard. I KNOW. But, you cannot have a movie storyline that steals all the bad bits from numerous accounts of other films and expect the negatives to cancel out each other. And killer Frisbees... hmm... I'm gonna let that issue go.",TRON - Legacy
261,proterozoic,Moronitron,4,2 January 2011,"In a way, Hollywood has been building up to this movie all along. The premise of Tron is flimsier than a Russian arrest warrant, but it allows its manufacturers to create a world full of things that zoom around, crash into each other and blow up, and to avoid explaining any of it in any way whatsoever.Every sentient human in the Western world already knows the premise of this movie; for non-sentient customers, the back story is filled in during the opening, through a stunningly badly-handled newsman narration. In brief, various fathers and sons get digitized with a laser and end up trapped inside a virtual world that runs on a computer mainframe (you may ask how it's possible to emulate a fully-functioning human mind on early '80s hardware, but there you go thinking again). The churlishly logical among us may ask why erstwhile protagonist Kevin Flynn didn't follow the elementary hiking advice of letting at least one person know where you are. Or why nobody ever wondered why a decommissioned arcade that hasn't been unlocked for twenty years was burning through megawatts of energy, or why it didn't get unplugged once the bills started to pile up. Or...You get the idea. Tron: Legacy is unlikely to make friends among people who tend to start sentences with the words ""why"" and ""how"" - and that's just during the ""real-world"" setup. Once Kevin's young heir - our next-gen protagonist - enters the Matrix, we are strapped in and taken for a ride through the most predictable plot in the world wedded on top of the most nonsensical action.It turns out that during a bad trip in the '80s, Flynn père made a software clone of himself, named Clu, that was meant to help him turn his digital idyll into a ""perfect system."" As these things go, the clone turned evil and appointed himself supreme dictator of the computer wonderland, trapping the programmer inside and instituting a totalitarian rule where programs are rounded up on the streets and pitched against each other in arena battles to the death, cheered on by howling hordes of spectators – also programs – while he watches on from his levitating VIP lodge. The battles take the form of the famous neon frisbee duels and light cycle races. Bright things are hurled around the screen, people yell, run and throw things at each other to a hammering techno soundtrack. All of this is inevitably exciting on a primitive, lizard-brain level, but as people who have been exposed to quite a bit of technology in the 28 years since the first Tron, please tell me, what aspect of computing does any of this represent? How do you end up with a crowd of programs that enjoy watching gladiator battles? Later, we find out that Clu, in order to build a software army and Take Over The World, traps loose programs and brainwashes them into soldiers. We are told that he must do this because he ""cannot create programs"" from scratch. This means that even after we have numbed ourselves into accepting the fantastically stupid idea that power in a digital world comes from commanding legions of glowstick-wielding software minions, we must believe that Clu is unable to use the commands Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V.But wait, it gets dumber. Our young hero is rescued from the gladiator pit and taken to meet his father Kevin, who's aged into, well, the Dude with admin powers. He can't get out of the computer, because the portal to get back IRL is only open for several game-hours, and he missed his window 20 years ago. Why did Kevin engineer a portal that will close on him after several hours? Because the screenwriters are really, really bad, and they don't know jack about computers. This is also why, as Kevin was creating a digital world, he never thought of including a god mode, or hell, even noclip.He is therefore reduced to festering in zen meditation, and trying to raise Quorra, a cute and athletic girl program who is the last of the ISOs – digital life forms that just sorta evolved one day and wandered in from the wilderness in a scraggly, torch-bearing crowd before getting wiped out by Clu to prove how evil he is. Kevin can delete Clu at any time, by reconciling his prodigal copy with himself. However, he is reluctant to do this, since this will destroy both the copy and the original human. I know I'm starting to repeat myself, but WHY?? Have you ever heard of a software, even from Microsoft, that allows you to synchronize two documents, and erases both as a result? Oh, but his son's portal is open, and the characters have a chance to get out in time, so they end up hitching a ride on a digi-tronic barge, I guess because it's a long haul to the serial port. They get chased by Clu and his stormtroopers, and yada yada yada. I should probably stop revealing any more of the plot, but the whole resolution of the movie plays like Chekhov's 21-gun salute. It would take a truly determined individual to be surprised by anything that happens here.One of the few, bittersweet joys of this movie is seeing good actors try to embody impossible characters performing absurd acts. Jeff Bridges is great as the bearded, shaggy Jedi Master-programmer. Olivia Wilde takes a character that shouldn't work and imbues her with curiosity and mischievous energy. Michael Sheen has the time of his life as the Merovingien crossed with David Bowie. Director Joseph Kosinski does his best with the visuals, which are sleek, stylish and original. Daft Punk come through with the exciting and angular soundtrack. None of this, in the end, serves to rescue the smoldering mess of a plot.One looks at this and comes away in wonderment at how much sense, after all, the Matrix trilogy made.",TRON - Legacy
262,mymtproject,Continuity issues and a garbage story that can't be rescued by CGI,2,17 November 2016,"Where do I start with this piece of crud?Disney made a beautiful film in 1982 entitled TRON, about a computer genius named Flynn who is zapped into the digital world and battles a tyrannical program called the MCP (Master Control Program). Everything about this original movie was wonderful. Computers had only started becoming household and office items in the 80's as the world experienced a computer revolution. In that culture, Disney created a imagined world were programs designed by man looked, talked and even thought like man. They also believed they were created by ""the Users"" and looked to their Users for the direction of their life. In TRON LEGACY, much of that world seemed discarded by the writers. Users were spoken of in disdain by programs in the new movie and apparently new age thinking was introduced by throwing in evolution (the ISOs.. really?!?), reinventing Flynn, who apparently no longer had Godlike powers over a silly program he created (CLU) and giving us Oliva Wilde with nothing to do other than walk around in a skintight, glowing bodysuit. The plot was confusing and muddled and the ending of the movie made ZERO sense. It's like the script writers looked a few panels of the original TRON without actually watching it. They drop a few homages to the original, like Dillenger's son being back at ENCOM and the whole ""Now that's a big door!"" joke that felt pushed into the new movie. I felt embarrassed for my date who paid to take me to this movie, especially after she had sat with me as I played the original for her on DVD. She got cheated, I got cheated and so did everyone else who paid to watch this piece of crud. The rotten cherry on top of this was an ending where Oliva Wilde's character (a program with no previous flesh or blood form in our physical world) ends up in our physical world, riding a motorcycle with Flynn's son. She's a FREAKING PROGRAM (ones and zeros in a line of code),not at all like Flynn, who was a human who went into the digital world! I should have known this would be a bomb when all anyone talked about what the Light Cycles fight. Even that part of the movie wasn't as good as the original TRON Light Cycle fight. This movie gets a 2 from me and only because of the CGI. Beyond that part, it's irredeemable.Note to Disney: when you create a world with specific laws (i.e. - Users are all powerful), you can't just discard it when you make a sequel, even if it's two decades later. Continuity matters!!!",TRON - Legacy
263,paperback_wizard,TRON: Reloaded,6,17 December 2010,"The story of ""TRON"" is that of a man who enters a computer world inhabited by sentient ""programs"" who are given the choice of either serving the purposes of the megalomaniacal program spreading throughout the system, or fighting to their eventual destruction in the ""Games"". In the first movie, Kevin Flynn, played by Jeff Bridges, must shut down the Master Control Program (MCP) with the help of the eponymous TRON security program. In the sequel, Kevin's son Sam must not only rescue him from the computer world in which he has become trapped, but also defeat CLU, a program Kevin had designed. Though the plots seem similar, there's little of the spirit of the first movie in the second. The MCP was essentially a conquerer, abducting (""appropriating"") other programs, merging his own program with those he felt would be most useful to him and eliminating the others. CLU, on the other hand, seems to be more of a spoiled prince, pitting programs against each other seemingly for nothing more than his own amusement.Flynn himself has become something of a ""God among mortals"" in the world of computers. Everyone knows who he is, and when he's around them, they know it. However, he can't do much against CLU, as a direct confrontation between them could mean the end of both. Sequestering himself to avoid that outcome, Flynn can only wait for something to change. He has a long wait, indeed, since time in the Grid moves much more slowly than in our world.CLU is a bit more proactive, though. When Sam, played by Garret Hedlund, finds his way onto the Grid, CLU makes him compete in the Games. The move is meant to draw out Flynn, and it does; sort of. Quorra, an apprentice of Flynn's played by Olivia Wilde, rescues Sam and takes him to see his father. The reunion is a genuinely touching scene, but it doesn't last long as Flynn quickly informs his son that leaving the world of computers isn't nearly as easy as entering it (which is certainly saying something, considering how difficult entering is). Flynn's reluctance to directly face his creation makes things even more difficult, and Sam is forced to take matters into his own hands with  let's just say ""mixed results"".It's not a bad movie, really. Unfortunately, it suffers from being a sequel. Like the ""Alien"", ""Terminator"", ""Matrix"", and many, many other movie franchises, it capitalizes on the perceived strengths of the first movie instead of the actual ones. I'm not talking about special effects, by the way. After all, who could resist the chance to update the 1982 special effects to the 21st century? The Games are updated, as well, and the action teamed with the special effects and the soundtrack make for several thrilling scenes. If all that director Joseph Kosinski wanted was to make the Games more enjoyable, then he succeeded.But the special effects were never the point of the first movie, anymore than they were the point of ""The Matrix"" or ""Clash of the Titans"". The plot of the first TRON was to halt the spread of a malignant program that either absorbed or destroyed anything it encountered. It was almost biblical in the way that programs kept yearning for the ""Users"" to reassert authority, and how Flynn, an actual User, entered their world, freeing them from the slavery of the MCP to fulfill their true purposes. Whatever metaphor you may use, the first movie didn't move beyond the realm of metaphor. In the end, programs were programs, and they sought for nothing more. In Legacy, however, there's little to distinguish between humans and programs. The movie even makes the outright assertion that programs are their own lifeforms. Again, it's not a bad premise, and I could have accepted it if this weren't supposed to continue the mythology of the first movie.Beyond the disconnect between the two TRON movies, there are a few things about Legacy that just don't quite work. First is the characters and their chemistry. Quorra isn't meant to be a love interest for Sam (at least, I don't think she is), but rather, she is fascinated by both him and his father, and wants to learn as much from both of them about our world as possible. Her earnestness doesn't mix that well with the father-son dynamic. Oddly enough, I have the feeling that any two of the heroes could have built a good on screen chemistry if not for the presence of the third.Legacy incorporates many elements from other sci-fi favorites. That's not surprising or even a problem; after all, very few stories are one hundred percent ""original"". In some cases, though, Legacy seems to borrow entire scenes from other movies. You'll recognize plenty of action sequences, special effects, plot threads, and even a line of dialogue or two from any number of sci-fi/fantasy franchises. During one scene, I half-expected to hear Flynn tell his son ""Great, kid; don't get cocky!"" And, of course, there are several nods throughout to the original film, most handled fairly well by the director and actors, but a couple that warranted at least a facepalm. These are separate from the exposition, of course, which is necessary given the time span between the two movies.I think anyone who sees this movie without seeing the original first will enjoy it; even devout fans of the original, such as myself, will catch themselves grinning during some scenes and gripping the armrests in others. Still, I would have enjoyed it much more if it had been developed independent of the first movie. It may go on to be more successful, more popular, and more acclaimed than the first, but it's not a true sequel.(Originally appeared at http://fourthdayuniverse.com/reports/2010/12/tron-reloaded/ )",TRON - Legacy

Lo and behold Sam gets sucked into the computer too, where he teams up with his Dad and they battle the forces of evil.And this is where the real movie and the real enjoyment starts. There's simply no denying how much fun this movie is, despite the storyline, which is just plain silly at times, and the writing, which leaves a bit to be desired. The experience is big enough and bold enough to easily bat away the little clunky failings.TRON: LEGACY is an enormously entertaining film, it's a Hollywood screen spectacle and proud to be unadulterated entertainment. Go watch it and enjoy!",TRON - Legacy
265,drakula2005,"A sequel, that's on par with the original and even better.Stunning!",10,19 December 2010,"I must begin with the explanation of why i'm giving the full note to the movie-i wasn't the biggest fan of the original Tron (1982) when i saw it, and even though i didn't expect much from the sequel, i was eager to see it, because i am a fan, a huge admirer of Olivia Wilde's and because the timeframe reminded me of another movie, i wasn't so keen to see, last year.A movie, which then turned out to be one of the fullest movies of the year-full of both heart and soul.I even saw it the same day-on the 19-th last year.And i said to myself, there were too many things alike, such as the fact i saw Legacy's trailer at the teather, just before the beginning of Avatar-too many things to throw away such an opportunity.So today i went, and i was totally blown away by, by almost everything.I guess that's what happens when you see a movie you didn't expect to be something special, but that wasn't the case.The experience itself was special-and not in terms in time and date and likeness but in terms of quality.The costumes, the effects, the music, the tone of the movie were special.The actors were the thing i actually wanted to be a little better.I always felt strange, seeing a Jeff Bridges movie-he clearly can act and is a great actor, but i don't like his style very much.I quite expected he would be the show-stealing actor, but i was wrong.It was the beautiful and stunning Olivia Wilde.I am a fan of hers and i always knew she is a great actress with huge potential, but was sad, so to say, by the fact she was great in TV-shows mostly-in House or the O.C. she's great, and now she put that passion in a big project so her talent can be visible for audiences around the world.She has great looks and is a skillfull actress.Only by the look of her eyes i felt what she feels, and that's very important.The bond, the connection with the people, ordinary people in the audience like me was so real and was what left us wanting for more even from other movies.She did that, a thing only a handful of people can do.That's what makes her such important for the movie.I know it sounds cliché but she is really the only woman for this role.No one else could've done it better.Garrett Hedlund, or Sam, was also interesting to see-a fact, i didn't see from the trailers-he has potential and he showed that in the movie.And i forgot to check who played Zuse, but i'm sure it was Michael Sheen, because only he is so crazy and unique in his style.He brought brilliancy and sheer entertainment in his role, it was something great to see.When we talk about the people behind the movie, we must pay a huge credit of the rookie director Joseph Kosinski.Disney made another brilliant gambling move, that's paying off.The man knows what he's doing and the studio was aware of that fact.I'm paying a huge debt to him for the effects as well, because he works with computer generated imagery, also a specialty of his.It will be an interesting thing, to follow his upcoming career moves and projects-he'll become a big face, i'm sure of that.All in all production and effects were great, some fresh faces were introduced and some-rediscovered in this one-hell-of-a-ride sequel, which will stand in mind for a long time to come.Avatar and Tron formed a Christmas movie-going tradition, that one only could hope continues the next year and the one afterwards(a little bit like Saw & PA's Halloween traditions).We, moviegoers, can only hope for things to continue in this direction, because you've brought warmth to this moviegoer's heart during winter-time.I hope people like Joseph Kosinski and Garrett Hedlund continue develop, Jeff Bridges to keep making strange, but otherwise captivating roles, and last but not least, Olivia Wilde to progress, because, she's not just another beautiful face, but a mesmerizing actress as well, who can heaten up a fan's heart and a woman with such skills, suitable for both the big screen and TV-such diversity is rare to see these days.She's something special.I know i'm not objective, but this must and is visible for many people i know and is now visible for everyone.So, all the best for her, and all the cast and crew behind the movie.Because you made one hell of a movie.The new Christmas movie-going tradition is here.And cheers for it.Cheers for ""Tron : Legacy""My grade:A deserved 10/10",TRON - Legacy
266,Colin-630-935811,Visually stunning.,10,30 November 2016,"Tron Legacy is one of my favorite visual movies,along with films like 2001, Alien, Blade Runner,Fury Road and Barbarella,I'm an artist and it's one of my 'go to' flicks for inspiration. The story is OK,as are the performances,the standouts being Michael Sheen and Olivia Wilde,but this film is all about the visuals,and they are truly spectacular,and make up for any of the films faults and weaker points. The costumes,makeup,production design and FX are just jaw dropping,they fill the screen,and combined with the movies other great quality,the incredible score by Daft Punk,I often find myself slack jawed at the awe of it all,it doesn't hurt that it has one of the hottest Sci-Fi chicks ever,the stunning Jem,walking around in light up latex,it's friggin awesome!! The light cycle and club scene are my two favorite bits,and kicks up the visuals to an 11, if that was even possible. So,if you like far out beautifully filmed cinema,and don't mind a weak story,then this is the film for you,I love it,always will,it's fantastic.",TRON - Legacy
267,NikTesla,Visually stunning yet ultimately disappointing,7,19 December 2010,"Visually this movie is stunning. It is a triumph of great visual effects.I am not a great fan of 3D, seeing it as yet just another overblown pile of Hollywood marketing bull. However, in this movie, I thought the 3D was well utilised. Rather than using gimmicky ""flying towards you at every opportunity, the director used it to give The Grid and beyond a real sense of depth. There was, however, some annoying stroboscopic effects when there was swift movement, especially close to the camera.But a movie with great special effects is nothing without a good storyline and characters you can really sympathise with. I did not really feel anything for the characters. To me they seemed to formulaic, spat out of the Hollywood character presses. There was the naive genius/father, the ne'er do well son, the evil villain, his henchmen, the double crosser and the beautiful sidekick who the main character falls in love with.The movie also seemed to be too long, maybe because there seemed to be less action and more jaw flapping than the first movie.Daft Punk came up with an excellent sound track, with their eerie tunes fitting in well with the environment. However, at times I felt the music was too overpowering.I gave the movie a 7 due to the way the movie looked. Without the visuals the movie would be a 4 or, at best, a 4.5 out of 10",TRON - Legacy
268,Snownoise,Only 2 action scenes and that's all you get!,6,26 December 2010,"To me, it was a huge disappointing movie because I could only see 2 action scenes in this movie only at the beginning and the ending. I was expecting more than that. Strangely, the scenes from the first trailer were not even there. They took the whole part of the trailer out of the movie. I've never seen a movie like this which showed the trailers were not even in the movie or took the whole clip out. The graphic was super, I could see it over and over again but 3D was poorly performed. I had to keep taking the 3d glasses on and off again to check the 3D effect which wasn't even necessary. It would've been nicer if this movie is more like a video-game-like-action movie, keeping fighting with each enemy and going up to the next level since the movie is about video game.",TRON - Legacy
269,IllusionOfLife,Most Fun I've had at the Movies in Ages,9,27 June 2011,"So I could make this really short and simply say 'screw the critics, go see this movie NOW!' but you came here to read a review, so let's do it. I had always known of the original TRON's existence and it's significance to visual effects today, but before this year I had always just dismissed it as a relic of the decade before I was born and never thought twice of it. However, that all changed when Disney released the initial test footage for TRON: Legacy (then tentatively titled TR2N). That piqued my interest significantly, and combined with an excellent Viral Campaign/Alternate Reality Game leading up to the film I was persuaded to give the original TRON a shot. What I found was a film with a weak script and visuals that had not aged well, but more importantly, there was also a fantastic and interesting concept that unfortunately had not been properly refined. TRON: Legacy goes a long way towards realizing Steven Lisberger's fantastic concept into something that is not only an interesting idea, but also an incredibly fun ride. But even by making TRON more accessible to a wide audience, it never disrespects the original; if you loved the original film you will appreciate the fact that the movie isn't a clean sweep that tries to pave over the original, it is truly a sequel to TRON and works very well on that level. It also works for new comers as well. There's plenty of fan service, but the movie will never make you feel out-of-the-loop. If you've never seen TRON, don't hesitate to see this film, you'll enjoy it whether you've seen TRON or not (although I do encourage you to give the original TRON a shot, if only for it's historical significance). As a pure sci-fi/action movie TRON: Legacy is fast, intense, and visually incredible; it's akin to riding a really great roller coaster, you may not take very much away from it emotionally or intellectually, but you'll want to come back to it again and again. Let's be honest, though, if you are expecting a movie that's going to be as surprising and intellectually stimulating as Inception or a movie as emotionally resonant as Toy Story 3 your expectations clearly aren't in touch with the real world. So on the subject of 'out of touch' let's address some of the common critic's complaints, shall we? Number 1: ""The plot/script/story is silly."" With even the most basic understanding of what TRON is, you know you're watching a movie about a man who has been trapped in a computer system for twenty years, and in said computer system there are sky scrapers and motorcycles that shoot walls made of light out the back. You should know full well where to set your suspension of disbelief, and what to expect out of a story like this. Number 2: ""There's too much jargon in the film/I don't understand what they're saying."" Come on now, we live in a day and age where everyone *has* to be a techie on some level. The ""jargon"" in this movie, is, in most cases, terms that most people should understand these days, and the more complex stuff is explained well enough within the context of the story that you don't have to understand the technical terms that it refers to, you can just understand its correlation to the plot. Number 3: ""The performances are wooden."" This one's going to be more a matter of opinion, but, while no one was going for an Oscar here, I thought the performances were suitable for the film. I believed each of the characters the entire time, and I never once cringed at line delivery. Again, know where to set your expectations; if you're expecting Jeff Bridges to give another Crazy Heart caliber performance your expectations are too high, however, he's quite a bit better in this than he was in the original TRON, or, more recently, Iron Man. This film is pure popcorn sci-fi/adventure. It's a film that has fantastic visual effects, great action scenes, and a whole lot of fun thrown in. It's not pretentious, it's not trying to be something it's not (unlike a certain James Cameron film from last year); it knows exactly what it is, and if you can allow it to simply be that, it's a great movie that won't disappoint. It has the sci-fi/adventure feel of J.J. Abram's Star Trek, mixed with the pure sense of fun found in Pirates of the Caribbean, and it's all tied together by the rather remarkable concept introduced in the first TRON. I highly recommend this movie, and I definitely encourage you to see this film in IMAX 3D. The 3D effects certainly shine more brightly (both literally and figuratively) with the IMAX technology, and the nearly 45 minutes of the film shot in IMAX are spectacular to behold. It's pricier to see it this way, but if ever there was a movie that demands it, it's this one. Don't wait until Blu-Ray and DVD, don't download it from a torrent, go see this movie in IMAX 3D because it's certainly the best way to experience it. Rating: A-",TRON - Legacy
270,jonesbrooke123,Visually Stunning,9,30 January 2018,"The visuals in this movie alone, are stunning. The story and plot really felt like it followed from the last movie to this one. its a slow pace, but its so fitting for this universe. I loved it and recommended it a lot.",TRON - Legacy
271,Bloomer,"Accepting that the feat of the original film can't be replicated, this was still a bit disappointing.",7,17 December 2010,"I was an 8 year old kid learning to program my Apple II when my dad took me to see TRON in 1983. The film has probably been a bigger deal in my life than I would consciously reckon.I was made aware of this tonight after seeing TRON Legacy. I saw it in 3d at IMAX and it was spectacular, no doubt about that. But the story didn't feel like it had much depth, and there was no sense of wonder.Aesthetically, the feat of the original film is only reproducible by doing something that nobody understands or has imagined yet, and doing it with new technology. The aesthetic of the new TRON is beautiful, but it runs along with my feelings about the diminishing returns of photorealism in gaming - the world of the original TRON didn't look like anything we knew. This new one looks like plenty we know. The world inside the computer has become a concrete looking environment painted with photorealistic CGI. It looks like it's all really there, like it's built out of matter. You can see the real latex wads on people's hands. To me this felt all wrong, somehow.Is this the point? That graphics are going this way? It seems logical, but in a way, I don't even understand the aesthetic of the new film. It didn't seem to bother anyone I saw it with.I enjoyed the film when it was in front of me, but afterwards I felt oddly down about it. I didn't think I went in with manic expectations, but I suppose deep down, I did want more, because the original film has been a part of my consciousness all this time, and it's a film which invoked pure creativity. The new film doesn't touch anything so inspiring, even if it has many good qualities.",TRON - Legacy
272,revenge_of_shinobi,cool movie,7,7 March 2011,"Tron is a big budget Hollywood film that shouldn't work. The reason it shouldn't work is that the story is, beneath the surface, very simplistic. there is that familiar story of someone suddenly out of his normal habitat discovering a strange new land, discovering the good and the evil and then defeating evil to put the world right, much like planet of the apes or buck rodgers or anything else. and it all happens by the book. the characters too are two dimensional but it's tough to criticise it for that considering that they are supposed to be that way, and in fact none of the characters are annoyingly so . the fact is they all lack depth but for some reason its all forgiven and the reason for that is that the world feels so organic and natural even though there is something alien about it. It's super cool to be in a world of blue neon with ambient light and music pulsing throughout the film making you feel that you aren't watching a film but have been enveloped in a uber cool trailer for a soon to be released movie which looks great. the movies sorta washes over you, not hooking you with story or plot or anything but just inviting you into a world so damn beautiful that all you can do is stare at the screen while blue men and red men float about on blue and orange bikes ..wooooooo.",TRON - Legacy
273,ajaiswal-40907,One of the most underrated sci-fi movie,8,6 December 2020,"VFX & cinematography is mind boggling. One would really think its happening inside a video game, story is fine. Bgm & music composed by daft punk is WOW. This movie is technical masterpiece.",TRON - Legacy
274,zerobeat,"Bad acting, but at least the story is terrible.",2,17 December 2011,"Tron? More like TroffThis awful movie gets a 2/10 instead of 1/10 because there's a few lines of dialogue that allude to some interesting things, like how we thought alien intelligent life would come from elsewhere but here it is.... spawned from the algorithms of programming and entirely virtual.So much time is wasted in virtual reality doing boring stuff like fistfights and chases - and almost the entire plot hinges on who is best at doing this. Will the villain steal the disc? Will the hero steal it back? I kept waiting for something slightly more profound, something that plays with the nature of virtual reality, but it never comes.Even in the real world (about 20% of the film) they get stuff so stupidly wrong. Like when Sam zaps a security camera to blank the image but the security guard fixes it by tapping his TV monitor. That's just a little tech thing that's inconsequential to the larger plot, but it's a omen near the beginning of the film that this will be one super lazy script where they just don't care one iota about any of the writing, about logic or consistency or good dialogue.It's like they looked at the special effects and thought ""this ought to be enough, right?"" It's like it was made by people who make porno movies and thought ""everybody just fast forwards to the sex scenes and doesn't care about the inter-connecting story, right?""",TRON - Legacy
275,jadongarcia,"""He doesn't dig imperfection"" neither do the critics apparently",8,8 December 2019,"To start off, the Motion Capture obviously was very uncanny valley, the skin looked too smooth and flexible without any real wrinkles. But that's understandable due to the given circumstances of the technology at the time being(2010, or 2009 when filmed). However that's only the Mo-cap, the rest of the visuals were astonishing. The best aspect of this film was the concept of being in a system that's completely different from our reality. Thanks to the visuals and the amazing, astounding score composed by none other than daft punk themselves, I felt extremely immersed and unable to take my eyes off the screen.Currently I am 18, when I first saw this film I had no intentional expectations and I was about 9 years old. During and after the film, I fell in love with this film so quick, I became obsessed and it lasted a few months. I bought the toys, reenacted the scenes at recess with friends like damn roleplay for crying out loud (who I feel sorry for putting through) but that just shows how much love I had poured into the film and its concepts. Of course reading all of this some might think it was just an obsession and nothing more or less but here I am almost a decade later rewatching it for it's best elements and not just nostalgia even though it took me back to when things were much simpler, I even got teary-eyed a few times when listening to the score, it's so ambient and satisfying to hear and because of the nostalgia it felt like coming back to something I once loved so much. I didn't regret watching this in theaters nor did I regret rewatching the film 9 years later.One interesting lens to see this film through was CLU being Lucifer and Kevin Flynn being God, and the ISOs being jews. Obviously it wouldn't be exactly the same but its somewhat similar on how the ISOs were this race that had been extremely valuable ""the miracle"" as Flynn Calls them. And CLU being like a fallen angel type.",TRON - Legacy
276,Natasha266,I'm a fan of the 1982 movie but not this one...,4,7 March 2011,"I think the writers/producers completely lost the essence of the old Tron. I doubt they even understood what the original story was about. It was a server Operating System portrayed as a virtual world. Corporate servers were a big thing back then, not everyone had access to it. Such an OS allocated priorities & CPU time slices to users who ran programs. The first Tron was very effective in portraying this world ('Bit' was so cute) and stuck to the computer way of thinking and efficiency -- that's why there were no night clubs, fireworks or use of 4 female models to take one's clothes off. The game thing might seem off but hey, programs have to die in one way or another.Back to the movie, the whole script felt patchy, as if they thought of different stories and put them together regardless of whether they fit or not. Very often I felt there were gaps as if they ran out of things to say or do. Acting-wise, I wasn't impressed. Olivia Wilde was pretty awful. I liked her in The OC and House but not in this movie. I don't think she knew what she was supposed to be doing, most time her mouth is left open as if she was in a daze. Was that supposed to reflect the non-acting of Neo (Matrix)? The rest of the movie was too much CGI and Starwars for me. Why would I want to re-see that? Even the sound effects sounded similar to X-Wings or whatever. The CG is big and maybe could explain Tron's lack of depth.28 years in the making and they came up with that... 2/10!",TRON - Legacy
277,Bob_647,"""He taught me the art of the artless: removing myself from the equation""",9,12 November 2013,"Quotes such as that one are vague and confusing, but purpose to symbolize the size of theme among other qualities, that channel to a much deeper film than remarked. Perhaps criticised more than it accredits: Tron: Legacy bases itself from a child's world of men in light-up attire, cartoonish motorcycles, and arena disc battles; yet rises with it's more thoughtful qualities to one of the past decade's better adult action films. It is one of the best settings yet for Garrett Hedlund's career as a Modern Action Star; and is epic, thematic, dramatic, plus of a style it's own to boot.The amazingly produced and precisely contemporary look of the visual work throughout the whole film, not to mention the thrilling score by Daft Punk exposing the talent and craftiness that has kept them at a top level in electronic music do outflash the more intellectual and thoughtful qualities in the film. The epicness of both the visual and musical components of the film are undemanding to be impressed by, and rip about in one's review as I noticed most IMDb members did. But the best epicness is found in how the film identifies itself abstractively and thoughtfully. The story is epic, from setting the epicness with a crazy heist through Encom Tower by the young Sam Flynn to open the film, to the scale of many of the events in the Grid: the Arena Fight, the Journey to the Portal, the Army Clue organizes. What is also remarkable is how the film merges epicness with it's action scenes so that they have a vast presence to them. Most action films constrict their fight scenes to the actual fight, but in TRON there are fights in whole Arenas, skybreaking high-rises, and vast terrain that not only add an epic bump through their visual appearance, but epic concept too.But what is ever more intellectual and thoughtful in the film is it's thematicness. Most of the dialogue (such as ""This will change everything: Science, Medicine, Politics, Religion, Philosophy"") and story (such as the ISOs emerging out of an unexplained void) opened some intellectual themes such as the Digital Revolution of the Grid, Humans vs. the Technology of the Programs, the Condition of Human Existence compared to the Programs and ISOs' own condition, the Evilness from Resentment of Clue, or the Human obsession with achievement in the ""Perfect System"" but never progressed beyond that, rather symbolised in vague pieces of dialogue or unexpanded points of event such as the examples aforementioned.What the film did present clearly was drama. As the story perished and fogged after the protagonists escaped from the ambush at Zeus', the dramatic feel to the film emerged more after that point. Most of the ""campy"" acting in Clue's tyrannical speech to his army, or Kevin Flynn's sorrow at sacrificing himself for his son's escape were what the film discontinued story to capacitate: fitting drama through dramatic scenes in the film; the intellectual appearance of which is too high for most typical action films to ever fit.The rise of TRON: Legacy to the level of most popular and good action films full of explosive chases, hot girls, flashy violence, intense acting, and rough stories also happens due to it's style. When all of the aforementioned components compose an action film, they complete a style sufficiently prototypical of the genre to ensure the film as stylish. TRON: Legacy is ensured by it's own style: futuristic vehicles, hot tightsuits (on both men and women!), bleak locales, digital environments, and those flashy discs, keeping the film styled even when constricted from the visual and musical wonder.But among all these edges that qualify the film, the best is the rise of Garrett Hedlund as an Action Star. Completing a performance that credibly appears as a fearless, proud, and self-absorbed youngster would suffice. But Hedlund reaches at more, applying an intricate character development of boy to man that constitutes developing composure, relating paternally, braving antagony, and winning Cora to connect to any watching young man. Hedlund's performance and the other edges aforementioned leave the watcher with a mad wicked action film.",TRON - Legacy
278,musanna-ahmed,"Storyline not the best, but a technically outstanding achievement",8,17 December 2010,"28 years it has been since the cult classic sci-fi TRON. Now Disney has released the sequel which should have been titled TR2N. The original film saw computer hacker and employee for a company named ENCOM Kevin Flynn downgraded to running a video game arcade and ending up being teleported into the digital world he created himself and being forced to be challenged in the games that again he created himself and with the help of a program, his self placed task was to defeat the MCP (Master Control Program) who was dominating the digital world with the help of a program called Tron. For anyone that never saw the first Tron, note that the people inside are known as the 'programs' and anyone abducted into the world, Kevin for instance, are unidentified as programs and simply called 'users'. The film received a cult following and was well received by critics despite the storyline being criticised. Now after 28 years, the amount of work they probably put in that amount of time (or could have) should result in something spectacular. Read on to see if it does.TRON: Legacy follows the son of Kevin, Sam (Garrett Hedlund) out on a search for his father. It opens with a scene set in the time roughly when the first film was set and has Kevin telling Sam a story about the Grid – the digital world that Kevin entered – and he promises to take Sam to the Grid. After leaving the house for work one day, news reports start claiming that Kevin has disappeared and that is when Sam's search begins for his father. We are then took to the future where a grown up Sam is driving to his father's company ENCOM and upon arriving there, uploads a virus to the company's mainframe before getting arrested. This doesn't prove to be a significant scene in the film though as we are never taken back to ENCOM. That's minus points for plot. Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner), the close friend of Kevin, returns (a lot older obviously) and sends Sam to investigate a page that was originally from Kevin's relinquished arcade. Sam travels to the arcade and discovers Kevin's office at the bottom of some stairs concealed behind the arcade machine. He then tries to investigate the page via the computer Kevin used to hack with and is pulled into the Grid himself. Equipped by female warriors with a disc and attire that users possess in the Grid, he encounters the survival challenges himself and encounters another female warrior called Quorra (Olivia Wilde). With her aid, together they set out to seek Kevin in the Grid and bump into Clu 2onto the way – the duplicate Kevin had created which turned against him.Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner reprise their roles from the original film. As well as Kevin, Bridges is also the face of Clu 2 with CGI used to de-age. Critics hailed the first film for its acting and this is delivered again here. Bridges is as convincing as ever as the two characters he plays however the computer generated face of Clu 2 becomes a lot less convincing as you see more of the character, ends up looking like a permanently straight-faced face with thick make-up poured upon. Garrett Hedlund shined in his role as Sam, Olivia Wilde was wonderful as Quorra and Michael Sheen who was rather unrecognisable did a fabulous job as Castor, the program running a club at the top of a tower.Talking visually, this is one of the best films of the year, beats just about every real world 3D picture of this year. When the trailers were first shown, the CGI looked promising and it sure impressed mightily. The film defines how a 3D film should be made; it wouldn't be a surprise if the next 3D sci-fi picture borrows a thing or two from this. The start of the film has a notice which tells us that several scenes are intentionally done in 2D and the majority are the ones outside in the real world. In the Grid is where the magnificent 3D action takes place. Plenty of moments that are 'in your face' show why the film should be watched in 3D. With the film being set many years later, it makes sense to why everything is revolutionised, from the neon lights to the sound to the upgraded vehicles. Talking about the sound, the musical score in the film is incredible. The entire film feels alive and you can just sense the incredible atmosphere in the theatre when sat watching this film.TRON: Legacy has taken a massive step forward technically from the last film and in 28 years with modern day technology, it is a visual masterpiece. However, just like the last film, the storyline is a let down with the film showing scenes that could turn significant but then take a different direction to where they could have possibly gone and it all becomes subtle but then forgotten, such as the coin given at the start and the aforementioned ENCOM scene. Overall, Disney has provided a spectacular eye candy 3D experience to end 2010 off with despite the lacklustre plot. Worth watching but only in 3D.",TRON - Legacy

At the end of the movie I just sat there and thought to myself, what did I just see. It was as fresh and new as Tron was back in the 80's. Just like then, I caught myself saying and thinking the same thing.Just wait and see, this flick will take either best sound or best special effects at he Oscars.Oh yes, do see it in 3D, this one is worth the money . . . it really is.

281,NotTheOne000,Bookending the CGI revolution,9,24 December 2010,"When Tron was released, it was not the CGI piece it's sometimes though to be. Much of the action was cartoon style animation, and the look of the film owed more to the influence of computer games than actual CGI. However, there were some important CGI effects used the in the film that were truly ground breaking and many years ahead of their time.Tron: Legacy, like its predecessor, is a flawed film. The dialogue is not great and the acting limited, as was the case with the original. However, the CGI effects are the mark of the full maturation of special effects. With the exception of the CGI version of a younger Flint, which doesn't quite convince as really human, the whole universe of Tron: Legacy is so realistic that it is the first truly believable computer generated reality. Unlike LoTR or Avatar, you do not find yourself thinking ""Ah, yes that's clearly CGI"". The rendering is exquisite; the proportions and angles are perfect and the sharpness and frame rate the best I've seen in a 3D film. So much so that the visuals are frequently breathtaking in a way that Avatar wasn't but Kubric's 2001: A Space Odyssey was.Importantly, real human actors have been used wherever possible. There is only one CGI entity in the film, and no CGI creatures. The environment and objects look completely real. Also, the film makers have avoided the typical mistake of overly showing you that the film is in 3D. Instead, the designers of the action set pieces have simply taken advantage of the extra dimension. The three main action scenes - the light bike scene, the disk battle and the dogfight - are wonderfully three dimensional. You don't really realise you're watching a 3D movie, but there's no way the 2D experience would be as effective. In my mind, the final dogfight is the best scene of its type since the famous assault on the Death Star in Star Wars.As for other aspects - the acting is not great but is serviceable. Flint Jr has similar mannerisms to his father and the Programmes are interesting, though more visually than in their dialogue. The story is simple enough, but no less complex and no less allegorical than Avatar. Timely questions about our daily immersion in the computer world and the inevitable outcome of humanity's quest for perfect efficiency in all things are addressed. The soundtrack is worth a special mention as it integrates very well with the film, and I don't think the film would work half as well without it.So, to sum up. If you want a complex philosophical investigation into the nature of reality vs fantasy, you'd be better off watching Inception. However, if you're the type of movie fan who loves beautiful imagery then Tron: Legacy is well worth the watch. There are moments in the film where the visual and audio come together perfectly, and genuine 3D cinema art is achieved. Until Tron: Legacy I wasn't convinced we really needed 3D, but now I can see how, if the director knows what he's doing, it's possible to do things in 3D that you can't in normal movie-making.

283,Kosinus,That's what I call quite good...,8,8 January 2011,"honestly, though loving tron for many reasons I have to admit its naivety and of course its age. The original tron may be more than other movies connected to its time through its style. So what have we here now? Tron: Legacy picks us up where we were left: names, places, situations... and then the original idea evolves without really contradicting its origin. It feels plausible.Several things has been done to please the fan, the knowing nerd maybe. Still this movie stands by itself. So nothing to be missed when being too young ;-) On the downside: if you love movies, you might have seen it all before. Stunts, perspectives, twists, attitudes... some movies are best enjoyed with a blank mind. So what? The more we know that harder we are to please...Outstanding is the look&feel. Visuals are beautiful (if you like this cyber-style), Action is well executed and in some scenes nicely use what comes with that certain environment. Clearly a great decision was to have DaftPunk for the music. The rejuvenation did happen on all levels: Story, Design and Music! Several images even reveal that there was a certain awareness of social or political implication, though being rather irrelevant for such a movie. Not as strong as in Singer's x-men but enough to stick out.Overall: This is more than simple eye-candy. ... and I wasn't this excited about watching a movie for a long time!",TRON - Legacy

285,ffiisshh,I am TRON. I fight for he Users (of IMDb).,8,27 December 2010,"I just watched it at an IMAX 3D, last night, and I was extremely impressed. As a sequel to the original I think it lived up to all of my expectations and went well beyond the original story line. First let me just say that the special effects were totally awesome, or as Flynn would say in 80's vernacular ""radical"". The plot was original and did not stray too far off the path of the ""digital"" reality world as laid out in the first one. Jeff bridges was geat, as always, Olivia Wild was just....well...wild (to look at), but TRON was practically non-existent in this movie (strange that they should call this movie ""Tron"" and not show the main character for 99 percent of the movie....(this is what they did back in 1982, as well...strange, huh?)

I really am angry that I could not find a regular showing of this out and about, sod off 3d! No wonder illegally downloads are going up, with the lack of showings that are not this so called 3d.About the film, first, you do not need too see Tron before hand, as there is plenty of plot, back story. So anyone saying there is no story, must of seen some other film. Jeff Bridges really must of had loads of fun doing this film, as he owns it. Yes it really does look and SOUND very good, the music by DAFT PUNK is to die for.A sort of wild western family with the Sam Flynn as the son in the wild frontier of Earth still longing for his father and trying to prove himself, Quorra is the adopted daughter who Kevin Flynn dotes upon and she seeks to prove herself and brush off her naiveté.The digital world is just as wild as the real world instead of guns and horses of the wild west, discs and light cycles are the weapons of choice. Okay, I'm reading this much, but this is a film about family bonding through adversity in a wild land.Not film of the year as we have another week but it's up there. Looking forward to Tangled next year over here, not in 3d or I might take up downloading to see films at this rate if things don't improve.Other note, A nod to AstroBoy -2009 cgi version female lead Cora, Tron Legagy- Quorra, spelt different but spoken the same, and both have short hair and are feisty.",TRON - Legacy

In fact I have fallen asleep every time I have tried to watch it, whether it have been in my high school science class to trying to watch it again before seeing the new one. But Tron Legacy really fixed what the original did wrong...in that it wasn't boring. Yes, it is visually pleasing and yes the CGI was great, but also the story was something that the audience could grasp and ALMOST fully understand and follow. The action was great.

295,MoronUnited,An Unbelievable Sequel to an Unbelievable Classic,10,15 December 2010,"Yes, Tron: Legacy is not only an absolutely incredible movie, but it truly is one of the greatest cinematic experiences to ever exist.When the Tron sequel rumors were finally starting to take flight, I was absolutely ecstatic. I am a Tron freak, and getting a sequel when all hope was pretty much lost was far more than I could handle. Everything that was being said was incredible and it was overwhelmingly positive. As we approached the release date, it started becoming more and more apparent that the task was too great and that nobody could honestly pull off a sequel that deserves to be called a sequel to Tron. I was wrong. I was dead wrong. I was dead ****ing wrong, and the fact that I can say that makes me happier than you can even imagine.The storyline is a tribute to the die-hards, an absolutely brilliantly crafted blend of old and new. The acting is fantastic, and seeing Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner in a new Tron movie is simply surreal, not to mention Olivia WIlde and Garret Hedlund are unbelievable. The score is not entirely orchestral anymore, but who cares since the Daft Punk score is shockingly effective and submersive. The visuals take Tron to a whole new level, and while they don't hold the same charm as the original, they are impressive in an entirely new way. Where Tron invented the wheel, Tron Legacy reinvents the earth the wheel turns on. To be stunned at computer visuals in a time where I am completely sick of the stuff is amazing, and Tron Legacy absolutely delivers.Flynn's Arcade has been reconstructed to the point where each floor tile is in the exact right place, and, and.....it's just absolutely brilliant. It looks like a Tron movie, it feels like a Tron movie, and it absolutely deserves to be called a Tron movie. The only possible complaints I have are that Jeff Bridges' CGI face looks amazingly creepy but I understand there was no possible way around that, and no inclusion of Only Solutions. It's basically the theme song to Tron, and it's not there.......anywhere. At least Separate Ways is in there, so I shall forgive.In short, Tron Legacy is more fan-service than any fan could have ever asked or dreamed for. It's a stunning production in absolutely every shape and form, and I am going to shut up now and bask in the glory that is one of the most satisfying sequels ever made.",TRON - Legacy
296,maverick-vishal,Scores great on Visuals and soundbut the script????,6,20 December 2010,"The plot of the movie is that of Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund) , the tech-savvy 27-year-old son of Kevin Flynn(Jeff Bridges),who tries to look into the disappearance of his father which leads him to the virtual world his father's been trapped in for almost 2 decades. What follows is a stunning visual delight with some edgy fight and chase sequences, displaying great maneuvers!!!! Sheer Visual Treat..!!In this movie, the soundtrack (courtesy Daft Punk) comes as the real winner. It makes the complete feel of the Virtual world so real and upbeat that it is hard not to enjoy. The fights and clash along with some very ecstatic tracks feels terrific.The script is the real culprit which takes the entire feel to an unexpected low. The characters are weak, so is the acting, even Bridges could not give justice to his ""Kevin Flynn"" character. But CLU was very well played by him(Yeah, Jeff Bridges appears in 2 Guises).Sam(Garrett) is just another character played in a very clichéd manner. Olivia Wilde is also just OK as the doe eyed ""Quorra"". Michael Sheen as ""Castor"" has a sort a cameo. But still his 5 minutes of screen presence impressed me.Director's job is just OK. Not extraordinary. The original TRON ('82) was a cult movie then.

Though I would have rather seen them redo the original movie and add the effect that were not possible back thenI still enjoyed this movie very much! The storyline seemed to drag a little bit, there seemed to be a lot of pauses in between the action, but overall a great movie. If you are going to see the moviedon't see it in 3D. There are VERY few 3D effects (if any) in the movie, and to be honest, it will be a waste of your money if you see it in 3D.

It never had a moment like Independence Day where they took out an alien ship because they never invented anti virus software.The world is also truly amazing, it was so cool to see there vision of a digital world, the action is fun and hectic and I enjoyed it all.The only reason I wouldn't rate this a little higher is because of CLU, the technology just is not there yet to replicate a human completely and at times he seemed to odd to me especially when he spoke.But in short fun action flick and I am pretty sure Jeff Bridges has a little fun with his character from the Dude in this.",TRON - Legacy
301,ryokan_wc,A ride of brilliant graphic!,8,8 January 2011,"To be completely honest, I did not notice the existence of 'TRON: Legacy' in the cinemas until recently as it wasn't my first choice of movie- I was much anticipating Narnia then. But when I saw the trailer with its stunning black, blue and yellow colour contrasts, I thought ""This looks interesting"". And it surely is! The story packs an extraordinary simplicity of quest. It begins with Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) telling his son, Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund) about the Grid and he looks forward to taking him there someday. Unfortunately, something goes awry and he gets 'trapped' in the world of programs. Growing up, Sam longs for the return of his father. When his uncle receives a message, Sam slowly finds his own way into the Grid. That's when the real adventure begins, and the most interesting parts of the movie prevail! The Grid is no longer the safe place he thought of or first imagined. Clu, the ruler of the Grid, forces him into battles of survival, putting him up against challenges with other programs. This is one of the best parts of the movie- the battles! The disc war and the motorbike wipeout, to be exact. The effects generated in these scenes are spectacular, with timely slow motion actions to create suspense and anticipation. The formation of the bike in computer looks stunning and as a teen, we go 'wow' and we wish we can own it in our real world.His ultimate goal is to search for his father and tries to bring him back into the real world. With the aid of Quorra (Olivia Wilde), she leads him to his father and they have to exit the Grid before the gateway closes. Race to the exit is exhilarating, again with its stunning visuals of the jet fights. No doubt, this movie places its emphasis on graphical effects and it surely is well paid off! The storyline may be common, draggy at the development and rather predictable, but I always believe in the 'how' than the 'what', and the 'how' especially the aforementioned scenes triumphs in this movie.It has great cast, in that sense a good selling point as it brings back Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner from its original TRON, and Garrett to me is the perfect guy to play Sam.I look for lessons to learn in movies and in this, I found family love and cooperation to work out best. Without a doubt, Sam and Kevin shares a typical father-son love that drives one another to bring out the best, even going the extra mile. Sacrifices by fathers for sons and courageous acts from sons to their fathers clearly displayed in this movie. And of course, without teamwork, there is no way to survive in the battles.While this movie has values to learn and great acting, the best remark I can say goes to its effects (once again) and it is the effects alone that will appeal to you and makes you want to watch this movie. Get ready for a ride of its brilliant graphic!",TRON - Legacy

It's a glorified motion-master ride that discharges levels of cornea abuse and motion nausea. Legacy is just two hours of overbearing, arbitrarily plotted aridity. Miscast lead Hedlund is in serious need of a personality transplant, forcing Bridges to do the heavy lifting and make anything of the father-son heart-to-hearts even remotely matter. Like the original, ""Tron: Legacy"" obsesses over technology and style but forgets critical details like character and plot. The reason it already looks dated is because its timeless elements are missing.",TRON - Legacy
303,glen-88,Tron: Lunacy,7,18 December 2010,"Tron has always been a childhood favorite, visually, stylistically, and idea wise - it was an amazing film but after watching it again as an adult, I realize it had some problems as well - mainly some weak plot development and character arcs.Tron Legacy, in this regard, follows it predecessors exactly in both it's accomplishments and snafus. The film opens solidly with Sam Flynn (Flynn's son) dealing with the loss of his long gone father and running off with Encom's Operating system - making it open source for all to use. Against the wishes the corporate board. A few nods are made to the original here - (we briefly meet Dillinger's son and see he has some part seemingly in the company's power structure, and the BIG DOOR makes a cameo appearance - you know the one.) Sam eventually makes it onto a new computerized grid (albeit with less flash than Flynn did in the original)in the back of his father's abandoned arcade. This new grid is dark and beautiful all at once. From there he is captured, forced to play the games - though cool to watch, seem to stand out less to me than the first time around, and meets Clu 2.0. Our antagonist. He eventually escapes and meets up with Flynn, and the two, with the help of some weird half program/lifeform (who takes the shape of a hot woman) journey towards the portal out in the far wastelands of the grid, chased of course by Clu and it turns out Clu's henchman - Tron (who was reprogrammed). At the end, Tron has a sudden change of heart, Flynn kills himself to take out Clu and Sam and robo girl escape back into the real world. Sam decides to take his position as head of the company and he and digi chick ride off into the sunset.Now that I've condensed the film into a few paragraphs let me encode to you it's pluses and minuses. Positives: Visually beautiful film, Some of the story subplots are very interesting, and the action is a lot of fun to watch.Negatives: The story starts a bunch of subplots that never really develop: First they bring in Dillinger's son, he seemingly has some power in the company, but nothing ever happens with him and he never is referenced again.Tron has a great subplot - he was repurposed to be Clu's evil right hand hatchet man but he suddenly has a change of heart in the last few minutes of the film (literally within ten seconds by voicing some old dialouge from the last film, tries to stop Clu and dies). He's amazing to watch when he fights - it's a huge twist in the story and he gets very little screen time to develop his arc. Almost none. So in the end the Titular character has a somewhat brief appearance and his motivations remain vague. Flynn's motivations also seem a little weak but even more than that Flynn apparently has God-like powers in this new grid - which are never discussed or shown in any way that makes sense, so when he sacrifices himself and throws his digital magic around, it feels a little too deus ex machina...but then again that's exactly what he is, so maybe I'm just being a little too anal about that one.The new life forms on the grid (I forget the bizarre name they give) that look like programs, act like programs, bleed like programs but aren't programs..entirely, are not really developed much - except that Clu tried to wipe them all out..for some vague reason and the only one that remains is Sam's new digital girlfriend. Apparently these beings will ""change everything"" but how exactly they'll do that is never talked about. This subplot really felt unneeded to me. Clu own agenda of invading with a digital army of his own into the real world is enough of a threat (albeit kind of a lame one). Finally all the weird inconsistencies with how the digital world works leaks through the fabric of the film's beautifual visual style...i.e. why is there real food in the grid? How can a digital program have a real body in the real world? How is Sam's girlfriend suddenly outside and in physical form at the end of the film?And why exactly did Flynn repurposing Clu at the end, and killing himself in the process for some reason, destroy or knock out the grid? What the hell did Sam save to his little zip disk at the end? WHAT THE HECK WAS THE POINT OF ANY OF IT?The answer: A thrown together script, a lotta hype, and lots of pretty cgi. Tron Legacy may someday stack up in cult circles like it's father did, and it may even get a sequel but the filmmakers need to remember it's not the dollars spent on cgi bits and bytes that count, it's the hours spent writing cohesive arcs and plots.",TRON - Legacy
304,loccomotive2000,Over-expectation strikes again...,7,18 December 2010,"The last blockbuster of 2010 comes in the form of the long awaited sequel to the 80s visual effects landmark, TRON, which despite it's limited success both critically and commercially, has amassed a cult following spanning two decades.TRON: Legacy takes place some twenty over years after the events of the first film. Kevin Flynn, CEO of software company Encom, had gone missing without a trace, leaving his empire to his disillusioned son, Sam, who still wonders why his father would leave him behind without a word. The hero's call arrives in the form of a page from Kevin's old arcade, and from there, Sam is transported to a cyberworld his father created called The Grid, filled with programs that behave like sentient beings, where he must win gladiatorial games in order to survive...or vice versa.The most undeniably brilliant aspect of Legacy would of course be the visuals. They've made one hell of an upgrade from the designs in the original, and its wonderful seeing how director Joseph Kosinski pushed the boundaries but remained within the physical laws of the lightcycle battles and the disc wars. Coupled with sleek choreography, it's one of the most original action sequences I've seen in a while.Oscar winner Jeff Bridges barely breaks a sweat in both roles as Kevin Flynn and his rogue creation, the program CLU, the latter which is an eerie ""de-aged"" version of Bridges. As Flynn, he assumes a sage-like persona, a Zen master of sorts, who watches in despair as his corrupted creations wreck havoc in his supposedly perfect world. Garrett Hedlund as Sam is somewhat average in his delivery as a frustrated young man, but is nonetheless competent. And Olivia Wilde, as Kevin's apprentice Quorra, makes a great addition as the ass-kicking eye candy, who is also revealed to have a much more pivotal role as the story progresses.The films also contains lots of allusions to themes from various religions and schools of thought, most prominently Christianity and Buddhism, giving a nice touch of depth to the film. The most obvious parallels being how CLU turned on his creator, all the characters' desire to attain liberation from the virtual world, and how our trio of heroes assumed the roles in the Trinity. I am a free thinker fascinated with films that carry philosophical themes in them, and while Legacy is no Matrix, it's just as fun delving into. Now for the drawbacks, which I am quite reluctant to address. Legacy faces a bit of pacing problems from not just having to introduce those who hadn't seen the original to The Grid, but explaining what had happened in between the two movies, and setting up a whole new storyline that sparks off from those events. The plot devices used to drive the story also tends to be rather weak and uninspired, which undermines the necessity of a number of scenes and characters. The 3D is also only present for about half the film, and does just a bit more to enhance the experience of The Grid, which is thankfully already mind-blowing on its own.Lastly, Daft Punk's music score deserves special mention. It is an absolute masterstroke; there's just no other way to complement this movie than electronic music, and combined with violins, they effortlessly takes you for a spin on the lightjet.Overall, the film is a visionary spectacular and an effective action film, but the story could well be improved. Having not learned my lesson and going into the cinema with expectations so high, in part thanks to the huge hype surrounding the movie, there's no helping the feeling of disappointment. Despite that, the fantastic visuals managed to excel on its part and provides a comforting consolation in this high tech adventure.That about sums it up. End of Line.",TRON - Legacy
305,gollumsmeagolrocks,This movie has far deeper themes than people give it credit for,8,14 November 2015,"The original movie was generic. While it's far from bad, it's plot was simplistic in terms of the overall focus being on the good vs evil side and less on the thematic element it established of Flynn and all users being gods. It serves as a mythology, however, to a much more insightful legend which unfolds in this movie. But the problem is, due to the somewhat simplistic nature of the predecessor, people failed to give attention to the themes of this film, preferring to focus on the generic side as that's what they'd expect from a Tron movie. But the movie doesn't stay generic, so when viewers find nothing simple to see they assume the movie is empty. It's not, they're minds are just preset to look for simple ""turn off your brain and be entertained"" values, which simply aren't present in this film.The whole movie, just like the original, is similar to the idea of a religious mythology. The original featured programs as disciples of the users, enslaved for their belief. But that plays a small role overall. Here, when the Grid is reprogrammed to the image of Kevin Flynn, Flynn is established to the status of ""the one true god"" at least of this version of the grid, and all the other users who contribute new programs are just angels. But the maker of this world is Flynn, regardless of whether or not he writes the fates of these people. So, much like the original Hebrew form of god, he is not so much a ruler who demands worship or enforce any rules but just a wise and experienced being here to help when he's needed.And it's not so much an analogy to call Flynn god as it is TRUE. He has successfully created a world, not a platform. A world that's self sustaining and requires no more intervention of the users, as displayed by the ISOs which created themselves and were programmed by no-one.And this demands many questions! If they'd been allowed to live, would the ISOs have made this world like our own in thousands of years? Does this mean that's how our own god could have created our own world and how we came to be? Questions of such layered nature can't simply be ignored as style over substance.And then there comes CLU, the best friend of Flynn who he trusted. But as god, I dare say it, may have been somewhat confused in his image he had for the world in his early form, so did Flynn suffer from this same confusion of image for his world. This causes CLU to suffer a similar fate of uncertainty, making him only able to understand that his god is incapable of creating a perfect world since he can't imagine one. Thus, taking matters into his own hands, he abandons his god and does what he sees to be right. But the problem is he expects to get a different result with the same thinking as his flawed god, the only thinking he has been exposed to, and makes even worse mistakes than his god, making Flynn see the errors of his ways. Thus, a most appropriate analogy, CLU becomes the Satan to Flynn's god.But the ultimate piece of symbolism that outmatches anything else in the movie, is the final attempt of CLU to get Flynn's disc. He realizes Flynn has tricked him, by giving the disc he sought to his son. He discovered that the son of Flynn, and thus the son of a god, has obtained the disc and power he seeks, and thus he must obtain it. There is so much symbolism that flies past viewers in what happens next. When CLU realizes he has been tricked, he raises his disc to derez Flynn and then go get the right one, but only violently places the disc beside Flynn, subtly showing in the end he still considered Flynn his friend and could not bring himself to kill him. CLU runs to obtain this disc from the obstacle stopping him from having the ultimate power, showing the rivalry between the Satan and savior of this world.Such themes like this show the filmmakers truly put a lot of thought into their creation, not a lack of it, so people need to stop discrediting them and their work.",TRON - Legacy
306,loganholley,"Eh, I believe, properly describes it",6,2 August 2016,"I'm going to begin this review like every other review I've written in this year and past that (b/c I'm quite lazy): Tron Legacy is an... interesting film.I'm not some kiddie that grew up with the original Tron, so I rented and watched it prior to seeing this in theaters back in 2010. While age has not been all too polite to the original Tron, there's always the new movie... right? Eh, maybe.I am a sucker for just about anything as long as it's got good visuals, an intriguing story, and great characters to back it... and I hate to say it, by TL only got PART of that right. It's CG work is excellent, and the action scenes are really well shot. On top of this, the acting (while not top-notch) is decent in most regards. To top this cake off, the soundtrack... is awesome. I don't usually care about soundtracks in movies, but this one stood out to me quite a bit more than that of many movie soundtracks that reuse the same songs you've already heard on the radio about a bazillion times.While all that is nice and kind... I believe there's something MISSING from that previous paragraph that I said would make me a sucker for just about anything... oh, yeah, I remember now! The compelling story and intriguing cast of characters! The story itself isn't awful by any means, and starts out quite well... but as the movie goes on, I found it less and less compelling than it SHOULD be. The characters aren't that well written, either. I never felt I really cared for any of the characters and the things they do because they all felt flat to me, missing any type of PROPER motivations and/or characterizations.All in all, I think about the best way to describe Tron: Legacy is this: A cardboard-cutout in a store that looks and sounds more amazing than many other cardboard-cutouts... but that's all it is: a cardboard-cutout. It looks and sounds amazing, but it's nothing really more than that.",TRON - Legacy
307,StrifeLeeSimpson,No Spoilers,10,21 July 2020,"In my mind this movie would have been great if not for the digital de-aging done for Jeff Bridges. It showed too much right from the start and it left a weird feeling for the entirety of an otherwise awesome movie. The score was one of the best film compositions I have ever heard and was pivotal in telling the story of a young man in a strange land looking for his father. The effects were incredible, acting was great and you could tell the filmmakers cared about what they were making. It captured what the original film was going for and enhanced everything about it. All in all it was a very enjoyable experience and I think about this picture quite often and listen to Daft Punk's soundtrack even more often. Highly recommended. I just wish someone could go back and fix the de-aging effect.",TRON - Legacy
308,wolfbeast,Rehashing the same'ol,2,14 December 2010,"A rehash of the old concept - Adding some things from modern video games, but otherwise it's just another rehash with a forced story to try and have it make sense. As such there is nothing original in this movie, with its only plus point being good acting.Mediocre in the GFX department, about on par to what you'd expect. Same for the (lack of) story, and the necessary and predictable ""heavy family values"" one can expect from a modern Disney Studios movie.If you want to push 3D movies, then you could be more original than doing this. Seriously...My opinion? Don't waste your time and money on watching this. Mildly entertaining for an afternoon outing - at most.",TRON - Legacy
309,zordmaker,Tron: Legacy - Bitter sweet for original TRON fans,7,28 December 2010,"Let me say this first. At 43 I am just glad that I lived long enough to see a sequel to the original TRON film. I saw the first one in the cinema when I was 15 and ever since, it has remained my overall favourite film of all time (and that's saying something, given the fact that I spent about 8 years working in the big budget film sector here in Sydney in the '90s and so I'm well versed on what it takes to bring a film such as ""TRON"" to the screen). That any sequel was made at all was a miracle. But I must say that some aspects of ""Tron Legacy"" were an absolute delight while others were annoying and fell expectedly well short.I must strongly disagree that this film is short on story. It's rare nowadays to find a film of this genre with such a strong and complex plot line - one which kind of keeps you watching because you just have to know what's going to happen next. However there was definitely far too little ""tron"" in TRON:LEGACY. Oh well.The film was enjoyable, the soundtrack refreshing (if not a little loud in the cinema we saw it in) and from the first frame it differentiated itself as unmistakably TRON. The most reassuring thing (to me) about the film was that the producers resisted the urge to create the film entirely in CGI and that the film was largely still deliberately driven by live performances. The reported shortcomings of CLU were virtually invisible to me anyway. Now the brickbats. The serious downfall with ""TRON:LEGACY"" is the almost non existent art direction and seriously deficient production design. The first TRON will always stand as an artistic masterpiece – and art was sadly the most lacking component in this almost annoyingly dark and monochromatic film which seems to have been shot entirely using black, blue and orange and just about nothing else.All the ""Disney Hallmark"" awe, wonder and ""otherworldliness"" of the original TRON is completely absent from this film. The mastery of Syd Mead and the many other designers who set the artistic foundation for the original TRON was completely ignored. The costume design was atrocious, more like a leather biker gang bang than anything TRON like. The ""Black on Black"" colour scheme made movement hard to watch.Most of the ground rules set by the original TRON were well and truly broken, leaving me somewhat feeling betrayed and confused. Other critics have focused on Sam's arrival in the TRON world in his regular street clothes as the best example of this (and I agree) however in short the TRON world didn't look anything like ""another world"" at all. The complicated procedure of transferring a human between worlds - done so elegantly in the first film – was completely ignored in ""TRON – LEGACY"". Just about everything (including all the vehicles, clothing and especially Flynn's Pad) worked towards trying to convince us that ""the grid"" was a REAL place where the laws of physics and matter apply just the same way as they do here on mother Earth. This (in my opinion) was a drastic mistake and centres on the biggest shortcoming of this film. Sam's transfer into the computer world made it look more like he had just walked into the next room rather than been transferred into an alien, incredible and frightening alternate reality.To summarize. Both the original TRON and the very appropriately named TRON:LEGACY stand alone as good films worthy of viewing in their own right. Fans of the original (like me) will find themselves feeling shortchanged on some aspects but very satisfied with others. Audiences who have not seen the original are likely to now want to seek it out and watch it. I can't but help thinking that TRON:LEGACY would have worked out far better (and more profitable) on a much smaller budget. The 3D works very well with this property. Given the 27 years we had to wait for TRON:LEGACY, no sequel could ever have lived up to the expectations left behind by the original. However the name now leaves us all in search of the truth – a ""legacy"" between the two now truly exists – and it will be a brave director indeed who agrees to take the property to it's next level. Let's hope we don't have to wait another 27 years for that to happen.Paul Matthews Sydney Australia http://artelex.com",TRON - Legacy
310,Jorgosch,Wasted opportunity,6,3 March 2011,"It's difficult to judge Tron:Legacy. While some aspects of the film let it rise above average, other aspects equally drag it down into the bog of forgettableness. Sure, you get high production values, nice special effects, more chill Jeff Bridges than you've had since the Big Lebowski and you meet the old gang of sorts.On the other hand, the script has awkward pacing, trying to pull a Matrix on you with pseudo-philosophic techno-babble monologues and only managing to bore you during large parts. The main character of Sam Flynn is miscast, there is no tangible emotion between him, his movie-father or any other character. The film has no character development, creates no tension and generally feels like a paint-by-numbers. Even the music score is dreary.But, if you look at it from another angle, the film manages to create an accurate representation of a sterile digital world. And there you have your message: it's an analogy for computer geeks never leaving the spot in front of their monitors, ultimately being trapped and lonely all their lives.",TRON - Legacy
311,bote,"visually spectacular, take it for what it is",6,28 December 2010,"Last year, when G4 network was still carried by DirecTV, I watched the original Tron movie several times during their marathon of it. I took it for what it was, a movie pushing the envelope of graphics in the early 1980s. The story was predictable: save the (digital) world, win the girl. Plus, I got to see Bruce Boxleitner 10 years before he took command of Babylon 5.I took the opportunity to watch Tron: Legacy at the IMAX 3D theater since it seemed like the thing to do.Sound - My ears are still bleeding from the incessant indistinct rumbling blasting forth throughout most of the movie. It more resembled generalized noise than useful auditory information; too much of a good thing. The rare moments of silence were precious--it's not necessary to keep the VU meter pumping full time like a radio station. Silence, like negative space, can be used to good effect. The music was OK, but I wouldn't know Daft Punk from The Eurythmics.Visuals - I got to the theater too late so wound up sitting in the front row (right next to Bob Uecker). I had to hold my head just so in order to get decent 3D imaging, plus it distorted my overall view of the huge screen. Still, the 3D effects worked where they used them. The trouble comes from the fact that The Grid is a totally fabricated world, which means that there are no real reference points that aid depth perception. This made some of the battle game scenes difficult to figure out who got hit and who was still standing, aside from the colors of their ""uniforms"". The ADHD editing style that pervades television and movies these days demands rapid-fire action, but it would be nice to impart some understanding of the action to the viewer. We'd like to follow the story, too, you know.Story - boy saves dad, wins the girl, but dad ends up sacrificing himself to save the boy. I took it for what it was and am not analyzing it. I agree with a number of posts on the comment board that point out plot holes and things which can't even pass suspension of disbelief. I'll leave it at that.Old/new - There was a certain quaintness about the original Tron viewed through the prism of 28 years and all the technological changes that have been wrought in that time. Perhaps I expected more out of a modern version of Tron than I got. I prefer the visuals of the new movie, but the story and acting of the old one.Overall, I enjoyed the new movie well enough, but I would happily trade a good percentage of over-the-top special effects for better story telling. It's a mainstream movie, so I set my expectations accordingly and they were pretty much met.",TRON - Legacy
312,kiwisago,Gorgeous Lights,5,22 January 2011,"I haven't seen the original Tron, so I don't know how much nostalgia I am missing out on by seeing a version of it for the first time in 2009...It is very pretty. The story and characters didn't engage me, but I was glad to see it on the big screen, ignore both, and just let the images wash over me. And I had to ignore the story and characters, because otherwise they were distracting me from a purely visual feast. That said, the actors did a good job. The woman who played the dark-haired girl in Tron land was very believable, conveying naive idealism in a touching way. Here I am not bothering to remember her name right now, but I will look for her in other films. Jeff Bridges is so good in everything he does that he should get offered dual roles more often.",TRON - Legacy
313,RamblerReb,Thank God for Bruce Boxleitner.,3,29 January 2011,"I say this because he is the best part of this film. He is the only one who actually gives a performance worth watching and the only reason I gave it three stars instead of one. Now for the rest of this godawful mess: The first film had an actually interesting and sustainable premise, namely, a formerly free system, steadily being corrupted by an increasingly bloated AI Master Control Program, with dual protagonists in the form of the fish-out-of-water Flynn and the heroic security program Tron. The film dabbles with theology, philosophy, and the nature of existence without ever becoming ham-fisted or preachy, and, while flawed, manages to tell a cracking good story in (for the time) ground-breaking style.Legacy, on the other hand, manages to take that once-sturdy premise and twist it into some sort of muddled Hitler allegory, with no clear motivations for the heroes *or* villains, no clear explanations for exactly why Clu went bad, and, most of all, no clear explanation for just what the hell Clu thought he was gonna do in the real world. I mean, he did know the light cycles and light jets and stuff wouldn't work, right? He did realize that bullets would be perfectly capable of killing his solidified programs, right? He did know that his plan was the most *idiotic plan in the history of idiotic plans, right*?!! Moving on to the extremely sloppy plotting, a sleazy chairman of the board and Ed Dillinger's son are introduced early in the film and never seen again. *Ed Freaking Dillinger*! Think about that for a minute. The son of the man whom Flynn presumably sent to prison at the end of the first film is introduced as working for the company of the man who sent his father to prison. He ""fixes"" something Flynn's son does as a (lame) prank, concocts a solution to the prank, and is *never freaking seen again*! This is only the first of many plot threads which are introduced and left unresolved in the finest Disney potboiler tradition.I will not even get into the complete asspull represented by the ""ISOs,"" whatever the hell they were, since I couldn't follow the gobbledy-gook Bridges was forced to spout in that scene. Let's just say that they're an anvilicious Jew analogy and leave it at that.All of this complete mish-mash of utter crapola leads up to one of the worst, most anti-climactic endings in recent cinematic history. I took time out of the retching I was doing at Bridges' awful performance (one minute he's playing it straight, the next he's The Dude-- make up your mind and stick with one, willya?) to marvel at the sheer hateful lameness of this blatant sequel set-up.There is so much more I could say about this waste of time, money, and opportunity, but I will end by saying that this film left my childhood memories like a Saturday night after Atilla the Hun hit town: raped and murdered.",TRON - Legacy

In fact i would watch TRON once again rather than Avatar. OK, enough of Avatar. Why i went to watch this Flick.. 1. It was obvious-6 months of brain wash(continuous trailer on the Net,TV,Theater and a completely new look OR new world to the movie....for e.g Matrix)2.Sound Track-From my guess,this would be the only movie i know that its OST was highlighted for a movie promo extensively.Felt like they wer the characters too. 3.Great special effects and stunt design/choreography.Where the Movie score point:- 1. Special Effects and Stunts.2.Music-soul of the movie.Daft Punk was an immaculate Pick. 3. New Look and its TRON world. (the Neon glow is an instant hit and watch out guys, this Neon glow might be the Theme of this 31st Decembers party theme) 4.Can also be enjoyed on 2D.Drawbacks:- 1.Story is not great or there is no story (could hav just kept the Game if they didn't had any story in their mind) 2.Dull moment in the middle (just for 15 mins)which really drops your excitement.But, all in all a must watch.

317,ochoamanuel21,Another masterpiece released in December (Previous being Avatar),10,15 December 2010,"I was surprised by the intro of this movie, which sets out the main character, Sam Flynn, who is Kevin's son to be a rebellious bad-ass for lack of a better term. It's like if Bruce Wayne from the Nolan Verse just decided to screw with the people from his company once in a while to prove that he truly owns the company even if he is not present; therefore, this was a perfect introduction to the character that is really the drive of the movie and the reason for this sequel, from father to son, the legacy was handed and controlled. Truly epic introduction and themes handed in the film. The soundtrack of this movie was truly magnificent, kudos to Daft Punk for creating this retro synthesizer music to match the video game world of Tron and a real surprise by an oldie which plays when Sam walks in to the arcade for the first time in years, will not ruin the surprise but it was nostalgic. The performances were all top notch, initially one might take from the trailers that the main character, Kevin's son, and Olivia's character would be the stereotypical out of the water teenager a la Percy Jackson that has to learn his true role and throw in the random romantic interest being Olivia's character Kora. As you can see by my positive review this is not the case, Sam Flynn is a Bruce Wayne rebellious but very charismatic character and Kora is a serious babe who is not who she seems to be and it is not at all the random love interest since the whole movie revolves around who she is, won't spoil it but it is very interesting, think of her as Leloo from The Fifth Element but without the autistic behavior. This is a visual feast that I will definitely buy on Blu-Ray since I saw it on IMAX HD, the way it was meant to be experienced, the 3-D was not necessary but the IMAX experience is where it needs to be seen to be believed. I'm pretty sure the Blu-Ray will blow me away same as Avatar did, but this is the best movie to see right now.",TRON - Legacy
318,patrickmbrame,So Fun and Entertaining,8,8 January 2011,"Extremely Entertaining and a Ton of Fun. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this and I had the pleasure of watching it in IMAX 3D which I highly recommend the way you see it. Almost 45 minutes of the movie is filmed in IMAX and it is meant to be seen that way. The special effects are out of this world you can hardly tell... that its all CGI it blends in that well. When Sam Flynn (Bridges son) first enters The Grid (the computer) it is an awesome spectacle. He's immediately thrown into a disc fight, followed quickly by a light cycle battle which for me was the highlight of the movie. And during every action scene you have Daft Punk providing the music making it that much more fun to watch (they even make a cameo at the night club scene). I was a little hesitant with the effect of making Bridges look younger, but for the most part it looks pretty good and you only really notice how weird it looks when he's talking. The cast is fairly strong even with Garrett Hedlund acting along side the power house of Jeff Bridges, he held his own throughout most of the film. But the supporting cast was excellent, you had Jeff Bridges (I don't really need to say anything else), Micheal Sheen as an eccentric club owner who was by far the most fun character on screen, and the always great looking Olivia Wilde who, like Hedlund, never seemed to overwhelmed with who she was acting with. A lot of the criticism that I have heard is all from the writing and story however I found no problem. Yea, there are plenty of stupid one liners that aren't needed but what can you do, the cast has to do something with the light show going on in front of you. As for the storyline, it wasn't too hard to follow and they do a pretty good job of explaining everything. It is pretty weird and out of the box and has a pretty strong Christianity theme but come on, your watching a movie where a human being gets transported into a computer world. What are you expecting? As for fans of the first one, you'll be plenty entertained and there a lot of little easter eggs in this one that will remind you of the Tron. There's also a great cameo by Cillian Murphy in the very beginning playing the son of the Villain from the first one, which leads me to think that they are already planning a sequel and I will be one of the first ones to watch on opening night. I highly recommend Tron Legacy, it's easily the most visually alluring film of the year and the most fun I've had at a movie in a while, just make sure you see it in IMAX 3D.",TRON - Legacy
319,lalitdevraj,Good theme.,6,9 February 2012,"Tron's main theme made it appealing to me: getting stuck in a video game. The duration of the movie was long and all that was expressed was not necessary to fulfill the total plot of the story. There was much unnecessary action but without it, the appeal would have possibly decreased. It was a movie which was not the most interesting and rather one that made one think, ""when will he meet the Boss"". In video games, if one beats the Boss, then he has won; so was the case with this movie as well.The casting was rather satisfactory; nothing to complain about. Action was plenty, as well the whole adventure concept, but with respect to keeping one itching to see what happens next, none can be justified. The movie was very static, no matter how much dynamism there was, as all viewers were cogent with was to follow, the only doubt being how it would be portrayed. The graphics blow one away if watched in HD.Overall, I would not say I enjoyed the movie, but I am glad that I have watched it due to its theme.",TRON - Legacy
320,JustStone,Shouldn't this have been called Flynn Legacy?,7,21 December 2010,"When walking out of the theater from ""Tron Legacy"", I overheard someone say, ""The movie was beautiful looking, if only it had 25% more plot"". This pretty much sums its up.""Tron Legacy"" is so pretty, so extravagant of a CGI film, that the plot had no choice but to take a back seat. This is for good reason; the Tron franchise has never been about plot, it's always been about the wonder of computer technology and its seemingly limitless possibilities. Tron is an ode to the computer; a nerd's nerd movie. Without it, computer graphics and animation as we know it might have not advanced as quickly as they did.When the first ""Tron"" premiered in 1982, a movie ""inside"" a computer was a unique, yet silly, concept. 28 years later it couldn't be more relevant. ""Tron Legacy"" took this idea to its next logical step, making the film a CGI eye candy extravaganza, and in this vein Legacy does its job wonderfully. For this reason, like ""Avatar"", Legacy is meant to be seen in IMAX 3D, and although it wasn't executed quite as well as the former, it still stands high above the rest. I'm jaded by an industry of remakes, reimagining, reboots, sequels and prequels. I'm tired of recycled plots and re-branded ideas and believe we need a return to originality in Hollywood. But the first ""Tron"" wassuch a compelling concept -- so original and a major technological achievement, it was hard to look away at what they could do with it now. Unlike so many other sequels and remakes, this film had a legitimate purpose: to justify and pay tribute to computer special effects in film, as well as preserve its legacy through its forefather. For this, ""Tron Legacy"" succeeds. Unfortunately, it doesn't almost everywhere else. Again, Tron is not about plot. The people behind this film wanted to get to the CGI Disney light show so fast, they probably left behind any real dramatic tension somewhere in a long lost first draft. The characters are so poorly developed, it's like the writers read ""screenwriting for dummies"" and then patched in ideas and concepts from other movies, as well as just plain rehashing the original film. Unintentionally ironic, the characters, like the film itself, are cold and lifeless, artificial and synthetic. They acted robotic even before entering the computer. Jeff Bridges return as Kevin Flynn is a nice touch, but he couldn't escape his ""Dude"" persona, which was distracting. But more importantly, the science and logic behind the film was loosely explained and conceptualized which seems to be a pretty big hole not to fill, considering it's a film about computer science. Not even Daft Punk's stellar soundtrack could fix this.I really hate saying it, but this is another film that has the looks but not the brains. It's all right for a movie like ""Tron Legacy"", but not for other soulless sequels/remakes movie studios keep churning out. Like many things these days, it's instantly gratifying, with no longevity. Maybe it's a sign of the times, or maybe my expectations were too high, but can we please have a Hollywood blockbuster with a little heart, even if that heart is inside a computer?",TRON - Legacy
321,jagooch,Definitely Worth Watching Despite Imperfections,7,25 December 2010,"I watched this twice on the same day, once in Japanese(which I barely know ), and once in English. I think this gave me the ability to look at the visual and audio components separately, making for a clear picture of both. Story Fairly simple, though you have some good subplots between father/son and user/program. There is even a conflict between decisions made during youthful idealism and current values(if I had known then what I know now). It's overall premise is very similar to the Matrix/Terminator, though the mechanics are different.Eyecandy From some beautiful women in skin-tight suits, to vast panoramas and believable CGI, I think there is something for everyone here. If you know the history of the making of the original Tron, you'll appreciate the Klu's suit. Music It fits the movie perfectly, and I've been a Daft Punk fan for a very long time. 2 thumbs up on the score. Script This is a weak point. It does well enough, but there is nothing quotable here. Also, Flynn is out of character in several places, you may not like this at all, I was mostly OK with it. A lot of time has passed, and perhaps he's become a full-blown hippie in the meantime. Immersion This film does a good job of drawing the view in. You either care enough about characters to watch what happens, or can't wait for more special effects. Overall suspension of disbelief is achieved, though., as many have mentioned, the young Flint is not very believable. Another minus might be that many properties of the physical world exist, clouds, water, exhaust, and even visors that fog up. Camera I love the camera work, its a strong point. you see exactly what you need to see to pull in the story. The 3D isn't that prevalent, and I found myself taking the glasses of for long spells to get a better movie viewing experience.Loyalty to the Original: If you've seen it, then you'll be fairly happy with the consistency between this film and the original. I didn't notice any revisionist history, which is good. Overall I recommend watching this, they didn't do every thing perfectly. It could use more polish(like a script review and maybe using another method to make the young Flynn effect.

Computers were exciting, but even then we wondered if there might be a dangerous side to playing all those games. Fast forward almost thirty years later. TRON LEGACY arrives at a time when blockbuster tent-pole pictures are becoming almost irrelevant. Here is a popcorn movie with a difference. A great plot that builds on the original, fantastic visuals, heart-thumping action, a great score, and a wonderful emotional climax to the movie. LEGACY is everything a big-budget summer movie should be. Thrilling, moving, stylish, fun. Olivia Wilde is a revelation is Quora. Michael Sheen does his best David Bowie impersonation. Yet somehow it all works. Great to hear a truly memorable film score again. In these days of soulless corporate fluff, TRON LEGACY stands out above the crowd. This machine has soul.",TRON - Legacy

Now, 28 years on, Disney are back with the long-awaited sequel, 'TRON: Legacy', a movie which, visually, does exactly as its predecessor did all those years ago. To start, the director of this movie, Joseph Kosinski, is void of a resumé, and the film's star, Garrett Hedlund is also very inexperienced in the business meaning it was almost plagued from day one. And on an estimated budget of $300,000,000, it's not like they didn't have the cash to splash. Jeff Bridges returns, thankfully, putting in an aged turn as Kevin Flynn, the creator of TRON and The Grid (the fictional game where the movie takes place). Most of the budget was obviously spent on the stunning visuals and set-pieces, but it does make you wonder how such an in-experienced director such as Kosinski can nab such a high-profile job? The movie itself is a mirage of epileptic light shows and poundingly brilliant techno-music (contributed by Daft Punk) feeding from an, at times, hilariously bad and cheesy script. Former 'Lost' scribes, Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz provide the pretty much blank pages of groundbreaking action sequences. It's almost like the two sat, worked up a basic plot then gave the script to a monkey to write. The dialogue is clunky and generic, but does move the story on nicely and Jeff Bridges and Michael Sheen in particular especially milk their roles. Olivia Wilde (in one of the first of her many Hollywood appearances in the coming year) is above-average but nothing special, providing no link with the audience and no genuine sex- appeal. The thing that steals the film overall, and its U.S.P. is the connection between the game and the Earth, how a video-game can be as unstable as our cruel world (the films villain 'Clu', a digital clone of Jeff Bridge's Kevin Flynn, is strangely similar to Hitler). It's this metaphor which is most important to the underlying structure of the movie, but is sadly barely used. Kosinski instead decides to present the movie in the classic blockbuster style, blowing stuffing up and keeping dialogue short and sweet, which luckily works for this picture. The special effects are so ground-breaking and amazing they truly steal the show and although the action sequences are sometimes elongated and frightfully similar, they always serve a purpose. I also highly recommend seeing the movie in full 3D, as it is supposed to be seen. The biggest screen possible too, as the fact that the movie was mostly shot in 3D and for IMAX really helps amplify the terrific score and brain-busting CGI. However, a small note, whoever's idea it was to digitally age Jeff Bridges to create a younger-version of him should be shot, it almost single-handedly ruined the otherwise flawless visuals. Overall, the film fulfils it's wishes to entertain, but is held back from doing anything more by the lame dialogue and undeniably awful choice of lead actor. The visuals are truly stunning and the use of 3D is justified and tremendously approached. It is, visually, one of the films of the year, but overall just a well thought-out and (mostly) poorly acted blockbuster. If you're up for a technically amazing light-show that will really knock you off your feet this Christmas then definitely buy a ticket, otherwise don't even wait for the DVD, it won't be worth it. 7/10",TRON - Legacy
324,rama-28,a technovisual orgy,7,17 December 2010,"TRON: LEGACY is what I'd like to call a technovisual orgy.. The movie is gorgeous. I feel more stimulated by this visual than I did with Avatar last year. TRON: LEGACY looks so stunning, it practically invites you to make love to it. The environment is faithful to the original film but it's amplified to tenth degree. The terrain looks more real, the grid looks more fascinating. Don't even get me started on the disc and lightcycle battles, quite possibly the highlight of the entire movie watching experience. They excite your senses,..If you can see or hear, boy has TRON: LEGACY got a show for you! By the way, you do not wanna miss out on the lightcycle race it's more complex this time around, more than just making a maze and getting your opponent to hit the wall, this game is more advanced, it has more twists and turns. Absolutely thrilling.Once again, it's a movie for the fans, so it's very nostalgic. The 80s music at Flynn's Arcade, the jargons, they even keep Flynn's office just the way it was in the first film but this time it's got spiderweb all over it because it's been abandoned for years. I think Kosinski made the right decision by involving Daft Punk to do the music, not only does their cameo attract younger audiences, but the mix of their electronic style with orchestral work also compliments the film. Their soundtrack is one of the best I've heard this year.Let's talk about the performances shall we. Jeff Bridges is terrific, but then again, he's terrific in all that he does. He's returned as Flynn and just like how he was 27 years ago, Bridges plays it cool and chill, the only difference is that his character is much older now and the story has him worrying at times for his son, for the mistakes of the past, he's constantly haunted by it.. but don't worry.. Bridges 'The Dude' attitude is still intact, Flynn would once in a while say something along the line of 'you're messing with my jazz man!' I love Olivia Wilde in this film, not because she's a great actress but because as Flynn's apprentice Quorra, Wilde is just such a doll, her childlike personality is hard to resist. She's naive, gullible, always eager to learn and incredibly faithful. Gotta give some credit to Michael Sheen. For those few moments, he's downright amusing. Sheen is engaging, he's energetic and he has this unbelievable range of showmanship. His character unfortunately is generic, Castor/Zuse is a successful businessman with a hidden selfish agenda. I think Garrett Hedlund could sharpen his acting skills a bit but for the most part he does his job. Sam Flynn is rebellious, angry, impatient and stubborn. Unfortunately Hedlund does sound like an actor who says his line as if he's reading the script, there's hardly any natural flow to it.I wish I could give the perfect grade to TRON: LEGACY but the movie is nowhere near perfect,.. I'm gonna try my best not to give any Spoiler here either..It's one of those movies that start out strong and it goes steady but halfway through the end it loses steam. It has all this great visual extravaganza, 3D FX, and cinematic set pieces but the action sequences in the 2nd part of the film aren't as elaborate and as creative as the first part, at one point it's even reminiscent of a particular scene in Iron Man which ironically also starred Bridges.I can't stand CLU's digital face. I'm aware that technology may not be advanced enough to give us a believable young Jeff Bridges, perhaps this is the best they could do.. but that Polar Express-ish creepy face just doesn't work for me.The story is basically a rescue mission meets father and son drama. Now.. remember how people were disappointed with Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps?! Some say it lacked all the merciless business attitude and dog-eat-dog teeth that the first installment had, which gave Michael Douglas an Oscar. I thought Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps was a strong sequel but I was aware that its melodramatic sentimental tone did drive away some of its fans. I remember the original Tron had more emphasis on programs, users, all the technical jargons, some may have been more far fetched than others, I remember it was more heroic.. This sequel however only has those elements to a certain point, because it's more drama, once again I don't necessarily think it hurts the movie bad but.. if it doesn't resonate well with the fans, I can definitely understand why. Keep in mind that the title itself clearly says TRON:.. LEGACY, the word 'legacy' should give you an idea that the father and son aspect would have to get more spotlight. Even the hero of the first film, Tron, doesn't get as much screen time and in this installment, he's not quite the character you remember and would root for either.Clearly the writers are geeks who love Star Wars and that's OK because hey, I'm a Star Wars fan too but it just goes back to that whole lack of creativity I mentioned earlier about the last half of this movie. At one point, TRON: LEGACY even wants to somewhat appear like Attack Of The Clones. So overall, I do believe TRON: LEGACY is an entertaining movie, an eye candy, a sequel that speaks to its fans..but it has just as much greatness as it does its weakness. I think some of its elements will disappoint some fans and it doesn't do enough to reach out to today's audience.",TRON - Legacy
325,wildwesth,"Tron: Disturbing, intense and phenomenal",10,17 December 2010,"First, this film is disturbing. It is pretending to be a Disney film, but it is Frankenstein, Metropolis, the Fly, AI and a Clockwork Orange, the Testament of Dr. Mabuse, Forbidden Planet and Blade Runner. It incorporates highly developed elements of German Expressionism, and film noir.As each of these earlier films crossed lines of comfort and morality with technical brilliance, so TRON Legacy does as well. You could say it is in the best traditions of science fiction - the utopia gone terribly wrong, the misguided benefactor who inadvertently destroys all he loves; the many lost lives of the innocent and the greater loss of humanity.The story, actually, is loosely based on King Lear, whose misguided loyalties and values lead to his estrangement from those who love him and ultimately, to his own isolation, and finally, to his own destruction. It is, in truth, a tragedy wrapped in the trappings of a cool action sci-fi flick.This is way beyond the traditional Disney fare. And the film does not cop out on taking the story to it's inevitable and honest, if painful and self-destructive conclusion.Like Blade Runner, it is a commentary on the ease with which human slavery emerges out of misguided ideals. It shows the tragedy of being confronted by our flaws in the heart-breaking loss of innocence of our own progeny.And as with those films, and unlike traditional Disney, the loss of humanity is not entirely recovered by the end of the film. What is recovered is done too late to save the fallen king. And at the destruction of countless innocents.And it is violent. When one main character is enjoying himself frolicking and laughing about while others around are being murdered, torn to pieces, dismembered, we are reminded of A Clockwork Orange. It is no less violent than that film.I was a little concerned while watching it how my kids would react.They also were a little rattled at the end: ""Dad, it was sad!"" they said, but they also hoped for a sequel. They want Kevin Flynn somehow to be restored. That was a lot for me to take, as a father. And I wanted CLU to be restored and reconciled with his creator. I wait with hope for the sequel. But should you tamper with what is a perfect balance?I think Jeff Bridges gave too good a performance, too intense, in both roles, and he draws us in entirely too completely. The humor in this movie does not protect us.You could say that he has mastered his craft, and I will give him that. But must we be so saddened and rattled by what happens to father, son, and creature?Just as Jeff Bridges gives us two very remarkable performances - wisdom, balance, and impetuous aggression.The ending was much more heartbreaking than uplifting. Like Casablanca, or Karlov's Frankenstein, there are sacrifices filled with pathos. The creature's final admission is heartbreaking, and inevitable. While the film shows you the evil creature at the beginning, dark and brooding, somehow in stages they make you understand him, sympathize with him even as his plans for great destruction are growing. His defeat is the tragic loss of a noble idea gone terribly wrong. Though he must be defeated, it is with great pain.Only a consummate actor like Bridges could have pulled this off to a level of Shakespearean depth. It was moving to tears. The Creator actually has two sons and must reconcile with both. But that reconciliation is only a moment, and like Frankenstein, both the idealistic but misguided creator and his creation are destroyed.The metaphor is also a biblical allegory, like the first, but much deeper this time, again, as with the best sc-fi films, like The Day the Earth Stood Still or 2001.When a film leaves you with that much emotion and depth, then it has succeeded. Unless you cannot handle that. You can be angry at this film, saddened by it, upset, but give it time. Don't complain about that. That was the point. This is what good literature does. It makes you wonder why you feel this way, and in the days ahead you begin to understand that you have come to love the characters and are grieving their losses.This isn't Iron Man. This isn't an Arnold Schwarzeneggar or Bruce Willis / Tom Cruise / Sylvester Stalllon film. There are no pure and all powerful heros here. You feel more sorry for CLU at the end than for Sam. The protagonist has made tragic choices in the name of sincere progress. And everyone around him has paid the price.The film-makers did this without our permission. They said it would be fun and visually stunning, but they were feeding us something deeper along the way.Those of us who take film seriously were given a great gift. This film is a triumph of film making.To see a film which is disturbing, packaged in a slick, neo-German, film noir style with characters whose self-effacing humility and humor is gilded with their self-destructive behavior may be off-putting to some younger film goers.But to those of us well versed in the literature and the cinomatographic ethos, this film works on so many levels, it is consummate. It gets under your skin. That isn't a bad thing. You will leave the theater moved and disturbed, but give it time and you will begin to understand something quite wonderful.",TRON - Legacy
326,dunks58-615-955316,Preposterous twaddle.,1,16 January 2021,"The original Tron aimed high, but fell far short, and no amount of groundbreaking computer animation could cover up what a meritless mess of nonsensical nincompoopery it was. Sadly, this ill-advised sequel fares little better. The corn is as high as an elephants eye, and the biblical allegory is laid on as thick as fondant on a wedding cake. The effects are admittedly far better than the original and alongide the effective Daft Punk soundtrack, they are its only real virtues.Jeff Bridges has little to do but look old, tired and as bored with his bargain-basement Obi-wan persona as I was. His uncanny-valley CGI alter-ego Clue is as disturbing to watch as it is dull and predictable, and this supposed evil overlord of the digital domain comes across as being about as threatening as relief teacher with a hangover. Also dull-as-diahwater is the alleged ""star"" Garrett Hedlund, who sleepwalks through the film, but given what he had to work with, who can blame him? Poor Bruce Boxleitner manfully makes the whole thing a tiny bit better by just being there and being decent at doing the tiny amount of stuff he is asked to do, but he and Olivia Wilde are totally wasted on this poppycock, as is the usually excellent James Frain, who was so fine in 'Orphan Black'.Special mention must be made of an actor with a decidedly mixed reputation in my book - Michael Sheen. With a firm directorial hand and a good script, he can really excel, but when left to his own devices, Sheen can often veer off into being a shameless ham, and with only a first-time director and a script that any AI could write better in front of him, Sheen waits about for about five seconds into his scene before throws the switch to vaudeville, pretty much literally. He goes the full leg of Parma here, and his preposterous prancing and posturing only underscores the crass and corny nature of the whole enterprise. I'm baffled that the director and editor seemed to enjoy his cheesy capering, because 99% of what we see of Sheen in this film would have hit the bin if I had been doing either job. I dont know if Michael got a Golden Raspberry for his truly cringeworthy and painfully unfunny performance, but it really, really deserves one, and IMO only ranks below Eddie Redmayne's epically awful turn in the execrable 'Jupiter Rising' because, thankfully, Sheen's character is despatched within minutes, and good riddance, too.Nothing makes any logical sense, either internally or externally, and for a 21st century audience the suspension of diabelief required to enjoy this guff would challenge any moderately intelligent 7yo. It is impossible to care about anyone or anything in neon-fringed slop bucket of paint-by-numbers plotting, aimless action and cardboard-cutout characterisation. Like its predecessor it tackles a potentially rich concept in the trite and tedious way that only Disney can, right down to the trademark ""orphaned child"" motif.Central to this film's manifold problems is the question of why The Mouse Farm would have chosen anyone associated with the appalling 'Lost' to pen this tripe, but they did, and it shows. The action is inconsequential, the plot is meaningless, nothing is at stake, and whatever emotional engagement one might have would be wholly dictated by whether or not you liked the original (Me: ""Haaated it!"").Inexplicably it made money at the box office, but given that it made about $400m against a budget of $170m it was hardly the runaway success Disney might have hoped for.No amount of drugs can make this drivel watchable. The original has at least the naive charm of a bold first attempt to do something new and different in film, but for audiences now well used to eyepopping SFX from the likes of Avatar and The Mandalorian, this movie was doomed to disappoint from the outset, and the whole thing reeks of cheap cash-in.Awful. Avoid at all costs.",TRON - Legacy
327,jaffacake2k,Not worthy of using the title; TRON. (possible spoilers),1,5 March 2011,"I was expecting a lot better. I WANTED it to be good.... They've had almost 30 years to get it right. I was very disappointed.After watching this Im not sure 'Hollywood' knows how to write an original screenplay anymore. Especially when the characters/story is familiar with the audience. There was nothing in this film you wont have seen a dozen times. Done much better too.They seemed to lose track of what the original concept was about and merged it with a kind of 'Matrix' style world. So programs didn't just have a function .... But they had a 'life' .... The moment Flynn walked into a 'bar/club' for programs i knew id had enough. I should've know that in the opening scenes when they used a computer generated Flynn to look younger i KNEW it was going to be bad! And it got worse and worse.Direction, screenplay, score, acting, dialogue, effects ... All are well below par.Even Jeff Bridges didn't bother to act. After watching True Grit I know he CAN act - he obviously had nothing to act WITH or was just picking up a pay check. Awful! But even Lightcycle race was uninspiring. I didn't think it was possible to ruin such a simple concept but they managed it.One of the worst 'established' films in modern times. Because of the budget, cast and crew involved Im compelled to give this a 1/10 ... My first. Normally even turning up on set would get you more than this! Insulting to the the audience.Is there ANYTHING good about the film? Yes. Eventually it ends.....",TRON - Legacy

There we go now that's over and done with. The film itself, has a solid storyline but it takes a while to get to that, as you are too busy making sure you understand the world knows as ""The Grid"" when it is first introduced. When that is over and done with, it gets straight into showing you what it is all about with the neon and the lightcylces etc.... Soon this becomes all a bit ""normal"" due to its usage, not to say that's a bad thing ! This means that the story can kick into action and you call fully appreciate it. One thing, which I don't like having to do, is look up the ending of the film online so that it can explain it to me. Admittedly I did do this, and now I've read why something happened/why something else couldn't have happened, it is all a bit more meaningful, I just wished it had had that effect while watching it ! I don't think this film lived up to the hype I had heard about it. But it was rather good ! And as someone who enjoys video games, think it did quite well in representing that. An overall improvement I think would be that (YEH, I know it was made by Disney, BUT) it could have been a certificate or two up and had a bit more grizzle to it, otherwise like I said, yeah it's good !",TRON - Legacy

Open your eyes and ears; the mind will follow.Open your eyes: see breathtaking visuals that aren't just there for the purpose of action. At times, they're digital paintings in motion. Crystal blue visions of the future. Art direction, digital effects and costumes converge to form an almost overpowering whole. Visually, this is the 21st century's answer to Fritz Lang's Metropolis.Open your ears: hear Daft Punk's rapturous score that blends electronic bleeps with orchestra to create a warm kiss to the 1980s- and an invitation to a sparkling future. Of mainstream films from the last five years, few boast music that is so organic and married to the story. And its not just the music. The sound design is stellar.Now let your mind follow some rather intriguing themes that seem to hint at a cyber-spiritualism. The first Tron did this. Legacy goes even further. Big issues here that go beyond the standard plot mechanics. Some viewers may be so focused on either the visuals or the sound, that they lose focus of the whole.

Therefore, seeing this film on an IMAX screen in 3D will provide the experience your looking for.Tron should not be missed, it will visually blow you away, forget the story, the acting and take off your reviewers hat for one moment, and ask yourself when was the last time anyone spent $200 million dollars on you?

It was good.But there's one major flaw in this otherwise excellent allegory of Hitler's Germany...The pacing.It needed to be either kicked up a notch, or have about 20 minutes trimmed from it.Jeff Bridges was excellent as always (and his younger self and antagonist weren't as distracting to me as they were to some,) and the actor who portrayed his son was very likable in his role (although his character seemed a bit wooden at times.)And the ""games."" Oh yes, the games. Taken to a whole new level. The light cycle sequence is, quite simply amazing. It was also quite nice to see all the famous vehicles and concepts from the original updated. It was also great to see the light cycle concept taken to a whole new level near the end of the film, with the introduction of the ""light flyers""Overall, good film, but the pacing needs work.",TRON - Legacy
333,silverdragon4,"And 28 years later, this happened...",9,30 January 2012,"As with many others, I watched and loved the original 28 years ago. I was only 7 years old yet knew a cool film when I saw one. Never did I expect a sequel, yet here it is. I was so glad when I heard Jeff Bridges was to return. He did so good in the original that it would have been a big mistake not to get him in.Born was Tron: Legacy. Jeff Bridges plays Kevin Flynn, former CEO of ENCOM and the Original ""User"" from the original 1982 film ""Tron"". After vanishing 20 years ago, he leaves his son behind not knowing what happened to him. In my opinion, this is one of the best parts he has played for some time. He also plays Clu, his creation inside the Grid, made to help him create a perfect world...who knew.Garrett Hedlund plays Sam Flynn, son of Kevin Flynn, the original ""User"". A messed up 27 year old who wants nothing that belongs to his father after he disappeared 20 years ago. The part was actually played well. Not a well known actor, I am sure this will help his career.Olivia Wilde plays Quorra, fighter and friend of Kevin Flynn within the Grid. I had not seen much of this actor before this film. I think only once I saw her in Year One. Strong, beautiful, intelligent...she has the great role to play.Finally, Bruce Boxleitner also a returning actor playing his 2 original roles of Alan Bradley, friend to Kevin Flynn and employee, now executive, of ENCOM and creator of the Tron program. He also plays Tron, the security program he originally created in his image within the Virtual world. This man is a great actor. First seeing him in the original Tron, I didn't really notice actors at aged 7, but when I next saw him in Babylon 5, I knew he was brilliant. Although not having a big part in this film, he played it as well as expected.This film, mainly set inside the virtual world, and what a world. Beautiful CGI created cityscape. The vehicles bring back good memories of the original film. The costumes are very cool. Effects are equally as good. I loved the Disc battles and Lightcycle chases.

334,alone_onthebeach,On tron,5,23 January 2011,"I saw Tron with my friends in our early Sunday morning cinema slots. The unfortunate thing is that I saw the first one years again, and I didn't like it much then. When I saw the Matrix etc, I started to understand Tron more. Since my childhood days therefore, I didn't fancy Tron much and I haven't watched it fully again, only bits and pieces on television etc.This new version is not bad. I enjoyed it, but its not the usual Sc-Fi as you frequent moviegoers and I know it. I like Sci-Fi that I can relate to (how do you actually ""relate"" to a Sci-Fi movie? I am not too sure, but I thought I had it at sometime or other..). Maybe I'm still stuck to my thoughts of the old Tron, maybe I am not keen to accept what my friends say about it, but I still think it is not as good as many other complex Sci-Fi plot. The Running Man was complex, but I liked it a lot.I would not watch Tron in The Cinema again, and if friends get around on weekends and somebody get the DVD out for after dinner movies and gets out Tron, I'll ask for another title.

This was a sugary chewing gum - it can't and won't get better with time. For example, Avatar was filled with the state of the art cgi, but the story telling and the execution of that cgi was spot on.Alas, ""the spice must flow"", the industry must manufacture blockbusters.

337,Biodigital_Jazzman,Tron gets serious,8,19 December 2010,"Even after reading reviews, seeing all the trailers and looking at stills, I wasn't at all prepared for Tron: Legacy. Happily, most all of the negative reviews that I read didn't hold true for me. As a whole, I thought the movie was an amazing achievement both technically and artistically. It's much darker both in tone and look than the original film, but it has a bigger message as well. The story of Sam Flynn's search for his father reminded me a lot of Finding Nemo. Tron: Legacy doesn't have nearly as much humor as Pixar's film though; it holds to its much more serious tone. I really enjoyed the ""2D"" setup during the beginning of the film. It didn't bother me that it was in 2D, just as it doesn't bother me that the beginning of the Wizard of Oz is sepia-toned. That lends the fantasy world much more impact. Plus, it's a reflection of how flat Sam feels his life is. After the loss of his father, Sam has become a sort of aimless troublemaker. He feels no sense of responsibility and an awful lot of grief. He has no way to come to terms with those feelings; his dad is gone and he feels sort of betrayed. Then along come old Alan Bradley telling him he got a page from his dad's arcade. That sets off the series of incredible adventures that follow. My fear with Legacy was that it would approach the Grid as a real place instead of the whimsical fantasy of the first film. The original film was (and still is) a good popcorn movie, full of visual splendor and improbable events, all taken with a light heart. Legacy though has a much more forlorn feeling, a sort of wise and somber attitude that doesn't drag the film down but rather gives it a weight the original never had. The grid is no longer a challenging yet somewhat benign place. It is a home to fear and death. Sam uses all his strength just to stay above that. The movie kept my interest from start to finish but I found myself desperately wanting a happy ending. Technically, the film exceeded my expectations. The costumes were remarkable, far better looking than they seemed in the stills. The 3D effect wasn't at all gimmicky but was definitely noticeable. And I thought Clu (the young Jeff Bridges) was a phenomenal achievement and will usher in a new era in cinema, for good or ill. I found the rendering to be completely convincing. I also liked how I felt a similar disorientation in Legacy that I felt when I saw the original Tron back in 1982. At times, I didn't quite know where I was and what I was looking at. That said, I was disappointed by the lack of color through most of the scenes. It seemed to be primarily black and white with streaks of red or orange. The original film was bursting with vivid colors of every shade. But again, Legacy was showing a much darker world. The acting was uniformly good. Castor stands out because the role is so over-the-top, but none of the actors are weak. Unlike many others, I thought the script was really good. There were some rather hokey references to the first movie, and some moments of genuine homage. But Legacy stands firmly on it's own. Like Nemo, it has a much deeper message beneath it's surface -- one of maturity and responsibility, and of letting go of the past. The ending of Legacy is beautifully realized, just ambiguous enough to leave you wondering if what you just witnessed was real or a fantasy. (My bet is on the latter.)My compliments to the entire production team. Kosinsky, Kitsis and Horowitz (inspired by Lisberger) have made a terrific sequel, one that not only pays homage to the original but also adds it's own psychological and emotional weight to the story. The soundtrack by Daft Punk is phenomenal. Overall, I recommend this movie. Like the original, I think that Legacy will be well-regarded many years from now. While not as trend-setting as the original, it has it's own story to tell and does so expertly.",TRON - Legacy
338,GeneR777,I think it was the best they could have done,8,17 December 2010,"Well, if anyone has ever seen the original Tron, you would know that there is quite a lot of inventiveness for that time period. That was back in 1980-1982 when they were making the first film. To put some perspective of how inventive TRON was for the time think back and remember that the first Macintosh computer was still just a project back at Apple, video games were mostly those sold on Atari cartridges. So the visuals at that time were mind-blowing to say the least. And if you watch it now and can understand what it meant at the time, yeah, it's still pretty impressive. But that was 1982. Almost 30 years later we have this legacy film. And guess what? It has a lot of the same stuff we saw in the first film. And that is almost a given because people loved the original because of the lightcycles, the grid, etc. So it is almost a given that you have to have them in the film. Well, if you take this film as a paint by numbers a la Hollywood style, then we have the following: 1.) The obligatory homage of lightcycles, light tanks, light whatever-those-red-flying- things-are-called-with-the-long-arms. 2.) You have the obligatory introduction of the new world. 3.) You have the obligatory sexy chicks. Come on. If you're shaking your head on this, think about it: you still have to appeal to the teenage boys and above. 4.) You have the obligatory guy-girl relationship. 5.) You have the conflict between antagonist and protagonist. Build it within a three act structure where the resolution of the story comes with a struggle between the two main forces leading to a resolution. Check. Okay, so what's really left then? We top out at a little over two hours I believe. That's just about all you can really do in that much time. So bearing that, people might ask: why isn't it more innovative? Why is it staying too close to the source material? Well, there's a good reason: Because TRON was a cult film for certain reasons. You can innovate but you have to be true to the source material which is the core reason for any sort of fan base. So, overall I thought it was decent. Some of the gladiator stuff I had to say was pretty cool. I liked the hot siren, and (of course) Olivia Wilde. But otherwise it was what I expected. Nothing terribly innovative. But heck, I still got my money's worth.",TRON - Legacy
339,chasburch,Incomprehensible,3,28 December 2010,"I saw the original Tron back in '82 and appreciated the groundbreaking computer graphics art, if less than enthralled by the plot. This sequel has less to offer: in trying to stay true to the vision of the original, the animators have been stymied to trying to augment the original 80's technology rather than invent something fresh. They do a credible job, but given the amount of progress that has occurred in CGI it is disappointing.This wouldn't matter so much if the plot held up its end of the bargain, but there are so many technological and logical impossibilities that I found myself shaking my head after about 40 minutes. Someone sitting behind me gave up and started snoring about halfway through. Very disappointed.",TRON - Legacy
340,largu,Not too user-friendly,4,17 December 2010,"I like the first Tron. Not in an creepy over-obsessed way, but I regard it as a campy, retro glitterfest based on an delightfully silly idea. The basic concept stays the same in Tron Legacy. Computer programs are sentient beings inside the computer grid, probably deriving from the fact that they are created from someone's hope and dreams and therefore inherit some of their creators (or ""users"")soul. In the first Tron a ""user"", Flynn/Jeff Bridges, is whisked away into the computer world (by lasers, no less). In ""Legacy"" the son of Flynn is looking for his father 20 years after he strangely disappeared without a trace. No price for guessing where, and we also find ourselves in the computer world after a quite glum and outstretched intro. FINALLY.Turns out the world inside is equally glum. Now, with the way the use of computer have evolved and increased dramatically since the last movie I was expecting to see a grid teeming with all sorts of life and variety. That may be my mistake. I realize that the world in Tron Legacy may in fact be the sole creation of one being (Flynn/Jeff Bridges) with no interaction with the rest of the world, which may be plausible,given the theme of the movie, but still. Flynn copy/paste a lot and is obviously very fond of the ""dark-gritty-stone-tool"".All that aside, there been notables upgrades in the Tron world. Most technology looks, well, cooler. It is stunning visually, especially in 3d. My biggest gripe with the movie though is how clunky everything is. This should be a rendition of the world inside a computer, but stuff hisses, creaks and spew exhaustion. When did the digital world turn so analogue? Sure, from a scientific point of view the digital is indistinguishable from the analogue if it is complex enough, but why does it feels like a step backwards? The world in the older movie actually feels like a much more accurate rendition of a computer world than this. The new one is more like reality with fancy neon. Flynn turns his personal abode into a reality shrine, and eating what I guess is a virtually crafted pig, but that is him emulating reality. The motor of the first movie was that we could see games and programs run ""as if it was in real life"". With todays graphics that is already happening on-screen so the movie might have outlived its gimmick. If so there are more than enough other features from the digital world worthy of being represented in Tron. Why just demote the whole world then?I realise I haven't said anything about the acting. Well, there is none. Bridges tries his best to put some personality into Flynn. Not an easy task. Most of the time he just seems awkward. Our protagonist, whats-his-face, Sam is the sulky and estranged techno-wizz-kid we have all seen so many times before, only a bit older this time (27). The Tron from the title is there naturally, and he does... nothing. Boxlietner is in the cast, why not let him give old Tron a line at least? In the male world of computers there are as many as two female actor, but they are just the standard blockbuster version of the madonna/whore, aka spunky and bitchy. That boils down to sourpuss, hippie, spunky, bitchy, a creepy game-character and oh, there is also a Bowie, although not thee Bowie. Hello Disney, NEXT TIME YOU SHOULD CONSIDER ADDING SOME DIMENSIONS TO YOUR CHARACTERS, AND I DO NOT MEAN 3D, OK?Frankly, I'm thoroughly annoyed, and though not expecting much also surprisingly disappointed. Ah, well. The 4/10 is for looks, sounds and effort. It do look nice and the soundtrack is marvellous at times. I'm convinced that the musicians Daft Punk would make a better version of Tron themselves AND with more heart.",TRON - Legacy

343,redshoesfall,You Need to Watch this Movie for Yourself.,7,25 July 2017,"Personally, I give it a 10. I know I might even be overrating it, still, but I LOVE this movie, even though there are some things clearly wrong with it - the characters and dialogue aren't exactly revelations. You've seen them before. Personally, I hated the dryness and neediness of ""female warrior"" Quorra - otherwise, they're relatively harmless, which is the problem. You might as well call them cutouts, though Jeff Bridges is an absolute JOY to watch.The plots a little vague as well - half the time (on the 1st watch) you don't really know why things are or what, but it's MUCH easier to follow than it's predecessor.But what the film does great, it does AMAZINGLY. The visuals are overwhelmingly unique, gorgeous, and atmospheric, the soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard, and they work together very well. The SPX are great, the sets are great - even when we're not in the grid, the city is beautifully portrayed. This was a very well-made, very attractive film, and not in a Hollywood sort of way where the ""animation"" is good or the ""CG is nice."" No.I was aware that this was a Disney film when I started watching this - that was part of the reason why I was so uninterested in it at first. It was in the middle of a lot of Disney flops at the time, though when I finally saw it, I was blown away. Pleasantly surprised - it has a darker, colder tone to it, more mature every other Disney movie - even feeling almost like a stylish indie at times. Again - this film isn't genius. It's not great, technically as a film, but turned out to be a personal favorite of mine and is destined to be a classic just like the original with it's unique tone, visuals, and soundtrack. GODDAMN THAT SOUNDTRACK. Watch this to know for sure for yourself - it's understandable if you don't like it, it really is. But if you enjoy it - then you probably will REALLY enjoy it. It's an experience.",TRON - Legacy

But understandable, and as always i will not bore you with entire plot of the movie spooned out till the bottom.OK that being said lets take a nice look at this movies, like i always say in every review i wrote here. Movies are like music, some love to rock and roll other like to hear Beethoven. So to get this two camped ""this movie sucks"" ""this movie rocks"" stuff out of the way i tend to be objective.The movie as i like Jeff as one of the great actors in my lifetime. Is just wonderful, his child is very well casted. The behavior fits the entire looks of him. He is not a super pumped up actor with a funny nose (twilight, new moon) he looks good and has that ""I can whoop ass"" As the movie prolonged, i only found one thing disturbing and that is the way how is able to ENTER TRON. Went to easy but i can forgive the creators of this movie. It is after all just a movie, but once inside the fun starts. The way the DE-aged Jeff is just wonderfully done, and the way the entire movie goes is really good.Great special effects, and it has a nostalgic feel to it (the sounds mainly) Mind you, yes i have SEEN TRON the original part I, but i cannot remember much from it. And i do not compare them either, i believe need to judge movies for what it is. And not what it was in the past so i will download part I for sure and give it a go again.I really enjoyed this movie, the acting was good. The special effects were just breathtaking and one of the RARE movies that i loved the soundtrack from! So got that one too by now! For science fiction lovers this is IMHO a MUST HAVE. No movie here deserves a 10 in stars, that would be perfection and nothing is in our world. But a healthy 8 is well deserved, exciting, entertaining and just well done! Finally entertainment!

So if you liked that movie, ignore my opinion.If you felt the same way then let me warn you that 28 years worth of progress seems to have passed these writers by. The dialogue is as hackneyed as ever and the plot makes even less sense. The 3D is very pretty at times, but that's a thin excuse for this movie. Plus it features what has to be the most cringe-worthy and embarrassing performance of 2010 when Michael Sheen starts capering about like an effete cheerleader giving gay stereotype lessons.This is the sort of movie that gives sci-fi a bad name. It makes Avatar seem deep and meaningful, so I suggest you watch that again instead.",TRON - Legacy

The main thing I look for is the storyline to be engaging and in the case of a sequel, to fit the storyline continuation or offshoot from the original movie's universe.In that respect, I was pleasantly rewarded by Tron: Legacy.Some claim the storyline is fairly thin. I would beg to differ as I feel it has as much depth as the original and continues the original in a fantastic narrative. The characters are also engaging and work towards the storyline well.My only point down is some clichés making a nod towards modern movie clichés here and there.The original was considered a theatrical failure and eventually grew into a beloved cult classic. This sequel very much will do the same.",TRON - Legacy
348,Neonfinity,The Legacy Lives On...,10,15 November 2017,"Tron: Legacy is a 2010 Sci-Fi Action film directed by Joseph Kosinski. It stars Jeff Bridges, Olivia Wilde, and Garrett Hedlund. The film was produced and distributed by Disney and is the sequel to my personal favorite movie and have seen this on opening weekend. Is this movie any better or worse? Well, I'm here to tell you what I think.Legacy shows Sam Flynn, given up trying to find his long-lost dad, Kevin (Jeff Bridges). He now annually sabotages his father's former company and later receives a message from his guardian Alan that came from Flynn's Arcade that hasn't operated since his disappearance. Suddenly, Sam finds himself in his father's world of the grid and embarks on a quest to find him again.The characters of Legacy are somewhat hit and miss. Sam doesn't really follow in the protagonist role as good as Jeff Bridges did 30 years before. Speaking of, Jeff does gives the greatest dual role in the film as Kevin/CLU and serves as a reminder how great his acting talents are. Olivia Wilde also gives a pretty good performance as Quorra as well.I like a whole lot about this film. It takes the world of Tron previously seen 30 years ago and gives it an incredible and entirely new feel without straying too far from its established nature. The soundtrack is nothing short of amazing being composed by French Electronic duo Daft Punk. The story may fall a little short but the pacing is alright and I would say is better than the first one. Plus the visual effects are mostly hit and some miss being Clu's CGI face, which I will commend for not being noticeable half the time.Legacy includes themes of Father/Son/Daughter relationships, Betrayal, Religion, Genocide, and Technology. Yes, I am describing a Disney movie. Kevin's relationship with CLU doesn't feel entirely fleshed out but enough to understand that CLU was like a brother to Kevin and basically becomes Hitler shown in his speech later in the film. Kevin was God of the grid and lost himself with his son, his other creation, and his world and takes it back in spectacular fashion at the end of the film.Tron: Legacy did well at the box office, but not enough to set Disney's plans to become a multimedia franchise like they had hoped. And since Disney bought out Marvel films and Star Wars, it will be a while until we get another installment. Luckily, this film has the cult following it deserves and lives on.Overall, I give Tron: Legacy a 7/10",TRON - Legacy
349,f_alcon,"Don't bother with the 3D version, and likely best enjoyed with a good home-theatre setup.",7,5 January 2011,"Don't bother with the 3D version. Perhaps because it was rather monochromatic, with MUCH of the film in blacks, I could not see any 3D. There was even a written disclosure at the start, saying ""...there are 2d elements in this film, deliberately so..."" I think even CLASH OF THE TITANS had more noticeable 3D (which was hardly any).And you also don't need to watch #1 again first. This is not so much a direct sequel where it's influenced by #1's events; felt more like another chapter, 30 years on. It was written and produced by the same guy who wrote and directed #1 (this was directed by someone else).Cannot say too much about #2 without spoiling it, except that I found it a lesser film than #1 - so go in with low expectations. The FX were OK - cannot say better nor worse than #1, just different. So in the end, definitely not worth top dollar to watch it on the big screen. If you must, perhaps a cheap/discount day (there is a 2D version for the moment). But would mostly recommend hiring and watching it on your home theatre, if you've made the investment. Though one thing you will miss unless you have a good sound system - it has a good music score and sound (base), which you will pleasantly notice in the cinema.",TRON - Legacy
350,unbekannternutzer,just about the money. cold and greedy fail.,1,17 March 2011,"this movie was made for making money. for my review i actually could just repeat this sentence over and over, and it would sum up all the bad things of this one. but i will explain a little:good film makers tell you a story. they have some kind of a vision, of how the movie should look like, of the desired impact on the audience and of the technical approach. not in this one. it is a shameless, heartless, uninspired, cold, shallow copy of the original with the single intent of making money, quick and, what's even more important, without risking anything. they follow the recipe that has worked (not) for other shameless copies or unnecessary, failed sequels. and this recipe consists of visual effects, stupid dialog (we don't want to ask too much of the stupid part of the audience, which is the majority and therefore more $ involved), 'cool' acting (which i hate), placing a lot of brands in the movie to make even more money, plus some little emotional part for the women, a bad guy, a fight, some stupid background story and a sh*tload of advertising. it works every time. and it's evidence that the people of this world are getting dumber by the day.i wouldn't be that angry if this was just some stand-alone movie. but this is supposed to be at least as good as the original. otherwise it's pointless to even make it...that is, if the makers would have some self respect and some sense of responsibility. which they haven't. they only know greed.i wont even bother to evaluate different aspects of the movie. it fails on so many levels, characters, dialog, plot, acting...it all lacks inspiration, passion, and heart.go watch the original tron. even the special effects look better in that one, better in way that it shows that they put some thought into it. in legacy they didn't. they just took the first design as making another one would have been too expensive i.e. would have reduced profit.legacy is just a cash machine. avoid it. you're getting robbed. not only of your money, but also of your time, and if they get you to like this crap, they also robbed you of your brain and heart, if you had one to begin with.i have to make a small addition: i did not watch the whole movie. i barely made it to half of it. i walked out when that boy-man entered 'the grid'. everything up to this point was stupid, but at this point i realised they even failed at capturing what 'the grid' was all about. it could only get worse. and so it did, as my friends told me. and about those 'positive' reviews on IMDb: those are part of the sh*tload of advertising which i mentioned above. at least some of it.",TRON - Legacy

I'm a die hard fan of the first Tron film and I have been looking forward to this follow up for months.So I've decided to split it into the good, the bad and the downright ugly.Good: Clearly it looks amazing, even if the 3D wasn't all that, I was still mesmerised, awestruck by the beauty of the whole thing. It stayed true to the original design and was updated to suit a modern audience well.The soundtrack was fantastic. Everything fit into place with the story and the ambiance of the film. Well done Daft Punk.Bad: The plot - well really I'm not going to be too harsh, a film like this isn't necessarily weaker for having a loose plot. but sometimes it didn't half drag on with a load of dialogue when really we should have been watching more action, which leads me on to the next point...Not enough action. Not enough light cycle races etc. Plus did anyone else think that they looked a bit slow? Nicely designed arenas though.Ugly: this is what I had a real problem with. The young Jeff Bridges/CLU CGI face. It just aggravated me throughout, it didn't fit with the rest of the people. Basically it looked great until he opened his mouth, and then it looked crap. Every time he came on screen I just got aggravated. It just didn't work.So in summary, it looks like I've criticised this film a lot, but as a piece of entertainment it is a very well produced affair.

The CGI face they developed for Jeff Bridges is not perfect, but it works very well with just a few exceptions and I feel, for my own tastes, that they have actually bridged the uncanny valley with this one. Still a bit of work to get it perfect, but this one works as it is. Oh, and the score by Daft Punk is beautiful.

The story quality of ""TRON:Legacy"" is NOT consistent and there are a few places where it makes very little sense in hind-sight. These places should have been replaced with better scenes.

If you haven't seen it don't worry it's all fleshed out for you in this much awaited sequel. ""Tron: Legacy"" has a promising beginning and when our protagonist actually enters the grid it is really cool. The disk matches and light bike races dazzle, but the film never reaches that awesome moment the audience is waiting for. Its feels like the whole film keeps building up to a very unsatisfying conclusion. There are some great story elements in here which could have been more fleshed out and are worth exploring but the story tellers decided to go towards more of a family friendly route that kids could kind of follow. It's a Disney film so I guess that's part of the reason. It is a film that doesn't quite know who its audience is. It's trying to satisfy the adults, the kids and the fans but I'm afraid it fails on all counts. There is not enough comedic relief in here and what little it has is lame. There are also some unexplainable things in here which the audience will question while watching the film but it's not worth loosing brain cells over. Even the one thing I thought would be spectacular was a major disappointment. The 3D in this is not good at all. The visual style of the film offers a promising 3D experience but there is not one scene that stands out as a ""Wow"" moment. The dialog is trite and the acting is mediocre. Even Oscar winner Jeff Bridges has a difficult time pulling of some of the one liners in the film. The most memorable character in here is ""Qurroa"", played by Olivia Wilde, she is wonderful l. Another positive note about ""Tron"" is that is has an awesome soundtrack by Daft Punk, I was nodding my head to it throughout the film. Over all ""Tron : Legacy"" is somewhat enjoyable but there are way too many good films out right now to recommend it.

They're right on. But everything else isn't. And I'm not even a die hard Tron-Fan to begin with. It's not your usual ""boohoo what have they done with one of my favorite movies"" reviews. Although I expect Tron-Fans to be disappointed, as there is nothing of the old spirit left in this one.No the movie seems like a commercial for the video game. You don't connect to the characters, you don't really understand or care about the story. It has in no way that oppressive feeling, that you felt with the original. Instead it's just a bunch of random action sequences following each other, lots of cgi and slow-motion (seriously, it's almost 2011, how many more slow-mo-projectile-evasion do we need? if scary movie made fun of it, don't do it in your movie and still expect it to be somewhat cool). there are like dozens of scenes that will remind you of other flicks, like ""the fifth element"", ""matrix"" or ""star wars"". but while copying styles and plots of other movies, TRON LEGACY fails to deliver something own, something unique. And that's basically the exact opposite of what TRON once was. Tron what have you become?

357,routier,Muddled & Disappointing,5,1 January 2011,"WARNING: SPOILERS *****************Visually, a feast, but a leisurely script leads to a muddled climax. A fan of the original since 1983, I had been looking forward to this for a long time. The trailers & stills looked very promising. Sadly, while it looks good, some questionable decisions have been made, and the film doesn't seem to know what to do or where to go.Some of the original concepts seem to have been dumbed down for audience acceptance. Programs, formerly living a uniquely digital lifestyle, sipping energy from pools, worshiping users, are now just like regular dudes with funny clothes. They work, sleep, eat, drink, and go to clubs. Perhaps this dumbing down is why this film poses more questions than it answers. Why has the digital world taken on analogue characteristics like dust, atmosphere & functionless water? Why do the digital Recognizers, previously smooth, humming machine menaces, now have exhaust flames & jet engine noise?Why do light cycles sound like they have gasoline engines? How can a totalitarian digital society have ""homeless"" programs (who drink from brown paper bags yet)? Why do all the programs now leap around and pose exactly like Asian martial artists? Just, why?? How were the Isomorphic algorithms going to change the world? How was CLU going to conquer the world with a bunch of computer programs who were good at throwing disks?When young Flynn switched off the server, was the world destroyed? (if so, shouldn't he have waited, since (a) the threat had been stopped, and (b) in case there were still some of those useful ISOs surviving, especially since he (and the audience) have no clue as to how to use them?) If hours in the digital world were minutes in the real one, and in the real world it's been 20 years, does that mean that old Flynn had been trapped for up to 1200 years? (which might explain why he's channeling The Dude from ""The Big Lebowski"")The biggest disappointment for me was the almost complete absence of the title character. By the end of the film, I still wasn't sure where Tron was. I had to read some summaries on the Internet to find out.I would have preferred it if Tron, in his last act, saved the day. Sadly, when he did (briefly) appear, he was ineffective and pointless.I was a fan of the original Tron. Original ideas and logic have been dropped for populism & eye candy.

What annoyed me most is the ""Matrixish"" style; while visually appealing, leading the story - programs inside a mainframe - to a next level of absurdity: there is rain and atmosphere (which gets thinner higher up...), programs eat, have beds, spare time in which they get drunk or go to clubs listening to music. A love scene would have hit the jackpot, but we were spared of it (and they cut the one in the 1982 Tron, by the way). Tron was an original story in its time, probably too early. Tron Legacy just looks nice, but many movies in recent years do. You might just skip this one.",TRON - Legacy
360,jane_concannon,poor sequel,4,16 January 2011,"Having heard some reviews before I went, I did not have high hopes of this film, however even so was disappointed. I have seen the original film several times and enjoyed it but thought with today's technology, it should be redone and could be even better. Well I was wrong! I cannot think of a good thing to say about this film. Weak story that didn't make sense a lot of the time, mediocre acting, awful music, poor casting - especially for the lead man - who seemed to have no charisma whatsoever. It was also too long by about half an hour. One thing I really enjoyed about the original was the long and involved race/chase scenes. In this film there was no way near enough of this for me, instead too much talking and fighting. In my mind this was even worse than Transformers 2 which is saying something.",TRON - Legacy
361,dino_saur333,I was expecting a bit more,6,18 December 2010,"Before this movie I was...vaguely aware of the original Tron. A week or so before the premier of this movie, I decided to lookup the original Tron. two days before Legacy started showing, I managed to get a copy and watched the original Tron. And those two days was the most agonizing wait of my life.I loved the original Tron. It was instantly a favorite for me. It had an engaging story of a human trapped in a computer world that I found pretty damn original (considering this was made in the eighties and all. After all, I've seen the Matrix films long ago)When Tron: Legacy finally came out, I was expecting a great story, great visuals, and an EPIC soundtrack (when the trailer said ""music by Daft Punk"" epic is pretty much a given at that point). I got plenty of the latter two, not so much of the former.I really didn't have that much problem with the plot. I get the plot. It was a good plot. The biggest problem for me was that the characters were a bit shallow. The main hero of the movie, Sam Flynn, felt flat. And while I could tell he was trying hard to convey emotion (it worked at least once during a touchy scene) he had a hard time expressing himself. the character of Quorra essentially acted half her age (or at least her perceived age; I don't fully understand how programs view the concept of age) Some characters are pretty interesting, like Zeus, however, they get next to no development in the plot. Reeally, the most engaging character here was the original Flynn, and maybe that's just because Jeff Bridges was the most seasoned actor here.And then there's Tron. The guy the named the movie after. Even in the original I never got why they named the movie after him since he didn't feel like the main character there (I felt it was more of Flynn's story). In Legacy, Tron basically is like Oddjob form Goldfinger. The dude has like ten seconds of dialouge...in total! Oh sure, he gets his awesome moments but if his name is the name of the movie, at least give the guy some good characterization (btw: they didn't)Overall, the movie was a great visual ride but the lackluster storytelling brought it down a level or two. They had the makings of a great film. Instead Disney produced what is essentially gonna be a Cult hit as opposed to a mainstream one (which is what you expect from Disney).But then, I realized. That's what they set out to make in the first place. A Cult hit. Think about it. The first movie was a box office failure because it appealed to a then very small audience (the geek community). And while that audience has grown significantly over the years, realize first that this is supposed to be a sequel to a movie made 25 years ago! I, personally, wasn't even born when the original came out. Very few people from Disney's usual target market (kids to young adults) actually know of the first movie, let alone have seen it.Tron: Legacy is essentially a love letter to all the loyal fans of the first movie and Disney's attempt to make their own little isolated cult franchise. Who knows, with the open-ended conclusion of the film and several unanswered questions, another sequel maybe on the way.Hopefully we won't have to wait another 20 or so years before that happens.",TRON - Legacy
362,djp2000,Not quite The Matrix,5,14 December 2010,"TRON: Legacy is a sequel to a film from almost 30 years ago. The original TRON, released in 1982, was not a box office success but went on to gain a bit of a cult following. It starred Jeff Bridges as Kevin Flynn, a hacker (they had those back then?) who is abducted into the world of a computer. This sequel stars Garrett Hedlund playing Kevin Flynn's son, Sam. He, too, gets trapped in the world of the computer. What he finds is that his father has been trapped in there again. The film makes an attempt at bridging the story of the two movies together for those who haven't seen the first one but it is still a bit hard to follow. This is done to explain how Kevin is trapped again and why he can't get out. Supposedly, the first film was known more for its visuals but the story was rather convoluted. The same goes for the sequel. When Sam first arrives in the computer world, known simply as ""the grid"", there's a good 20 minutes or so of him being thrust into gladiator-style games in which he must survive. That part of the film is amazing to watch. It's really like being in another world that's like nothing you've seen before. It would've been great if the movie concentrated more on that aspect of the film; maybe because the games were part of the original, the writers wanted to focus on something deeper. TRON: Legacy bares a resemblance to The Matrix. Unfortunately, it is much more like the subpar sequels rather than the original. The Matrix was great when it introduced us to a whole new world, another one where we were blown away by cool special effects. But the sequels got way too preachy and over-explained everything. That's what happens in the latter half of this film. The same technology used to age Brad Pitt in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is used for a reverse effect here. There is a version of Jeff Bridges' character in the grid which is the same as he was in the original film, so the technology is used to ""de-age"" him and make him look as he did back then. It comes close but it's not perfect. There is also a great score by electronic music duo Daft Punk (who make a cameo) which fits the futuristic-looking setting perfectly. The film may be a delight to some, at least to look at, but the confusing plot gets frustrating after a while and becomes a turn-off.",TRON - Legacy
363,deeprise1988,Lightening virtual world,7,31 January 2011,The movie is astonish journey of Sam Flynn in the lightening virtual world created by his dad with the intention that one day all techno world would lead to ideal world for the humans.Things became unfavorable when programs possess their own goals.With some fantastic light visuals. Film specially works for the eyes as most of time you believe its a marvelous light and laser show.Action and visual effects are good as well the acting. I like the way they done to create young Jeff Bridges. And most of all I love the music.The music was so compelling. One of the best soundtrack in motion picture. This movie entertained me so I would say I liked this movie.,TRON - Legacy
364,Monstrel,Stylish and classy,8,2 January 2011,"This movie has crazy fast motorcycles, beautiful women in skintight outfit, what else do you need? The plot is simple and lacking, sometimes boring, but I didn't come to watch it for the plot. I came for the visual side, and this side did not disappoint. The movie has distinct style (well, inherited from the previous Tron movie, but who cares?), and it looks classy. Some of my friends complained that there could be more special effects, kinda like a non-stop comic action, but I think the volume of special effects was exactly what was needed to keep the movie in style.I liked a movie and gave it a solid 8, I would give 10 if it had a little more drama and more complex but less boring dialogs. Nevertheless, highly recommended for the lovers of sport bikes and gorgeous women!",TRON - Legacy
365,rockitpoh,Visually Stunning - Hollow and simple plot.,6,11 January 2011,"I was very excited to go and see Tron Lagacy in 3D. I am a fan of the original 1982 movie and a huge fan of Jeff Bridges so you can imagine the glee I felt when I heard they where making this movie.Visually Tron Legacy is amazing, the art direction is superb and the CGI is like something we've never seen before. And so it should be with an estimated budget of $160 000 000. I wonder to myself, how could it cost that much? Its just a bunch of CGI? But none the less its a great looking style.Bridges is great in the part and the CGI reconstruction of his younger image is well done but far from seamless. CGI, CGI, CGI!!!! Thats all it really is though. The story is a little lame and simple, the characters are underdeveloped and difficult to relate to. And the moral is also a little lame at the end of the day.My biggest disappointment was the 3D implementation. They could have done a lot more with it. Even Jackass 3D had more ""eye popping effects"". The one thing I really enjoyed was the music score. Amazing and cool without being cheezy. If your a sci-fi fan, go and see it. I would even buy it on Bluray just to add to the collection. But If your looking for something intelligent watch inception again.",TRON - Legacy
366,fearless2003,Optimistic spirit of technology/expansion of human existence,7,21 December 2010,"This is a beautiful, stylish film. Visually this was the best film I've seen in years. The score was awesome. Tron Legacy, like the Matrix, Ghost in the Shell etc... sees technology ultimately expanding the boundaries of human existence... granted there are dangers to be avoided. Kevin Flynn in some ways reminds me of Ray Kurzweil, the inventor, who writes about the technological singularity that may be coming. I thought all the actors did a good job. The writing wasn't great, but it was interesting enough to supplement the great visual style and overall tone of the film.",TRON - Legacy
367,AGfox16,Horrible,2,24 June 2015,"My review from TRON: Legacy broken down:Plot: 1/10, didn't make any sense. So many plot holes and things I didn't understand, what are ISOs (though ""explained"", it was still confusing)? How did Sam learn how to use the weapons/vehicles in the grid so fast, to the point where he could defeat programs? How did Clu think what he was doing was going to make things right, and why would he do it if he's a copy of Kevin (even though it was old Kevin)? How did Kevin help Quorra escape the genocide when they would've been surrounded by troops? Why was it so important that the world meet Quorra, the surviving ISO? In the end, all she did was ride on a motorcycle. Why did Clu's troops capture Quorra instead of killing her right then? The one thing that this movie has going for it as far as plot goes is unpredictability!Characters: 3/10, while the acting was fine, the characters were bland and not likable.Music: 9/10, Daft Punk did an amazing job with the soundtrack, but unfortunately, the music couldn't save the movie.Special Effects: NA, I don't even know how to rate this, because I didn't know what I was looking at when I watched this film.Conclusion: Music is the only thing that prevents me from giving this a 1. It's impossible to like such a confusing film as this.",TRON - Legacy

369,moldo_bmf,Does not tarnish the legacy.,10,17 December 2010,"I was one of the unlucky (as I see it) people who didn't see the original ""Tron"" because of the fact that I had not been born at that time (something which can also be said about some of the main protagonists, in an ironic twist). Considering the previous fact, the miraculous surfacing of a sequel warranted a first viewing of the original, and a look into how it's aged over the past 28 years. When looking upon it with a mindset appropriated to the time of it's making, the original was revolutionary, and set forth new, bold ideas, in a day and age when personal computers were just surfacing, and were regarded with frightful eyes, as most world-changing ideas are. Ideas that have maintained a sense of intrigue and metaphoric strength, despite how mainstream the idea of a ""world"" generated by machines has become. The parallels that could (and can be) drawn between the original film and the world at its time (as well ours) are numerous and are the source of it's storytelling strength. The fact that it doesn't need to tell you what to think, it makes you think for yourself if you so wish to.""Tron: Legacy"" starts of on the same mindset, adding the kind of action that was not quite possible given the technological restrictions of the time when it's ancestor came to be. It adds the ""scandalous"" idea of evolution within a system that is meant to be guided by preset rules, as they were dictated by a superior entity, an idea that was scandalous even in our own world at one point in time. The programs that are capable of evolving, are seen as a form of degeneration by the system's self-appointed administrator, CLU. As such, they must be purged. Other ideas are also set forth, but I will not delve very deeply into them, considering that letting everyone notice and analyze them by themselves is a much better choice. It's enough to say that you won't be bored by what the movie has to say.The film itself is engrossing, it's story complex enough for afterthought, delivered capably by the actors (with certain over-the-top performances as well). Visually, it is breathtaking, especially if you're a fan of a minimalistic, futuristic look, but it also chooses to include a classical approach to design, itself combined with elements that inspire a futuristic ""revamp"". The soundtrack is what really blew me away, however, but in that opinion I am biased due to my love for the work Daft Punk has done and still does.The only thing that bugged me was the fact that the younger look made for Jeff Bridges looked very artificial, which wouldn't have been a problem, had it been used only for CLU, since the artificial look of a program would be something that would make a certain amount of sense. But when it is used to render him as he was in the past, it tends to seem even a little bit distasteful. I appreciate the effort put into this aspect, but not the finished product. But that's just nitpicking.As a whole, the movie is very entertaining, it survives the fact that it is a bit corny at times, and leaves you with at least a couple of questions after you've seen it, which is always good in my book. While the 28-year gap may not be warranted, it doesn't deter the sequel in any way, allowing it to prove itself worthy of it's legacy.",TRON - Legacy
370,planetp,"Powerful Score, Fantastic Effects, Good Enough Plot",9,28 December 2010,"The score by Daft Punk is top notch, probably one of the best and most powerful scores I've heard in a in a long time. The music is perfectly scored to the action, pace and tone of the movie. It is powerful, deep, and will rock your socks off. I can't say enough about it, other than it made the movie. I'm almost certain they will get an Oscar nod.The effects are groundbreaking and take cyberspace to a whole new level. Not only will they get an Oscar for the effects, they will probably win it.I'm not sure why this movie has gotten such negative reviews. The plot is good. Different in tone than the first, but good. Perhaps these negative reviews are coming from people who did not see or were not influenced by the first film. I came of age during the arcade era, and the first movie captured that age perfectly. To see it come to life again with this stunning movie was thrilling. I could see a few more plot twists this movie could have explored, but it did a good enough job with attention to detail, some interesting conceptual ideas, and plenty of references to the old movie to be enjoyed by fans of the first movie.",TRON - Legacy

Seldom do I get to say that the sequel was better than the original but by god I'm close on this one!,TRON - Legacy
372,jecika,Great soundtrack,4,6 January 2011,"When I first wanted to see this film I had no idea it had any connection to the game. I was bored so I picked a random film to watch in the cinema that night.I love science fiction, but this was just funny at some points. The plot is full of holes, I wasn't able to get the full picture about ""the grid"", because the story was just poorly interpreted. The cast was OK, honestly I didn't expect anything serious from this kind of film.The soundtrack left a really special impression on me. I was thrilled to see Daft Punk playing. I nearly started to dance on my seat, it was really something. Overall, the film looks nice, I mean it had to be spectacular, it's sci-fi :)If you are a big fan of the game, you'll probably be thrilled and you might like it, but not me.I cannot rate it higher than 4, because I think it is the maximum this film deserves. The soundtrack cannot make the film much better, can it?",TRON - Legacy
373,rsre4-1,It's OK.,6,20 December 2010,"As for the plot of the movie - it was OK. Nothing spectacular. The action was great - plenty of it.It was an overall entertaining movie worth the 2 hours on a rainy Sunday afternoon.HOWEVER - the 3D was, to me, not worth the extra money. I'll put it this way: visually, the movie looked great. About as cool as looking into a holographic 3D picture. Things looked like you could reach out and grab them. But it lacked the ""Coming at you"" effects of what 3D movies should be and what I'm paying for. Nothing popped out of the screen at us. Nothing came flying towards our heads, despite many opportunities to do so. It looked more like a world you can reach into rather than a world coming out at you. I was disappointed in that, especially since I paid twice of what I would normally pay.For whatever 3D may be for you - if you looking for stuff to come flying out of the screen at you, this movie isn't it, and you might be just as well served watching it in 2D and saving the extra money.",TRON - Legacy
374,shawn00,Great fun!,9,7 January 2011,"I have to be honest, I had my hopes pretty high for this sequel. I enjoyed the original Tron as a kid and, while the special effects show their age when looking back on it, there's still something special about the original that stuck with me.All that said, Tron: Legacy goes exactly where I would have wanted a sequel to go. Right off, the visual effects were fantastic. The Grid never looked better. While some purists complain about the atmosphere and weather that could not live inside a computer, I argue that this is fantasy, so why not play out to the fullest? As far as the story goes, it was well told, easy to follow and was a fun ride. The emotional side related to father and son was very well done. I have to say, though, that Olivia Wilde pretty much stole every scene she was in. After only seeing her in a couple of roles before, I was very impressed by her acting talents in this. Her sense of awe around Flynn was wonderful but it was that innocence and wonder that she pulled off that was so captivating. Her face in the final scene was pure wonder and was just fantastic.All in all, this was a great fantasy picture that I would see again and again.",TRON - Legacy
375,damonous,A Roller-coaster Ride of Coolness,10,18 December 2010,"I wound-up watching the original Tron on DVD a couple times (for a couple of friends) in the last week before I saw Tron Legacy in 3D the other night. I'm due to see this again tomorrow with a different group of friends, and I must say... I am looking forward to that.While Tron 1 is still an 'interesting ride', and (to be honest) was truly groundbreaking for its time, it's definitely more-focused on allegorical ideas than the 'gripping dark realism' of movies we've become accustomed to in the last 20 or so years. Tron Legacy, while surprisingly not jettisoning story, is definitely a 'modern' blockbuster. At times, it is less-focused on the sci-fi aspects of the original movie, and more on superb digital effects.That being said, Tron Legacy is one of the best action/sci-fi blockbusters of 2010, and (in my book) neck-and-neck with Resident Evil Afterlife for usefulness of 3D-presentation. It really is a 'roller-coaster ride of coolness': dark and sleek, brutal and efficient, and infused with the sexy goodness of Olivia Wilde. And on top of that, it's reverent to the first film in that it still takes the time-out to speak to your mind, not just your senses.I'm not sure where some of the complaints regarding 'flimsy or confusing plot' come from. --Obviously those who either did not see, or did not like the original. Because Tron 1 made no ""practical"" common-sense, either, if you're the type not willing to go in with an open mind.For fans of the original, there are some 'recurring elements' (almost in the same order as the first movie). But, they are updated so well...I was going to give this a ""9"", but when the IMDb selector says ""10 (Excellent)"", ... I just had to choose that, because Tron Legacy IS excellent.What else? ..Oh, yes: the Daft Punk soundtrack. Just AMAZING. It pumps the techno-cool visuals along with urgency and weight like a ton of bricks falling on top of you... then smacking you in the head once or twice to bring you back to consciousness. (And that's a good thing!)",TRON - Legacy
376,thedarksteps,If saw it when you were 12 years old,9,17 December 2010,"No Spoilers in this review.I saw the original when I was 12, way back in 1982, I've been waiting for some kind of a sequel ever since. Disney had originally began making a sequel back in the early 2000's, but it got canned, at the time I was seriously frustrated that it had, but having played the corresponding PC game Tron 2.0 I'm glad they canned that one.The movie goes above and beyond the first, obviously in CG, but more importantly in the plot line. I'll admit, much of it was predictable, but what isn't nowadays? Some of the music by Daft Punk seemed a little out of place from time to time, but mostly contributed to new feel of the universe. A much darker universe than the first, but you can see that in the trailers.There's a disclaimer at the beginning of the 3D version that tells you the movie was not filmed in 3D, but that it was converted to it, despite that, I still think the 3D version was worth the extra $3.50, even though I didn't have to pay it, being an old movie fan working at a movie theater has its benefits.I don't think there will be a sequel in movie form, but a game that follows Tron: Evolution might be possible.Either way, if you've been waiting 28 years for a sequel, this is certainly worth the wait, if you're new to Tron, who knows.",TRON - Legacy
377,marplesj,"Amazing soundtrack, average film",7,20 December 2010,"After seeing an interview with Bridges in which he described the film as the next thing since Avatar, I was expecting to come out with that same feeling which I had when I left the cinema after seeing the first Matrix movie or indeed, Avatar. Unfortunately, no.Other than the initial bike races on the grid, the 3D did nothing for me in this film I'm afraid. Some of the explosions looked very pretty indeed but on the whole I couldn't help but feel let down, I suppose this is the curse of waiting for a film to come out for soooo long, expectations are built too high.Upon entering the city I thought a lot more could, and should, have been made of the whole 'underground rebellion', spending time on the almost Bladerunner-style of streets. But no, we spent pretty much all of the time there in a bar, which must have been struggling because of the economic downturn it seemed as it was hardly busy, must have just missed happy hour ;) It was almost as if they could only afford that set. I would have loved to meet some more characters, some more 'programs', and get to know their world, how they felt about how they are treated etc, it would have made me care a whole lot more! The soundtrack however, has to be one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard, a huuge salute to Daftpunk who suited the film down to the ground and did an awesome job.The script is at best, mediocre and at times I had to chuckle at the cheezy 'Disneyness' of some of the line delivery. To say that he hadn't seen his son in 20 years, Bridges was pretty dismissive upon their reunion and in all, I was expecting more from the legend. In fact upon the closing scenes I cringed at the cataclysmic-esc dramatisation that Bridges has to try and pull off - waaaaayyy over the top. On a positive note however, I thought that Wilde put in a very decent performance as Quorra.Lastly, can I recommend that any cinema playing this film boost the brightness a tad as it is way too dark! A lot of the 3D was lost on me as I was honestly squinting to make out what was happening! (No, I have no eyesight issues!) This was especially the case during any fight scenes, I very quickly lost track of who was fighting what and where.",TRON - Legacy

379,ZombieMcQueen,And incredible film and a worthy sequel.,10,31 December 2010,"I was among the many devoted, excited fans to see Tron: Legacy on opening day/weekend. Afterward, I felt like shedding tears of joy over how brilliant, wonderful, incredible, and fulfilling that movie is. From the first sights of the digital world to the end credits, I was literally shaking with awe and amazement.Revolving around Sam Flynn, the son of the original film's main character, the story follows him as he enters a digital world in search of his father, who has been missing for a little more than twenty years. Come to find out, the digital world that had been set free of the power-hungry Master Control Program in Tron is still besieged by a totalitarian threat, this time in the form of the familiar program CLU. (although this is a new incarnation compared to the one fans will remember). After finding his father, the two Flynns set out to once again free the digital world from its tyranny and spare the 'User' (real) world from a complete takeover.While this may sound like typical Disney movie fare, Tron: Legacy is incredibly faithful to the storytelling style of the original film in the sense that it executes its uniquely heroic storyline with a more mature and intellectual/philosophical methodology. Yes, there is family-friendly conflict, and yes, there is a romantic subplot, and yes there are many more points that are staples of Disney cinema, but like the original Tron, there is a deeper substance here that is very rare to find in other films, Disney or otherwise. Also incredible is the visual design and splendor of the film. From the intense lightcycle and disc battles to the sweeping digital landscape vistas, there are countless sights and scenes you will see in this film that you have never, nor likely will ever, see anywhere else (at least, outside of the possible sequel).I know there has been a lot of negative feedback from critics and the major public. I personally find this to be unfounded. When Tron was released in 1982, it was unlike anything anyone had ever seen in movies, and didn't really follow typical movie entertainment formulas, so most people either disliked it or ignored it. Thus, Tron has never been the most widely seen film, and since Tron: Legacy depends largely on one's knowledge of it, most people who have seen it recently will tell you that it doesn't make any sense. Do not anticipate such an expectation - the film is intricately and subtly told, but if you remember the basis of the original movie, you will do fine here. As far as current critical opinion goes, most critics have hated both films and thought them to be dense and unintelligible (read: they didn't know anything about computer technology, thus they didn't understand or appreciate most of what was going on, thus they thought it was stupid and childish), as well as saying there is no character development at all. I would personally ignore them as well. Both Tron and Tron: Legacy not only have well-written dialogue (if you understand a little bit of technology/pay attention), but they are also more about philosophical exposition and discovery than typical movie development. Tron is a series that has almost never gotten respect from 'intellectual' film critics, because it doesn't follow their understanding and opinion of how film should be. Nor does it want to. Tron: Legacy, like its predecessor, strives to be its own experience and succeeds grandly, and for that it deserves to be seen and respected.Overall, Tron: Legacy is not only the sequel fans have been waiting so long for, it's brilliantly well thought out with excellent character development, accompanied by the most astounding visuals in years. It's an incredibly intelligent, philosophical, and captivating work, and I am beyond pleased that i've had the chance to see it. End of line.",TRON - Legacy
380,SidewinderSMR,An audio-visual experience,9,28 February 2011,"Tron: Legacy should be seen (and heard!) as an audio-visual experience, rather than a movie with a compelling plot or deep story. The plot certainly moves, and the back story seems to conform to the original movie -- but for those of us living in the modern era, the 80s tron premise is too far fetched (or even outright silly) to be accepted today.Obviously, if you're a fan of the original, you'll probably disagree here -- but then again, you'll probably find the movie conforming to your expectations to begin with. This review is for those of us who aren't! That said, the movie has excellent visuals (we saw it in IMAX 3D) and an excellent audio score by Daft Punk. If you are a fan of their previous film, Interstella 5555, you might find Tron: Legacy a film similar in some ways: the audio experience plays a big role, and the plot and premise of the film play lesser roles.In conclusion: Go see this film, but don't expect to be blown away by some amazing story -- instead, go there with the intention of enjoying the ride and letting the musicians and artists take you to their virtual world.",TRON - Legacy
381,Mr.Big,"Tron Legacy lives up to all expectations and surpasses them with blinding speed, grace, agility, dazzling imagery and heart warming soul.",10,18 December 2010,"I loved the references to the original movie. I only wish more people in our small town ""got it"".There were moments throughout the picture where I wanted to stand up and cheer.Does no one applaud during movies anymore?, or maybe the problem is just where we live.I wish Cindy Morgan, Dan Shor and Bernard Hughes could have made even a brief cameo. Bernard (Walter/Dumont) will be sorely missed. I hope in future sequels they will be able to re-rez him if only for old-times-sake, in the same manner they paid tribute to Lawrence Olivier in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.The music is nothing less than astounding. Yet they still hearkened back to the original electronic score, only brought up to date 10 times over.My one wish would have been a few more characters from the original, but I'm glad they passed the torch to Garrett Hedlund (Sam) who is sure to appeal to today's audience, and carry on the legend.In summary:As a life long TRON expert, Tron Legacy lives up to all expectations and surpasses them with blinding speed, grace, agility, dazzling imagery and heart warming soul.The thin ice that Disney walked out on back in 1982 has resurfaced as a flawless sculpted crystal, a masterpiece that is sure to touch the inner being and imagination of generations past, present and future.I hope it doesn't take another 28 years for the next one. Even so, if that be the case, they will find an 81 year old man, standing there waiting for them..",TRON - Legacy
382,hwm-05554,"Excellent music, poor plot",7,10 March 2021,"The best part about this movie are the visual aesthetics combined with some of the greatest music I have ever heard in any movie. Daft Punk did a great job at adding rewatch value to this movie. The actual plot of the movie is simple and rather boring, there also is no character development at all.All in all, 7/10 it could have been a masterpiece but it was ruined by a mediocre plot.",TRON - Legacy
383,tom1111,Excellent movie.,8,17 December 2010,"This is a solid movie. The visuals are impressive, the soundtrack is impressive and fits the mood and scenes of the movie well. The acting is pretty good. Jeff Bridges and Hedlund and others do a great job. There is intensity, sense of urgency, emotional depth in the characters. The story line flows nicely, but it was little uneventful in very few seconds, but conceptually, visually, and imaginative ways, this was a solid movie for me. I like science fiction movies so this movie really opened my eyes and was very unique and nice experience.Also movies that use a lot of computer graphics can become very visually overwhelming if the action scenes and sounds are overdone, but this movie wasn't overwhelmingly CGI motion and action oriented. The nature of the movie is futuristic even without the computer generated imagery.Solid movie, interesting, unique, good acting, very good sounds/music, and those with special interest in science fiction movies I think will find this pretty much well done.Solid 7.2-8 for me.",TRON - Legacy
384,abundidi1184,Loved it!,8,21 July 2012,"I am 63 years old, and I loved the original movie, Tron, because I loved everything Jeff Bridges, and the movie was so unique and exciting. I've never been a gamer, so I didn't relate on a gamer level. I related to the original on a movie watcher's level. The same is true with Tron Legacy. 30 years later, I'm still not a gamer, but the effect of this movie struck me the same way. Jeff Bridges did not disappoint, and the supporting actors were up to the task. The movie was so exciting it kept me breathless throughout the movie. Many times while watching it, I exclaimed with ""Wow!"", ""Damn!"", and other expletives. I saw it at home with no 3D HD on a 32 inch TV, and it held up. This movie needed none of those things, because the directing, story line and acting was truly enough. Wow!!!",TRON - Legacy
385,samlane86,Tron: Legacy,6,5 January 2011,"TRON: Legacy is not a terrible movie, but it isn't great either. It is an imperfect movie. I haven't seen the original TRON in years (actually it was the first movie I ever bought on DVD way back when). Maybe if I had re-watched the first movie, I would have had a greater appreciation for this one. In any case, this film involves Sam Flynn investigating his father's disappearance twenty year previous. Through a series of unlikely events, he ends up trapped in the same computer world his father has been stuck in all these years. Together, father and son have to find a way out. Let's talk about what's good about the film first.It's effects are great for the most part, a vast improvement from the original (obviously, after 28 years). They offer the viewer some nice eye candy. I also quite enjoyed Daft Punk's score for the movie. It is a soundtrack I wouldn't mind owning. And as a homage to the first film, the soundtrack also includes Journey's Separate Ways (Worlds Apart).The movie has a fairly talented cast. Jeff Bridges and Michael Sheen are enjoyable in basically every part they play, even if this isn't one of their best. Bridges reprises his role of Kevin Flynn from the first film. He has a number of Lebowski-esquire lines, such as: ""This guy doesn't dig imperfection."" and ""You're messing with my whole Zen thing, man."" Apparently, Sheen based his performance partially on David Bowie. This really comes through in a fun, albeit small role. Newcomers Garrett Hedlund and Olivia Wilde round out the cast as Sam Flynn and Quorra respectively. Wilde's performance is quite promising. While Hedlund's is just average, and some of his one-liners come off rather cheesy.As many have said before me, TRON: Legacy's story is where the film really suffers. Again, it's not bad, just wholly unoriginal. You can name any number of films about a utopian society gone awry. And artificial intelligence turning on it's creator dates back at least to 2001: A Space Odyssey in 1968. The script even tries to wax philosophical at times, but is never quite able to reach true depth, just scratches the surface.While, as mentioned earlier, most of the effects are top notch, there are two that aren't quite so effective. The film's 3D was all but nonexistent. So the glasses just served to further darken already dark images. But, 3D is a pet peeve of mine. The de-aging effect, first used for Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen in X-Men: The Last Stand and for Jeff Bridges in this film, is one they have yet to perfect. It has always looked very unnatural to me.What lies between good and bad? Imperfect? Mediocre? Whatever the answer, that's what TRON: Legacy isFor my other reviews and whatnot check out my blog at: notexactlyaquote.tumblr.com",TRON - Legacy
386,ModKuraika,Superior to the original in more ways than one.,8,22 December 2010,"Now let's get one thing out of the way. I quite like the original Tron, I just personally think this sequel is better. I'm a big fan of dystopia, and I loved the look of Tron: Legacy with it's darker tone, look, and style in comparison with the original which had a bleak feel as well, but had some cheer to it. Tron was so well-crafted at such a low budget that its nice to see a sequel (NOT a remake) made with a much higher budget and opportunities to shine.It was great seeing Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner reprise their respective roles as Kevin Flynn/Clu and Alan Bradley/Tron. It was a great idea to keep Steven Lisberger around as Producer, and the little references to the first film make it feel whole.It's really the style of this film that's state of the art but overall I felt the story was solid as well, and had more of a focus and intention, whereas the first film was kinda here and there at times. Daft Punk was definitely the right decision for music in a unique situation like this.The characters work a lot more, in Tron I really couldn't tell who was meant to be the main protagonist, Flynn or Tron (the title itself adds more confusion). Clu and was definitely a more developed and more interesting villain then the MCP or Sark, and makes you feel almost sympathetic. The costume and prop design are updated for our time, the CG used for the Grid is no Pandora, but works perfectly for what it needs to be.In conclusion, the story is solid (at least in my opinion), the special effects are state of the art, the characters are fine, the acting works, and the philosophy behind the plot really intrigued me. It didn't feel like a popcorn flick. I'd watch this movie any day, as a great sequel, and a solid film. After all, it's Tron, it's not trying to be Cyberten Kane.",TRON - Legacy
387,TheGame111073,"An Enjoyable, Long Overdue Sequel that Compliments the Original",7,15 January 2011,"Tron: Legacy is an extremely entertaining, visually captivating, long overdue sequel to a great sci-fi classic. Tron: Legacy is a great follow up to the 1982 Disney ground breaking film. The movie is a fantastic visual spectacle much in the same way that the original film was. The first Tron featured innovative visuals that took audiences breaths away and the new film meets and exceeds the bar that was set by its predecessor.The cinematography of this film adds a great tone the picture as this Tron's theme is much darker and more sinister than the first movie. It is a great follow up to the original as it aptly explains the progression of the story and the development of the Tron universe. The first Tron's universe mirrored the video games of the time as it was filled with bright colors. This film uses more dark tones highlighted by colors to help emphasize the darker tone of the film. Tron: Legacy has a very good plot that compliments the original film but it has a universal appeal so that those who never saw the first film can enjoy just as well. The story is very plausible and has very little flaws. The main flaw of the story is the subtracted role of one of its main stars from the original Tron movie, Tron himself. Tron was a warrior program that championed for the users in the first film. He led the revolution against the Master Control Program. The character in the latest Tron film is more of a henchman and is barely seen. This was huge subtraction.The movie is a visually stunning marvel with a multitude of underlying themes about parenting, and family embedded within the larger than life sci-fi fantasy. The movie is really about family and the legacy that all parents want to leave their children. The film is a really good illustration of the obsession with career that many parents chase and in the process they often miss time or ignore the real legacy of them which is their children.Tron: Legacy is not about performances. Conversely, the film does contain some notable ones however. The main characters in the movie are portrayed very well. Jeff Bridges, in particular, gives a enjoyable performance as Kevin Flynn. He adds a feel of nostalgia as he uses many phrases like ""far out,"" ""way cool"" or other proverbial sayings from the 1980's to emphasize the character's lack of progression while being trapped in the computer. Garrett Hedlund does an admirable job as Sam Flynn. The main detractor to his performance was the combat/gladiatorial games that Sam was too proficient at. He too easily defeated everyone in the games. I found it extremely hard to believe the level of ease that he had in defeating some of the more experienced fighters in the games. In the first Tron, Flynn needed the help of Tron to survive the games. In this version, Sam takes them out until he faces Tron. Michael Sheen was extremely entertaining in his over the top performance of Zeus. His portrayal of the excessively exuberant Zeus added some color and a great relief to the more serious performances in the film.The original Tron was a good story highlighted by ground breaking visual effects that captured everyone attention and it was way ahead of its time with is cinematography. Tron: Legacy is not a movie about performance. Nearly everyone that goes to see this movie will go to see it for one of two reasons. The visuals or the fans of the original film or both. The movie is equally satisfying in both of those areas as well as enhancing the original story in almost every way. Considering those two factors then Tron:Legacy is an excellent sequel to the classic.",TRON - Legacy
388,asmenar,Pleasure for the eyes,10,11 November 2018,"Enigmatic, brilliant, exquisite, breathtaking.
But, i am not going to bore anyone who is reading this review. Instead let me try to focus on the bad points. There are some, like the person acting as middle-aged Jeff bridges looks odd when he talks. Then there's not enough screen time with the ""coolest bikes i have ever seen"". Also, it's not as epic as the original LOTR or The revenant or Star wars.
No, this is not an epic movie. There are reasons for that, this takes on a subject more complex than Matrix, more dramatic than Fastnthefurious, more eyecandy than Neon demon. The bike scene will raise every single hair in your body, no matter how many times you watch it. The concept will blow your mind, if you truly try to understand it. Even though the scaling is not grand, when you realize what idea they are trying to portray in the movie, you understand the reason. Just like real life, people are never ready to take something like this seriously, its almost like witchcraft.
I have bored you even more, haven't i? You must think, reading this was a gigantic waste of your 30 seconds. Tell you what, no matter what movie you have seen and think is the best movie in the world, if you have not seen this masterpiece yet, then you have not seen the best epic movie of all time.",TRON - Legacy
389,Pixie-Belle,3D Feast!,8,19 December 2010,"It is the present day and we are sucked into 'the Grid' with Sam Flynn, the son of Kevin Flynn who went missing almost 20 years ago, to find his dad and battle Clu in this 3D world.OK so let's beginThe story is pretty weak, the script quite painful at times. Every time it slows down and the characters begin to speak to each other you find yourself screaming for the action to start again and by the end I was starting to lose interest. Also having never seen the original I also think a few things were lost on me, they did try to explain it but I think that never compares to actually seeing the film. I don't know why it was not re-released on DVD prior, at least it wasn't in Australia. Maybe the original is such a bomb they thought it would put people off?Visually it is amazing, the best 3D I have seen on the big screen, better then Avatar. (I have no idea other than the 3D why people are trying to compare it Avatar.) It is a sci-fi nerd fest of 3D effects and the light-cycle battle is truly out of this world!Acting-wise for Cillian Murphy's cameo is great and clearly leads to more in future the man can be on screen for just a minute and still pumps the movie with cool! Michael Sheen again is always a favourite for me and the scene featuring him and Daft Punk is the film's highlight. And of course the music must get a mention, I am not normally one to focus on a film's score but this was fantastic, every time the music started you couldn't help but get excited about what you were about to hear.I must say there is something slightly Star Wars about the film, Jeff Bridges played a slightly Zen Jedi you could picture George Lucas just itching to bring out 3D Star Wars or half temped to make another!Overall a good fun, exciting film, a visual feast for the eyes, you must see it on the big screen in 3D. (I wonder how it will translate and how enjoyable it will be on a 2D TV screen?) Anyway go see and enjoy!",TRON - Legacy
390,Syndicateman,"A response to Tron: Legacy's greatness, and its negative reviews which miss the point",9,17 December 2010,"I went in with low expectations after reading all the complaints and reviews about the plot being shallow. After leaving the film though, i was thoroughly impressed with Tron: Legacy. What ""bad plot"", I kept muttering to myself. ""What the hell are they talking about?"" Maybe this is how it feels to be a fan of Avatar.That said, I think reviewers are completely missing the point of Tron: Legacy. So many have commented on the absent explanations being the element that ruined the film for them but so many forget that the film's technicalities were too convoluted to begin with to even begin explaining (such as how and why the grid works), so it instead told a fairly simple hero's journey. As James Berardinelli writes in his review (also, off topic, why is he considered a top reviewer on RT?), ""They had 28 years, and this is the best they could come up with?"" Precisely my point. They had 28 years of technical advances! How do you adapt the original Tron's explanations? You can't. Leave it to the sci-fi novels, and at times, I really felt like Tron: Legacy was an adaption of a much larger, and more complicated novel. Instead of rummaging through made-up plot science, it relished in the atmosphere, imagery, and ambiance, furthering my suspicions that Tron: Legacy was really just a sci-fi novel adaption in disguise, as adaptions of novel usually focus on the atmosphere and recreating rich personalities rather then getting bogged down in a heavy plot. I was reminded of Inception, and how that danced around its explanations in favor of telling a great story.I am wondering if there's some part of this film that alienates people. That makes people fight back against just sitting back and letting the film entertain you. I saw one alienating plot element, the meandering narrative, but thought it was methodical, and I suppose it could be described as ""boring"" especially as the ending feels a bit light footed considering all the build up. Not enough ""epic"" action. Not enough Tron, though really, it became readily apparent that 2/3 way into the film, the plot had switched to ""leading up to another sequel mode"". Really, the only thing keeping me from enjoying the film, which I found engrossing in how it relished every moment of screen time it had to tantalize the eyeballs of the viewer, was Olivia Wilde. She is this perfect romantic lead and I instantly melt when she appears on screen. I was on the edge of my seat the entire film, hoping she'd make it out to reality with Sam. It was intense in that she is such an enduring actress and she nails her part so brilliantly, that her romantic escape, for me, became the entire driving force of the film.Let's finish it up with the hivemind complaints about Sam's character (Flynn's son). He's empty and shallow, but that is ENTIRELY THE POINT. His life is lacking, and he uses his father's absence as an easy excuse. I see this all the time in other films and people seem to get it. It's father-son relationships 101. When his father asks about him, and Sam instantly seems disappointed in himself, it's because of his aimlessness. I found this to be incredibly enlightening considering this was a Disney backed film and Disney loves perfect protagonists. By the end of the film, Sam had gone through an arc. We're not suppose to like him at the beginning, we're suppose to sympathize with him.Last bit: The screenplay for Tron: Legacy reminds me of a very millennial gen-minded process for adaption, and I wouldn't be surprised if style over substance becomes a more standard modern methodology. The only problem is, most people go to see films to be ""entertained"" and have no precognition of the purpose of a film besides that. It'll be interesting to see what sells, and what doesn't.",TRON - Legacy
391,joerice-98902,Legacy indeed..,10,10 October 2018,"BIG Disney Pixar fan and was very young when the OG Tron came out so didn't have too much invested going into Tron Legacy.
Casting was great with Bridges and Michael Sheen delivering solid performances... My future wife Olivia Wilde was an awesome added bonus.
This movie had so much room to explore considering the advances in movie making since the original Tron and I was not let down at all.
Add an amazing soundtrack by Daft Punk (best movie soundtrack since Drive) was a nice icing on this tasty treat.
Was heartbroken to read that they aren't going ahead with the sequel due to low box office numbers but tbh in Australia we had little to no pre-release media for this so if that was similar in other countries then that's on the studio to correct. 
I've tried to sell other people on this movie and sure there are a few that didn't appreciate it but I'm slowly converting those who haven't watched it into fans 😎",TRON - Legacy

This film is very well made, very well written, and is laid and strewn with quality throughout. The themes are there and are integrated into the plot and story well, the villain is not only a great villain, but a great character. All of the main characters are good, decently developed people. The acting is good all round from the entire cast. There is so much subtlety and attention to detail in the story and the characters of this film with both the interactions of the characters and the world of this story.

394,jswraven,The Big Lebowski meets Daft Punk in the Matrix,6,20 December 2010,"A lot of reviewers are giving Tron: Legacy 10 start ""despite its flaws.""Great visuals? Yes. Appropriate music? Sure.But, the story is a bit forced and the dialog is downright BORING. Perhaps Disney could have shaved $5 million off the marketing budget and spent it on writers instead. This is a momentous movie--give us some momentous dialog.Instead, we get Jeff Bridges (Kevin Flynn) acting The Dude. That was fine in ""The Big Lebowski"" and even ""The Men Who Stare at Goats""--yet, it feels out of place here.Garrett Hedlund (Sam Flynn) plays every rebellious young man from every recent movie (think Chris Pine as Kirk in ""Star Trek"" and Shia LeBeouf as Mutt in the last ""Indiana Jones""). Angry, bored, talented. Yawn.Cillian Murphy plays Edward Dilinger (son of original ""Tron"" nemesis Ed Dillinger). He gets a few lines, then that plot thread vanishes. Why is he even in the movie?Yes, the movie was entertaining. Go see it in the theater, have some popcorn, be entertained. But 10 stars? Hardly. You won't remember more than two lines from the movie by the time you recycle your 3D glasses.",TRON - Legacy
395,clay_animator,"If you liked the original, then you'll enjoy this",8,19 December 2010,"I should probably start by saying that the Original Tron is one of my all time favorite movies. I have a top six that shuffle around a little bit but always remain at the top and Tron is one those. Basically, if you were to say that Tron is my favorite movie, I couldn't call you a liar. That being said, I was nervous about this movie. I was afraid that this movie wouldn't be very good and would even ruin my opinion of the original. Fortunately, this movie was not a disappointment. Quite the contrary. First, I need to get the one universal complaint out of the way: the story. This movie has a pretty weak story and there are a few plot-holes. One that kept bugging me throughout the movie was the Kevin Flynn's age. Now, I realize that Jeff Bridges has gotten older and that they can't use that digital face for all the shots(it was pretty obvious in the opening scene), but it doesn't make sense to the story why he is that old. Do cells decay in the digital world? If so, and if a millisecond represents 8 hours, then shouldn't he be a lot older, or even dead? Here's a good warning. Don't try to think about how this story would work based on how computers actually work. You're just going to get confused. Another issue with the story is that you never really believe anyone is dead. Tron was mentioned near the beginning, but killed off in a flashback. Now, be honest. Do you really think that the characters WHOSE NAME IS IN THE TITLE is dead? Kevin Flynn also died at the end of the movie in a moment of self sacrifice. Do any of you really believe he's gone? Cops can recreate files that have been deleted and written over several times. Someone like Sam can definitely get his dad back. Besides, Disney wanted to make a trilogy of these. Kevin Flynn isn't dead. So the story is not anything to write home about, but it wasn't in the first movie either. What people loved about this first movie is exactly why this one is so good: the visuals. This movie is beautiful. The sets, the costumes, the vehicles. It all works. The action sequences were also impressive. Today, action has sort of broken into two groups: stylistic and gritty realism. I tend to prefer stylistic because I am so tired of seeing shaky cameras in movies. Seriously filmmakers. It's called a tripod, use it. This movie has several great action sequences and it all looks impressive with that neon on black ascetic.Here's basically how this movie's audience is going to break down. Think about Avatar. This movie has pretty much the same strengths and failures of that movie. The visuals are great, but the story not so much. If you didn't like Avatar, it was because of the weak story and if you liked it, it was because of the visuals. I predict that reactions to Tron Legacy will be similar. If you're undecided on whether you want to see it, think about Avatar.Although, comparing this too Avatar does bring up one other flaw. The 3D is a little lackluster. Tron Legacy was actually filmed in 3D(mostly) so it's already a step above movies like Alice in Wonderland in the 3D. But I don't feel like it was utilized very well. There were times when I couldn't tell that it was in 3D and I had to take off my glasses just to see if it was in fact 3D. Now, the stuff in the real world was shot and presented in 2D, but I'm not talking about that. I did think it was a little lazy that only part of the movie was shot in 3D, but this did lead to an amazing bit when Sam was zapped into the grid. It was sort of like the scene in Wizard of Oz when Dorothy opened the door and stepped into Oz at which point the movie became color. That use of the 3D worked but besides that, I feel like it could have been utilized a bit better. I feel like I'm fixating on the negative aspects, but believe me, this is an excellent film. One final note. The score by Daft Punk is awesome.",TRON - Legacy

However, this film was an absolute delight to go see. It has something for everyone in, awesome effects, mind-blowing action, emotional moments and even a little bit of eye candy. There was also a funny line or two thrown into it for good measure. The actors gave great performances, fitting into the world of Tron fantastically.

397,silverwing-001,Flashy...But thats about it,6,22 December 2010,"The movie was...OK. Not horrible, but not great either.The Good: The special effects were amazing. The Light cycle sequence made the geek in me scream. They clearly went all out to make it flashy. The sound was also incredible. I mean i was literally shaking in my seat cause the bass was intense. The Action sequences were very good as well. The games were great. The disc fights were very exciting.The Bad: The plot was not well written. Granted it could have been worse. But the things that made the original Tron enjoyable and original were left completely out. It felt more like a futuristic human society rather than the inside of a computer. It was awkward and out of place. I wont give away spoilers but don't expect much. The dialog was really cheesy. Not Tron cheesy I mean action movie cliché cheesy. They actually cut out a lot of Tron Original dialog. De-Rezzed was about all they kept. The main character is boring and unoriginal. The main villain was horrible as a villain. But I could forgive it all if Daft Punk didn't do a horrible job at the score. I mean horrid. Its tron its meant to sound techno their specialty. It sounds like more of a Hans Zimmer rip off.The Ugly: Jeff Bridges. OK the mans a great actor. Thats why hes on the ugly part. His performance in Tron Legacy was not his best. I know hes able to do much better. Hes still the best actor in this movie by far. But considering the rest of the performances were terrible, thats not a high standard.All in all its OK. Flashy and exciting but not a lot of depth. Jeff Bridges saves the Acting segment even though he wasn't at his best by far. Its worth seeing.

A truly stunning spectacle of visuals and sound. Between the production design, the sound fx, the amazing score, and the pure skill of story-telling, this movie reminded me of what a true blockbuster is. Science fiction is a rough genre' because it demands such a high suspension of disbelief. Not all massive budget fare can deliver. Movies like Transformers or the Star Wars prequels proves that bigger is not always better. A film needs consistency. It needs heart. You have to be sucked into a world for 2 hours and stay contained in it's walls until the credits roll. Tron: Legacy does this. It takes the very basic conflicts and never lets go. It hinges on a very simple and specific goal, and sees it through. It doesn't distract (other than beating you over the head with some minimal PG rated exposition). It's a movie that never forgets what it's meant to be. I enjoyed it very much.",TRON - Legacy
399,ruink,Where's Tron? Just Kidding,5,20 December 2010,"Its been a near 30 years since the initial release of the original Tron. A film that at the time split the opinions and beliefs of it's many viewers. Some found it revolutionary and others found it to be complete sci-fi jargon which led to its inevitable cult following. Has the sequel delivered only to it's cult or has it also delivered to what could possibly be a mass success?The answer is simple; Tron: Legacy will be a massive success. The reason for this? In an age where special effects rule the box office, Tron is absolutely full of them. And some pretty damn impressive effects at that. But sadly, the story is a complete mess. Its a lot of checkpoint non-sense. ""Lets go here and find this, then go here"" etc etc. But what it lacks in story it makes up for in technical splendor. From the 3D, to the effects,sound, and fantastic action sequences.The acting all the way around is expectedly mediocre with the exception of Jeff Bridges whom is always entertaining. His dual role as the elder Kevin Flynn and the corrupt version of himself, Clu is quite impressive and always interesting to watch. A lot of his performance is fresh due to the uncanny motion capture that went into Bridges' Clu who looks like twenty something version of Bridges.Tron: Legacy may not be the epic sequel die hard fans were waiting for all these years. But one thing can be said, Legacy is spectacular visual entertainment. But if I were to highlight my one major complaint it would be this; in a Tron film where in the world is Tron himself? Though he is in the film, and without spoiling anything, I was highly disappointed with the amount of screen time and the role he had to play for the story. Maybe this bothered me because Tron was always my favorite character from the Grid.With a few reservations aside, Tron: Legacy is truly worth shelling out a few bucks to turn off your mind and just watch some awesome visuals invade your mind.",TRON - Legacy
400,sabretoothmovies,Trontastic!!!,5,22 December 2010,"A Deaf Person's Favourite Movie The 2010 Tron film is amazing to watch, provided you are either deaf or just don't care about a plot/decent writing. The movie looks fantastic; never have roman gladiator battles been so sleek and modern; never have inflatable motorcycles looked so realistic; never has Obi Wan Kenobi dressed so much like Morpheus. It is modern eye candy that explodes off the screen in dazzling effects.The actual content however, is a muddled heap of garbage that borderlines the film on comedy territory. Here is the basic plot: ten year old son and father have clichéd conversation, father leaves and disappears, son grows up and goes all Tony Stark on his life minus the cool factor of Robert Downey Jr., son grows up and finds his way into grid world where he finds his father trapped by the evil supervillian Clu!

The title of the film I think comes from the video game from which the movie is based, and is also the name of a character who was good but now is evil but then becomes good again so in the end it is all cool.What is actually cool is Jeff Bridges, who plays the father/creator -of-the-grid/zen-master and then as a separate character plays Clu as well. Jeff Bridges is what would happen if you combined Gandalf with a very rugged lumberjack, and then added a touch of God to the mix. In short, he is awesome. Sure the director makes him do stupid stuff like whack a guard on the head to reprogram him, or create a swirling tornado out of nowhere but that is only because Jeff Bridges is a good sport. Also it is because he got paid millions.The movie in total cost 170 million to make, and I would make an educated guess and say that most of that money was spent on making things look wicked sweet. The problem however, is that when things look wicked sweet, they don't look real. It's hard to care about a violent Frisbee battle when it just looks like a dramatic video game. It is even harder to care when the dialogue from the protagonist-with-daddy-issues goes something like this: ""Is this really happening?"" pause for something to explode ""OMG it really is."" Olivia Wilde as the Trinity of the film also seems fairly hollow. She's unconscious for a portion in the middle of the film and the audience really doesn't notice a difference. On a side note: can a human and a program hook up? Because that just seems weird to me.I have not seen the original Tron, nor do I want to. Wikipedia says that it was criticized for its weak plot line, which its sequel clearly did not learn from. In the end, I just think Hollywood just needs to hold some teamwork seminars and figure out how writers like Aaron Sorkin or Diablo Cody could write the scripts for movies with awesome special effects. Like Juno but with aliens as the characters, or Tron with dialogue as fast and impressive as the motorcycle chases. That's all I want, but I think it is about as likely as a blind person liking Tron.Rating: S-a-b-r-e",TRON - Legacy

402,nikowanamate,"sexy, edgy and enthralling - doesn't disappoint",9,18 December 2010,"having heard about the film tron legacy a year ago,my movie bug got interested. i watched the first one, and thought it was okay.however, watching the second one was simply nothing short of amazing. the stunning action sequence, the fantastic visual effects and most of all a fantastic good/villain Jeff bridges. watching this film will definitely leave you feeling you have your money's worth. it was entertaining from start to finish and not one moment was at all boring.i found my self slipping into this film, which was stunning, but the music definitely helped. having an actual band write the music was absolute genius. the music goes so well with the film, that both film and music become one. it adds an exciting effect to the way you see the world of tron.i must admit, i had my doubts about the director choice, but having seen this film, i'm left thinking, a new director with a new vision that Hollywood has yet to see. the film is certainly better to watch in 3d because...trust me...it helps.overall i thought this film was sexy, edgy and enthralling.",TRON - Legacy
403,jones-ben42,TRON Legacy is a fun guilty pleasure,6,22 December 2010,"In short, I loved watching Tron, but after everything was over, it did seem that many of the aspects of this movie were a bit underplayed or things just seemed wrong.This movie did have many good things about it. The visuals were amazing, superior to that of Avatar (in my opinion), Olivia Wilde, a perfect score from Daft Punk to fit the mood of the story flawlessly, Olivia Wilde, action scenes that really were just fun to watch, and Olivia Wilde. While I do believe the original movie's visuals were more realistic in the sense that it truly made you feel like you were in a computer, the visuals truly cater to the audience and the darker mountainous tone emphasized the feeling of being trapped that Bridge's character felt. Simply put, you can't really describe the music of a movie, it's just something you must hear it for yourself to be fully immersed into the movie. The action was some of the best I had seen this year, on par or superior to the zero-gravity parts of Inception. The entire sequence with the lightbikes on the grid was easily the best part of this movie; it was fun, thrilling, and amazingly well animated. And of course Olivia Wilde is Olivia Wilde, nothing much to be said.With these good things, there are a large handful of things I found to be disappointing. First off, while there was a protagonist in the movie, he is underplayed in that role. In basic movie making 101, a protagonist needs to have things explained to him so he, and also in turn the audience, can understand. There wasn't really any of this in the movie and they relied on people seeing the 28 year old prequel as a reference of knowledge. Sam would have been perfect as an ignorant, slacking son that didn't meet up to his father's expectations when he was a child. And when he was transported into the computer world, his father would be able to explain things so that he and the audience could understand. For example, people who didn't see the first movie would have no idea the significance of a program and users or of the character Tron. Sam's immediate understanding of the technical chaos doesn't help the audience to understand the plot anymore.Also, and this is probably my least favorite part of the movie, was Clu. This character was a disaster. With robotic CGI movements, rare but noticeable lip syncing failure, and no emotion in his eyes, Clu was a bland antagonist. It would have made much more sense for young Flynn to create Clu as an older and wiser version of himself, which would equate to modern day Bridges. This image would make one to believe that he would be intelligent to create a perfect society, but similar to Soviet Russia, perfection in society is impossible to achieve because of too many inconsistencies. This would help the animators because they wouldn't have any need to show young Bridges's face. They could have have simply just gotten all the shots showing young Bridges from the back, which brings a cloud of mystery around the character and makes the true reveal of the character much more interesting. Then, in this fashion, the old wise Bridges would come face to face with Clue and see that while Clu is a perfect image of himself, it doesn't capture the knowledge of true human reasoning and that Clu was a shadow of his young ignorance.And while there are more things I could nitpick at, I have a 1000 word limit, so I will only mention one more thing. The ending of this movie just could have been handled so much better. The fact that Bridges killed himself to save Sam and Quorra simply baffles me. People seeing it initially might think of it as a selfless act for the sake of his son, but there were other ways to go about it. While I do understand that the writers wanted to use the concept of redemption and making up for ones mistakes to resolve the situation with Clu, Bridges, Sam, Quorra, and Clu all could have made it back to the real world and they all could attack him there where he has no special abilities and secretly ""take care of him"" so he doesn't like take over the world. This way Kevin and Sam could take back Encom together, and going along with my recommendation before about Sam being a slacker, Kevin could help teach Sam the ropes so he could one day take full control of the company when he dies.There are more things in this movie that I didn't like, but this movie doesn't try to be perfect. This movie is a fun watch for anybody, it's enjoyable and a thrill ride to the very end, just don't get caught up in the specifics like I did and you will love it. If you are a technical person, like computers, or just fun, popcorn action, then you'll love watching TRON Legacy.",TRON - Legacy
404,Shadwellarmy,Can I have one of those Light Cycles for Christmas please?,6,19 December 2010,"I won't go into the plot or the details of the storyline. I saw the first Tron when I was a kid and have always been a fan of the film. I have been watching the trailers for this film since they came out and couldn't wait to see it. I went with my 10 year old son, and we both really enjoyed it. It's nice to see a film that doesn't need gore or ultra-violence to make it real! Even in Avatar there were some moments where my son had to look away! I have been reading all of the critics reviews and have to say the 1 and 2 star ratings are not justified. Great family film that I would see again. My only criticism is that there was not enough action in the middle, they could have done more with the Grid games part to slow the whole process down and spread the action, instead it's over too quickly and leaves you wanting to see more action from the Light Cycles and Cars. The 3D is great but still not seen anything that matches Avatar in that respect. And yes, it has nicked parts from Star Wars, but then who hasn't??! That's why Star Wars was so great! Go and see Tron: Legacy and unleash the 'full geek' within!! You know you're in denial!!",TRON - Legacy
405,mikeylvsmvies,Total Awesomeness,10,19 December 2010,TRON:Legacy is a totally awesome flick.It takes place 27 years after the original TRON. The story involves Sam Flynn(newcomer Garret Hedlund)setting out in search of his long lost father Kevin Flynn(Jeff Bridges)and getting transported into the universe of TRON where father and son reunite.Olivia Wilde co-stars as Quorra who becomes Sam's love interest.Bruce Boxleitner reprises his original TRON role of Allen Bradley. The father/son story arc resolves in a bittersweet manner with the father sacrificing himself so that his son can get home. If you have seen the original TRON you will be blown away by this sequel. The 3-D effects are awesome. Plan to see TRON:Legacy and prepare for awesomeness.,TRON - Legacy
406,bprokosz,Tron bookends the age groups...,7,27 January 2011,"It's surprising to me how difficult it was to actually get my hands on a copy of the original Tron. Amazon sells it for upwards of $70 and my local library had me on a waiting list that meant I had to see Tron Legacy last night instead of when it came out. Finally though, 2 days before it leaves most of my local theaters, I got to watch it...First: TRON...the original...When Flynn breaks into the mainframe to download files that show he is the true inventor of popular video games, the mainframe activates a laser that breaks down his molecules and traps him in the computer world. In order to get back to reality Flynn teams up with Tron, a super program and fights to the Portal, the only way back. I asked everyone if the movie was good before I saw it...everyone said instantly ""no...its horrible""...going in with that mindset I forced myself through the first 10 minutes of in-comprehensive story to get to the real plot. Then I was shocked that the disgustingly bad graphics and horrible acting were actually intriguing me. Soon I was on the edge of my seat as Flynn and Tron are involved in suspenseful light cycle chases and tanks blast away at the grid...really...i was shocked...the graphics are so bad and that acting is worse. After the movie I felt rewarded and thought the story had a perfect arc and was satisfied.....TRON LEGACY....2 days after seeing the original I watched this..which also happened to be 2 days before it left theaters in my area (whew)...1) The plot: Sam Flynn, son of billionaire Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) is the cookie cutter rebel...outrunning police on his Ducatti, living in a garage, and breaking into his father's company to pull pranks...one night, Adam (from the original..like...the guys who's program was Tron!) tell Sam his pager went off inside the dad's old arcade...Sam goes looking, finds a hidden door, accidentally shoots himself with the infamous laser gun, and is now on The Grid...horrible...the original had a point, setting up a point through ""accidents"" is, to me, a cop-out. Anywho...Sam is forced to play games and ""survive"" on the Grid as he looks for his father.2) The characters....Sam= rebel...think Kirk in the new Star Trek mixed with a little John Conner via T2...thats it...he's there to push the plot along. Jeff Bridges= Awesome...really awesome...you could play a drinking game to the times he says ""Hey man, it's cool man, we're jamming man!""...and he plays two parts very well.All the other characters are programs so you'd expect them to act robotic therefore they don't count...although the club owner and the right-hand man are IDIOTS...so annoying.3) The 3D....pointless. Now before I get hate responses I will say the graphics looked amazing...light cycle races, Frisbee fights, and the planes all were flashy and bright and fun...however, I tilted my head several times to see without the glasses and found out there were very very few times where the entire image was in 3D...sometimes a light trail would be but the cycle wouldn't...a pixel would blast out at you but the action around it wouldn't etc...in my opinion wasted. Also, 3D movies are shown darker than normal so I'm confident that the Bluray of this will look brighter, flashier, and even better.overall....eh...keep in mind this is the sequel that broke so much new ground in the world of computers and movie-making it's still being talked about...it was a revolutionary idea and blew everyone's mind....the new one is typical Disney flash but there's NOTHING in it that I found to be groundbreaking or did anything even close to ""bullet time"" in the Matrix, 3D in How to Train Your Dragon/Avatar, or even tell a fantastic story. This movie is Matrix/Star Wars/Star Trek/and the ending is 100% LOtR you shall not pass...Explanation of my title for this review.....for kids this movie is definitely worthy of its PG title, the style is more important to kids ages 6-13 than the substance so it is a perfect movie for them. Ages 14-17 will probably think it's not cool to see a PG Disney movie and would rather sneak into a dumb R rated comedy. For fans of the original like my parents and anyone old enough to remember the actual affect Tron had will like this movie as well, most likely the 30-50 year-olds. There are tons of references to the first movie including dialog ""Wow, that is a big door"" is said in both films while opening the same door. the words ""I fight for the users"", the original had as one of it's tag lines is in this movie and is a great moment for fans.Finally, this movie starts out an origin story for newbies but should have been a full-fledged sequel. The scenes on The Grid are fun but nothing monumental, the story is everything we've seen a million times, and the ending is just fine, if not feeling a little rushed. Great as escapism but not worth the $16 3D fee at all.",TRON - Legacy
407,TheChampReview,Tron was better than expected,7,23 December 2010,"I was actually pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the movie. The plot was simple but it worked as a re-make and adaption from the cartoon. The cinematography was great and the overall look of the movie was definitely innovative. It was a story about a father and son who were separated and came back together, so the points that were supposed to be emotional definitely had the correct tone. I was pleased with the acting, pleased with the score, pleased with the action and more. As i stated earlier, i wasn't blown away by the plot. But i'm not a fan of movies adapted from cartoons. But nonetheless, there isn't you can do with a story that has already been written. I was a little confused of the use of CGI in certain moments that I felt didn't need it, but i guess the film makers thought it necessary. I won't be brutal like I usually because the movie was not a bore. Definitely not a roller coaster ride of excellence all the way through, but if you're bored and going to the movies was your choice of activities I would definitely recommend Tron.",TRON - Legacy
408,vshnay1,"Visuals are 8, plot and story 4 = total of 6",7,23 December 2010,"Two thumbs up to the animators at Disney, excellent job boy. Stunning visual effects that take your breath away, captivating action sequences and wonderful costumes. The set designers deserve serious recognition for creating clean and visual impacting world. It is nice to see the Kevin Flynn's place of habitation to be a great combination of Victorian and modern. But i am afraid that is all of the positives i can say about the movie. The movie starts fast and goes into familiar territory of reintroducing characters from the original Tron into the light, but it does not take sufficient enough time to cover the background story as to why, how, and so on. The brief explanations of how the new digital universe come to be are just that brief, they are not visually captivating, they are lucking a certain punch, they do not give me a defined historical time line. It almost feels like that the writes did good job of reintroducing the characters from the original Tron and then gave up.The first action sequence in the arena is excellent, very visually stunning, the combination of colors and background is outstanding. But it is the only one, there is no more, the boys in the writing department forgot to add at least 2 more. The directors seriously should have broken down this movie into 2 movies and loaded it with 5 to 6 Matrix like action sequences. Dear directors and producers, you should have thought of that.",TRON - Legacy
409,Danniboi,Should this movie be called Tron: Legacy?,4,14 September 2011,"First of all, this movie has almost nothing to do with Tron. This movie is about Flynn and the mess he's inadvertently made in a harmless, isolated server.I'll echo what so many other reviewers have said, in that this movie is visually beautiful, I give it 4 out of ten mainly for the visual effects and that the actors did their best with what they were given, and that is where it pretty much ends for me. With the budget it had, as well as being the sequel to a groundbreaking film, I would have expected a decent story to go with the effects.I was really hoping to see what happened to more of the original characters, but although Tron's human counterpart put in an appearance, Tron himself was hardly in it, and it seemed as though he was only shoved in there to make the title of the movie relevant. He didn't do anything except look slightly menacing, spout a line from the original movie and then sink into oblivion. And why was he kept in a helmet? If Jeff Bridges can be made eternally young by the power of CGI, why can't Bruce Boxleitner? I was also disappointed with the plot, or lack of it. I saw this at home and had to go back and watch the second half again because I fell asleep on the sofa halfway through.Aside from Quorra, (pretentious spelling of an ordinary name), the remaining females in this movie wore stupid shoes and looked like they were plucked straight from a makeup commercial. They looked like silicone sex dolls. Predictable and boring.Finally, Cillian Murphy and his character was completely wasted. Why introduce Dillinger's son, played by a fantastic actor and then not use him anywhere else in the movie? This movie is very pretty, but my advice is to skip it and go buy a packet of glo-sticks. Don't give money to movie makers if they can't deliver a decent story to go with the effects.",TRON - Legacy
410,Barefooteagle,Very bad excuse for a film,4,27 December 2010,"I am deeply disappointed with this film. Indeed, trying to cope with one of the most entertaining science-fiction films of the 80s did not prove an easy task for Disney, a task in which they failed miserably, proving once again that risk is not one of the core values of its film-making, choosing instead to get close to safe formulae as much as they can, and resulting in a terrible version of what could have been a classic film like its predecessor. Badly predictable (after the first 15 minutes you have enough clues to figure the whole story out), and with some scenes that look as if directly borrowed from some other films (The Matrix, Ghostbusters, etc), this film is just a bad excuse to take the dust off a few memorable items (the bikes, the video game battles, the portal to the real world, Tron itself) and trying (very badly) to build a coherent story. No such thing. Almost perfectly parallel in its story telling to the original Tron, this is just a poor, boring story drowned in millions of dollars of plastic computer animation and terrible acting.",TRON - Legacy
411,cinemacide,"Visually Perfect..the rest, meh.",5,22 July 2012,"Ho-hum story of the chosen one that we've seen a zillion times (Star Wars, Dune, The Matrix, etc.) but with an even more bland lead in the vein of Chris Pine or Channing Tatum. Which only furthers the banality of the story. And yet the reason you keep your eyes glued to TRON: Legacy is for the most amazing visuals. Some can argue that pretty pictures alone don't make a movie, well, here is the rare example of when it does!! Combine grand CGI with the most dramatic and engaging electronic score courtesy of Daft Punk and you'll find yourself drooling. Sure, none of makes much sense but really who the Eff cares. That 52 inch flat-screen you got for Christmas, quite literally sucks you into the most incredible pulsating data pounding universe thats been seen since 2001! You heard me right, Kubricks 2001.

412,jdavenpo,Fantastic time at the movies!!!,9,16 December 2010,"After leaving the movie i wanted to give it a 10, but have since tempered my enthusiasm only because Garret Hedlund's performance weakens considerably with each new scene. He started strong, but by the end was just not very believable in his roll.Any weakness in the plot was exposed in Garret's limited abilities IMHO.Overall though, spectacular fun, good vs evil, hot chicks, and gamer special effects. LOOOVED Bridges, he was fantastic!!! and the younger version was awesome!!! I was entertained from beginning to end, never felt like it was dragging along, storyline was interesting without prior TRON knowledge. Kids loved it and will be taking 8 year old and wife next week.

But it worth watching.",TRON - Legacy
414,rysmith25,"Outstanding, but does it live up to the hype??",9,17 December 2010,"Not quite.The good about this movie certainly outweighs the bad. First and foremost, this movie has set the new standard for most visually stunning movie ever created. The sound is also on that same par with the visuals of the movie. This movie created a symphony of audio fidelity. The use of daftpunk for the audio tracks that actually sync up the action moments in the movie, to the sound effects of the grid, you are listening to as close to perfect as it gets. The Grid world is a character and a story by itself, that totally sucks you in. The acting of Sam Flynn played by Garret Hedlund was solid, but not Oscar worthy. His character wasn't very deep, and you can tell the script writing in regards to his character was too safe, not taking any risks. Like everyone has already mentioned, his chemistry with Bridges in the father/son bonding scenes were believable. The acting of Jeff Bridges as Kevin Flynn, the return protagonist from the first Tron was a mixed bag. I personally think Bridges the actor did excellent considering he had to play three characters in the same movie(old Flynn, young Flynn, Clu 2.0). Bridges was able to differentiate his characters quite convincingly, with each having their own distinct personalities. In the same breath, the writers/director must have influenced Jeff Bridges' spiritual 'dudeness' because he reminded me too much of the dude from the Big Lebowski as the older Kevin Flynn. Old Kevin seemed to like to say the words 'man, radical, dude, and chi' a lot in the dialogue. Whether that was Bridges just kind of freelancing his character or the writer/director telling Bridges that he needed to be the dude, I don't know. In any case, the big Lebowski was taking me away from the world of the grid. The plot lines in the movie were generic and felt borrowed from other movies. Tron Legacy left out too many questions and plot lines in relation to the original Tron. For one, where was Tron? Spoiler alert: The movie is called Tron, where the heck was he? It would have been better to leave Tron out of the movie entirely then throw him in half heartedly at the end. Its a cool little surprise, but the movie was already over at that point, and the Tron action sequence that followed that was anti-climatic compared to the other action sequences. What little screen time Tron gets (when you finally realize who he is) he doesn't show any personality or physical traits (his face is covered by a shielded helmet)that the audience can relate to. When Tron actually does anything that differentiates himself, Tron speaks, and says, ""I fight for the users."" If I didn't already know he says that in the first Tron, I wouldn't have heard what he said. The writers / directors did a poor job of using the Tron character. Obviously, the movie wasn't about Tron, but about the relationship between Sam Flynn and Kevin Flynn, but if they were going to introduce the character Tron, they should have done it right. The last disappointment is only slightly disappointing, and it was the CGI Clu 2.0 young Jeff Bridges. The CGI work itself is breathtaking, leading to the perfect visual score rating, but the awkward jaw and lip motions (facial animations) don't line up with that of an actual persons expressions. In a still image, you can't tell the difference between an actual picture of Jeff Bridges in 1982 and the CGI model of Clu 2.0.I know there was a lot of nitpicking in this review, but the preview of this movie, and the pedigree behind it, made this the most anticipated movie release ever for me. The trailers have been everywhere for over a year, and the visual flare always ups the hype factor. The other problem this movie runs into is that it is released a week after the best movie of the year, Inception, was released on Blu Ray. With all those obstacles going against Tron, the movie almost lived up to the hype anyways.

415,Arashikage2,Tron: Legacy (2010). Unrelated to Tron (1982).,4,7 March 2011,"This is a movie about a bad guy wanting to conquer the world and the good guys trying to save it. If you think you know how the script will play out you are right, it will play out exactly like that. In contrast, in Tron, Master Control program was already controlling the world in the beginning of the movie and I at least, couldn't imagine how everything would end up.First of all: Tron is in this two hour movie titled with his name for two minutes. Second: The techno-religious if I may say undertone of Tron is absent. Third: No awesome, hack the planet, Master control program. Fourth: It doesn't make sense in the realm's rules. I'm sure some other reviewer will be happy to list us all the gaps in logic and plot holes so I will not go in to that. Fifth: The whole premise if I may say is based on Ghost in the cell (1995), especially the ending. Sixth: I find it extremely unlikely that after his adventure in Tron, Flynn would remain silent about everything that happened. And about the laser ending up in his basement. There are too many people involved and its way to important technology for that.Now, as a stand alone movie the SFX are great, the best reason to see this movie. I hated the choreography though. It has some good action moments and some good dialog. But the problem is that some scenes break the atmosphere of a digital world. The acting and directing is average I can say, neither bad nor revolutionary. The product placement is very blunt and persistent but I suppose it can't be helped in such a big budget movie. When it comes down to it I do recommend watching this for the experience alone. But it left me with a feeling of pointlessness and I immediately proceeded to watch Tron, were it left me with a feeling of that's what the future might bring. One star for the cyberbike fight, one for the wardrobe, one for Bruce Boxleitner's short appearance and one for The CGI.",TRON - Legacy
416,gidget234,Tron is not for everyone,3,26 December 2010,"This is speaking from the viewpoint of someone who has never seen the original: Tron (2010) is all about the glitz and glamour. There's tons of bright lights, cool toys, and pretty girls. It's your typical sci-fi movie. Since the film is mainly focused on the visuals, the story loses out and the outcome is a recycled, lackluster storyline about revolution and us vs. them.The acting is nothing to rave about. At times it's melodramatic but I guess that's what you get for a heavily CGIed film. However, Michael Sheen did stand out as Castor/Zuse. He was barely on screen but for the short time he was, he gave his character life and vivacity. He created a character that was interesting and had a back-story.3D. At the beginning of the film, they tell you that only parts of the film will be in 3D, AKA. the gaming part. Tron is not a 3D movie. It's a movie that was made and then the word 3D was attached to it. Yes, it's one of those movies.Overall, nostalgic fans of the original and sci-fi lovers will adore this film.

417,samuel-legassick,Should Tron Leave The Legacy As It Is? I Hope Not ...,8,30 December 2010,"Whole review and more at www.thewildbore.c*mAfter reviewing the Tron Legacy soundtrack and the Tron Evolution tie-in game, finally here is the review for Tron: Legacy - and it certainly is a Merry Christmas for one and all.Before starting to delve into The Grid and it's inhabitants, I have to start by saying I've always been a huge Tron fan. As a kid, I would often pick up Tron again and again to watch over and over and has always had a special place in my heart, so when the initial concept footage for Tron 2 was released, you could imagine my excitement. Since then, I've been cautious not to get too over-excited. Sure the trailers look incredible, Daft Punk (whom I adore) were signed on to do the music, Jeff Bridges was going to do it, it was going to be 3D and also in IMAX. I had to bestill my beating heart that every time I get over-excited about a film, it very often disappoints and I didn't want that to happen here. Not to Tron. Please.As readers know, I didn't rate the game very highly but Daft Punk's score got top marks (both reviews can be found on the right hand side or on Youtube's 'thewildboretv' channel) and once the film was released it got some very mixed reviews but I tried my best to keep out of it until I'd seen the final product myself, which was in centre seats at Waterloo's IMAX by the way.If you don't know already, Tron Legacy takes place after the events of Tron (but not Tron 2.0 - the PC game for those non-geeks) where Kevin Flynn is taking advantage of being able to enter digital space by playing God and creating his own world. However, random beings, pieces of code or whatever they are, called ISO's have turned up and inside them could be the answers to the Universe, apparently. However, Flynn's 'supervisor' program Clu has a lot of ideas above his station and believes the ISO's to be imperfections and thus destroys them in The Purge (events of Tron Evolution). Kevin Flynn is banished and is hiding out with the beautiful Olivia Wilde (Quorra). Meanwhile, Sam Flynn, heir to his father's company, is busy causing havoc and being a rebel in the real world until he enters The Grid where luckily all his extreme sports hobbies come in good use.Firstly the visuals are probably the best I've seen in anything, ever. It looks f*cking cool and is absolutely incredible to witness. The first time we see the Tron world, it's unlike anything I've ever seen before. In this respect, the 3D-ness (is there a word for it?) works perfectly and it's the best use of 3D effects I've seen yet, and yes that's including Avatar. However, there is one massive flaw and I've seen it crop up time and time again in reviews - and that's the young Jeff Bridges as Clu. It simply doesn't work. It looks like Tom Hanks from The Polar Express or something, it is clearly animated and really stands out as he stands next to real people. It's a shame that technology has come leaps and bounds but actors don't have to worry, because recreating actual people won't be an issue for a while. It's a shame because it takes away from the rather dramatic scenes rather than adding to it. ......For rest of review please go to www.thewildbore.c*m",TRON - Legacy
418,Justint0815,Things Got Creepy When Bridges Runs Into ... BRIDGES!!!!!,7,11 February 2011,"""The Grid, a world of endless possibilities. More Beautiful and dangerous than I ever imagine."" Sorry to interrupt Jeff Bridges but I will like to warn you about the dangers you are about to take after you finish you talk with your son Sam Flynn and my review. You a character named Kevin Flynn in a big film called Tron: Legacy (I call it TR2N) a sequel to the original 1982 cult film. It starts with your talk (the one I interrupted) with your son Sam Flynn about your creation called The Grid. You come back to your arcade and in your son's point of view, vanished (or killed, or buried alive but you already been through that (shutters)). 20 years later, Sam Flynn as an adult (don't ever let me get started on how he grown up without you) went looking you you and Blam went into The Grid, the place you been trapped in for 20 years (don't worry you aged but your program did and you ran into him at the end (hence my tittle it got creepy)). How did you got trapped Bridges, your creation Clu2 turned against you because of a species called ISOs (stand for Isomorphic algorithms). Anyway Clu2 runs into Sam, almost killed him in a Light Cycle match, saved by the last ISO named Quorra, and at the end, you and the other Bridges pixalated. I had you admitted, I was entertained like Snoopy meeting Garfield in a mirror on a Monday, but you have your flaws. You have dazzling 3D visuals and score (both snubbed the the Academy Awards) but your weak script didn't known where to put the plot. The result was an uneven band of a father and son making out with a well balanced script with stronger character. So go ahead Bridges, do the story and get pixalated at the end, I don't care because I'm already busy writing a letter to the Oscars to make a special award for it's visuals and it's electric score, but don't say that I didn't warn you. Bye Jeff Bridges and say hello to Quorra for me if you have a chance.",TRON - Legacy
419,timo-hellmund,A highly underrated movie,9,23 August 2011,"As an old TRON fan, I had to see this at opening weekend. So I did (started 1/27 here).The visuals of the classic TRON were very well captured and transfered to modern standards. The more cute and colorful look morphed to a grown up and darker setting. I liked that since the grid was created 20 years ago. Plus, the CGI was brilliant. Same with the score by Daft Punk. Holy sickness, this is amazing! I wonder why it is not nominated for an Oscar. What a shame! Its powerful, thrilling, makes the film better.The characters are flat. OK! I totally agree to the critics. However, the overall story is not bad! It is way above sci-fi average with some in between tones and stuff. It is never as predictable as Avatar.The references to the original TRON (e.g. the Bits on the fireplace) were nice and the disc wars and the light cycle race made me feel nostalgic, which was awesome. The CGI was just amazing.I agree, Legacy really misses some potential in story and telling but they can proof to make it better in TRON 3. And some questions still have to be answered.It is not the directors or actors fault that Legacy is bad in critics opinion. They just did expect way too much. They totally underrated this movie. After watching it on BluRay again, even the LOST writers did a decent job. The whole world of TRON is brilliant. Do not forget that despite some flat characters!The weak story sequence at Flynns hiding hole actually is none. It was just destroyed in 3D theaters by the massive action before and after... and maybe by the crunching popcorn around. If you look closer and have the silence of your living room, you see that the plot is not as bad as you remember it from cinema. Even the ISOs are explained somehow.I cannot believe why this movie only got 49 / 100. It is better than that. It is good and maybe the best, and of course most original, live action film from Disney in years.Legacy is a worthy sequel to TRON and every fan must see it and needs to buy the BluRay to make another sequel possible. This movie deserves it, like it deserves a better TRON 3.",TRON - Legacy
420,fahdupsidedown,An excellent execution on so many fronts!,10,2 November 2014,"The Tron franchise, in my opinion, is groundbreaking in terms of story line and concept. While the first was probably noted for revolutionary use of CGI, the second one actually has the depth required in a good sci-fi/fantasy movie. The set design is brilliant. The characters, even the minor ones, or the villain is sufficiently fleshed out. But the most important element of the story is the father/son relationship that comes across as being deep, significant, and sincere.Plus the ending is one of the most epic, glorious, and beautiful of any I have ever seen. The music, the colours, and the facial expressions during the last scenes are extraordinarily well weaved.",TRON - Legacy
421,thedarkknight-89,The Legacy Continues,10,18 March 2011,"Tron: Legacy is a beautiful film. For those who are fans of the original Tron (like me), I have this to say: Those who created this film, were fans as well. The utmost care was put into evolving what you saw in the original, into the New Grid. The story, the music, the characters and the world are all a natural evolution from Tron. In short, its a more than worthy sequel that continues the vision and the beauty of the original, and adds so much more.For those of you who have never been fans of Tron: This is a beautiful film. The story is a poignant one, filled with the emotion and feeling of deep characters. The effects are second to none. The music is unbelievable. This is a film that will delight almost anyone. Young, old, action fans, drama fans. It's usually a bad thing to say a movie has something for everyone, because if they've tried to hard, it's obvious and takes away from the film. But this one really does have something for everyone. It's an enjoyable, moving, fascinating story that leaves you with something profound, as well as wanting more.",TRON - Legacy
422,eJay17,Legacy of Terminator Salvation,4,26 December 2010,"There are some common things in Kosinski's movie and McG luckluster. They are simply beautiful shoted, nicely edited, they have a lot of good special effects, they contain scenes with younger version of well known actor. But...PROSperfect music Daft Punk did it well and I enjoyed it all the time design - it's truly awesome. the suits, cars, all these sets... wow! first 5 minutes - nice intro, good start for nonTron viewers Olivia Wilde and Beau Garrett Clu - sometimes creepy, CGI not so good, but it's the best character in this retarded movieCONS absolutely flat heroes, without charisma (even Bridges has poor dialogue lines) awkward script with massive stupidity and needless characters (Zuse) action scenes are...just fine, without any cool camera angles or surprise twists 3D is rather bad, I felt like on 2D movie all the time movie has really boring scenes (with bad dialogues) ending is just ...... up! And Clu was bad in it. Kosinski didn't even explore this universe, it feels so poor - Flynn house, stadium, part of the city, some rocks, train station..that's all. - I didn't feel crushed and punches into face by Tron Legacy.

I watch the blu-ray at least every 2 months. The lenses used to shoot some scenes were amazing, the scripts have soul, have meaning, the writers most definitely deliver.

425,desalvo_j,This Movie is a disgrace to the original Tron Movie,1,22 December 2010,"I have to say that I saw the 3D version and I hate to say it but this has to be the worst movie that I have seen this year, the visual effects are very bright very spectacular but that is it; If you are into light shows this is the movie for you; because that is all you'll get; if you wanted a movie with substance THIS IS NOT THE MOVIE FOR YOU; IT WAS THAT BAD AND I'm NOT KIDDING; I was stunned at just how stupid this movie was there is not and I mean no plot line Walt Disney has sunk to new lows; It was not worth the $11.00 per ticket to see this B Flick.The plot was terrible along with the acting; this movie lacked vision and substance you get pushed from one bad scene to another and it does make me sad to give this film a bad rap but it was not worth sitting through all of the bad acting just to see the light show and CG effects. It surly does not live up to the original vision of Tron and as a follow on film I would say don't waste your time and money because there are other films playing now that are worth both time and money",TRON - Legacy
426,matvej-kazin,Forget Avatar! TR2N is here!,10,20 December 2010,"So here is why I think some people didn't enjoy this movie as much as I did: 1.You didn't see it in 3D.You must see it in 3D! 2.You saw it while feeling uncomfortable either in a chair, placing or with people you came.Best to see it alone on a Sunday evening. ..And 3.You are a depressed human being who automatically finds flows in anything you overcome. I simply loved this movie. When I go to the cinemas, I choose my movies wisely.. I don't run straight for the tickets when I hear about some movie named 'Scott Pilgrim fights bullshit!'. I check IMDb, I do my research, simply just who the actors are, if there are any prequels, watch them, hype up on the trailers and then go to the cinema. Movie is not an apple for you to pick and just put your teeth into it. You gotta know what kind you're eating. So I went on a Sunday evening in a half empty lounge where I could choose the perfect sit. I made myself comfortable. Shut my iPhone4 down and got ready. Man oh man.. This is a pure piece of art of our generation. So stunning. And the music? GOOD LORD! When the bass started to hit my eardrums I wanted to born a baby in that moment.(I'm a man) Storyline was flawless, actors was flawless, execution, production, every little detail just fit, simply fit perfectly. Finger-licking good! You can put your Avatar blue-ray disc in the trash. NOTHING comparing to this piece. Now if you are going to see this movie asap, then please oh god do NOT download it, because A.it will ruin the movie experience for you and B.you know.. for the good. Try to go alone, and be cool with it, make yourself really comfortable, buy a snack, warm clothing, spread your legs. And try to even see the old Tron some day before the cinema, it will give you the needed knowledge. Have fun and don't think about it. Enjoy! :)",TRON - Legacy
427,Nus5,"ye, plot is thin, but the rest is awesome",10,2 January 2018,"Call it thin or generic Disney plot, at the end, it is nice film, with great visuals, Jeff Bridges who can deliver even the cheesiest line sovereignly, or the killer soundtrack. It was my criticism back when it came out, that it could have been so much better. Thing is though, it probably wouldn't have made its money being ""too gritty"" or ""too complicated"". It's the hard truth after all; those types rarely receive the commercial success it needs to spend the money. But times changed (a bit). I'd love for it to be a Netflix/HBO series maybe. Wouldn't that be something?Anyway, i can still enjoy it now more than 7 years ago. I'm just grateful we got one, i guess. Seeing as a 3rd is out of question, at least for now, here's to hoping they do explore what is an original and fascinating universe at one point before i die (or the planet). It would be shame if it went to waste.",TRON - Legacy
428,kennyggavin,Perfection,10,11 June 2013,"** Spoiler Alert** Tron : Legacy (2010)The most visually appealing film in my 35 years!!!. As a kid growing up I loved the original Tron (1983) and when I heard of a sequel I was highly intrigued. After seeing that Tron: Legacy had a budget of $200million I was even more excited to see what we all had in store for us.It was cold Sunday Morning and I decided that today would be the day for me, my wife, and my two kids to partake in a 3D visual experience. Im totally serious when I say that Tron 2 in 3D is not just a movie but an event. With the awesome heart pumping adrenaline sounding endorphin releasing music of Daft punk we were all drawn into the most amazing time we have ever been part of at a cinema. Alright, I have said enough for the visuals and audio of this movie, so lets talk about the acting. AS always Jeff Bridges did not disappoint and Garrett Hedlund who is a new comer to me did a perfect job as the Sam Flynn Hero. Im a motorcycle enthusiast so the chase scene at beginning of the movie brought back good memories of ridin fast through the city when I was younger. I mean we got motorcycle chase scenes, base jumping off of city skyscrapers, computer hacking into corporate mainframes, and thats all before the real action starts. Once Sam Flynn enters his fathers arcade the music turns to Journey and Eurythmics, then upon entering ""The Grid"" this film turns into pure eye candy and makes you wish that it was all really possible to enter a video game. What we have here is visually stunning Cyber world Gladiatorial games that include Light Bike, Killer frisbee/boomerang games and just plain FUNOlivia Wilde enters the scene with great acting and acrobatic fight sequences and then a younger Jeff Bridges (CLU) takes over with more realism than the 1983 version. I could go on for pages and pages about how Great this movie was , I have seen this movie probably 60 times on my Blu-Ray player, LED TV and surround sound ( not bragging, just saying the better your equipment the better this movie and sound are)............. Bottom line is this movie is perfect",TRON - Legacy
429,jrwilson7,A great Sequel...or is it a remake?,9,1 January 2011,"Tron: LegacyTron: Legacy, the sequel to the original Tron movie released in 1982 lives up to its predecessor in all its glaring neon glory. With stunning visuals (especially in3D) which pay respectful homage to the original and a rocking, rave-like soundtrack (courtesy of 90's house band Daft Punk) the film transports you back to the ""grid"", a computer platform of stark, geometrical simplicity where users and programs pit themselves against each other in a series of ""games"" designed to wipe each other out.The original Tron was groundbreaking in almost every aspect of its production and while there may not be much groundbreaking occurring in Tron: Legacy, you will be dazzled by its sheer brilliance of bright neon lights and almost impenetrable scale. The film really is Disney's flagship for its future in 3D.The story itself is fairly basic. Sam enters the Grid which has been taken over by CLU who has imprisoned his father Kevin and is building an army to rule the world. Sam must convince his father to return home and save both worlds. There's some nice exposition that helps to build the events of the missing years that fits in well to the overall story, but the premise is a tried and true formula that we have seen plenty of times before. Yet you don't seem to notice how simple it is behind all the eye popping visuals and mind altering sound track! It would have been nice to see the writers scratch the surface a little more with the characters and their motivation, but in all honesty, if you are a fan of the original, you are going to be happy with a basic storyline.And the point is that it's the visuals that you're going for, not the story. Like Avatar, Legacy is all about enjoying the feast for your eyes rather than the food for your brain, and where Tron gave us light-cycles that left a blaze of light in their wake like a highlighter was spewing ink behind them, Legacy offers you the same thing – only better! Instead of ""straight"" lines, the light cycles give off a beam of color that has a fluidity and life to it that you can only imagine the original creators would have wished for.Every color represented is a bright neon or stark white and stands out against the black, lifeless backdrop of the city which has grown into a sprawling metropolis. The assumption the viewer needs to make is that as with any computer platform that evolves to become bigger and better than the one before, so too has the Grid and where once a landscape of squares and geometrical shapes existed, now a sunning vista exists.What is impressive is the addition of new vehicles and new concepts on how they work. The Light Cycles that were a staple of the original return with renewed conceptual design which sees the bike and user become one with each other. Not to give much away, but the idea behind how the user ""enters"" the vehicles is quite a unique idea.Daft Punk electrify our ears with a retro/futuristic beat of synthesizer music as a soundtrack. It is said that the duo share a similar obsession about the original Tron movie and that the soundtrack to the film has inspired them. Who else better then, to make a pure electro soundtrack the heartbeat of this film? It's even fitting that they have a decent cameo appearance.Performances in the film are OK, nothing Award-worthy, but Brit actor Michael Sheen is the stand out as Zuse, a futuristic version of David Bowie (on crack). Worthy of applause though is director Joseph Kosinski who helmed a massive film of enormous proportions – and has never directed a film feature film. Disney trusted him with $200 million of their money to build and create the new world of Tron and help launch them into the 3D stratosphere.As said earlier, Tron"" Legacy is a feast for your eyes, not for your mind. Don't go in expecting much, but you might leave looking forward to the future.",TRON - Legacy
430,crazycoaster_kid99,Consider it a HUGE improvement on the original's effects.,7,15 September 2011,"The storyline of this movie was similar to that of the original's. But although the first ""Tron"" wasn't bad, ""Tron: Legacy"" was better in almost every way. Upgraded effects, better acting, more ""in-your-face"" type action moments. The only downside? Half the twists were predictable. But even though you'll be correctly guessing who's who, and what's gonna happen next, it's really a great movie. A few other things to note. One is that this is a good movie because you really don't have to see the original to know what's happening here - though there are some jokes that you'll only get if you've seen the original. The whole idea of Clu being evil, and Kevin Flynn being the one who created him, was pretty clever. And I never expected Tron to go bad, then become good in the end! It's a perfect improvement for those who watched the first ""Tron"", and a really good new experience for people that are just getting interested in the franchise. Wanna watch it? I say go for it.",TRON - Legacy
431,hanz12891,Could have been so much better,7,17 August 2014,"God, I wish Tron: Legacy had better script and characters. Because if it did, it would've been a modern day masterpiece. Apart from those two things, nearly everything in this film is super top notch. Starting with the visuals. CGI has been done to death in many ways by other movies, but nothing like this. The world of the Grid is both technically and artistically beautiful. A digital world with a dark color pallet lit by shimmering glows of neon lights. This is one of the best looking movies I've ever seen. I give it extra merit for being creative and imaginative.And don't even get me started on the soundtrack. Whoever made the decision to get Daft Punk to compose Tron's music deserves an award for the best decision making of the decade. Their electronic techno style score fits this movie like a glove. It makes sense to have it for this kind of movie. Combine that with the visuals, and Tron is incredibly immersive....except, when the characters come on screen.Jeff Bridges is a great actor, but he just doesn't have much of a good script to work with. He tries to deliver it as best he can, and gives a good performance nonetheless. The real problem is nearly everybody else. The main protagonist and Olivia Wilde aren't that great either. Most of the dialogue is just tedious plot explanation. There's also a painful lack of good humor. There are very few character moments, but they just fall falt. It seems like this movie got so obsessed with creating a digital world, that it forgot to work on it's human element.But that is all worth bearing, because like I said, this is a stunning visual experience. I bought this movie on BluRay and I never regretted it.",TRON - Legacy
432,Shon R.,"Visually Arresting, Dull Film",5,9 January 2011,"My summary line up there says it all. While I didn't expect a whole lot in terms of plot or character development when I went the theater, I did at expect some action--the trailers and ads make it look like an action movie, after all. And at first, there was a good bit of action (and here is the only spoiler I'll give), what with the young Flynn rather unnecessarily stealing computer secrets, but as soon as he enters the matrix, er, I mean, the grid, things start to drag. The action scenes are sporadic, and since I have no emotional investment in the characters, I didn't really care if they lived or died. The best I can say of the film is that both the sound and visual effects are great. At two solid hours long, it's a surprisingly boring flick, and I'd have a hard time recommending it.",TRON - Legacy
433,pizzagoodgogo,I don't understand the bad reviews.,10,3 July 2021,I am a visual effects enthusiast. How am I seeing reviews that talk about this movies poor graphics. The graphics in this movie still hold up today. You can argue the young Jeff bridges looks uncanny. But when has a vfx like that worked other than blade runner 2049. There are some some issues with this movie. But I love this movie and I don't really care about it's minor problems. THE MUSIC IS OUT OF THIS WORLD.

434,youbigbluemonkey,Loose yourself in the virtual world,8,24 December 2010,"Atmospheric is perhaps the best word i can use to describe this film, the dark moody lighting broken only by the neon lit stripes of the two factions serve to immerse you in a distinctly oppressive digital mirror of our own world.There are films where special effects take centre stage, luckily for the most part this is not the case, the cgi effects in this, aside from a few matrix style slowmo scenes are simply used and tossed to one side to give the impression that what you see is the norm and not the extraordinary. That said the cgi is wonderful as takes on its own character of the film.The acting is straight forward and doesn't detract from the story but don't expect anything memorable aside from maybe a few lines and scenes. The same can be said for the story itself, there's not much depth to it, its a straight forward good guys vs bad guys kinda film with all that entails. But the pace and style of the story don't need anything more than that, they suit each others needs well and produce a wonderful film to just sit back and cheer for the good guys.A mention must be given to Daft Punks soundtrack which is simply spot on for this kinda film, you couldn't find a more perfect match.There is enough at the end to leave open a sequel and i hope that comes true though at the end it can wrap up nicely as finale to the tron story quite nicely too.",TRON - Legacy

437,x-ramubay,Major Fail if you didn't prepare by watching TRON 1 first.,10,15 December 2010,"First a few comments before my review of the film. I noticed in the other reviews and fan sites that those that saw part 1 understood part 2 much better, those that didn't see part 1 just threw a tantrum that they didn't need to and that couldn't possibly be the reason they didn't understand the plot...though at the same time thought there was no plot....how does that happen? Simply put, if you tear a book in half and only read the second half you're going to miss stuff, don't complain about it, you missed it, YOU YOU YOU, it's YOUR fault, not the movie. And NO NO NO the video game is not TRON ONE and is NOT the movie. How dumb to state you missed part one but you made it up by playing the video game. No! TRON: LEGACY requires knowledge of the first film, tough if you didn't see it but you didn't do your homework, major fail. This wasn't a remake, it was part two, Jeesh. You little mini-brain black holes don't deserve this film. Everyone had plenty of time to find a copy of the original, you had decades, entire lifetimes for most of you. And Disney bent over backwards to make it 3D because they knew they couldn't draw in the morons without 3D, but that's the problem, morons!!!!! MORONS!!!!! They don't deserve this film. They don't.

438,robertheinrich73,extremely entertaining despite some minor flaws,9,22 December 2010,"As this movie has already received more than 200 reviews, there is not really much to add. But because I am really grateful that Disney decided to produce a worthy sequel for a great classic movie (which did not get the attention it deserved for being one of the very first cyberspace movies, I think), I feel the urge to write some comments anyway.Well, decades passed since the original TRON. While everybody will understand why classics like STAR WARS get resurrected after many many years, TRON: Legacy will have surprised many, if not most, old fans. Yes, I understand that over the last few years there have been some teasers, but nevertheless the final product hitting the cinemas felt like some kind of unexpected yet beautiful Christmas gift.I have read most of the other reviews, and most of them agree on the obvious points:*** stunning CGI (3d graphics) Hey, it's 2010 - would you have expected less, from a giant producer like Disney?*** great soundtrack Well, this is a point worth commenting on. Everyone expects that the soundtrack for big budget movies is not too bad. But DAFT PUNK did more than a satisfying job - they did great! Most of the soundtrack reminded me of the good old times of C64 SID music (on purpose I guess). This was really a surprise - you wouldn't hear anything like that nowadays except maybe at some meetings of retro tech demo scene fans. A perfect fit, underlining TRON with an homage to the good old times of computer game music, when ingenious artists like Rob Hubbard squeezed amazing tunes out of tiny analog sound chips.*** nice story The story of TRON:Legacy could be reduced to ""son searches for long lost father, joyous reunion is challenged by evil being, challenge is overcome -> happy ending"". But, again surprising for a family friendly main stream label like Disney, there is far more to that. One of the reviewers even compared the protagonists to Shakespearean characters. This movie travels into unexpected depths, and leaves the consumer who just went for trivial entertainment by nice optics and sound wondering about the future of the human race.And this is why I want to thank Disney for this movie... It could have been so much worse and lame. It could have been for kids only, thrilling them while satisfying their parents so they don't get bored too much - like many other Disney flicks. But this one went another way - your offspring will enjoy the effects, understand most of the story, but YOU will be the ones who are startled by subliminal issues (as I was).Hmm, I checked the ""contains spoilers"" box, so now I want to disagree with some of the people who criticized this movie: (until now people who did not watch the movie are safe, but if you want to watch it without knowledge and prejudices, you better stop reading this review)one reviewer said that it was ridiculous that the appearing virtual characters had earth-like late 80's or 90's appearance (especially haircuts) instead of a perfect, digital one. And, that the protagonist's father using language like ""radical, man"" would not fit into the TRON universe.I dare to contradict. First of all you must consider, the creator of the presented universe got stuck in there in the late 80's. It makes perfect sense to me that the female programs wear tight latex suits and use digital hairspray.Also, with nobody telling him that it was lame to comment on startling events with phrases like ""Hey dude, that's radical"" with ""hey, we don't talk like this anymore"" - how would he know? How would he learn other phrases, being stuck inside a system with no input from the outside world? But there are some minor flaws I would like to mention:first thing that comes to mind is the fight scene at EOL bar... it was too chaotic, therefore not really entertaining. Why didn't they hire a good choreographer? While the scene fulfills its purpose (heavily injure Quorra, steal the disc from Kevin), most bar fights from a random western or eastern movie do better in presentation. Also, after the fight Flynn yells at the deactivated Quorra ""I will help you baby!"" - not really in character, I think.why would Kevin have aged inside a digital world? Yes, of course, to make it easier to relate to him as human, and to be able to distinguish him from CLUE - understandable yet illogical.the gladiator stuff - why? Yes, it's part of the original TRON universe - but we are told a few times that the grid was designed to be a perfect world, a perfect society. Monarchy and gladiators don't really fit into my visions of a perfect society - do I get something wrong?other users: in the opening scene Kevin tells his son, that the grid is now a place where programs and users can coexist peacefully. Yet he (and decades later his son) are the only users who are actually present. What happened to the others? Are there others at all? Also, the role of Kevin is a bit confusing... in the original TRON he was ""only"" a user, fighting against the system. In LEGACY he is called the creator, and we are told that the GRID is his design.But all these are minor glitches in a really good movie. And I am silently hoping there is a director's cut which will explain some of the unresolved stuff. And yeah, a sequel would be nice, but please don't let us wait another 3 decades for it! :)",TRON - Legacy
439,kapiniaris,Not a bad at all,7,27 December 2010,"Tron legacy...,when I first heard about it,I expected just another ""snatch"".However I was wrong,the special effects are amazing and there is a lot of action in the movie keeping you no bored at least...!!!The whole movie is cold,dark and it never lights up until the end of the story and as a matter of fact this gives the film a great atmosphere.Those who love science-fiction films like Matrix will find this movie gorgeous.On the other hand the plot is weak and predictable while the characters are not so well developed and this is undoubtedly a main disadvantage for a movie to be remembered for years.Nevertheless, in my opinion, Jeff Bridges is doing his part very well and this gives somehow a prestige to the movie.Never mind this movie may not be a masterpiece but is surely a good reason to go to the cinema and have fun during on Christmas days",TRON - Legacy
440,FreshOne10,Brilliant film; if it doesn't make the studio's targets it's because of horrible Marketing,9,19 January 2011,"This movie is extremely well done. It stays true to the original and dovetails in an intelligent and engaging way.The writing is solid and is refreshingly intelligent. There is no dumbing down of things, and you wouldn't find the actors mouthing off all that is going on to spoon-feed the audience. The plot is intricate, but not confusingly so... though you have to pay attention throughout. This is not a movie to watch when you are tired or sleepy.The acting is above average for the most part. In this type of film, the subject matter does not lend itself to what we would consider stellar performances, simply because most of the 'cast' are not humans, and for those that are... the acting range required per character is not broad.The pace of the movie is excellent. It doesn't take long for the action to start and the movie moves along at a nice clip, well punctuated by thoughtful dialogue, and dramatic action, with a sprinkling of tender moments... which are never overdone so as to be manipulative of the viewer.The graphics are splendid, and not excessive as in ""Look what we can do!"" The graphics suit the environment they are in. Do not expect the OMG imagery as in Avatar however.The music fits. Daft Punk does a good job with the electronic Music. The movie also has some good humour in it, but I'll leave you to discover two particularly good morsels.Now on to the ***SPOILER*** part: *STOP* if you are yet to see the movie.*** The marketing for this film is shoot-yourself-in-the-foot stupid: ***1. The main poster for the movie, gives away the ending of the movie. The drama, and tension in the last quarter of the movie was a fraction of what it could have been because... ""Oh yeah, the main poster shows Sam and Quorra in the beam at the end."" It's obvious then who makes it and I didn't see her with a damaged arm in that poster, so we know her arm gets restored. This poster is the equivalent of the original Star Wars movie having a poster with a large picture of the exploding death- star.If they thought that they needed to put a female on the poster, then they should have just put some shot of Sam and Gem. That would not be giving away the ending, and it would also make the public think that Sam and Gem are an item in the movie... and lead to some good surprises.And if people don't have a really good roller-coaster adrenalin rush from the movie... they don't tell their friends it was *great*, they say is was ""good.""2. I saw 'Disney' too much on promotional material. Disney for me means one thing: ""For Children!"". And this movie was anything but a typical children's movie. Yes, they may go and watch it and enjoy the visuals... but they would get 50% of what is there. The movie also provokes thought on things like: Free Software (as in the Free Software Foundation)Software companies releasing new versions of software with hardly any new features and bilking customers. Creation UtopiaHappiness and ContentmentSo, yes the franchise is owned by Disney, but it should have been marketed through some other entity... even if Disney created that entity themselves, or just use another studio. e.g. by Lion's Gate & Disney (even though Disney did everything.)3. Because the crew decided to properly honour the franchise and create a worthy film, it is just about mandatory to have seen the first film. To go see this film without having first seen TRON is like watching 'Dark Knight' without first seeing, 'Batman Begins'. But TRON legacy is 20+ years apart from TRON... so what would I do? I would have re- released a digitally remastered version of TRON *in cinemas* about 1 year prior. The tickets would have been say $3.50 instead of the regular $10. This, just to establish a very large base of people for the new version, who would be able to really understand and 'get' the new movie.* The Bad * There is just one bad thing in the script. Why would a minimum wage security guard risk his life by stepping onto that thing at the top of the building??! The intruder has no where to go... just call the police! That's why I gave the movie 9 out of 10.But again, hats off to the writers and director for making a great film. Thanks!",TRON - Legacy
441,michaelbauers,Excellent sequel,8,19 December 2010,"First off, not sure what people did not understand about the storyline. Made sense to me, anyway.If this was not a sequel, I think I would give it 7/10. Because it's a sequel which did not disgrace the original, I bump it to 8/10.I was not bothered by some of the quibbling details some other people seemed fixated on. I was too busy enjoying it.I like a sequel which connects well to the original. I feel they did an exceptional job with that here. Loved that they used the original Flynn arcade for example.While the philosophical aspects of the film are not particularly deep, I think they touched nicely on some ideas, and it did give the movie depth.Unlike people who think maybe Bridges did not do a great job, I was very much moved by his performance. He was very dynamic. OK, maybe some of his language was more 70s surfer than 80s techno geek. I guess they were trying to present a laid black Californian Zen explorer. It worked OK.Olivia Wilde very much held my attention. What can I say, she's very pretty and I think did a nice job.Almost all acting was good, almost all dialog was good.Of course we expect good visuals. Light cycle scene was cool, for example. I was most interested in the set they used for Kevin Flynn's residence. I was quite taken with it. Some nice work there The visuals were less important to me than the story, especially it's capability of extending the original movie. I very much felt they did a nice story, and extended the original movie (which I am a fan of...it was than I remembered when I watched it again not long ago.)",TRON - Legacy
442,janichsan-1,"Makes no sense, a paper-thin plot, visually impressive – a worthy sequel",8,31 January 2011,"Let's be honest: the original Tron made absolutely no sense, had a pretty stale and thin plot and only became a cult because of its revolutionary use of CGI and its impressive visual style. Tron: Legacy is no different. The whole premise still is idiotic and the plot repeats in large parts the predecessor while being full of gaping holes and illogical things that you better don't try to wrap your head around.And you know what? I don't care. The movie is entertaining and simply a feast for the eyes. Of course, it's far from being as revolutionary as the original Tron – CGI landscapes are a staple nowadays, as much as 3D (even though the 3D is top notch). Nevertheless, the movie is very stylish and – what's more – is full of beautiful images, that often remind of classic paintings in their composition, which alternate with breathtakingly choreographed action sequences.Despite all the visual effects, the actors' performances aren't overwhelmed. The characters are memorable and, surprisingly, even show some depth. My only gripe is that the digitally de-aged Jeff Bridges as Clu doesn't quite manage to come out of the uncanny valley.While I have to admit that I'm not a fan of Daft Punk, their music fits greatly to the movie and does a lot to set the mood and atmosphere.All in all, Tron: Legacy is not a very intelligent movie, but it's fun and simply impressive.",TRON - Legacy
443,ProfessorKaos64,A superb follow up amidst the trash remarks of current Hollywood fanfare,10,17 December 2010,"Disclaimer: I saw this in IMAX 3D, so your experience with some things may be different.That out of the way, let me start but saying, wow, just wow. From execution to presentation this was a blast. Will it win over non-tron fans? Probably not. Don't think your significant other will love it despite you dragging them there. This is a movie for the geek at heart, the sci fi nerd in all of us. For me it was an easy Transition from the original Film.Your don't need to watch the first film to get the gist of this film. Just about all the core elements are thrown at you, but watching the first film will most definitely not only put you in the mood, but help you to understand Flynn's vision on a more focused scale, sans explosive special effects of today's time. That said, it is one hell of a ride. As far as staying true to the original Tron they kept some core elements, things that really mattered and expanded on others bringing a nice cohesive stitch together on a great saga. I hardly believe some purists will cry foul at some of the new redesigns of vehicles, new locations and methods of getting around the Grid itself. Most of the main characters are present, C.L.U. , Flynn, and yes Tron himself. The supporting cast is magnificent, with newfound character Quorra fitting right in. Her character is most interesting in her naive attempts to understand the ""human/user"" way of life. I liked, for the most part, how the new director treated the Tron world, not destroying key concepts but expanding on them. Fans should not be disappointed.The visuals themselves are outstanding. You will find out of this world ambient lighting effects, impressive CGI, and if you saw the 3D or 3D IMAX showing, some incredible 3D elements. Don't go into the film expecting 3D everywhere, and this is a good thing. They keep the normal scenes for the most part 2D and the neat actions scenes in 3D. The lightcycle races and hand to hand combat visuals were superb. They really could have not done a better job capturing the essence of Tron, pulling you into a world of computer circuits. Tron Legacy's biggest strength is it's hidden philosophy / religious aspect. While this will remain hidden to many, its a key part of the movie. The first film got the core philosophy right, but with technical flair or ""this is my goal, this is computing, and this is Tron"", but in this film there is more of a sense of a ""higher power"", with concepts of death, life, greed, revenge, and more spiritual concepts flushed into the movie. Take Flynn's meditations in the movie, and how he ""connects"" with the world. There is deep meaning to be said of Tron / The Grid and how the film tries to show us how that world is not just very connected to the programs and users in it, but to the real outside world as well, as evidenced by Quorra in the end of the film.Overall I was very impressed with this film, and if you haven't seen the original , do so. You may laugh at its SFX, but its part of this ""Legacy"" this film is built on, and was very ahead of its time, done at a time when Disney was doing hand drawn film cartoons. Very under appreciated then , and still is. But for any fan of this ""world"", Tron Legacy is a sure hit.-Mikey D",TRON - Legacy

445,curtydc,Tron is back!,10,21 December 2010,"First, let me start by saying any negative review you may have heard about this film is completely full of poop! Now that I have that out of the way let me tell you why this movie is great, and why you should go see it now! Tron Legacy is every bit as impressive for this day and age as Tron was back in the 80's. The impressive digital world, cool and sexy sci fi outfits, futuristic technology, and intense video game scenarios that make you wish they were real! However this time around, the action is turned up to the highest level and the music is tuned perfectly for each scene. If you enjoyed the first movie, you'll recall that it wasn't a great movie because of its acting or 1 liners, but for its revolutionary science fiction computer world, and the way it brought video games to life, and the quirkiness of its main character Flynn. The same can be said about Tron Legacy, but in all fairness, the acting, plot, and characters are all miles ahead of 80's Tron.Come into this movie expecting cool action sequences, a great soundtrack, and top of the line CG effects. I guarantee you'll leave the movie liking the characters (even the bad guys!), liking the story, liking the world and wanting more! Disney, please give us another sequel, but this time around don't let it come 28 years later!",TRON - Legacy

448,SpartanIII,I LOVED This Film,8,23 December 2010,"I saw the original Tron the night before my friends and I went to the Midnight Premier, and though the original was visually fascinating, I found the story line to be pretty moot.Tron: Legacy was completely different.The plot in this was much more in-depth and attempted to reach a wider audience than just programmers and let's be honest, nerds in general. There was a few more twists involved as well as better written dialog. I also enjoyed the decisions that the characters were forced to make, and the development it caused.The characters were believable in the sense that they weren't normal movie characters. Unless its a drama, characters in films always seem to be trying too hard to be relateable. They are really strong characters but with a terrible and at times pointless flaw that makes them susceptible to one form of weakness. But the characters in Legacy were only the characters they were meant to be, with no irritating weaknesses or stupid habits.The graphics were ground-breaking, which was a welcome similarity to the original Tron. The 3D was well done, and did actually take advantage of the format for reasons other than getting a few more dollars out of the box office, which is something I greatly appreciated as a patron.And finally, the score composed by Daft Punk was spectacular. There were definitely influences from Hans Zimmer but not the point it was irritating. Overall, I think Tron: Legacy surpassed the original, which is very rare were sequels are ever concerned, but very much welcomed.8/10",TRON - Legacy
449,Panther826,Somewhat Disappointing...,6,23 July 2011,"Tron Legacy give us an amazing visual effect. The concept is unique and presents something that never has been seen before on a big screen, especially those full body suits. However, its plot is too shallow and isolated, leaving me never wonder what's going to happen next. Another problem is one of its leading actors, Garrett Hedlund. I applauded when they chose someone unknown rather than big names and familiar faces, but the someone they chose, in my opinion, is a big mistake. He has no charisma or charm or both. Most of the time I felt like he was just reading off the script instead of living in the story. Jeff Bridges, however, gave his usual A+ performance. Without him, TL could have just been another borderline B movie. Let's hope the sequel will be better! 6 out of 10.",TRON - Legacy
450,adanathel,Good and pretty entertaining but it should be better....,7,5 February 2011,"I can safely say that i was extremely pumped up from the first time i saw the first teaser from this movie...I am such a fan of the original tron that I could not wait.For the same reason i was terrified that it could be so bad that would kill the legacy of the original tron. I mean Hollywood has a really bad tradition with sequels.Well the good news is that the movie was actually good. The bad news is that it could be so much better. No it ought be much better.I won't get to the technical details...I mean it is obvious from he trailer that in this aspect the movie is brilliant. Visually stunning, good cinematography and an unbelievable soundtrack. Daft punk were almost too great since i caught myself sometimes to just listening to the music instead of watching the movie. Which does highlight the movies weaknesses.The characters were pretty good also. Bridges was just awesome, as usual, as he let a few bits of the ""Dude"" to spill into the movie. Hedlund, although not that great, was more then adequate for his character. And Wilde(OMG she was beautiful) actually portrays a pretty strong character while on the same time managing to create a vulnerability that really compels you to want to protect her. Something like Fifth element's Leeloo but with a more subtle performance which is good.Now for the bad stuff. Well obviously the story... Although not bad it just did not go far enough to really interest you. And you could see the potential. The idea of the ISO's and the genocide, the constant chase for perfection and the betrayal of clu can make for a really deep and compelling story but the movie never really delivers.Instead the plot only scratches these things superficially. And the worst was how they wasted a character like Tron. OK granted that the actual main character is flinn in both movies but the damn series in named after this character. In the first movie the whole goal was for him to reach the I/O tower and he was essential for the resolution of the plot. Here he does almost nothing extraordinary until the end, which is really very predictable. And it is too bad since you see a great chance of good character development. The fact that he was captured and re purposed to serve Clu and how he struggles to escape from this through his relationship with with flinn could actually make for a pretty compelling story.It could easily be the main conflict of the plot instead of that between Clu and Flinn. Instead here he is treated like a second class support character...I mean come on...The movie is named after this character and that is the best they could think for him...It is a real shame...Anyway overall it is good and enjoyable but you can immediately realized the potential this movie wasted.Too bad. Still I don't see why any fan of the original could not find it at least a little entertaining.",TRON - Legacy
451,jdrockovich,An Awing Experience...,7,17 December 2010,"Tron: Legacy is truly a gem of a movie and milestone in CGI history. It takes the spirit from the first movie and adds updated and mesmerizing visuals that make the old Tron look like a rusty, unfinished Atari game. The storyline plays well from the original and the casting was spot on with pin point precision. Michael Sheen wasn't in this film for too long but he made a dazzling mark on the screen when it was finally his time to shine. His energetic and sporadically induced character made you hate and love him at the same time and actually gave Jeff Bridges a run for his money.Storyline: Kevin Flynn left his son Sam at a young age and due to his absence his son became a ravishing rebel teetering on the brink of the walls of his dad's flourishing and once highly respected company. After sabotaging the company's plan to oust out the idea of selling their new operating system for free Sam later finds out from his dad's old friend Alan that he was paged from his father's office that's been disconnected for 20 years.Sam goes to his dad's office only to find a hidden door built behind a TRON arcade game. Once in the room Sam finds a grimy looking desk that has gathered dust over the years. He wipes off the desk to reveal a touch screen keyboard and a few present menus. While trying to crack the password a machine activates behind him and shoots him into cyberspace where he then ends up knee deep in the gorgeous landscape that is his dad's very own virtual silicon valley.Sam is picked up by an already familiar vehicle and is chosen to play in the games with his own said objective to be survival. Once a cut on his arm proves his validation of being a user he is taken to a mystery figure that Sam mistakes for his dad. The impostor is none other than his dad's generated partner Clu who is convinced that with his father's data disc that he can enter the human world and rid it of his imperfections.Thoughts: Tron: Legacy did an amazing job of keeping you interested throughout the whole time length of the movie. Sure, near the end the dialogue lost some of it's chug and the young Kevin Flynn at the beginning of the movie wasn't realistically convincing enough to pass for the 1982 appearance of Jeff Bridges but the visuals and art direction were more than enough to balance out this ferocious and anticipated marvel.Rating: 8/10 Final Words: Lovers of the original seemed to enjoy this one to a great extent so if you're a proud follower or just person looking for mind numbing visuals then this should most definitely be on your holiday to do list.",TRON - Legacy
452,chrisboi2010,This is greatness!,10,20 December 2010,Tron: Legacy was an amazing film! Stunning visuals and a great soundtrack won me over in a heart beat.

453,paz9,Not geeksome enough,6,24 December 2010,"Great action and Father/Son drama, but other than a few ""grep"" and ""kill"" commands briefly flying by, there is not enough esoteric computer concepts to interest hard-core Tron-heads. I expected so much more with all that has been developed since 1982. They talk of a ""grid"" -- come on, that's power systems. Why not ""cloud"" as in ""cloud computing"". Where are the Google apps, ""search"" which is so ubiquitous now, firewalls, wireless, terabyte hard drives, memory sticks, streaming and connections into the multi-media world? I also found the quantum leaps in storyline a little too much to make, such as when Flynn & son simply vanquish the rouge programs without any new secret weapon or insight. And of course, the completely ridiculous feast of roast pig! WTF? Where did the food come from with ""no sun"" and why would a spiritual mediation practitioner be eating pork?

The visuals were fantastic and for once in a movie the 3D was put to good use and didn't take away from the overall effect of the film.The soundtrack was a perfect fit and really made you get into each scene and feel like you were in part of the action.Acting was pretty good but this is where my deduction from a perfect score comes in: the script. Some of the writing was just awful. I feel like the scriptwriters wanted to make their characters sound cool or modern by making them say things like, ""I'm not digging this, man."" or ""You're still rockin' it.""

I, wasn't born yet, when the original came out, and haven't seen it yet. Lucky for me there was a '101' video on the internet. So does 'Tron: Legacy' delivers. Let me try to answer that question. First of all, this is one of the biggest treat you can give your eyes. This movie looks superb. Together with Avatar from James Cameron 'Tron Legacy' is one of the best looking movies of this decade that i've seen. Now sound/Music. I dare to say that tron has the best soundtrack/sound you've heard this past few years. It is an enjoyment for the ears. Now The story. I try to not spoil anything. This is your typical good vs evil film. A mad character gone wild and it's up to the good guys to stop him. A side of that you got a second plot line.

457,Durbaq,Spoilers!The Opinion Hole: TRON Legacy,9,31 December 2010,"SPOILERS!A brief thought on the cinema experience, specifically the trailers. There were two trailers that liked to the ram the word 3D down the audiences' throats, be it Yogi Bear and Gnomeo and Juliet. In such a manner that resembles a child who is desperate to catch up with the bigger players by announcing it had the latest 'in thing', 3D. Onto the film itself, a few minutes in as soon as I saw a poster to Disney's 1970s flop The Black Hole I knew we would be in for a treat. Such an in-joke that almost says ""Yep, we made that but this is better and we learnt out lesson!"". The main character Sam Flynn was bland as you can get. A mere function of the plot perhaps, we need someone to take us into the world of Tron. In the time that grew up he took a page out of Batman's book by standing rooftops, jumping off them and coming across as a vigilante hacker. Reminded me more like Robin though. The main plot therein is Jeff Bridges' Kevin Flynn talking to himself as his clone Clu, but it's okay because this is Science- Fiction! Split-personality is tame compared to a world within computers. I was glad to see Bruce Boxleitner return as Alan Bradley though he seems to have also taken a page out of Christopher Nolan's Batman franchise. He plays into the anti-Rutger Hauer character in Batman Begins, while still sporting the same look. I even thought it was Rutger Hauer. The musical score by Daft Punk is the greatest goddamn score I have ever heard. It fits, it is (dare I say this) organic to the film's visual aesthetic and, when the plot slows down and starts to hit a few speed bumps the music keeps your mind from wandering.Michael Sheen's character was well he made me think of David Bowie circa Labyrinth doing an impression of Jim Carrey's Riddler from Batman Forever. I was grateful for his comic relief since Sam Flynn was about as interesting as sitting through someone else's wedding. Someone you don't like. Since I have seen the original a few times I more or less knew what to expect plot wise, it gave me great pleasure explaining the premise to my companion for that evening since her taste in cinema meant she was completely new to such pizazz. Whereas Michael Bay's Transformers films had the action set to stun, The world of The Grid was nicely colour coded to aid in our understanding of who is good (blue) and who is bad (red). Needless to say she like it.It might just be in our small part of the world where we saw the film, but there has been no kind of merchandise to this film that I can see. No action figures or toy vehicles. Unbelievable if this is the case when such a film features incredibly active concepts. I am surprised toy companies haven't jumped at the chance to make a hell of a lot of cash from the film. Does the original Star Wars toy controversy ring any bells? Speaking of Star Wars I liked the Millennium Falcon / Tie Fighter battle at the end of A New Hope reference, intentional or not. Along the lines of the female lead Quorra shouting ""Here they come"" to which Flynn senior tells junior to ""man the turret"" I was waiting for a ""don't get cocky kid"" pun that never came. I liked Clue doing a Christopher Lee as Saruman in that he assembles an army and gives a speech to them. I was disappointed that they didn't make a reference to the Master Control Program (the antagonist from the original film) or his User in the original film played by David Warner. That said I thought the references to the lore was very good and the film didn't get bogged down in establishing that which it came from. Nevertheless the film went full blown sequel setting at the end so I would imagine a follow-up is likely to follow. So then TRON Legacy. I loved it, it looked incredible, sounded incredible and the acting was nothing to be concerned about, apart from a dull lead. On the subject of 3D and this film, I read an article that likened it to The Wizard of Oz film of this current 3D generation. It said that like in the 1939 MGM musical which was famous for its transition from black and white into full-blown Technicolor which did a hell of a lot for colour in film. Tron Legacy did the same for 3D, more than Avatar did by actually doing the same effect. The film starts off in 2D, our world as it were and as soon as Flynn junior is put into the world of Tron or the Grid the film leaps into rather impressive 3D. Certainly made me appreciate the medium a lot more. The characters all have their own desires and it adds to the dimension of the film, no one really seems to be merely a plot function so that the story can advance. Flynn junior was just to dull to be a convincing leading protagonist. I can't wait for the follow-up, because there is a whole word to explore inside computers and in Legacy they only scratched the surface.",TRON - Legacy

The direction (certainly in 3D in the cinema) really feels rushed; its true this film failed to hold my attention for long periods but having a lengthy shot where a character being talked to is completely out of focus simply highlights the fact that 3D films using traditional shots (under the current technology) only really work when they're entirely CGI. As far as the Sound track goes; I am a fan of Daft Punk but certainly less so after this.

Sequels always have more to live up to than stand-alone films, and ""TRON: Legacy"" did not do its predecessor justice in continuing said legacy.The first movie took an original concept and really ran with it, from story to characters to costumes to computer generated landscapes. Everything looked, felt and acted like a different world. The programs had real-world user counterparts, had specific functions, and the whole world had a certain way things worked that was based on how computers work.""Legacy"" on the other hand, goes strictly for looks and rehashing the same kind of action sequences seen in other movies. The whole thing looks and acts too much like a techno version of the real world. Or like another version of The Matrix. The light cycles can jump over things now -- since when can you cross light trail barriers? There are aircraft and quasi-parachutes, but there's no sense that these things have a computer-related function, they just look cool and provide vehicles for the action. The programs presumably eat and drink and dance at nightclubs now. Michael Sheen is fun to watch, but his character and the whole nightclub scene was unnecessary. Even the names of the characters are more like real-world names versus computer-world names. Sorry, spelling ""Cora"" as ""Quorra"" and ""Zeus"" as ""Zuse"" for the credits doesn't count.Other problems with ""Legacy"" include glaring plot holes and unanswered questions. As a user, Flynn had to be the most powerful being on the Grid. How is it that he is forced to sit back and watch Clu take over everything? How did Clu change Tron into a bad guy? What really made the ISOs special, apart from appearing out of nowhere? The answer to all of those is to not let a coherent story get in the way of all the cool-looking action. The story mainly exists to piece together one action sequence to the next. Blatant emotional pieces concerning missing fathers, tyrannical dictators and genocide are dropped in to add some sense of story depth, and they do feel dropped in rather than developed in a meaningful way. The ISOs really only serve as a way to introduce the genocide angle and get love interest Quorra out into the human world, and Flynn must sit around so his son can come save him and have that father/son reunion. (Really, he never even tried to contact the outside world with his user powers?) It feels like they decided Tron had to be included somewhere since he was the titular character of the first movie, even though they had no use for him. His character needed more backstory and development in this film with the good-to-bad conversion, but they chose to give Bruce Boxleitner almost no dialogue (c'mon, he's doing voice-over, it's not like they had to CGI him young again like Jeff Bridges) and have Tron/Rinzler utter Predator-like sounds for most of his very few scenes in the film. He could have been the most interesting character in the film, and they practically threw him away. What a waste. Same for the story in general. There are so many different angles and ideas from the first movie that could have been explored in a new story, and they were all ignored in favor of looking cool. Maybe that's why Jeff Bridges as Flynn either doesn't want to get involved in this mess or tries to focus on his inner peace in the middle of the action.A big part of the charm of ""TRON"" was that the computer world was so different, that it didn't have things the real world did but a new set of rules and possibilities grounded in the workings of computer hardware and software. That was the originality of the ""TRON"" concept, and ""Legacy"" abandons it in favor of cool-looking sets, costumes and action sequences -- sure, it looks great, but there's no sense of wonder like the first film had.(Having seen the first episode of the new ""TRON: Uprising"", I'm sorry to say that rehashing what's been done in other series and looking cool like this latest movie is the direction the franchise continues to go. Sad.)",TRON - Legacy
460,kielyjohn-261-769087,Please do not listen to the negative reviews!,10,4 July 2016,"I was brought up Tron as I am an 80's kid, I remember being a gamer entering Tron's world (even though I struggled to understand what was going on) left me amazed with the effects.Now the sequel I was not interested in the slightest, I'd heard of it and did not pay any attention.But then I saw it on Sky movies and boy did my opinion change, they really have thought about the old film and there is so many references to it you can't help but feel humbled they thought of so much. So there's a scene where the protagonist enters the arcade from the original film, power comes on and all the old machines come to life.They even try to incorporate actual programming into the film, people using Linux commands and not having those Hollywood made up operating systems and menus.Then there's the actual plot which builds and builds and is very well told, sure there are some predictable twists and also things we've time and time before BUT I didn't roll my eyes at any point. I won't give anything away other than Jeff Bridges is listed in the film so that's not a spoiler and he plays a great part which is refreshing to see.I would say if you like a good action film with a decent plot and amazing CGI that compliments the film rather than hinders. Please watch and just relax and enjoy the ride dude!",TRON - Legacy
461,daviddiamond,Three movies in one; but unbalanced.,6,9 January 2011,"Tron: Legacy (2010) was really three movies in one:(1) For the box office, draw, it was a good-vs.-evil action movie.(2) For those who grew up with the 80's style arcade games, it was a good tribute to that type of arcade. It also has appeal to the more recent cyberspace, matrix and computer geek crowd.(3) At its deepest level, Tron 2010 was an exploration of applied Zen. If this theme had been woven equally with the other two themes, it could have been a ten-star film. Unfortunately, the glitz and action so dominated, that most of the viewers barely took notice of what, IMHO, the movie was really about. There were a couple of strong allusions to living outside of the matrix, to meditation, ""listening to the sky"" and ""listening to the sound"", and to taking oneself out of the equation. Near the climax, what was intended to be the understanding of total responsibility for one's reality, non-judgmentally accepting the projection of one's thoughts and consequences, and (much like the theme of Dark Crystal), becoming one's greater self by merging with one's alter ego, was overshadowed by the escape drama. The dissolution of a reality of one's own creation (which is nothing real anyway; just a matrix) and of one's self, which is inconsequential from an enlightened perspective, seemed in the movie to be more of a noble, self-sacrificial act.All in all, Tron Legacy had the great potential to contrast and integrate every day drama and action with transcendental consciousness. It fell flat, though, giving only lip service to its deeper level, failing to balance the intended themes.",TRON - Legacy
462,manofsan,Needs More Tron!,7,18 December 2010,"What I liked in the original was that Boxleitner's character Tron was a plucky monitor program taking on the big Master Control Program that ruled the mainframe/grid/whatever. Bridges' character had god-like powers because he was a user, but Tron was a spunky fighter.We hardly get to see Tron in this sequel. I'm fine with the fact that when we do see him, he turns out to be a henchman or enforcer for the evil CLU. But we hardly get to see him or his awesome fighting capabilities. When he does finally flip from bad to good, it's too brief and there's not enough buildup to it. He changes to good and sacrifices himself in an all too brief instant. Even when Darth Vader switches over to good and kills the Emperor, we at least first get to see the drama of him watching his own son Luke suffer at the emperor's hands. We don't even get just a little bit of dramatic impact when Tron converts and helps out the good guys.The movie and its sequel are both named after Tron, the plucky agile freedom fighter hero from the original. They could have at least given him a bit more screen time for his death scene. If I had made this movie, I would have at least had Tron accompanying the good guys and clearing a few baddies out of their way using his awesome fighting skills.The only hint of a better fate for Tron was his plunge into the water, and the change of his colors - like some sort of final redemption. They could have at least made that more poignant.",TRON - Legacy
463,Moester_,Seems I got a different experience than everyone else. *spoilers*,10,20 December 2010,"**** Spoilers Throughout **** I will start to say that I was a big fan of the originals, the character and the setting really sucked me in. I must say that my expectations were extremely high and while some weren't met I must say that most were met and exceeded. Every review I've read talk about the father and son angle...which to me was under-used, as a matter of fact, I was expecting a lot more...To me this movie was about visionaries and often their ideas and purposes are perverted by their followers and the greedy. In the movie both of Flynn's creations are perverted one by corporate greed and another by Clu's zealotry. I couldn't help by think of Steve Jobs and his outing from the company he created by short-sighted corporate weasels during the board meeting with Allan. And there are nearly countless historical examples of intellectuals being ousted by their followers following revolutions.Beyond the real-world parallels I must say that I enjoyed the characters. They didn't make Sam into the typical ""badass"" or ""emo kid"" but made him a flawed hero who was both vulnerable and could kick butt.I loved Flynn's character and while a lot of people compare his vocabulary with ""the dude's"" but I saw it as a logical progression from his speech in the original. I mean how much is your vocabulary going to change when you are in exile in a world of your own creation? I loved the character of Rizzler as a re-purposed Tron who overcomes the ""brainwashing"" and protects his friend in the end. I would have liked to have more of the titular character but it was a nice surprise to see Tron having such and impact in the story even though I missed the character in his original form.The character of Quorra was the weakest character in the movie, her whole purpose was somewhat glossed over while her significance is strongly hinted at but not completely developed.Clu is by far my favourite character in this movie. The Zealot who simply cannot go beyond his literal interpretation of his purpose/religion (after all Flynn's commands are for him commands from God) If this character isn't relevant in this world where we are so polarized over every issue then I don't know what relevance means. Clu is the personalization of the ills of purpose over understanding, of the enactment of an idea over the fulfilment of a thought. Flynn is the dreamer who sees his dream evolving and growing while Clu is attached to a momentary vision. And he fights for that vision, that perfection and that is why he fights Flynn and why in the end Flynn apologizes to him.I loved the character of Castor, Micheal Sheen plays him as a mix between Iggy Pop and a car salesman. He is thoroughly efficient and steals the spotlight from every scene. I especially love the scene where he realizes that Clu is turning the tables on his and that he is holding none of the cards. Sheen's mastery subtle expressions shine through and say more through a look than a page of dialogue.My only real beef with this movie is that it requires a sequel to close up all the loose ends. Is Tron still alive? Is Flynn really dead after merging with Clu? what did Sam save onto that disk in the end? What is Quorra's significance in our world? What will Sam accomplish as the President of Encom? These are all questions that need to be answered and in my opinion can only be with a sequel.And yes, everything else you've read is true, the effects are outstanding, the actions is just as intense as you would want. And the movie is just jaw-dropping in IMAX 3D; by far the most effective use of CGI I have ever seen. The score in the movie is exceptional, Daft Punk really show their understanding of the movie and really elevate many scenes to another level.To me this movie was in the layers and not in the flash. I think that most people were blinded by the CGI and saw Transformers instead of using their heads and seeing a thinking person's Sci-Fi movie.",TRON - Legacy
464,Flick_Montana,A Worthy Legacy,10,11 February 2011,"Let me preface this review by stating that I am an unabashed fan of the 80's. I love the music even though MTV killed rock, I love the vision of the future even though neon is clearly on its way out, and I especially love the movies.Now, I know that the original Tron was terrible in most ways. However, it had a few things going for it. First, it had Bruce Boxleitner and Jeff Bridges. As if that weren't enough, they spent most of the movie basking in a cyberpunk neon glow. If you accepted the movie for what it was, it was an epic adventure in corny 80's wonderment.Tron: Legacy is everything that a fan of the original could possibly want. If you didn't enjoy the first movie, you might still like this one. If you loved the first movie, this one will absolutely immerse you.The first thing worth pointing out is the amazing special effects. They were worth every penny. But the special effects actually take a back seat to one thing; the music.Composed by Daft Punk (who actually make a cameo), the music is not like their typical fare. What it is is absolutely astonishing. The soundtrack will win awards, make no mistake. If it loses out to Justin Bieber's new ""movie"" then I will start putting my money on the world ending in 2012.From beginning to end, I was smiling through this flick. My gums were dry, my cheeks ached, and I wanted to do it all again. Immediately. Tron: Legacy was everything the original wanted to be, but couldn't. It does leave me wondering if, 30 years from now when the new Tron movie is released, it will be as massive a step forward over this one as this one was over the old one? If so, I'm going to start eating healthier because I really need to see that.Final statement: I really REALLY want the duster that Flynn wears in the end of the movie.",TRON - Legacy
465,TheFewSick,An enthralling love letter to the live-action Disney films of my childhood.,10,21 March 2011,"My love for films involving a singular setting that expands into separate worlds or fantastical realms and dimensions such as Coraline, Troll, Hellraiser and Poltergeist has been realized again in spectacular fashion. Not being a huge fan of CGI, I was pleasantly surprised by the special effects as I could tell everything in this film was constructed with excruciating, meticulous attention to detail from the character deaths (known as de-resolution) to the lightning and fireworks in the digital realm of the Grid.Jeff Bridges portrays dual characters in the film, reprising his roles from the 1982 classic Tron- both his character in human form, Kevin Flynn, and C.L.U., his digital reflection and counterpart on the Grid. Seemingly the ying to his yang, C.L.U. has been stuck in arrested development; Hell-bent on a digital ethnic cleansing by wiping out imperfections in the system or ISO's- newly developed programs that mystically came into being. The film was written by the UW alumni team responsible for a majority of LOST, Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. Fans of LOST should recognize some similarities in the warring clans, secret initiative, a violent purge, right and wrong within the duality of the individual- the perception of it in the eye of the beholder and eventually ultimate sacrifice to reset the balance.The digital reconstruction of Jeff Bridges sans 20 years can be a bit unsettling to the eye. While it looks 90% accurate and lifelike it can at times suspend disbelief but also attribute to the darker side of the character C.L.U. The soundtrack score by Daft Punk is superb and reduces Trent Reznor's Academy Award-winning Social Network score to ambient background keyboard noise. I have been listening to the French duo's excellent symphony infused, electronic-retro score repetitively since late last year. The upcoming Blu-ray release promises to be the HD event of the year for me; the special effects, with slight exception to the digital Jeff 'The Dude' Bridges, are virtually flawless. The sound effects of the Recognizer blazing over the Grid are so bass driven and badass that I will be shaking framed posters from the wall until my speakers pop or I blow a fuse.",TRON - Legacy
466,paystchr,"Since I was a Kid, I waited for it!",10,18 February 2016,"Ever since I was 2, I loved watching Tron. Tron was the first word I spelled. I wanted to watch it every day. Years, I asked for a sequel. Then, a fateful day in 2010 with the first trailer, and I was excited! On January 2011, I saw it on the IMAX 3-D screen, and it is the only film I ever saw in 3-D. It is literally the best! I don't care how people responded to it. I loved it! In 3-D, I was electrified from start to finish. The actors performances are powerful, especially Jeff Bridges. The visuals are down right stunning, and Daft Punk's soundtrack makes you want to watch it again and again.The story is, Sam Flynn, is the son of Kevin Flynn, who went missing back in 1989. But when Alan Bradley, Kevin's personal friend, gives him a clue, Sam goes to his father's old arcade, and is teleported onto the Grid, the digital platinum universe inside the computer. With the help of warrior Quorra, he finds his dad, and must fight his father's program Clu, from entering the human world, and taking it over.This is a must own for all Tron fans, and anyone looking for a good Sci-fi film. You will be amazed. It is awesome. Buy it on DVD, or Blu-ray. This movie is worth your time. This movie is worth 5 stars.",TRON - Legacy
467,nbalive_fanatic,Visual and audio feast,8,24 December 2010,"I will try to be brief and not spoil to much but I will say that ""Tron: Legacy"" is is great eye and ear candy. While it is not the best movie to be released or that I have seen this year or even the best from Disney this year, (""Toy Story 3"" says hello) it was certain the best EXPERIENCE I've had at the cinema. Daft Punk's techno-orchestral score perfectly sets the mood and gels for the entire movie. It's energizing, epic and wholly effective. Possibly soundtrack of the year. The visuals? Awesome to say the least. Of course, the centerpiece appears to be the digitally de-aged Jeff Bridges as Clu and he looks pretty good throughout. The effect is not perfect and there are parts where it's painfully obvious it's CGI, but I applaud the steps that have been made and it doesn't take away from the character at all. The story is rather simple, but it's more than enough to be cohesive and keep the action moving. Overall, the acting was good and far above the level of the typical action blockbuster. There are also enough homages to keep people on their toes, from the original to Star Wars to The Dude. All in all, if you are expecting a life changing, prolific, utterly classic piece of filmmaking, your expectations are too high. What the film is is a worthy successor to the original while maintaining it's own independence. It has heart and just enough content to keep it from being strictly an exercise in style over substance. It's slick and entertaining, so just sit back and enjoy the show.",TRON - Legacy
468,Crave,"Beautiful, stylish and sleek...if that's all you want in a movie",6,17 December 2010,"(If you have not seen the original Tron, this review will contain spoilers. If you have, then you've already seen the most intriguing parts of Tron: Legacy)Tron: Legacy is an attractive but predictable sequel almost 30 years in the making. The shame of the movie is that it had the possibility to re-invent and re-ignite a genre. Instead it settled for good-looking mediocrity.The first Tron, released in 1982, was years ahead of its time. The special effects were new and startling: Balls of electricity could be thrown, bounce off walls and destroy digital floors or even digital people; A disc held in the hand would transform into a day-glo motorcycle; An electronic version of water could be absorbed to restore health; People could hitch a ride on a Sailbarge attached to a laser- beam and watch as an electronic landscape spread in all directions. The ideas, too, were radical: A digital world existed parallel to our own, populated by programs written by humans, each of whom had lives and personalities that reflected their human counterparts; A human could be attacked by a malevolent, hyper-intelligent computer and transformed into a digital signal no more significant than an Excel Spreadsheet file; There would be a time, very soon, when digital and analog creatures would co-exist in the same space.The original Tron was just that: An original. No Science Fiction movie to date had successfully fused a computer world and the real world. There was no precedent.Fast forward almost 30 years later and we have Tron: Legacy. If it were a computer program it might be considered Tron 1.3.7. There is nothing ground-breaking about this movie. You will see no effects in this movie that haven't been done somewhere else before. The neon-lights, the glossy black surfaces, the zooming vehicles, the exploding bits of data, the outfits - all of them have already been used in one way or another.As for story, once you know the background of the original Tron, the narrative is as basic as a game of Pong: There is a plot by a powerful bad guy to do what megalomaniacs are prone to do and the hero has to stop him. You can check your brain at the door when you pick up your 3D glasses.However, even if Legacy does not push intellectual or technical boundaries, it does give us an updated, 2010 version of everything we HAVE seen before. On this point it succeeds brilliantly.Everything is rendered in breathtaking, cutting-edge CG. The art design is stunning. The much-advertised lightcycle race is indeed spectacular to watch. In addition, everywhere you look there are electronic bits and bytes. Costumes glow with a light of their own. Beverages are topped with digitized ice cubes. When a player in the games is ""de-rezzed"" they shatter like glass. Like every action movie sequel, additions have been made to the original Tron. New characters. New vehicles. New ""toys."" (All of which Disney is happy to offer you at your local toy store)All in all, if you're interested in a popcorn movie that looks great and will entertain you for a couple of hours, this movie fits the bill.I just lament the possibilities of what it could have been and isn't. How about computer/human hybrids? What about the horror of a computer virus? Or the concept of Re-Rezzing (undelete)? How about vehicles that could move in multiple directions at once? Brainwashing using digital technology to make a program believe it is human? What if a program could talk to a human? Imagine making a friend - not with another human using cyberspace - but forging a connection with the digital world directly? The concept of God vs Human creative power in the digital world? And please, please, please - give us some better futuristic weapons than simply a disc and a few bright orange rods!There could have been so many possibilities. Unfortunately, Tron:Legacy, like the character of Sam, is neither as fascinating or as inspiring as its predecessor.Perhaps, in another 30 years, we'll get a movie worthy of the original.",TRON - Legacy

I'm not quite fond of this pop-corn cinema, but I wanted to give it a try, after all I liked the original Tron.Great mistake, HUGE.During the first, let's say, 30, 40 minutes? I was completely baffled because I was wondering if this movie was a remake or a brand new film. Well, the actually new stuff doesn't start until almost an hour into the movie, and then is when you start to get the idea ""ah... so the plot, hence the movie, starts here!"" which, in the end, is not big deal given the awful acting, awful dialogue, awful whatever you can imagine.Even the FX kinda suck. OK, they're technically brilliant, but, come on, the original Tron had a much more ""digital"" feeling to it that this piece of junk. Sometimes it feels like Matrix on steroids, which certainly means a lot of steroids.

One often has to walk between pleasing style and pleasing substance and Tron: legacy does both.",TRON - Legacy
471,pointman-7,It was just OK!,5,17 December 2010,"The original TRON was ground breaking with pioneer in using computer imagery, even though another half of the effect were done with old fashion hand paint animation and optical printing. Nowadays, computer is used for almost every movies, so I expect a lot more from TRON LEGACY!Well, I am kind of disappointed and certainly won't consider it out of this world! It was just an OK movie with well control execution and budget. It is certainly nothing near AVATAR! AVATAR was almost 100% done with computer animation and special effect! Here, most part of the movie happened at night! That already save them a lot on back ground detail. Then again, some of the details are really unnecessary. What is smoke and dust doing in the computer world? Mile stone in computer generated special effect? Far from it, unless you born yesterday! The updated vehicles were nice and really cool though!3D imagery? Once again, I feel FLAT (much like AVATAR)! Once again, it shown me that once I focus on the story, it really make no different to me - 2D or 3D. The feeling of depth is just not that great. Just another excuse for theater to charge extra for that flimsy 3D glasses! No more 3D movie for me!On the musical score? Director seem unable to decide whether it should be more techno or full orchestra style, so he given us both. The impression is neither here or there. I certainly prefer techno style in the original TRON. Still using DISC for storage? During the original TRON, 5.25 inch diskette was used for storage, followed by 3.5 inch diskette, CD, DVD, and now spinning disc is almost at the end of the road as Flash Drive and SD Card are taking over. A little behind time for a futuristic movie?No complaint on actors. Most did an adequate jobs. No Oscar winning performance. Story wise, all over the place. Why program need to eat? They only need energy source, maybe like water in the original TRON. Over here, they have wine and eat asparagus! None of the character make me care for them (as compare to the original TRON), even the death of Kevin Flynn (Spoiler!). OK, he died. So? Is that necessary?That's all I want to say as a sci-fi movie fan. For an almost 50 years old guy, maybe I just get a little ahead of time!

To say I was relieved would be an understatement.Visually stunning with great tweaks on the original, set design incredible and loved the recreation of Flynn's arcade.I really enjoyed the father/son story arc and thought well acted by all and the reasoning behind Flynn senior being trapped very plausible. The small digs at Star Wars, homage to Blade Runner and other sci-fi films were subtle inclusions bearing in mind the time the original was made.End of Line Club, Michael Sheen, Daft Punk...let's open it now, what a party that would be.Jeff Bridges was the main reason I went to see this again and he didn't disappoint.A definite must see, so top reading, get on your light cycle and go.",TRON - Legacy

This is going to take eye candy to a whole different level and from every screen clip I have viewed at the past Comic Con's, I can only say that my skin is bubbling with eager joy to see this entire movie.It has a great cast, lead by the all time great, Jeff Bridges, and a visual concept that dwarfs any blockbuster to date. My guess is that this will be to the industry, what The Matrix was. I can only imagine how this would have turned out if The Wachowski Brothers had been involved, but needless to say, it looks amazing. To all the naysayers, who are comparing it to Avatar, I say that it's a non issue. So it's being released at the same time of year with a giant marketing campaign and it's strong point is visual effects. It's not a fair comparison, because James Cameron has a name that is synonymous with Titanic, Terminator 2, Aliens, and so on. We have a first time director for the Tron Legacy. But my guess is that this will be a crowd pleaser and will put him on the map in a major way.",TRON - Legacy
474,elisdanielflores,This movie has aged perfectly.,10,26 July 2021,"Let me clarify the 10 star rating, because objectively speaking is not a 10 film. It's at its max a 7.5/10. My 10 works all over nostalgia, emotional attachment and overall likeness of this film. Having said that, I admit a have a emotional nostalgic attachment to this film, as I said before, but I will explain my objective opinion regarding Tron Legacy.1: The movie's plot is quite simple. Kevin Flynn gets trapped inside the Tron game, his son Sam Flynn goes in to save him, after the villain Clu sets them both a trap. There's no big Matrix-like story plot. Beginning, middle, end, that's it.2: The writing from time to time is over the place, with little plot points going nowhere, only to serve a little information for the 2hours run time. It does however, give more than enough time to know all the characters involved in this story. Sam, Kevin, Clu, Quorra, Tron, Zuse/Castor. You will know all the character's backgrounds and purposes.3: The visuals choices, the cinematography, the overall theme of the film, is definitely a visual paradise. Regardless if you like the script or not, the visuals you will experience them, like nothing you've seen before.4: The sound and music and probably the best part of the film. If you own a home cinema system, please use it with this film. The overall sound design is definitely oscar worthy, as it will use the whole potential of your system to give you an experience totally different against other Sci-Fi films. The ""bike battle grid"" scene literally had my living room shaking, it's an experience I will never forget in my life.5: Even thought it has a normal plot, the final confrontation of Kevin and Clu is absolutely well written. It's emotional, it's well explained, the music sets the mood of an epic final battle Star Wars Original trilogy like scene. All the plot points leading to this confrontation, finally touch, giving no strings loose.6: Overall, this movie has magic, has it's own narrative and themes, has it's own personality. It's rare to see nowdays with Disney Films, since all of them are pretty much from Marvel and Star Wars. You will have fun with this film, even if you don't enjoy the whole 2 hour film, the action scenes are definitely something else.My nostalgic point: I saw this film when I was 11 years old, it's pretty much my childhood movie. You can say it is my Star Wars. I enjoyed it a lot when I was a kid, and now I'm enjoying it even more as an young adult. This movie is a wild ride, and I hope Disney soon releases a 3rd Tron film, just as good or better than this one.Pd: Bring Daft Punk back to score, please.",TRON - Legacy
475,yasin23,great maybe the Legacy will continue,7,10 January 2011,"Having watched Tron when i was little i decided to watch the original first before watching this movie (although that is not necessary). The Film starts (with a flashback) a few years after Flynn have a son and is about to make 'Perfection'.To be honest i thought the script was not going to be any good and i dismissed how the storyline would act out and even if the 3D version would be much different than 2D one. Boy was i wrong on all three points i think i enjoyed the film more when i went with these apprehensions.The acting was awesome especially by the Flynn's, Quorra and although Gem had a small scene it was impressive. No matter how advance CGI becomes it was difficult to relate with Clu the static eyes made it all to artificial. Visually it was outstanding like the light cycle race worth watching in 3D. This one of those movies that if you talk about specifics it will spoil the whole film.Finally i would give it an 8 out of 10 a must watch in the holidays.",TRON - Legacy
476,Favri,One for the kids...,6,13 January 2011,"So, last night I watched Tron: Legacy at a new state of the art cinema in London. Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of Jeff 'The Dude' Bridges and pretty much anything he has starred in. The film was promising – in the pipeline for quite a while, big budget ($13 million alone spent on costumes!), 3D filming technology better than Avatar's, Daft Punk providing the beats... and Jeff Bridges!! Then reviews started coming out – and they haven't been good. Now, usually I am not one to care for reviews or film critics (yes, the irony...) but inevitably my expectations were lowered.One thing was clear from the start: the plot is definitely not the strong point of this production – Kevin Flynn is stuck in the virtual world he created, his son Sam discovers this and tries to save him. Nothing ground breaking, but that's not the point. The point is to be blown away visually, to make you stop caring about how weak the story is. Now, the filming for Tron: Legacy was done in 64 days. As impressive as it is concerning. The post production lasted 68 weeks. THAT is promising. I read this and instantly stopped caring about the story, months before the release. I was, unfortunately, a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong, visually, it's stunning. The fight scenes, the bike scene(s?) and the city built on the grid are beautifully done and deserve to be seen on the big screen, in 3D. What disappointed me is that I did not feel they made the most of these impressive visuals. To put it simply, I wanted less talky, talky, more fighty and bikey racing. Or at least, if you have to sit through the dialogue and plot/character development, make it worth our while. Here is what confused me even more: check the credits and you will see that 8 people are mentioned in the Writing credits; 2 for the screenplay, 4 for the story and 2 for the characters. There is no evidence of this. Or rather, there is a doubt as to whether the script was reworked a few too many times. In my humble opinion, they could have done with half the dialogue and double the action – that would have made sense. Instead they tried to make the plot more 'complex' and the characters 'deeper' and ended up with an action film, with not enough action. Although, let me repeat it, the action sequences are brilliant. Which inevitably made me wonder ""what if..."" even more. What did not disappoint at all was the awesome soundtrack and equally awesome costumes. Really great stuff. I doubt many movies can say they have Daft Punk, Journey and Eurythmics in the listings – the sounds are just amazing from beginning to end and very well used. The costumes look incredible. The lights and materials were all real and incorporated into the suits for purposes of realism – excellent choice! Crazy money, but money well spent. Again though, these accomplishment made me wonder what this film could have been had it disappointed a bit less in other departments. The contrasts in the music in particular, as well as the ones in technology, such as the old Arcade vs the encom skyscraper vs the Tron world, were something I felt deserved a bit more screen time and attention.Disney took a few risks in this production – making it PG was almost a given (it's Disney and they'll go as far as PG-13 with Pirates of the Caribbean but not further), picking Joseph Kosinski as Director and Garrett Hedlund as lead, to name a few. Unfortunately the film is 'very' PG – I don't expect or want loads of violence, gore and profanity, but odds are if I've seen the first Tron, and I can't wait for the long awaited sequel, by now I'm old enough to handle slightly more 'rated' scenes and dialogue which I feel could have added a bit of passion and flare to the film. Kosinski's career highlights so far, from what I've read, are trailers for Halo and Gears of War. I understand Disney's logic in hiring him (less famous = more control by Dinsey) but he might not really have been ready for this huge leap. A slightly more experienced director would have brought more to the table and might have appeased the fans. The older ones anyway... Hedlund was actually not that bad. At times. His character (as with the others) is unfortunately treated very superficially, so the challenge is not huge, but he still does what he has to do... My only thought is, regarding his upcoming crucial role in On the road, that I seriously hope he had some insightful, inspiring and helpful talks with Jeff Bridges in between shoots, because he will need to step it up a notch!! I refuse to comment on The Dude's performance as it was not unbelievably amazing, which is what he has made us expect from him. Let's just say he could have pretended he was a bit more into it... though I can see why he wasn't...To sum it up Tron: Legacy was an entertaining and impressive visual experience. An amazing soundtrack, impressive costumes and visuals were not enough for me to leave the room smiling. It took me a few minutes to come to the conclusion that this was in fact one for the kids. And I sincerely hope the kids loved it because when I was younger, when my expectations were lower and I hadn't seen as many movies as I have today, something like this would have made an impact and made my imagination run wild (definitely without traumatising me). I just hope they'll make one for the older fans... in my lifetime...6.5/10",TRON - Legacy
477,costycyp,Tron,9,26 December 2010,"The movie is gorgeous. I feel more stimulated by this visual than I did with Avatar last year. Tron Legacy looks so stunning, it practically invites you to make love to it. The environment is faithful to the original film but it's amplified to tenth degree. The terrain looks more real, the grid looks more fascinating. Don't even get me started on the disc and light cycle battles, quite possibly the highlight of the entire movie watching experience. They excite your senses,..If you can see or hear, boy has Tron Legacy got a show for you! By the way, you do not wanna miss out on the light cycle race it's more complex this time around, more than just making a maze and getting your opponent to hit the wall, this game is more advanced, it has more twists and turns. Absolutely thrilling. The acting was absolutely fantastic. Each character was cast perfectly. I must admit that when I saw who they had chosen for Sam, I wasn't too pleased. He looked like some generic male model out of some catalog... and then he completely proved me wrong. Now, I am not saying the kid deserves an Oscar, but he did do a very good job. Jeff Bridges was of course fantastic and the rest of the supporting cast were at his level. Recommended to fans and non-fans alike. This film is the definition of 'Big' in terms of visuals and sound. Very impressive stuff. I might go back and watch it in 2D before Christmas. I know that making comparisons to other films is a recipe for approval ratings disaster, but this film sounded better than anything I've experienced in a theater, and looked better than anything I've experienced.",TRON - Legacy
478,olie2008,One giant cliché...,4,4 January 2011,"My Dad had promised that we'd go to the pictures after the New Year scenario had drawn to an end. Usually my parents and I would visit the Cinema at least once a month, but due to the absolutely dire films that landed up on shown over the last quarter of the year, that routine quickly drew to an end. After seeing some fairly good reviews on IMDb, we decided that Tron would be the best way to start the New Year.Diabolical. Absolutely awful. Those were the first words we muttered as we stumbled in our dazed state out of the cinema. ""What had been praised as a technical achievement was really quite average with nothing visually special to comment on"" we decided as we drove home. For me though, and both my parents for that matter, the viewing of films is something which must be enjoyable. Sure, the style was fairly nice, although polished far to perfectly for my liking, but to enjoy a film, there needs to be some element of substance. There was none.From the start: clichéd movie lines, a plot formed from a million other different films with the clichéd 'Boy fulfills his destiny and gets the girl of his dreams' and, I'll be honest, some pretty poor acting. A career worst from Jeff Bridges. Could it get worst? Well, as with all Disney live action movies, that's something to certainly consider. I considered it and was not at all surprised when the film practically collapsed in on itself. Many plot holes and unexplained plot elements: the building of an army, how a digital character was able to be rendered into complete biological existence etc etc. Moreover, it just became more and more unoriginal: Sets from 2001: A Space Odyssey, Space fights from Starwars, and one liners, undoubtedly from a generic Hollywood list of best ways to top of an already horrific film. To be honest it shouldn't even be called a film...I certainly wouldn't recommend that you spend, for me, in Britain, £8:00 to view this talentless drivel in 3D, and quite honestly I would recommend you spend any money. Don't watch it. As always with Disney's attempts at being mature and sophisticated, it ends up being pretty awful.",TRON - Legacy
479,rpgfan173,Best sequel I have seen in decades,7,10 March 2011,"This Tron is an excellent sequel, and I don't only say that because of the visuals (which means nothing to me), it has an excellent OST, a very good story (though not as deep as in the first Tron), good acting and dialog (compared with the first movie) and though the actual motivation of Clu is not revealed until the end, the movie does not get you bored so you can get there OK.I really recommend this film to all the fans of the first movie, except in the case that you're the kind of SUPER nerd who find flaws in everything, in that case you better don't watch it with high expectations.I gave the original Tron a 6.8, I give to this movie a 7.2.",TRON - Legacy
480,carl_2266,"In a place called the grid, a boy learns the whereabouts his father, who has been missing for the past decade while also fighting off a man named Clue.",5,26 May 2011,"I was quite disappointed in this film. I went to this film in theatres on opening day with high expectations. I had just watch the original Tron few days prior so I was pretty excited for this film. However, this film was not anything like I expected. First problem I have is the lack of modernization with in the film. Tron legacy had plenty of technology that could've been installed into the film(no pun intended). It didn't have that interesting look of things like the original did.Speaking of look, the visuals were also a disappointment. If you're like me this was the one film you were looking forward to in 3D, however only half of the film is in 3D and it isn't even that spectacular. Now you may argue that they only put the 3D parts in when they were in the Grid, but no. I took off my 3D glasses about 4 times, 3 of which were at moments when they were in the grid, and the screen was perfectly clear. Another thing I had a problem with is the effect to duplicate Jeff Bridges. Now I didn't notice the it to much until about a third into the movie, the effect made the duplicate look really digital almost like an effect from an Ed Wood if he had CGI at some point. The thing is though the effect could've been save if they made the eyes on the effect glowing that orange/yellow colour on the suits. It would've look kinda neat and also look like the digital muck up look made to look that way on purpose. Also while watching this, it didn't feel that alive like the other did, it almost felt like a giant room with 2 chairs in it, not much to see. Another thing that bugged me is the kid who gets sucked into the grid. Its not that I didn't like the kid as an actor, but I didn't get why he was so good at everything. For instance, right at the beginning when he's in the disc tournament, it takes him about three seconds to figure out what the disc is, figure out how to use, understand the physics of the disc, and be a pro disc thrower. Its just hard for me to take it in that he figure all that out in a matter of seconds. If it were like 10 minutes or something then it would've been more captivating in my personal opinion. The last thing I'll regard is how they got a turkey dinner in the grid. I mean, how did it get there? Did they beam it in the grid? Did they kill it with in the grid? Are turkeys really some sort of secret computer virus that I'm not aware of? I have no idea.To sum up, if you like the original, prepare to be disappointed. But giving the film some credit it did have some really great visuals and the soundtrack was really great as well. But aside from that, the film has many flaws that I didn't even look at in this review that really bring this film down. The plot was kinda generic, the acting was sub-par, and overall it was all that interesting like the first was. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it could've done a lot better. With that said I hope you enjoyed this review and I'm looking forward of making more.",TRON - Legacy

It has been a long time since I have been dazzled by a movie like this. Everything was so new and fresh and just fun and entertaining. The music was some of the best I've heard too-really addicting. Went with 2 kids, aged 9 and 13 and they both loved it. If you want to go see a movie that will just make you feel good and totally entertain you, this is it. If you want to ask why was he able to do that? How could he do that? etc. it might not work too well. Go in and just let yourself experience the new age of movie making at its best!

Rehash of the light train from first film.Underwhelming climax.The end.Sadly despite all the money thrown at this production it all went on special effects, nobody thought to write a decent script.Also it suffers from the fact that getting inside a computer and having supercool fights isn't really that exciting anymore, it was done to death in the Matrix films (which ironically drew a lot of inspiration from the original Tron). Also none of the characters were really worth caring about.Very disappointing but i got to see it at the cinema for free (yes in 3D, Avatar is better in this respect) so i'm not as annoyed as I could be.",TRON - Legacy
485,Reschat,"With somewhat mixed expectations I really enjoyed the movie, with several aspects simply put: Awesome!",9,14 December 2010,"A few hours ago I watched TRON: Legacy (2010) and despite mixed feelings about the 3D experience, I really enjoyed the movie.Yesterday I watched the original TRON (1982) to prepare for the movie tonight and even though I didn't love it, it was still enjoyable (especially Jeff Bridges's performance). So when I today went and watched the sequel, several smaller aspects gave a little extra because I had the original fresh in my mind.The story wasn't mind-blowing but it was decent, consistent, and provided the necessary suspense. The characters (and acting) on the other hand were excellent making the situations and interactions very believable. For this reason, one of my favorite scenes was actually a simple dinner conversation between Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges), Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund), and Quorra (Olivia Wilde) which depicted so much more than the word exchanged.To stay with the extremely good aspects of the movie, the whole ""system structure"" and ""society"" were actually quite interesting and very well made. At no point did I find the events in the TRON world weird or inexplicable, which I actually had expected at least a few to be.Now to one of the main aspects the movie have been promoted through: The action. I really enjoyed all action sequences, whereof several were extremely clever made giving some fun twists in fast and exiting action scenes. But I'm not sure if the 3D helped enhance the experience.During the movie I wished that I could watch it in 2D instead of 3D (using polarized 3D glasses). At several points I found the picture blurry and disorientating. Not sure why but the two movies I have watched in 3D (Avatar and this) where both somewhat disorientating in curtain scenes, making me wish that I had watched them in normal 2D instead. So I'm not at all a fan of 3D and when I can avoid it, I choose to do so.Overall I really enjoyed the movie, with the characters and ""society"" being the parts I found the most entertaining and interesting. I can highly recommend watching it.Halfdan Reschat""I'd mount that ISO""",TRON - Legacy
486,Binba,The real CLU is Disney,3,20 December 2010,"The heavy iron that is Disney Pictures seems keen on squashing every sense of freshness and imagination, producing products so perfected and polished that they leave nothing behind when you're done watching.First and foremost, the story:The more Hollywood moves on with its tent-pole ""events"" and skyrocketing budgets, the more I find myself asking: ""300 million dollars, and THIS is what they come up with?"" We often distrust each other here on IMDb, but I would safely hand out the screen writing job of Tron: Legacy to any of you readers or fellow reviewers, knowing that you'd do a better job than what ended up on the screen. As for all the, um, technical details - why did they bother? No one debates the existence of The Force, Hogwarts magic or that DiCaprio can bend dreams. Legacy created a silly trap for itself trying to explain too much. The graphics are mostly TOO good - we're getting so used to amazing out-of-this-world VFX that we get numb. The CG in the 1982 original was so crude it was abstract, and in a weird way more engaging than the $300M sequel. The old Tron didn't make much sense and the storytelling was clumsy, but it had a vision, and it was bold. You can sense it still today. Skip Tron:Legacy and revisit the original, or go watch a movie like Where The Wild Things Are to remind yourself that films are about imagination - and that they can have a heart.P.S. That odd disclaimer about keeping your 3D glasses on is even odder because you should ignore it.

I can imagine there is a galaxy far far away...but not a computer world that I can physically enter.Putting that aside, and imagining that in the eighties this plot could have been cool, I could enjoy the visuals. Also the 80's synthesizer soundtrack was brilliant. Looking at the acting, the only one above average was Michael Sheen in my opinion. Not that I blame the actors...the unbelievable storyline played a part here.If you're thinking of seeing this movie: I would advise to see it in a theater because of the visual experience and the soundtrack.

That includes the scenes where it was supposed to be a young Bridges in the real world. I thought Avatar showed us how to do that right?Quite possibly the biggest collection of cliché characters I've seen in years. They just kept coming. Was this supposed to air on the Disney Channel? It felt exactly like one of those movies. I was expected Zac Efron to show up any second. The best way to describe it is to compare this to the type movies that were shown to the very first motion-picture audiences. They would just put a train on the screen or a guy on a horse.

491,shakezuulla,Tron Legacy: Return of the Digital Sci-Fi Fantasy,9,17 December 2010,"As greed was the true enemy of the original film, vanity is the new enemy within Tron Legacy. The sequel brings us the classic tale of Creator Vs. Creation (Paradise Lost, Frankenstein, Jurassic Park etc) In a new, updated, would be utopia of a digital world, the creator, Kevin Flynn, becomes trapped within his own obsession when trying to chase after perfection...A perfection that he already has but does not realize until it's too late.The Creation, Clu, is scorned, tries to win his creators approval by taking his vision of a ""perfect"" world to our real world by proving that he is worth more than just a puppet to do Flynn's bidding.Tron Legacy is very thought provoking and ultimately keeps the film within the same construct as the original. It would have been very easy for them to have amped up action sequences to 110 but instead we have a great balance of a philosophical story along with pleasing visuals. It is very hard to find a Sci-Fi flick today that allows the audience to actually take in the visuals without 65 different things happening in the same scene or the camera shaking all over the place. Tron Legacy allows the viewer to see the high speed Light Cycle races as well as experience the identity disc duels from a perspective that captures the action but does not shove it in your face as quick as possible.Most important of all, Tron Legacy is not striving to be bigger, better, or louder than the original. If anything, it seems it strives to be it's equal in a modern age. Although it is significantly different visually, it still maintains that Tron vibe. There is still a lot of mystery to the digital world and how everything works. Not every detail is spelled out for you and thankfully so. It is still up to the viewer to leave a few things up the their imagination. Overall, the movie embodies the right amount of Tron nostalgia while bringing you a sequel that moves the story forward. The new characters are well establish and do a great job at taking us through the movie. The visual speaks for themselves and the story is definitely not shallow. The movie earns the right to be called Tron Legacy.Return to the Digital Sci-Fi Fantasy...See this movie.End Of Line.",TRON - Legacy
492,illnino-2,A Visual Treat in 3D,7,17 December 2010,"I just got the chance to see this movie today in 3D and I must say this has been a vast improvement over the 3D movies that have come out this year. The special effects were quite good, a very worthwhile effort from Disney. It's definitely worth watching in 3D, give this one a go. The extra bucks is worth it. The fight and chase scenes were quite impressive. Felt like being transported into a actual video game.Despite having such good special effects, this movie really lacked a backbone in terms of plot. The story was not that confusing as some people say, it is a little complicated and there definitely are loose ends. I'm reviewing this movie by itself and am making no comparisons to the original. But I feel with such technology and special effects you really do need a engaging story that grabs your attention right from the beginning. Sadly this movie had some pretty slow moments which spoiled the over all experience. A movie shot in 3D should have a engaging story and spectacular visuals. Somewhat like what James Cameron did with Avatar. But here we are left disappointed as both ends of the equation don't match up.The actors gave a decent performance. Jeff Bridges was good with his role, I felt there was some resemblance to The Big Lebowski, which was fun. The animated and younger version of him was not that much of a distraction as we do have to consider that Clu was a digital clone of Kevin Flynn. The costume designs and the atmosphere of the movie was awesome. I personally didn't expect such a dark ethereal creation of The Grid from Disney. The movie was dark and I feel it contrasted the colors used for the costume designs and settings quite nicely. As I had mentioned earlier, this movie is a visual treat for the audience. They definitely got the 3D and the atmosphere and mood of the film right.I haven't heard of Daft Punk much but I will say their music in the film was perfect. It truly captured the mood and vibe of the movie. The beats were so fitting for the life in The Grid. So expect to hear some real good electronic music in this film, very futuristic.So far a good experience, really enjoyed the special effects. Kinda boring at times and slow paced, but if you are able to look past that than it is a movie you will enjoy.",TRON - Legacy
493,harris3810-1,"Pretty colors and a cool soundtrack, but sorry, no plot.",5,27 December 2010,"Problem #1. This movie would have been awesome had they hired a writer at any point. The whole film felt like it had been created by children selecting randomized clichés from a hat: Main character loses parents, becomes angry. Main character is a rich badboy/risk-taker. Main villain/fighter used to be a good guy. Villain is *shocker* reprogrammed/brainwashed good guy! Reprogrammed/Brainwashed good guy remembers he is a good guy! (And just in time to save the day!!!!!!!) Father sacrifices himself to save son. Female role is played by a really hot actress. Why not Kathy Bates? Betty White? The ISO plot line was like a bunch of mumbo-jumbo thrown in, like adding packing peanuts to your breakfast cereal to make it go further. Sorry, but 90% of the dialogue would not have made it through a freshman Creative Writing course. Problem #2. A great portion of the film was 2D. They added a disclaimer at the beginning explaining that this was done on purpose, but when 45 minutes of a 2-hour '3D' film are in fact NOT in 3D I want 40% of my money back. Problem #3. I think that most of the loosely-connected action sequences were trying to support some plot line about the hot female lead ""changing everything"" back in the real world. Something about her perfect, disease free, succulent body being able to revolutionize the human race. OK, kind of a big deal. However, she decides to 'remove herself from the equation' by fighting the bad guys alone. This is a bit like John Connor trying to save his mother and the Terminator by shooting himself in the face. Sure, you removed yourself from the equation, but now there isn't much reason to go on. Not only that, but once they make it safely back to the real world after so much sacrifice, what does Sam Flynn do? He puts her on a motorcycle with no helmet. Even in the artificial grid people wore helmets! And this isn't some smokey chick from Tony's Wings and Billiards, this is, once again, the only survivor of a race of perfect beings and the potential key to saving billions of lives. ""Hey, this is the cure for AIDS, cancer, Lou Gehrig's disease, everything you can imagine! Watch me juggle it over this volcano!"" All in all, 5 stars.

494,JCPadmore,Hated the ending,7,16 April 2011,"Don't get me wrong, this is a great film. The visual effects are great (apart from the de-aged Kevin Flynn & Clu 2 who look like they would belong better in the animated ""Beowulf"" film rather than this live- action one).But enough about the slightly ropey CGI on those two characters, I'm here to ask one question....WHY WAS THE ENDING SO LAME?In my opinion, they should've done something far more iconic for the ending, (like they did with the original, with the computer world ""streets"" gradually changing into the real world highways). Additionally, I was annoyed that so little was done with the TRON character. The film is, after all, named after him but they didn't use him hardly at all other than for a couple of fights. I would've loved to have seen a show-down between Sam and Tron that lead, ultimately, to TRON'S redemption or death. Something a little darker would've worked and potentially added a bit more punch to the title of the film (i.e something left by Tron) because what, exactly, IS the ""Legacy"" of Tron mentioned in the film's title????? It's not apparent. Also, there should've been more at the end surrounding Quorra's experience of the Sun for the first time and, perhaps, some exposure to the ""real world"" (i.e natural phenomenon that she would never have experienced although I'm definitely NOT asking for an environmental slant or anything lame like that!!!). The ending just left me cold.Anyway, please reply and let me know your thoughts on how you would've ended the film or your own interpretations of the actual ending.",TRON - Legacy
495,silver_rob28,"Still a lightweight story, but visually stunning",7,7 January 2021,"Firstly, Jeff Bridges reprising his role as Kevin Flynn would have been having me watching this, shall we say Tron reboot no matter what.Overall a solid outing, 28 years from the original Tron movie. However, the visuals are absolutely stunning from start to finish, the 'grid' look smooth, detailed and a visual trip; accompanied by a remarkable soundtrack which was used with great effect.Like the original Tron the story is still lightweight, and there was so much more that could have been done with Clu and Flynn and feel that Castor was very much an underused character. Also, the plot was similar in terms of the 'games' which were pretty much identical to the original Tron (albeit looked a lot better).In terms of Flynn himself, I feel that the grid he created and 'entered' became a mirror image of his previous life from the original Tron, where Dillinger became powerful from stealing his gaming ideas, whereas in the grid Klu became overtly powerful as he evolved from the utopian character that Flynn envisaged. Moreover, it became his personal hell, he was an outcast within the grid, expelled to the outside due to fear; again a presume a mirror image of I see of Flynn within the corporate world, an outsider that doesn't fit in.His soon was a good edition, solidly played, more of a back story here, could have been explored further, however, basically Kevin Flynn 2.0.Also, having Disney's involvement probably watered down any substantial grit which would have given the movie more of an edge, with this likely a executive decision to aim the movie at the younger age group. I wonder how much better it could've been if say it had had more depth and edge. Not necessarily a wasted opportunity but maybe slightly missed.A solid 7 and a good watch for new fans or fans of the original Tron.",TRON - Legacy

So my advice is don't watch it till you watch the original, not only because you will understand the story better but also to appreciate all that has been done in the new one.Once the movie started and the music started to play with all that darkish blueish visuals I felt like The Dark Knight all over again. I must say I am still dazzled because some of the scenes were really mind blowing especially the race. Everything about the movie is appealing, I mean you might find it a bit chatty when it comes to explaining about what's going on but once done you'll jump again into another action scene with spectacular visuals.This is not Avatar however I guarantee you if you've enjoyed the original just a tiny bit then this one is a winner.Thanx for reading my review and hope it was a bit helpful to decide whether to go or not.",TRON - Legacy
497,infantincinerator84,New TRON brings back story WITH visuals in a time where most films fail.,9,23 December 2010,"I saw TRON LEGACY opening night and admit I was looking forward to it very much, as I enjoyed the original TRON. After being disappointed with several reboots and sequels to beloved childhood classics (such as Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and the new Star Trek reboot) I learned not to set foot into a theater these days with high hopes. I was ready when the lights went out for a typical retake of a classic filled with flashy effects and adolescent humor without substance or story. I was wrong. This film does NOT disappoint for TRON fans nor people new to the story. It picks up 28 years after the original and puts the pieces together perfectly with the son of programmer Kevin Flynn being whisked away into ""The Grid"" and beginning a search for his father, who disappeared when he was 7. The feel of the film is dark,furious and action packed but, unlike a lot of modern films, it has a wonderful balance of Story, acting, music AND effects, instead of just relying on effects. If you are looking for something different and exciting, look no further, The Grid awaits you, more deadly and tricky than before! Buckle up It's a bumpy ride!",TRON - Legacy
498,coolfire-shakti,"One word ""AWESOME""",10,17 December 2010,"The first thing that blew my mind - I didn't realize until the last 15 minutes of the movie that Clu (the villain) was actually Jeff Bridges himself. Thats the level of CGI perfection this movie has. Visuals are a treat to the eyes and BGM by Daft punk is a treat to the ears. I am a big fan of CGI and this movie satisfied all my senses. The plot is not complex as suggested by few other reviewers. It's simple and straight forward. If at all the movie had any flaws (which i didn't recognize), they would easily be compensated by the mind blowing visuals and music. Don't listen to any negative reviews. This movie is super cool. Don't miss it.",TRON - Legacy
499,jorgenmolijn,a boring movie to supplement a great soundtrack,5,28 January 2011,"I have to say I didn't watch the original Tron. But seeing some other reviews where they preferred the original that the 2011 movie, maybe it's a good thing. I might have made this new movie even worse...Where to begin? the good parts of the movie are the special effects and the music. The Tron world looks cool en the special effects work nicely. But nowadays, every movie could be made cool by just the special effects. The music is great and I think that Daft Punk was a logical choice. However, some parts of the movie are made just to let the audience notice the music. Like the movie was made for the music, instead of the other way around. But what about the plot? It sucks...I like the whole idea of a creator who is banished by his own creation and the way that imperfection is good. But the rest of the plot falls short every time. Why would't they send just one person through the portal so they can open the portal from the outside. What are those isos really, besides people who get killed quickly? Why was there a freight train exactly on the right time when the fled from the bar. Why was the genocide covered so lightly, while that last women was supposed to be a miracle. The board meeting and joke during that scene, non of it mattered for the movie itself. The fights in this movie aren't that spectacular. Every time it starts to get cool it ends to quickly followed by a boring and slow conversation. And for a movie hat rely's to much on special effects and action, it just falls short. Again. And to make things worse. Where were the emotions? When they mention the genocide, that women (can't remember her name) shows practically no emotion while she is the only one left. She could have made that she has an itch somewhere, it would have had the same impact. Sam Flynn is even worse. Just after seeing his farther again, he wants to show an emotion but instead he draws a face which shows 3 different ones. You couldn't tell whether he was happy, sad or confused as a person, only that he was confused as an actor. And again on the motorcycle at the end, where the girl looks at the sun. He just stares at the same point with no interaction with his girl and no emotion. In the end, this movie has so much potential. A different world, a father-son relationship, computers who want to take over the world. All things could be great in a movie, but they didn't work it out properly. Instead they added all kinds of substories which don't complement the story. For example, the boardmeeting, the annual pranks, the revolution which didn't happen.",TRON - Legacy
500,obsidian_guardian,Most predictable movie EVER!!!,1,6 January 2011,"When my buddy and I went to see this movie we predicted about half of the things that happened in the movie. Plus everything happens so conveniently for the main character. He goes searching for someone and just happens to find on the street in about five seconds the one chick that can take him to that person, when he gets in trouble Cora just happens to burst in the knick of time out of the ceiling, etc. They might as well just have handed the main character victory. I thought this movie would be at least semi-original or have unexpected plot lines but it had none of these things. I literally almost fell asleep watching this movie.",TRON - Legacy
501,Lionbeard,"One of the best films of 2010, hands down.",8,22 December 2010,"If you want to read a lengthy review of Disney's latest masterpiece, you'll have to look elsewhere. I can sum this movie up in just one word: fantastic.I went into the cinema really not expecting too much; from the ads, I'd presumed it would be a poor recreation of an 80's film/game, however, not 10 minutes in and my jaw had dropped. During the initial scenes of the film, I actually questioned the life-likeness of one of the characters. The CGI was absolutely incredible, it made me think twice about if it was real or not. The story wasn't ground-breaking, but the effects, cinematography and gripping fight scenes, accompanied by Daft Punk's breathtaking soundtrack, really had me clinging to the edge of my seat. I never found myself looking around at the other people in the cinema; I was completely and utterly immersed in Flynn's digital world.8/10 Loved it.",TRON - Legacy
502,fireof1989,It isn't as smart as part 1 - but it is just as fun and awe inspiring.,8,20 December 2010,"Sadly, I am not old enough to have seen the original ""TRON"" back when it came out in 1982. However with that said - I still have an understanding of just how revolutionary its effects were at the time; my mother was a huge fan of the original and had been lucky enough to see it in theatres. She showed me the film when I was a kid, and despite having seen movies like the original ""Toy Story"" that had made strides since TRON, I was still dazzled by the effects and smart, creative story. I have loved computers all my life, and part of that may be because of TRON.When this movie was announced, my mum and I went nuts. A new TRON film? On the big screen?!? HELL YEA! My mother joined my wife & I for a 3D IMAX screening of 'Legacy,' and it was well worth it. While ""Legacy"" may not be as revolutionary as the original was, it still manages to capture what made the original great by having a polished technical sheen, great action, and some clever computer references.The story's progression from the first film is in Real-Time, as it takes place 28 years after the original film. Apparently after the events of the original film, Kevin Flynn left his program CLU in charge of The Grid in order to ""Create the perfect system."" A year after, he had a son and became the new CEO of Encom. Flynn's son, Sam, becomes the majority share-holder but isn't too interested in Encom's affairs and has little to do with the company. Then, his father goes missing. Sam gets a message from him beckoning him to his arcade, where he finds his fathers computer.. Oh, and the digitizing laser just so happens to be there and Sam finds himself in The Grid, and the film continues proper as he tries to find his father and solve the mystery behind the Grid's new problems.The story is arguably the least important element of the film, and while I didn't expect a work of literary genius - I will admit I was a little disappointed with it. I refuse to give out spoilers for any movie, but the ending felt mildly anti-climactic and I also feel that the story left a few holes that need explanation. Tap-dancing around spoilers here, here are some of the main questions I have. What exactly did the ISOs do? How did Kevin recognize TRON during his appearance when he was masked?? What was up with the ending scenes??? It simply isn't as smart as the original in this regard. Truly, the original isn't a masterpiece of story telling either; but it had a much more adventurous quest, slightly more interesting characters, and it had a nice little sub-text about big corporations in the 80s.The movie isn't just a treat for your eyes, it is also a treat for your ears. The sound effects are great, but even better is the music. Daft Punk did the score and it suits the film perfectly. It sounds both electronic AND epic. It is one of the most memorable soundtracks in recent memory and it is one of the first times since ""The Lord of the Rings"" soundtracks that I immediately went out and bought a copy of the films soundtrack CDs.This is a bit nit-picky, but I do wish to express my opinion on one thing in the art-design. As neat-o as the art design is, I do feel as though the new design has a few flaws. In the original, the computer world was almost pitch black but with white lines intersecting; machines like The Recognizers were mostly coloured and shapeless, made from some sort of ethereal data and could change shapes. Here, they are clearly made of some sort of glass or metal with lights on, and they aren't as flexible which somehow makes them less threatening. The ""Blank Spaces"" are also often filled in by a glass like reflection, and I kind of liked the more surreal ""Blank spaces;"" even the highly underrated 2003 game 'Tron 2.0' found a more satisfying expansion of that style, with weapons and guns often being made of various open shapes that can morph but appear to be missing black spaces. That's just a VERY minor gripe though. :) Overall - Tron: Legacy is what it is, a blast! It won't revolutionize the capabilities of computer graphics as the original did, but it still looks and sounds incredible and it is one hell of a lot of fun!",TRON - Legacy
503,peanutsticks,Exceeded My Expectations,8,22 December 2010,"A meaningless revisit of 1982's TRON with updated special effects was my worst fear going into seeing TRON: Legacy... and thirty minutes in this movie seemed to be just that. By this point the younger Flynn has been sucked into the grid (a disappointing two-second camera zoom effect when compared to the original's iconic sequence), initiated with his grid gear (awkward and overly geeky two-to-four minute sequence), and then forced to compete in the standard Frisbee and Light Cycle games (which aside from the awesome 'de-rezzing' effect upon death were pretty uninspiring... I actually preferred the original versions despite 'inferior' special effects.) It would have been nice if they went out on a limb here and tried to invent a few new games, but I suppose for an audience who has never seen the original its no big deal.Thankfully, soon after, Flynn meets his father and the movie's purpose is finally revealed. A father and son wishy-washy story? Thank God no! But rather the origins of the main villain Clu, the events that led to the disappearance of the father, and the origin of the movie's heroine. Its a compelling back-story that takes the TRON universe to a whole new level. Accompanied by the soundtrack of Daft Punk, some quick hitting scenes, and some sexy vixens in skin tight spandex the movie from here on out seems to fly by towards its climatic ending. Certainly didn't feel like two hours.All said and done I thought this movie was great and to my surprise I enjoyed it more than the first. Definitely one of my favorites of 2010. Only problem? Its over and I'm left wanting more TRON!P.S. I saw this movie in the traditional 2D format.",TRON - Legacy
504,otherwoldlyreviewer,Verdict: Unforgettable experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,19 December 2010,"I just came back from watching this film. Put simply: it is A THRILL RIDE FROM START TO FINISH. Relentless in its execution, brilliantly acted with a straightforward storyline that everyone can relate to. I have never been a die hard Tron fan, but it left a solid impression on me since I saw it many many years ago and I have never forgotten it. Now, this sequel has done it for me as well.This film is the ultimate escapist's dream. The landscape of the cyber world is PERFECTION!!! Exuding the sense of that other world of sleek electrons with an underlying reality of being spawned by ""the user"", I can't imagine it being surpassed in its visual depth and clarity. The high level of detail in the structures and machinery of craft and vehicles is just eye candy. The GRANDEUR of the crafted world is SIMPLY AWESOME!!! As a 3D film, readers, believe me when I say to you Avatar doesn't hold a candle to it!!! The 3D has been used in this film purely and solely in the service of the movie, the story and the whole experience itself. Unlike Avatar, which was just a few hours of 3D images.I was exceptionally pleased by the acting, Bridges and Boxleitner are just veteran pros, Bridges' double act as Kevin Flynn/CLU should be case study material for acting students. Garrett Hedlund's acting was spot on, I thought he did a great job as the lead protagonist and the fact that he was unknown (at least to me) was even better. This guy will probably get some quality roles in the coming years. Olivia Wilde's take on Quorra could not have been bettered, I loved her unconventional nature and quirkiness. It was great fun to watch.The soundtrack by Daft Punk was a match made in heaven. Every stroke of their electronic chords moved you along the breathtaking movie experience that is TRON: LEGACY. They were the perfect choice for this movie and and I'm thrilled that the makers of the film chose them to help lead the viewers on this cyber-journey of a lifetime.The hugely entertaining action is stunningly and sense-shakingly enhanced by the CGI and 3D experience. With a fundamental story of the battle between good and evil, great acting and a visual experience that you will wish it never ends, this is a once in a generation film, just like its prequel. I'm thoroughly glad to have experienced it.Trust me: YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS FILM!!!",TRON - Legacy
505,ciubotaruoa,The return to art,10,23 December 2010,"I have to say that it woke me. I was expecting the usual... boring visual effects, the usual 3D thingy (probably an axe flying to me or some snow falling around me). But no, this time was different. I didn't even realized it's a 3D movie - completely forgot about it. How come?First I amazed by the music as in couple of seconds I was totally ""in the movie"". It catches you from the first moments and makes sure you stay tuned till the movie finishes. Initially I thought it's yet another copy of ""The Dark Night"" or ""Inception"" soundtrack. Oh how wrong I was. I am listening daft punk for some years now. Mostly because I love the video clips, myself being a huge fun of anime/manga. But nothing extraordinary... until Tron. With this sound track daft punk gets closer to the league of classics like Jean Michel Jarre and Vangelis.Then you get into the Tron world which is not pretty graphics nor cool visual effects. It's visual art. Everything is consistent, astonishing... breathtaking... beautifully simplistic. The good and the bad in simple colors.I will not say anything about the plot as I wouldn't like to spoil it for you.Overall Disney made a great job with this one.",TRON - Legacy
506,jfmccli,Toxic Regurgitation Of Nothingness (TRON),6,11 January 2011,"I hate to say it, but I am a child of the CGI generation. I enjoy mind blowing, erection inducing, so visually stimulating I need a towel special effectsI can't help it—perhaps it's genetic. However, that is not to say that I am not also a strong proponent of solid story structure, good acting, and, for the love of god, dialog not written by a comatose four year oldbecause I am—keep in mind that these are just fundamental expectations, not my only criteria for a good film. Essentially, I am just trying to make the point that while CGI is entertaining and it can certainly compliment a film, it cannot be its sole justification for being enjoyable—are you listening Michael Bay, you slimy c**t. This, as you most likely expected, brings me to Tron: Legacy.First off, I would like to say that the story of this movie is quite irrelevant when it comes to my judgmentit was neither here nor there; neutral, if you will. With that out of the way, now I can get down to the nitty-gritty—P.S. why is that a common phrase? Anyways, this movie was quite ridiculous. So, Flynn's son, Sam—Flynn being the protagonist of the first Tron— who after having his father disappear at a young age is now some renegade weirdo who scoots around on a Ducati stealing s**t from his own company—way to waste your time, idiot.Without giving away too much, he ends up finding his father inside ""the grid"" after Allen, another character from Tron, receives a page–yes, he still has a pager–from Flynn's old office phone–It's a shame Allen wasn't near a pay phone when he received this ridiculous page. Moving on, after Sam finds his way into ""the grid"" via the all too common trapped door and laser cannon combination, the movie then devolves into an incomprehensible mess of incredible CGI, computer cocktail parties, and a cacophony of conflicting characteristics from Jeff Bridges who has become some sort of odd flower-power guru who still vocally frequents the vernacular of a 1980s teenager.I can't bring myself to say that Tron: Legacy was terrible, but I will certainly say it wasn't good. I suppose the best way to put it would be to say that it was idiotically entertaining. I suspect it will make several appearances on the top ten lists of many old virgins (see photo) and mental patients.",TRON - Legacy
507,robotradiohead,Disappointing and uninteresting,1,20 January 2011,"First thing I want to say is that I was very annoyed that they only showed it in 3D at the theater. It was a waste of extra money: I kept my glasses off during the intro and when they were in the digital world I didn't really notice when it was 3D.The story wasn't interesting. It was annoying that it hinted at the Holocaust and Hitler (or any other fascist leader, doesn't matter): ""genocide"" of the ISO's, one person leading the rest to ""perfection"". I didn't see why Clu would bother entering the real world. If he can send a page to someone in the real world, he might as well just hit the systems of countries or banks, whatever -- what Master Computer wanted to do in the original.The characters were cliché and flat. It almost seems like movie makers take the same characters but put them in another jacket and story every time. There wasn't much dialogue and it still sucked. They used stupid one-liners you might've heard before. (Maybe not the exact same words, but the reaction to a certain situation, the way and the tone in which it is said is the same in a lot of movies.) Tron, or Rinzler didn't make sense to me. OK so, first he was a good program who believed in the users, then a while later in the New System CLU turns against Flynn/users and turned Tron into Rinzler. Rinzler's hunting down Sam, but then, in their...aerial pursuit.. he changes, goes ""...I fight for the users!!"" and crashes into Clu. Maybe I missed something, but I thought that was very random. (And why does his head whir?) The digital world itself was pretty wrong. You got that computer-feeling in the original Tron, but in Tron:Legacy it felt more like being on another planet. Dust blowing up, wind, curves, spilling blood (that drop), ... it all seemed wrong to me, because I always imagine a computer world to be more straight lines, 010101,pixel, etc.I had the impression they were advertising in the movie as well. Ipad, Nokia, mascara, ... I wouldn't normally care, but it was obvious when one of those girls were staring at the camera for a second too long.The only good thing about Tron: Legacy was the film score. Daft Punk did a great job! It really fit the idea and gave the right feeling. I still feel thrilled when I recall the intro of the movie. I almost wish they had just made the movie themselves, they would've done a better job.I'm not surprised that Tron wasn't a good movie. It's obvious that it's just another dump Disney made purely for the money. The Disney from my childhood is pretty much dead now.Anyway, if you haven't seen Tron: I wouldn't bother. Especially not if it's only in 3D; it's not worth the extra money. Unless you like Daft Punk and want to listen the music while eating eye candy.",TRON - Legacy

I can't remember the last time I paid to see a movie twice. The first Tron is one of my favorite movies of all time and this sequel lives up to it without a doubt. The story was great and connected well with the original plot. Visually you are not going to find a better looking movie. Same goes for the audio. The acting also is top notch and well done. I HIGHLY recommend seeing this movie before it leaves the big screen! I also haven't purchased a DVD in several years, but I will be buying both the DVD and soundtrack. Oh, last but not least, don't be thrown by this being a Disney production. The first Tron and this movie are anything but the average Disney film. End of line.",TRON - Legacy
509,brockwilson,never been so stunned by special effects in my life!,9,3 March 2011,"This movie within about the first two minutes of it, and then 10 minutes after that, contains the most groundbreaking, and mind blowing visual/special effects I have ever layed eyes on. The score accompaniment is such that I almost cried, and Jeff bridges and the new guy aren't bad either. I though it was a very decent sequel to continue the series, being that the story, and acting aren't as bad as critics claim. They're just looking for too much in a movie these days. That's the only plain and simple way to say it somewhat politely.If your looking to get out reality for two hours of your life and watch an emotional story of a bond between a father and son, mixed with the complications of a very (now dark, deceptive) computerized world, I suggest you take a view of this masterpiece in modern day film making.PS: If you like Electronica/Orchestral music as much as I do, a tear may even sprout from your eye at some point throughout the feature.",TRON - Legacy
510,JacquesStrappe,Tron: Legacy should have been much better,5,10 April 2011,"I am a big fan of the original, having purchased the VHS when it came out. I also purchased the 20th anniversary DVD, so when plans were announced to make a second Tron film, I was extremely pleased.The movie starts out in 1989, where Kevin Flynn is tucking his 7 year old son in, talking about the digital world. He has finally made a breakthrough, and as he goes into work that night, you sense that something is coming. Kevin Flynn is never heard from again.Fast forward 20 years...Encom is in disarray, Flynn's son Sam is majority shareholder but could not care about running a company, and corporate greed take over from the board of directors. Sam returns to his father's old arcade, where he finds a secret passage hidden behind the Tron game. He finds a touch screen panel, and after getting access to the system, he is digitally transported onto the grid, the digitized world. At this point, I had no complaints whatsoever.And then the movie fell flat. From then on, it seemed to be like they were merely going through the motions. The script was less than stellar, there was not enough Bruce Boxleitner, and Mr. Hedlund, who plays Sam, was really quite plastic.This movie had exceptional special effects, but a movie with only that going for it is still not that good. It had none of the charm of the original, and apart from a few cute references to the first film, there was virtually no humor.I spent $5 to see it on a PPV movie channel, and that really is about what it is worth. You'd think after contemplating a sequel for 30 years, they could have come up with something far better. Disappointing is the best word to describe this film.",TRON - Legacy

For all the sequels that weren't made and the ones they made instead, to the tiring remakes and endless reboots and total lack of imagination, this film makes up for it. From the start of the movie to the Disney Logo at the end this movie will captivate you. You don't NEED to have seen the first one but who are we kidding, it does make a difference. And if you have never seen Tron, that is just sad. ""The Dude"" Jeff Bridges is amazing and funny. Garett Hedlund is great, Olivia Wilde is gorgeous and kicks major butt, Bruce & the rest of the cast fit in like a glove and make everything work. The updated world is just amazing. The music is awesome, a couple good oldies that will make you reminisce on the 80's. There is not one thing about this movie that i didn't like.

The film delivers and explains all you NEED to know and then develops its own story. The characters are clear and concise and visually this film is amazing!

Story, good follow up to the original Tron. Cast, sexy choice. Costumes and engines, well, you know what everybody was waiting for, YES, the light cycles, AAAAAMAZING deadly pursuites. Despite all the dazzling CGI sfx in the movie it's not really a big surprise compare to all of nowadays sci-fi movies sfx, just an inch above them all. Personally I've been more fantasmed by the original TRON's sfx back in 1982 'cause it was the first of it's kind. The 3D worked fine, even better than Avatar's if you ask me, that didn't meet my expectations unfortunately. Overall it's a great movie for your buck, just a little tip, no need to use the 3D glasses till sam Flynn jump into the computer world. But to be honest, for us, hardcore fans like me (I was 14 then) that have had the luck to see the original TRON back in 1982, despite all the awesome dazzling CGIs, Legacy didn't come as close as the first one for it's marvellous world of sfx (for it's time which was the first of it's kind).",TRON - Legacy
515,Wednesday_Next,gorgeous but lame,5,26 December 2010,"Granted, the original wasn't Shakespeare. But surely for a tiny fraction of the budget, they could afford a decent writer. Or maybe just one. It feels like it was written by a committee of people who all hated each other. The two teens I saw it with rewrote it with about 6 variations on the drive home, all of which were superior to the movie.Absolutely beautiful, but it felt like postcards, filled with dropped story lines and utterly inconsistent internal logic.

518,tobyrodwell,Underrated and Awesome,10,31 August 2016,"Yes this borrows a bit from the first movie, but who cares when it looks and definitely sounds that good! Daft Punk's sound track absolutely killed it in the movie and should have won more awards. Jeff bridges was, as usual, amazing, while Clue did not have the best CGI, I forgot that because the story was so fun and Clue was a very compelling villain, you understood why he was committing the actions he did. Oh and the action was brilliant, all of the battles were stunning and riveting. Gareth Hedland was great as ""The Son of Flynn"" and had great chemistry with Olivia Wilde, who was also great. Tron was a total Bad ass in this movie and made me want more. Another character I wanted more of was Michael Sheen's Zeus (I believe that's how his name is I may be wrong) and he was funny, very honest and bad ass. Again though, DAFT PUNK WAS AMAZING. I still listen to their sound track, in fact I am while writing this! I loved this movie, amazing CGI, great performances, good story, a lot of feels, has good humour and amazing sound track. If you have not seen the movie, please go see it, hopefully I have not spoiled too much. :) 10/10 amazing experience and also a cool use of 3D as well. :)",TRON - Legacy
519,marcusnewton,"A beautiful film with an awesome soundtrack, but a so-so storyline",8,21 December 2017,"So, after being only 1 year old when the first Tron came out, getting to watch it decades later in the late 90's didn't really feel like anything special. However, thinking back to what was on the Silver Screen in the early 80's it's easy to see what a masterpiece the first Tron was and how original the storyline truly was. This film, is not nearly as original sadly. However, it does have a couple of redeeming qualities, none the least of which is the banging soundtrack by Daft Punk. It is SUBLIME how good it is. The visuals are quite fantastic as well... they give a quality to the grid that 1980's Tron would be jealous of. While the original had more heart, this has more beauty. Where the original had more soul, this has more flash and pizzaz, if you will. The only redeeming quality of the film is at the end where something major happens to the protagonist. Other than that, it's a standard quest driven story, go here, to get this, to go there and get that. As a person who has lost someone close to me, this film resonated with me. If that isn't you, it probably won't for the same reason. That's why I gave it as high as I did. If I hadn't had to deal with that loss, this movie would have got a 7 stars. Yet, the way it handled that part of the story was quite good, and gave closure to a decent sequel to the first Tron, in my opinion.Just let this sink in... my review is of a movie that is now over 7 years old, and yet the music still feels as fresh as it did then. If nothing else, watch this movie for the MUSIC!",TRON - Legacy
520,travisstrum,Where is Tron 3?,10,1 September 2019,"This movie has everything going for it. It should be viewed as a classic in my opinion. One of the greatest of our time. The soundtrack alone is a masterpiece, but then you a have a meaningful story, wonderful acting and the visual effects are incredible! 10/10 all of the way in my book.",TRON - Legacy
521,saltandpepper66,Unbelievably Awful,1,25 December 2010,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, a typical example of Hollywood's ability to use special effects gloriously but at the service of an incomprehensible, boring and inane plot. What happened in this movie? I dare anyone to explain it. All I know is that ""important"" things kept happening and Jeff Bridges kept having sudden explanations for why things happened that came out of nowhere. Well, not out of nowhere, out of the desperation of screenwriters who had no idea what their movie was about. In the annals of special effects blockbusters that have no ideas, no plot, no emotion, no characterization, Tron: Legacy is the ultimate disaster. Don't go to see it.",TRON - Legacy
522,rwl1964,Special Effects are not the only thing that makes this movie GREAT!,10,18 December 2010,"I will only add a few spoilers but nothing that ruins this movie experience. So don't worry I only clicked on that check to cover my lower backside. Now read on without fear, I will not put you on the game grid.I have to start off with pointing out that almost every review I have read says that this movie is only good because of the special effects. The acting, the script, the story, the young Flynn (Jeff Bridges) and the rest is described by most as being either poor or mediocre. This is simply not the truth at all. I won't call the performances Oscar winning but they are actually very solid. (WAAAAAAAY better than Avatar for acting!) I love the bar scene for instance, tell me I am wrong go ahead I dare you. The Mad Hatter played by Johnny Depp is less convincing than Michael Sheen in this similar role. Zuse at the bar is a great scene and there are many more. When Sam takes the trip to the Grid he shows incredible emotion and it is all spot on as he realizes what is happening. This is a very hard set of scenes to act well and he nails it. The digital face of Clu or younger Flynn is one of the best digital recreations of the human face done to a VERY high degree and I respect just how far animation has come in the last 5 years alone. People have this part just plain WRONG. Really the Clu character or younger Flynn is just plain awesome. He talks fine, and smiles VERY life like and all that, so go watch the movie again and appreciate it more because you got it all wrong if you think there is a problem here, what the heck are you people looking at?Now we all agree the soundtrack is great. The techno music is perfect. I can't stand and say bravo enough about the wonderful music. So I will leave this alone since everyone pretty much likes or loves the music. OK, the story has some flaws, but nothing serious at all. It is all tied together nicely and we see there is a complete tie in for everyone and everything for the most part. I am not sure why Tron decided to become a fighter for the users again, I think because he was close to Flynn again. This is a weakness I found. There are not very many moments like this in the movie. The script is well written and I love the plot. I love the ISO concept. How many people understand what the ISO is all about? I bet not many.I love the nostalgia too. It really keeps true to the original and ""upgrades"" it all BIG TIME. Who thinks that is a stupid part of the movie? Not too many I think. It is obviously another thing that makes this movie great.OK, are we suppose to be mad because they got good looking people to play the younger characters? They are good looking and they can act too, so get over it will you? I think the problem may well be that the special effects are so great that even good acting looks flat against such a super back drop. Let's face it the special effects blow even Avatar out of the water. Yup, it totally and completely blows it away. The acting in Avatar sucks by comparison and almost everyone agrees that Avatar is a great movie. Tron is a great movie and now gives any movie on the market a run for it's money. It will be on my top 10 list of movies of all time. OK, here is another thing I read many times. It rips off the Matrix and steals from Star Wars. Nope, it really doesn't at all. Again, be specific if you are going to take that stance. Say hey the concept of going into a cyber world is the same. Remember in the Matrix they never actually go to the cyber world, but in Tron they actually do make a physical transformation. It is completely different and what is like Star Wars? Explain yourself please. I know there are certain apparent rip offs that may be unavoidable, but there is no blatant rip off anywhere in the movie. So what if they did anyway? Isn't most art nothing more than a rehashing of old popular themes?I have to talk about the special effects for a minute. They are out of this world, and they are not too over the top since this movie truly calls for this type of super special effects. I love the special effects and these effects are part of what makes it a great movie but there is much more to this movie so go see it, it is a must see movie.",TRON - Legacy

524,J-102,Slight feeling of emptiness,5,25 December 2010,"After the credits rolled i could hear various comments of ""average"", ""poor"" and even a ""sh-t"" was to be heard. first 30 mins... average second 30 minutes ... awesome.... third 30 minutes...OK last 30 minutes...poor..so Since i was such a big fan of the first one it may have sullied my view but then again others may think different The 3d was impressive at times.. but it was no Avatar in that respect. Not enough cool action scenes. More of those cool two legged flying ships.. no cursor!! The lightcycles were great and really wanted more of them but however there were too many flying things and the whole thing about TRON was that it was kinda based on a game, this one isn't.. its like the MATRIX in fluro at times.. witch is probably the reason it sucked a bit cos I'm talking about the Matrix Revolution... not the first MAtrix.. Oh well5 out of ten",TRON - Legacy
525,shroberts,I just need more,3,28 December 2010,"I saw this moving Christmas Eve, and watched the original a week before (after seeing it when I was 10). At its very core, the plot of Tron is so pathetic, so lame, such a bad idea, neither of these two films should ever been made. But for some insane reason, Disney has invested massive amounts of cash in the projects not once, but twice.Let's get this straight, deep down inside the computer, 'programs' walk around, in humanoid form, looking like the 'users' who programmed them, and play bizarre games in some physical realm--to the death??? um.. These programs also have hopes, and fears, and long for freedom. What?? They also have flamboyant personalities, and love, and dream of getting out of the 'grid' and see the real world??? HUH??? Maybe I am a 'geek', who has been programming computers for 27 years, but I refuse to believe that the general populous of this planet are dumb enough to get their heads into this idea. When I re-watched the original, I was a little shocked at how bad an idea it was. But I figured, it was 1980, and not that many people really knew anything about computers, and it was understandable. I figured when they made a sequel, they would divorce themselves from this plot a little, and come up with some moderately palatable explanation to what we are watching. Then the other night, I sat in on the opening scene of ""TRON: Legacy"", and Jeff Bridges is narrating some dream-like sequence, talking about how he ""started to wonder what the information looked like moving across the grid. Did it look like little cars and people walking around on city streets?"".. my mind was ablaze. I immediately knew, they didn't update a thing, they didn't make the slightest effort to make any of it make sense. And the rest is history.They simply spent 300 million dollars making one of the best looking films I've ever seen, and piling it on top of a foundation of feces. Its a giant 3,000 story building, built on a pile of dung. It looks great for a few minutes, then sinks in, falls over and explodes. By the end of the film, it just gets more and more lame. More and more happens with absolutely no explanation. I tried to put my head around what really makes me so angry about it all. I have thoroughly enjoyed some lousy movies with bad plots. I don't even have a problem with the basic premise of 'humaizing' some element of this world, in movies like Toy Story, A Bug's Life or Cars. I think what it comes down to, in action type movies, I don't care if its really truly believable. I don't care if Clint could really have been faster than all six of those guys he just gunned down. I just don't want the movie, and its plot, to INSULT me. Tron is so bad, the whole time I sat there I felt like I was being robbed of my lunch money, over and over again. I felt like I went to see a freak show, and the two headed cow is just a normal cow with a second head spray painted on the side of its neck. At the end of the day, Hollywood must do better. I need more. Its not enough to make a beautiful movie with nifty looking stuff flying around. It still needs to be a movie. Tron Legacy is nothing more than a laser light show--you are just as well off watching it with the sound off.",TRON - Legacy
526,phaota1,Spectacular. Don't miss it.,9,21 December 2010,"TRON LEGACY exceeded our expectations 100%. Ignore any and all negative reviews you have read or heard about, especially from Roger Ebert. After he bad mouthed the hilarious classic Tom Hanks comedy, The Money Pit, back in the 80s, I stopped listening to him. If you are a fan of the original, as well as the sequel game, TRON 2.0, you will absolutely love the movie. Even if you haven't seen or played the original film or TRON 2.0, you will still come out of viewing LEGACY with a big grin. The 3D is perfectly done, making the world very realistic in feel. Like in the original, the Light Cycle race in the arena is spectacular and beautifully done. I could not stop grinning through the whole thing, it was so enjoyable to see. The acting is top notch. Sure, there are quiet moments with somewhat lengthy story telling, but it never hurt the flow or film IMO.I've read on a lot places that everyone loves the soundtrack by Daft Punk and I have to put my positive vote in with them. They created a masterpiece for the killer soundtrack. Even the two 80s songs used in Flynn's arcade before Sam goes into the digital world were chosen perfectly for the lyrics of the moment.There are tons of homages to the original TRON film that any fan will pick up on, both audibly in the sound effects and visually. My all-time favorite homage, though, isn't part of the TRON universe at all, but from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Flynn's hideaway is entirely based on the set at the end of 2001, with the square-panel lit-up flooring and white Victorian-ish furniture. Even the sounds of the silverware clicking in the quiet room during the meal is reminiscent of when Dave is eating in the sterile, minimalistic space from 2001. Being a BIG fan of that movie, it just made me smile to see that.The biggest jar-dropping situation of the whole film is in the technological advancement in CGI, especially with outstanding performance of Jeff Bridges digital double, Clu. He is perfect in every detail. You will never believe that he is a digitally de-aged Bridges using the same, but better, program system from the film ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" to make Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett both young and old.It was also nice to see that the makers of the film did not totally ignore the original movie's prequel game, TRON 2.0. Legacy's world is a sort of Galapagos environment within Kevin Flynn's advanced, but small, computer system below his arcade that has been sitting their for 20 years without any outside connection to the Internet. So, the story is a stand alone situation that isn't connected to the former prequel game that dealt with Alan Bradley and his son, Jett. That digital world involved the ENCOM computers and Internet. But, the makers of LEGACY did incorporate architectural elements from the game into LEGACY, which was nice to see. Go see TRON LEGACY when you can, especially in 3D. Forget IMAX 3D version unless you really want to spend a lot of money and have your eardrums blown out. The Mini-Max screens are not true IMAX anyway, just big widescreen movies with a way too loud sound system. True IMAX would be on the huge screens they have that make you feel like your in the movie's world. The normal Disney 3D screening is excellent. The only thing I did not like was the ticket price. Up to recently, I used to pay $7.50 for a matinée showing. It's now jumped to $12. That is way to pricey for matinée.",TRON - Legacy
527,noelmckeown,Tron it in the bin,2,3 January 2011,"Terrible film besides some of the effectsI'm big sci-fi can but the dialog and storyline was just so bad.

I liked the previews and enjoy 3D movies. This movie had many things going for it, cool costumes, set designs, great special effects, what I thought would be a compelling story. Frankly I was bored and I've been trying to figure out why... After seeing Avatar earlier this year I guess I was expecting another movie of that quality. 3D was not necessary for this film in the way it was used. I expect things to fly out and be much more, well 3 dimensional, my companions and I thought we had defective glasses.

No matter how much I wished to love it, I didn't. I love out there sci-fi. Although I had read negative reviews, I still wanted to give it a chance so, my friend and my self went to see Tron:Legacy. The 3D was a nonentity. The original had that dimensional look at the time and was better. Good to say something positive. The story seemed mechanical and forced, the script was sleepy...Oh! After an hour, I checked my watch 4 times before the end. I wished so much for this to be spacey and wonderful and, in, the end, both my friend and my self agreeing, the music by Daft Punk was the best part of it and without it, it was a non entity.

532,adnixon,Culturally impoverishing drivel. I switched off after 30 minutes.,1,5 January 2013,"I watched about half an hour of it and then switched off the TV. It was wasting my time. Saw the original as a young man of 24 in 1982. I found it shallow and childish even then, though I enjoyed the special effects and the plot concept of a virtual world, because computers were fresh and new then, nobody owned one at home, and few people had ever played or seen an arcade game of the sophistication represented in Tron, least of all me, and the Internet was pure science fiction in '82, looked forward to only by a few Heavy Metal readers, of which I was one. Tron '82 nicely tickled these fancies. But while the computing world has evolved a thousand percent in the thirty years since 1982, Tron Legacy has evolved only 1 percent beyond Tron. Tron Legacy is just plain flat-out boring, with a ludicrous script that's meaningless and all over the place. It depressed me that this is the impoverished level that American culture has stooped to feeding its youth with, the film's cultural subtext being that so-called 'vintage' computer games of only thirty years age be held in the same awe and historical significance as ancient Egypt, Rome, Homer and Shakespeare. God help America.",TRON - Legacy
533,garyclarke,Best 3D So far - Stunning Entertainment.,10,10 January 2011,"What an awesome mind-blowing enjoyable film. I don't understand why the critics where so negative towards this superb film. I don't go to the cinema for intellectual stimulation, I can read a book or watch a complex plot on the small screen for that. I want to see a film that I can sit back and be entertained by without any effort from me, which takes full advantage of the big screen, big sound 3D medium - boy does this film deliver such! The sensations: of motion, of falling, of flying where extraordinary - the virtual world was breath-taking – the music was also superb - this is a fantastic film for all ages, a stunning experience in 3D Imax. I am now going to buy my own quality 3D glasses so I can go again and enjoy even more. My only negative comment is aimed at penny pinching Odeon (Cardiff) not the film – because they provide such rubbish plasticy flimsy glasses, especially considering what they charge for tickets, on their rubbish web-site, which would not let me book seats where I wanted towards the front even though the whole block of seats here where completely empty when I arrived 1 hour later !",TRON - Legacy
534,wooly_ompus,Looks great but.....,5,17 December 2010,"I first watched the original Tron earlier this year and even though the special effects hadn't aged well, I was still impressed. The story was simple yet told rather well, the art direction was inventive, the acting was pretty good and unlike so many other live action Disney movies there wasn't any musical numbers or annoying sidekicks. So 30 years on how does the sequel hold up to the original?Visually this movie looks beautiful. The art direction looks better than before due to updated special effects and the cinematography really helps to make the world of The Grid look stunning. From the Light Cycle battles to the barren wastelands outside the main city, Tron Legacy is easily one of the best looking movies of the year. Unfortunately apart from the visuals Tron Legacy does not offer much else. The story centres on Sam Flynn, son of the main character from the original Tron, Kevin Flynn. When Sam was very young his father Kevin went missing, many people thought he either died or ran off with all his millions and even though he had no evidence to back him up Sam always thought something else happened to his father. Years later Sam receives a message from an old family friend telling him where his father is, interested Sam goes to see if the message is true. While searching for his father at his old arcade, Sam accidentally gets transported to the world of The Grid. There Sam learns that Clu, a program created by Kevin to help create The Grid, has imprisoned Kevin inside The Grid for all these years. It is now up to Sam to defeat Clu and get his father back to the real world. The story for Tron Legacy is actually pretty good when you sit down and analyse it, unfortunately the movie doesn't present the story that well. The biggest problem with the movie is the pacing. It's extremely slow yet it shows off everything and anything to early and too quickly. The Disc Battles and Light Cycle races are shown off so early and so fast they feel like a blur almost. After these two action scenes, which are back to back, the rest of movie slows down completely and feels like and utter bore. The characters spew exposition upon exposition for so long you wonder if you just missed another movie in the franchise. It's not what their talking about is bad, it's just that they talk about it show much and show you so little the movie ends up feeling like the third in a trilogy instead of a real sequel. The other big problem with Tron Legacy is the characters and dialogue. The dialogue is laughably bad at times, especially this one bit where Sam is explaining what the sun is like in our world which nearly made me laugh out loud in the middle of the cinema. Apart from Kevin, Clu and Tron all the characters are really dole and lifeless. None of them have great personalities so they come off as quite boring characters. Tron Legacy looks and sounds great; it really is a treat for the eyes and ears. Unfortunately when you look past the flashy visuals and great daft punk tunes Tron Legacy comes off as a rather lifeless, uninteresting movie that starts to bore you as you go along.",TRON - Legacy
535,gauravchauhan,Hire a Writer please.....,4,13 February 2011,"There was so much that could have been done with this story. I mean the scope is boundless a virtual world where well virtually anything was possible. Instead you keep waiting for the story to evolve and keep waiting for something to happen. Jeff Bridges is wooden, sure he has been alone for 27 years and the whole meditation has been keeping him sane but the whole mystical sage thing doesn't really work. At no point of time does one feel any empathy for any of the characters except Olivia Wilde in her vulnerable moments. Overall it was quite a letdown especially since I had dragged my wife (who is not a major science fiction buff) to show her how much fun it was.Its one of those movies where special effects give way to a good storyline. All in all a waste of good cash just see it on DVD.",TRON - Legacy
536,raulxb,definitely worth seeing,10,2 January 2011,"Tron is a movie that in my opinion has an unique concept. The first movie was innovative and always made me want a sequel. Tron: Legacy was i think a long awaited sequel for many people. You have to watch the first one to like it 100%. For the first viewers i think the Tron world is definitely worth seeing. The fact that is in 3D only makes the experience better, but don't expect many 3D amazing scenes because i don't think this is the strong point of the movie, even if it has very nice effects. One of the amazing things is that Jeff Bridges is playing as The Creator, even if almost 20 years have passed since the first Tron. I wish you a pleasant evening watching this movie !",TRON - Legacy
537,Grizeus,"TRON: Legacy certainly tries hard, but perhaps takes itself too seriously and loses the wit of the original.",5,29 December 2010,"In the early 1980's, Steven Lisberger imagined what it would be like inside a computer and a few years later, Disney came out with Tron. Yes, had some problems, but Tron more than made up for them with stunning visuals (for that time) along with witty characters and exciting sequences. In 2010, Tron: Legacy came out and people are watching it in theaters at this moment. Out of that, truly, came mixed reviews. Hard to know exactly where you stand on it, nothing is typical, the reaction is purely subjective. So now I subjugate you. My parents recorded Tron on a tape years and years ago when it played on Disney Channel. As a kid, I would attempt to watch it and turn it off soon after. Scared me to death. Years later, I picked it up again. And loved it. It took me to places I never had thought about before. As a novice CG artist, the animation blew me away, still does. Tron was funny, had some great lines and moments, and especially had incredible music that I still enjoy to this day. Now we move on to Legacy... I made myself so excited with this and watched the film with an open mind. I was hoping I wouldn't be disappointed, yet I was. Started out AMAZING. I was with it right until Sam Flynn enters the Grid. The CG done on Jeff Bridges was exceptional, the uncanny valley is certainly growing smaller. I could really feel for Sam, the beginning got me emotionally. Having seen the original film numerous times, I greatly appreciated and loved all the references to the first. Felt superior to all the others who had no idea what they were talking about. Legacy worked when it was doing that, that's what a sequel should do. It should not have a completely different feeling than the original and throw in a bunch of failing themes and bad emotional grabs. The only problem with any of the visuals of Legacy was Sam's journey into the Grid. I have to sigh. The original did it so much better... The sequence where Flynn get's sucked into the machine is so breathtaking and lasted around forty beautiful seconds. Legacy sucked in Sam in two seconds in an effect that is incredibly boring compared to the original. It just left me thinking, ""This is where they are supposed to show off how fantastic CG is nowadays... And they blew it"". The rest of Legacy suffered from boring typical dialogue and choppy pace. There were a few beautiful moments usually involving Olivia Wilde's incredible character, Quorra, but besides her there wasn't much depth or much of anything besides sparkling lights in this Grid. The absolute worst part of Legacy was the music... I'm sixteen, yet I don't understand the music of my generation. Kids nowadays get off to anything that has a pulse. I missed Wendy Carlos' score for the original. It successfully mixed orchestra and synthesizer. Daft Punk barely threw them together, most of their score consisted of a single motif repeated around seventy times with perhaps one chord progression. I'm not lying when I say that I can easily recreate most of their music in Garageband. So simplistic and redundant whereas Carlos sounds like Bach. Daft Punk could have redeemed themselves had they used any of the themes from the original movie. What makes Star Wars and Indiana Jones so classic? The continuing themes. Same composer throughout films. Tron Legacy had no chance to be at the status of those films when it had no music themes to tie it and the original together. I missed the wit of Tron. There were some very creative lines in there and computer and character build, but you forget you're inside a computer with Legacy. It could be the future of earth, for all you know.Verdict: I appreciated the small allusions to the original movie, but Tron: Legacy is much worse and suffers from issues with pace, story, music, and lack of creativity. Very sparkly and pretty, but where's the depth and heart? Even though the original lacked much of those qualities, it made up for it with wit and those fun qualities that 80's movies had.",TRON - Legacy
538,benparf,Mesmerising visuals and a beautiful soundtrack keep a shabby plot afloat,7,9 January 2011,"The neonlight-fest visuals of this Disney sequel will have you mesmerized. The best scenes are constructed with a beautiful surrealism, not too dissimilar from Kubrick's 2001. A Daft Punk soundtrack packs an impressive punch, as would be expected. The weak element of the film is a rather shabby plot that will make you either laugh or cry. Thankfully the audio-visual extravaganza bolsters enough oomph to keep the whole thing afloat. TRON: Legacy picks up where the original left off 28 year ago. Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund) is a young rebellious, cocky and arrogant twenty-something. He's one of those little rich kids that has been well and truly spoilt by millionaire daddy. Only daddy, real name Kevin (Jeff Bridges), has been missing for over two decades. Turn's out he's disappeared into 'The Grid' and couldn't get back. One day Sam manages to hop inside this virtual world too and they are reunited. Inside the parallel universe that is 'The Grid', the robot-people are referred to as 'programs'. The 'programs' are made to fight each other. In this sense it's a lot like Gladiator but without the lions and lot less heroic. But, to it's credit TRON boasts things that Gladiator forgot; there is a battle-to-the-death Frisbee tournament and some rather exciting cyber-motorbike battle scenes. Clu (Jeff Bridges) controls 'The Grid' and tells the programs what to do. He's the boss and an authoritarian one at that. He's a bit of a Hitler really. Kevin Flynn, who created the grid is forced to live in isolation outside of Clu's constituency for some reason or other. The real irony being that Kevin created Clu as a replica of himself a few years back. They are like those identical twins that love to hate each other except that Clu fails to age and has a CGI plastic shine. The plot really isn't that great. The father-son relationship is both awkward and clichéd. The whole narrative fails to build up to anything vaguely exciting. This is principally because the apocalyptic threat driving the over-heroic cheesiness really isn't that threatening. TRON isn't too dissimilar from Alice in Wonderland, in principle at least. These are not films that deliver anything much in terms of narrative. The true wonder lies in the discovery of another, slightly insane, world. But where Alice makes this overtly clear, TRON tries to mask it with attempts fit the traditional narratives. In this light, it's essentially a rather tragic Star Wars wannabe. The trouble perhaps lies with the word 'Disney.' This is a production for kids who are young enough to be coaxed into a cinema trip on the promise of popcorn from a reminiscent father. It was never going to be a gritty, daring or 'out-there' bit of film-making. TRON is worth seeing if only to indulge the senses. Take a trip to the cinema as the magic will struggle to translate into your living room, no matter how large your widescreen or expensive your 7:1s.",TRON - Legacy
539,brockrhodes,Waste of time....,1,1 September 2011,"Tron: Legacy is inferior to the original Tron in every way & is one of the worst movies I had the misfortune to suffer through. I saw it in IMAX 3D and still would have walked out had it not been the fact that it was the first night the theater was open. It's so shallow and tame I was offended. It was so horribly filmed it failed to make obviously gorgeous women in leather suits desirable. If you have any taste or sense, skip it or be sorry... The only redeeming quality this film has is its eerily good CG placement of young Jeff Bridges head on a younger actor. A more current Jeff Bridges is in the movie too, but instead of being kidnapped by the program from corporate headquarters like in the original apparently this time accidentally beamed off of The Big Lebowski set.",TRON - Legacy

I've watched it countless times over the years and I have never seen anything that compares as an overall project from cast, visuals, soundtrack, and everything else. The soundtrack could not have been any better. Daft Punk was a perfect choice.Tron:Legacy was a visual masterpiece in 2010 and still, a decade later, is one of the most impressive visual experiences available. The facial animation of younger Jeff Bridges from 2010 is better than the young Mark Hamill in the Mandalorian season 2, from 2020.I still eagerly await developments on the 3rd installment and will likely cherish and recommend this film for the rest of my days.Check it out on Disney+.",TRON - Legacy
541,drachirloyah,"Visually Striking, Emotionally Dull",6,21 April 2011,"Tron Legacy has something in common with 2009's Star Trek; it's modern, relevant, slick, stunning to look at and has some outstanding music and action set pieces. Where it differs however is where Star Trek succeeds the most; in plot. Tron Legacy doesn't have a terrible story but it doesn't capitalise on the high moments to give any real sense of satisfaction nor do moments of triumph completely thrill. It's frustrating because during the second hour when the plot is in full swing, it starts to feel improvised like the filmmakers are throwing random twists and turns in to make it more captivating. It backfires because whilst Tron is a treat on the eyes, on the brain it's barely anything satisfying.However the visuals cannot be overstated enough. Whilst Avatar is striking for creating a landscape that's believable whilst alien, Tron's world is like something out of a nightmare with black thunderous skies and bright lights in a metal city. From the first moment inside this world the first thing that comes to your mind is WOW. In a year where movies such as Inception, Scott Pilgrim and Harry Potter have produced great special effects, Tron Legacy is the one which blows them all out the water.The action is superb as well. Once inside this digital world the action begins and barely stops until the exposition begins after the first hour. Disc battles followed by an even more impressive and iconic light cycle battle is exhilarating. The only weakness in the special effects is CLU; the idea of making an older actor look younger has been done before and done a lot better (Benjamin Button). Whilst the template is there and there's enough evidence to show that the technique can be effective, the result here in Tron Legacy lacks expression or indeed any life behind the eyes.Casting is hardly anything spectacular but it's good to see Jeff Bridges and Olivia Wilde is very quirky and likable as Quorra whilst Garrett Hedlund is a capable lead. Michael Sheen however gives a very David Bowie-Esq performance in a rather strange segment but generally the characters can hardly boast to be anything special when you consider the storytelling weaknesses. As a directorial debut it is quite stunning and confidently directed by Joseph Kosinski who, whilst having a great grasp of the technical aspects of the movie, needs a lot of refinement in the handling of the human element.A great visual experience with just enough plot and excitement to make this more than a hollow effects driven blockbuster. Thumbs up for a sequel.",TRON - Legacy
542,md-ulus-n,One of the stupidest scripts I have seen acted out on screen...,3,5 July 2011,"Let's start with the positives. It is a visually ""pretty"" movie, and Jeff Bridges sort of does an alright job.Does ""pretty"" mean the effects are good? No, the effects are pathetically bad given the amount of time and effort that went into the film. It contains some of the least exciting and most predictable CG fight scenes I have ever seen... IN MY LIFE. But boy were they ""pretty"".The script was so pathetic it's barely worth discussing. It's kind of like debating the weird formless mumbling that issues forth from the mouth of a newborn. ""Was that a word, is it thinking, I mean, is the movie real, am I dreaming?"" What is this movie about? It's about nothing, it is nothing, it has no meaning.",TRON - Legacy
543,r-feeding,Are you serious?,3,17 December 2010,"It's really really really hard for me to understand all the ""OMG, ITS TOTALLY AMAZING! BETTER THAN THE ORIGNINAL!"" reviews. Honestly, this was total crap! I thought it could be something, since Mr. Bridges is a great actor, and the original movie was great. But no, crap, crap, crap! Cool visual effects, yes of course, but the story is crap and Garrett Hedlund... You call that acting? I seriously don't get it. Is it just because of the awesome special effects? Or the incredibly hot Olivia Wilde? Whats so good about this movie? But if all you want in a movie is 3D, cool visual effects and a cute Olivia Wilde... Well, go see it!",TRON - Legacy
544,ztlfire,Absolutely brilliant,10,25 December 2010,"This movies is by far the BEST visual stunning beautifully written and the soundtrack ...EPIC.The only complaint is that you're left with a huge sadness when it ends. You also find a few scenes seemed to have been shortened or missing ( when you compare them to the trailers) and even some scenes that should have been longer i.e The grid battle scenes....oh God that was such a beautiful stunning and soulful scene. Like the digital version of swan lake. Just absolutely breathtaking. Yet, it was so short! Long story short: we need a sequel because with Tron you can't go wrong. It has the potential of surpassing the Matrix.",TRON - Legacy
545,Pass_The-Popcorn,Not much of a virtual reality.,6,19 December 2010,"It is not about advancement in technology, it is about taking away, changing and ruining an original concept. There are no circles on a grid by definition. A grid is a grid; that is from the original and was the concept of the entire game Tron. In Tron Legacy the grid is no longer a grid (they make circles and jump ramps) although they name it one. The computer world is more Matrix style than Tron style and I think I heard a few quotes from star wars. They are in a virtual world yet you don't get that feel. the first Tron realised this fact. In my opinion I think it would have been a lot better had they of stuck with the original unique concept and made that into 3D. A micro chip is still a micro chip and the inside of a computer still looks more realistic in the original Tron where there were grids, electrons and circuits than Tron legacy where there is a house, mountains, parties and a cocktail bar. If there was no original 1982 Tron, this film would have been pretty good as far as effects go, (on a budget of 150 million pounds) however based on such a great movie it just really lets itself down and everyone else who appreciated and understood Tron.",TRON - Legacy

I looked carefully for any signs of Disney ""cheesiness, corniness or spoonfuls of sugar"". There was a tiny bit of it, that's why only a ""9"" rating instead of a ""10"". But, O.K. who cares? It's Disney with a definite edge, reaching for new territory, going hopefully into a Disney ""New Age"". Techo music by Daft Punk helped (a lot). Amazing, new, mind blowing special effects (the 3-D worked). The Matrix, Bladerunner, and Minority Report mixed and brought together in a new way. Amazing translucent vehicles appear and fly across the screen. There is understated but deep acting by Jeff Bridges. I liked the ""David Bowie"" character. The Villain was a real villain. The circumstances and plot of the movie were futuristic and timely. Hey, Interjections of Zen philosophy, great!There are Great Martial Arts moves with Discs! A strong and intelligent women character fights alongside our hero. Our Hero was real. An upbeat and amazing ending, displaying a coolness which was not the usual Disney stuff. I will see it again, so will you. The critics don't know what they are talking about.",TRON - Legacy
547,craigwilliams1964,Awesome effects/disappointing plot,6,30 December 2010,"The only reason I have marked this film with a 6 is because of the special/visual effects. They are truly spectacular. I saw the film in normal ""mode"" but wish I had gone to see it in 3D, as I feel it would be unbelievably superb.However, I don't think I can sit through the dire plot again. The script is weak at best, with no real continuity, we don't see the boardroom revisited from the opening scenes which leaves a sense of closure missing from the film. I saw the original movie and there is so much that could have been done plot wise, unfortunately - in my humble opinion - it was forsaken for the effects. There isn't enough about Kevin Flynn to justify where he has been for 20 years, no depth to his character, having said that Jeff Bridges has a good go at giving this movie some meaning, alas the same cannot be said for Michael Sheen, a truly great actor reduced to a camp role as a bar owner.If you like your effects then go and see the 3D version on the big screen, otherwise wait until you can rent it. Sadly disappointed :(",TRON - Legacy
548,antonio-pirespreto,3 for the visual impact,3,16 March 2011,"I would have to say 0 for the rest. I saw the first Tron when it came out. At the time it seemed very futuristic. The computers could barely do a complex polygon and seeing that kind of CGI was amazing. The bikes, the concept of the games was really something new. 30 years have passed and we would expect that the plot could be refined (we know so much more about technology). But what we get is some sort of a open source free OS diarrhea (bad company wanting to make money vs the good boy wanting to give everything for free) mixed with some awful acting and no attempt whatsoever to find a parallel between the digital and the real world that can be a little believable. It's just putting the ""normal"" world into a digital, immaterial one. Absolutely ridiculous. The film is boring to watch, has no plot, shallow characters like the poor Joker imitation and Daft Punk acting like... Daft Punk. Taking the bike concept to a flying ""thing"" with a turret and guns that throw XML (joking) ammunition is beyond ridiculous. It just destroys the whole concept. No wonder that the film has higher ratings from the under 18 segment. It seems that a show of light and a Ducati is enough for these kids to rate it 9 or 10. Save you money. Buy another BD or DVD. This one is simply not worth it. Even at $5 I would have to think if it's worth it.",TRON - Legacy

Its so crisp, dynamic and amazing it blows my socks right of. The amazing stunning CGI is super good! The Soundtrack is one of the coolest soundtracks ever. Combine this with a pretty good story and more than OK acting, you got yourself a really good movie! The story all by its self if just OK, its the total package that makes this movie amazing. Its kind of like an 2 hour amazing music video. Its perfect for demoing my home cinema etc. You need to see this in HD with DTS or better! You just NEED too!",TRON - Legacy
550,jeffsaremi,Marvellous Combination of Technology and Art,8,12 February 2011,"When you watch a movie 5 times in less than 2 months, in the theater, and you're still craving for more then at the very least you must tell someone about it.I rated Tron 8 out of 10, criteria wise, but that should not matter much to you. You watch TRON for its cool factor, the awe, the entertainment value. And in those it scores higher than any movie you've watched so far.TRON has created a never-before-experienced combination of sound and imagery. To experience this effect you must watch it on the big screen in IMAX. Then you'll feel the heart-pounding bass in the musical score. Scene after scene you'll be amazed of what you see to the extent that at sometime during the movie you'll realize your mouth has been wide open. That's the jaw-dropping magic of TRON! (as is said in the movie ""the awe was palpable"")The story of TRON is very made-up. There is a lot of technical babble which sound more like techno-hallucination. This especially manifests itself at the beginning and at the end of movie. However, if you get past that, if you buy into that, the rest is a story of hope, desperation, betrayal, struggle, and sacrifice (""taking one out of the equation"").The musical score is just beautiful to listen to even by itself. There's perfect sound editing to time the music to the scenes.From the perspective of computer graphics TRON scores as high as recent movies, if not higher. Everything is imagined to be translucent which allows you to see more of the excellent work they did in creating this digital world. I must mention that the best character of the movie (CLU), the villain, is a computer-animated character, probably one of the best human-face renditions ever.I'd be really surprised if the costumes, designed for this movie, don't make it in some shape or form to commercial products out there. We should at least see some concepts being adopted by the racing industry.The acting is very good and in the case of Jeff Bridges it's excellent as you'd expect; Extra kudos to him who not only acts as Kevin Flynn but also does the voice for CLU.The photography/cinematography is top of the line in TRON. They have gone all out. There are a few ""into-disk/away-from-disk"" scenes and then there is the most astonishing ""Elevator"" scene which cannot be described; all as examples.",TRON - Legacy
551,carter-veteran,A remake and a sequel both in one,7,21 February 2011,"I always wondered what the world would look like if I travelled into a computer? What would computer information look like through the first person perspective past the main board and CPU? Disney's Tron released in 1982 attempted exactly this creating a world that was part Science Fiction adventure and part video game. It was certainly like nothing people had seen before being the first movie to utilize C.G.I., fans of video games loved the: Atari style design, computer terminology, the fact it was like walking through a video game at the time. The movie developed a cult following but still bombed at the box office I guess it stretched a little to much for the average movie watcher.Over two decades later Disney decides to make Tron Legacy an attempt to reboot an old franchise as well make another money maker like Pirates of the Caribbean. The story takes place 27 years later, Sam Flynn son of Kevin Flynn from the first Tron finds himself looking into his fathers disappearance when he accidentally gets pulled into the world of Tron. Tron Legacy is both a sequel and a remake, the movie tries to establish itself as its own big budget special effects world of its own action movie and remake, while also trying to continue the story of the first one and being a nostalgic trip for fans of the original Tron. This is where Legacy fails for me because it runs into trying to many things at the same time some things are good while others aren't. First the good Legacy doesn't disappoint in terms C.G.I. and sound if you saw the trailers you know what to expect, the effects team really gave their all to upgrade the original Trons black and Neon light Atari scheme. The movie looks fantastic bringing up some very creative vehicles and locations as well as having some very cool action sequences. Tribute must also be made to the techno D.J.'s Daft Punk who go above and beyond in making a fully original soundtrack to further engage you in the movie; It continues to surprise me why they weren't nominated for best original soundtrack at the Oscars?Other then the C.G.I. and sound the movie does tend to have a weak plot for it all. Not that its bad but it seems to retread the original Tron (Disc battle arena, Light cycle fight etc.) more then going off and doing something new. There are some plot holes, moments that leave you going ""huh?"" here and there and some boring scenes that while aren't total snooze fests slow down the pace quite a bit. These are minor issues and really don't affect the overall experience so don't take them to heart, I'm just saying it could have a better narrative to tell with all the great stuff they do have in the film. The movie really is a worthy sequel and reboot to the franchise; It is a fantastic movie with great visuals and sound and while it does have some minor issues they really don't affect the experience of what the movie tries to do. Tron Legacy is one wild computer graphic techno trip and a I highly recommend you see especially if your a fan of the original.",TRON - Legacy

If only they had acted rather than played at being actors as much as they played at the land of tron being some other worldly special sacred place to which they did not deliver on making believable.I hope this is the end of tron.

554,james_wadsley,"TRON plus tight leather, minus any imagination",5,23 December 2010,"I first saw TRON as a kid and I loved it. I loved the idea that programs had lives and a world of their own. How could you watch the original TRON, presumably many times and only come away with the idea that the movie was all about people with glowing lines on their clothes? The new movie is all about superficial style over substance. However, even in terms of style the movie reeks of Matrix envy. Lets combine tight leather with glowing lines -- they never did that! Ha! Why is the dark sky in Flynn's Utopian Grid so much like the one in the Matrix future? The film repeatedly veers off like this into Matrix emulation instead of establishing style consistent even with its own plot.Plotwise, the first things that were jettisoned were those cute ideas from TRON that made the digital world, inhabited by programs, different. Cycles previously had to travel digitally -- vertically or horizontal but not any more! The plot devolved into a pale fantasy novel: Young hero opens portal to a strange land where red toned villain is intent on using the portal to invade our world! Fortunately the wise old wizard and the spunky princess/love interest help our hero save the day! It makes no sense that programs can travel out of the grid/computer. Even my kids could tell the writers had no idea about computers and no imagination to translate computing concepts. They just built a TRON-like world cargo-cult style. All the big plot components are randomly added as part of a general up-the-ante approach. All the side characters are just there to be victims. There is a complete lack of empathy from Sam for ordinary programs, a big component of TRON, and this is quite jarring.I went to see it for the imagery and effects, already aware that the plot was weak. I was quite disappointed in the effects though. They were flashy but predictable as was the fight choreography. I wish the people who own the rights to truly original ideas like TRON would stop giving the franchise away to the first pitch they get and dig deep enough to find out if the pitchers understand the premise of the original film. On behalf of the film-makers, I think a big apology is owed to the original writers and director. TRON is dead for me now.",TRON - Legacy

It just works so well in the movie. This Daft Punk guys are geniuses. And i keep listening to the soundtrack in the car.I simply can't get enough of it. The movie itself is good,visually stunning,awesome graphics(except CLU),but i gave it 10 mainly because the music. The story line is good and the father-son thing hit a cord with me. If you want to enjoy this movie i recommend seeing the first movie before this one.(Tron 1982). All together a very enjoyable experience(for me anyway)and worth seeing again.And i'll definitely do that.",TRON - Legacy
556,Tokyographer,When digital reality becomes physical,9,6 June 2011,"I would define this movie as a hybrid, influenced by science fiction classics like, Blade Runner, Matrix, Star Wars, Super Agent Cobra and Space Odyssey 2001. This movie has the combined DNA from my favorite science fiction/ fantasy movies and it deserves a 9 because of that. Tron Legacy's genes are among the best in the genre, adding to this a powerful music score and next gen computer animation. The women actresses seem like the materialization of 70's and 80's Japanese futuristic manga femme fatale, with the perfect bodies and faces. The only things where the movie stays short is on some of the supporting actors/actresses and unfortunately Jeff Bridges CGI version still needs some work.In conclusion I loved the movie and its definitely a keeper, repeater and recommender.",TRON - Legacy

However, you will quickly realize very little of the original TRON has survived, including a serviceable plot.The original TRON had the advantage of coming out when computers were new. It had a villain adequately played by David Warner as Dillenger and his counterpart Sark, who is controlled by a more evil force, the MCP.I am thinking though is there anything more significant here than a holographic adventure running in a computer somewhere? At worst case, Norton Antivirus should be able to eliminate Clu and his minions. The suspense, what there is of it, is totally without meaning.",TRON - Legacy

In the truest sense movies are a visual medium and this film was stunningly gorgeous. I really felt like I was inside of a game, even the music was comprised of the tones and sounds you would hear inside an arcade. If there was ever a concept for a film made for 3D viewing, this is it. And if you've never seen a movie in 3D on an IMAX screen, this is the one to see. A true work of art.

561,fuxan,What can I add? I guess my take. I was blown away!,10,29 December 2010,"My thesis: Tron Legacy hit me on every point. It far exceeded my expectations and more. It was an experience and I've seen this movie 4 times now and can't get enough. A sci-fi epic, please excuse the cliché.1. Engaging: I felt like I was in the grid myself. You don't need 1st person/POV to do that. The fluid like editing/story progression along with the visuals helped to that end.2. Visuals: Saw this in 3D every time (3 times reg 3D, once IMAX 3D...IMAX 3D is worth it). The lights and shadows with some natural ambiance along with picture perfect scenes every frame of every second. My eyes melted with glee.3. The Music: I have to mention the music, it was an orgy for my ears. Electronic beats with violins...can a sci-fi movie get any cooler? They did so with a clean, crisp element with more of the soul thumping, thematic, hit you where you want it to every bass drop, every snare, every fx...Daft Punk and friends gave us what we never knew we wanted. I can't get enough. I listen to every single track on the OST over and over again. They need to win every award possible for their work. Thank you Daft Punk, I now see the light.4. Sound effects: Just plain cool, man (I imagine Jeff Bridges reading this review out-loud as I type). Action movies...this is a new benchmark for you and listen carefully (as a disc bounces off a wall and derezzes a hapless program).5. Story: The overall story is not unlike a Greek tragedy of sorts. It just gave me that feel you know, but I didn't walk out emotionally drained rather emotionally uplifted and inspired really. The drive of both sides of Kevin Flynn his real self and CLU both intrigued me. CLU is more of an anti-hero to me rather than a villain...it's quite tragic yet reflective upon oneself and inner desires.6. What I ""saw"" in Tron Legacy: Themes of duality: Aside from the obvious white and red lighting, and Flynn vs CLU game, there are other deeper forms of duality here. The passive/more rational almost exacting side of Kevin Flynn vs his more chaotic, emotional, irrational side is evident.Perfection: I was pleased to see a movie bring up an important debate for a long time...perfection is truly unknowable and undefinable. Even conceptually it is vague. CLU represents another part of Flynn that was idealistic, naive, vain, and too calculating to see the big picture that's right in front of him...the beauty of chaos and our relationship to the world and others.Life: Who says life is any one thing? Who says what is not alive and alive? Put away your doubts as to a digital world where an ISO algorithm can be fabricated into a carbon based life-form being she/it was not before. More complex life or thought can meta-physically very well come from anywhere. Who's to say in one form a rock is not alive in a sense? A virus to me is neither alive nor dead according to definition as I understand it. The whole idea of complex form born of no intervention i.e. ""the variables were ideal"" is not far fetched. Brilliant research into the programming, philosophical and spiritual realms and wonderfully integrated into this film.7. Why I'm giving this film a 10. I felt it was a 10 every time I walked out of the theater. Even when I thought it through without my chaotic emotion, methodically I came up with pretty much the same figure. This movie is a well rounded 10 and is now in my top 10.Go see Tron Legacy in 3D...you will thank me. The End.",TRON - Legacy
562,demank,This is only a beginning of a legacy.,8,23 January 2011,"Well well, complaint is always easy to make, and even fun to do. How easy it is to pick on & on about the plot while indeed there aren't much else to complain about this film.Yes the plot is somehow simpler than what we ""spoiled"" viewers these days would expect from a movie with such a marvelous production. And indeed, the world of TRON, consistent yet multi-layered, chic yet dark, straight-forward yet inter-laced, does deserve one if not many ""MORE"" epic stories. But simple isn't bad, epic can be boring. Let's don't forget, this is just A movie, which is just a window that its MAKER* opened so we can peak into this vast & beautiful masterful of imaginary.The plot is simply a story of FATHER & SON, of their worlds apart yet a journey together, a dream realized yet torn apart. A father loves his son, and a son misses his father. Any other sub-plots on top of this isn't necessary. Yes, one can argue, there is so much in the plot to be developed, or to be explained, or to be completed. Like: - What is happening or will happen in the real world? - Some characters, systems or events can benefit from more consolidated development. - And what the world of TRON has as impact to religious, philosophical, political, economical dimensions our life (we do have glimpse of all these details in this movie). - And yes, yes, it misses some 'Kiss' or 'Sex' to spice up a bit here and there (and no we don't need that in the story.)But, let's ask ourselves, honestly, - Do we, really want to, have all these to be squeezed into 2 hours of film time and believe it can be made understandable & enjoyable? - Do we, really want to, sit there at the end of the film, sighing, omg, this is another ""cannot-stand-alone"" films with open, unnecessary suspense for the next in line of a monstrous Omega-logy of complicated names and over developed plot that can not even self-sustaining itself without external materials. - Do we, really want to wait painful for the next and the next next movies, because we were made to do so, & only to become more and more confused with what's going on?So, thank you, actually, ""the MAKER"" of Tron, to present us a rather simply but NOT at all boring story. It's a story of FATHER / SON love, and it's heart warming, breath catching and eye popping. After all we are humans, we have emotion as love/hate, which differ us from programs. Emotion, it's our weakness and our strength. Emotion can overwrite reasoning, logic, and all the rest. It's our imperfection, it is a movie of imperfection.So thank you again ""the MAKER"", for Tron Legacy is made with class and perspective. It has laid a very important milestone to the development of the world of TRON. It has bring this world ALIVE. And now it is up to our own imagination and creativity to fill this world with the depth of our own mind, and stories of our own inspiration. Cheers, for this is only a BEGINNING.PS. Needless to say the stunning visual effect alone is worth seeing it in the cinema. Worth seeing even if just regard it as a music video.PS. PS. Viewing of the original movie is not required but recommended because it will serve as enrichment of this ""Trontastic**"" world and will make a lot of events/objects more understandable or more enjoyable.

563,taw862,Overall,10,18 October 2014,"My issues with Tron: Legacy, some of which have been pointed out by other reviewers, Doug included. For a movie named Tron, there was very little of the guy. Yes and *spoiler* there was a character who was essentially tron, but he didn't come to being aware of this until the last 20 minutes.Granted it would have been hard to tie in a story with Sam, Flynn, Quorra, the ISOs, and Tron...but if the character's name is in the title, he'd better be in there and not a side character. In the original, we got to see more Tron and Alan, at one point even interacting to one another. In Legacy, we don't get that, though understandable.My other problem is when Zeus makes his appearance. I had a hard time taking the character seriously and before as soon as I heard reference of his name, I knew something was up.And then lastly, the CGI Bridges. At first, I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but there was just something about the appearance that didn't add up, and finally it was when I looked at his lip movements. They were realistic, but not to the point to convince me that this was a live actor.All in all, I love both movies, but Legacy's focus I think is in the wrong place. The father-son and creationism plot points are interesting, but they delved too much on the relationship rather than the things that needed to be discussed",TRON - Legacy

This sequel is a legacy like Star Wars Episodes 1-3 were. It takes the original world & concept, makes it hip and fresh for the kids and loses all the personality. There's plenty of special effects, neon, hot chicks, and cool music but all this does is make you wonder what on Earth (or Tronville - don't sue me Zynga) this has to do with the inside of a computer / network. The bar scene with Daft Punk is all well and good but again what does it have to do with the programs all the characters are supposed to be? The four ""hot chicks"" who put the suit on junior are just embarrassing for their exploitation - a light-cycle can ""res-in"" but his outfit has to be done piece by piece? This movie is Tron in name only. The title character may as well not be there and it lacks the cachet(?) of the original movie.On the other hand if you don't care about the original movie, realise it's the first of a supposed trilogy so has an incomplete story, forget any logic about being inside a computer, like models in bodysuits, wish you too could ride a Ducati, and enjoy Daft Punk, then it isn't so bad after all.",TRON - Legacy
566,tgnarl,One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.,1,30 December 2010,"I saw the original and enjoyed it a lot. It was original and had a good story. The idea of entering a world inside a computer chip was cool. And it was rendered well and believable. I had heard reviews of the new movie and so I wasn't expecting much in the way of a story or characters. So I was planning to enjoy the 3D and special effects. Well, those were a disappointment. The characters and the story were so lame that it overwhelmed and special effects. I was ready to walk out of the theatre after 20 minutes. It did not get better. What a waste of $16 and 2+ hours. Save your money and your time. Go see ANY other movie.",TRON - Legacy

568,everything_I_Think,like buying a new computer that wont connect to the internet.,1,27 January 2011,"For months now the mainstream film media have been building this up. To me it was an utter failure of combined elements that could have worked if they had only paid for a decent writer to make it at all interesting. I seriously expected so much more, if not from the plot then from the action sequences. The light cycle scene was cleverly updated but lacked any tension being placed so early on in the film - it was so obvious that the generic programmes would bite it and not at all exciting watching both Clu and Sam simply show their feathers a little only for a completely random previously un-introduced (and a bit lame) element to interfere (tension!!!)-. Then talking. Then dinner and talking. Then Micheal Sheen being a nonce. Then Talking. Then badly staged fight scene without anyone really knowing why. Then talking and sitting on a slow moving toilet brush, talking. Meditation. Then Clu turns into a motivational speaker. Bit more random fighting. Wheres the disc and why is it so important? Why? Then over long chase sequence which did look quite pretty. Then we realise just how spiritualistic Flynn has become for the 100th time. BlahBlah.Avatar had cutting edge 3d special effects which fitted to the filmmakers priority of bringing the viewer into another world. Tron Legacy also has this priority. The difference: The world of Tron is a horrible, absurd place to have to stick your head into for 2 hours. I remember leaving the cinema after watching avatar depressed at how sad our world looks compared with pandora. I left the cinema laughing after tron legacy. And not especially interested in playing a computer game, ever again. Avatar was luckily supported by a half decent script and good acting. Tron fails in all of these areas.Nothing in this film caught my interest other than my concern for Sam's adorable little dog and my unanswered wonder as to who is feeding him whilst Sam is in Tronland following the yellow brick road. And I have to say that the Jeff Bridges effects failed to impress me. I think the official terminology is Digital Botox and the human eye is yet to be tricked. In fact the closer the cgi boys get to realism the more annoying it is because it is uncomfortable to watch something of two worlds. Either way I don't know if Clu was supposed to express any charisma or not, I would say the effects ruined the performance of Bridges. Technological achievements like this are only valuable if they add something to the art of performance. In this case they were annoying gimmick.I Don't recommend this movie to anyone, especially not younger children as it is dark without any sense to balance it out and far too confusing to be fun.",TRON - Legacy
569,lpireyn,Complete heap of garbage,3,25 March 2011,"As much as I'm a fan of the science-fiction genre, I had to force myself to watch this movie to its end, and only did so in three painful sessions.This movie is empty: there is no plot, no twist, no character, nothing.The only things worth mentioning are:1. The nice and original CGI: granted, the way the bikes and other vehicles are ""instantiated"" is cool. But then the races suck.2. The music: if you like Daft Punk, I'm told they did a very good job.3. Quorra is not the ugliest girl around.Hence my 3/10.The rest is a long and boring succession of inconsistencies, goofs and nonsenses. The whole scenario could be summarized in a short sentence, but I won't even bother. The actors are lifeless and look like programs even before they enter ""the network"". This movie is a bad compilation of the worst moments of the Matrix trilogy, and succeeds in making them even worse.Disney could have saved millions of $ by making a 5-minute video clip featuring Quorra riding her cool bike while listening to Daft Punk.",TRON - Legacy
570,fedja100,What is this movie about? I don't know.,7,19 December 2010,"So why did I go to see this movie? It was mainly because I haven't gone to the movie theater in a while and just wanted to entertain myself. My choices were Yogi the bear (or whatever) and some other films but I chose Tron because I am a fan of Science Fiction. So i saw the movie today, 12/19/2010 at 10:00pm and I had no idea what it was about. I picked 3D because I really enjoyed the CGI 3D of Avatar, just the CGI but I'm not going to discuss about that movie now. So when the film started, I got really excited because it was in 3D but then there were shots where there was no 3D at all. Seeing that this was the 2nd movie I saw in 3D I expected everything to be in 3D, however, there was a sentence written before the movie that said some shots were going to be in 2D, I didn't quite understand why but 3D isn't the most important thing in a film , so I let it go. The beginning was excellent, I kinda really tell you much or else I'd ruin the movie for you but It did give me a good suspense and I liked the way it all escalated to the final ""world"". The actors were fine, the special effects were good too. The story was simple and easy to follow. Now, some of the things that I did not like about this movie was how it all ended so quickly, yes it was a 2 hour movie, but the way it all was building up I expected more to happen when we got to ""end"" of the movie. I don't know about you, but I felt like they could have added more things about the story. However, I read that this was a sequel, and that the story already began in the first movie and that this was a continuation. Well I didn't know that, had I known that I'd probably assume that they'd make a 3rd film to end it, to give it a feeling of completion.My most favorite thing about this was, even though it's a 'sequal' I guess, was that it was something new, something I have never seen before. Although you could kinda compare it to the Matix, with the whole ""different world"" being connected to this world thing, bla bla bla, it brought something entirely fresh to the movie theaters and that's what got me hooked on this movie from the moment it started to the end. Although many would hate how it wasn't filmed in all 3D, I kinda respect the fact that the story line and actors were interesting, unlike some movies ""which I'm not going to mention, to avoid starting a fight"". And that's what counts the most in a movie, it has to be INTERESTING, for that is why movies were ever created in the first place.",TRON - Legacy

Being film in stereo, as opposed to a conversation (Clash of the Titans) it looks superb, I believe they used the same 'Fusion' rig as Cameron used on Avatar and it shows.The one aspect I was wondering about was the story line but I found it very compelling, good character development and a good mix of action and plot points to make the film keep you interested throughout.Not forgetting sound and music, loud and engaging. A great soundtrack to buy weather you like Daft Punk or not. An interesting mix of orchestral (Hans Zimmer style) and punk!Overall a fantastic film, visually stunning, great stereo (great work DD and others), and very enjoyable!Best seen in IMAX if possible.",TRON - Legacy
574,tiagojbastos,Visually Stuning,7,14 January 2011,"I'm not going to explain much about this movie story/premise, because I assume most viewers were fans of the original Tron.When I first heard about this movie, I couldn't be more excited: an old movie with brand new technology? Even if the story turned out bad, it was a new Tron, and that alone made it perfect.I watched the movie last night, in 3D, and it was a very pleasant experience for the most part, but don't think this is a great movie, because it's not.Flynn (Jeff Bridges) is back, and in two shapes. An older Flynn, and a computer generated younger Flynn. The computer model looks good (for the most part), and it was necessary, otherwise we would have ended up with an old man with a ton of make-up on it's face, just to shave off a couple of years.The movie starts with Flynn disappearing, and his son entering the Grid world in search of him. It's textbook script, but then again, what could we expect from Tron? It was never about the story, and this movie proves it. The plot is weak, and weakened by poor/unnecessary dialog and very shallow characters.Luckily, none of that matters once the Grid world is shown to us. Visually it's great, and the action scenes are fun and fast-paced. I even dare saying it's the best 3D movie I saw so far, which also poses a problem: this movie looks great and feels great only in 3D, and in the theaters. I can't imagine myself in a few months buying the movie to watch in my sofa.Another problem with the movie is that half-way through, it becomes repetitive. Maybe if they kept the action flowing, with little dialog, this movie would have been better, but trying to add depth to such a poor script ends up boring the audience.The bottom-line is: Tron Legacy if fan-service. It a re-rendered universe with very little story, but very good looking.7/10 if you watch it in the theaters, in 3D 4/10 anywhere else",TRON - Legacy

The movie was a lot of light and fury signifying nothing. There are plot holes everywhere and illogical things happen all the time. The Arcade is abandoned and boarded up but the electricity is still on? Really? Algorithms can become real flesh-and-blood humans? That's like having your algebra text come to life when you open the cover and the equations run out onto the table. Worse, TRON: Legacy is so derivative the seams are showing. It rips off Star Wars (multiple times), Gladiator, Casablanca and even Cabaret. There are probably even more thefts that I didn't pick up on but recognized as worn old tropes of one genre or another. The only thought I had on the way home was regret at having dropped 3-D prices for this piece of Hollywood drivel. The American studios have such contempt for their audience -- ""Just feed them lots of action, special effects,blood, and violence and they'll love it."" Well, not so much.

578,limefield,A sorry excuse for a film,3,19 May 2011,"Tron Legacy; the name suggests it should stay in your head for many years to come and leave an impact on cinema. I would like to get it out of my head as soon as possible and if it does leave an impact on the future of film you may as well give up on watching them. Firstly it is boring, the fun original didn't need an update and the 2 hours of my life would be better off spent watching paint dry, I probably would have been more excited. Although the effects are impressive, 'The Grid' all looks very well and good and especially the way that they made Jeff Bridges younger. But it was all to dark for me and made the film very melancholic. It was slightly sad to see a good use of the technology go to waste.The actors tried hard to reclaim it but the dodgy script drowned the way they performed it. $170 000 000 was spent on this film. Why don't they employ decent writers and why does it always seem to be that the ones made on a small budget are better? Decide on that for yourselves.",TRON - Legacy
579,odea999,Good start but down hill from there,3,21 December 2010,"Stylish with superficial CGI and impressive images. However, lacks any real substance. The film is very dark, and the orange and white lights on black get old pretty quickly, but I suppose that's in keeping with the original. There were a few creative moments with a character names Zues that came off really tacky and lame. Almost felt like watching a stage production in a few parts. Was it just me or was the 3D really disappointing? Most of the time It didn't feel like the film was 3D at all. Perhaps the most MILD 3D ever, or maybe I've been spoiled by Avatar.. Not much of a sequel really, apart from the first ten minutes. Most the film was a repeat of a familiar theme. If you are restless for a movie and need something new then perhaps you might try this but don't let it be your first choice. Padraig O'Dea Eaton Square Monkstown",TRON - Legacy

Af almost 30 years we get to see 'Tron: Legacy' and my first ,second and third reactions were all ""Wow! Yesss!!"".I've seen the movie today. In 3D. It was big, it was good. But it wasn't great. Was i disappointed? No quite. Let me explain: This movie hád to be made. And thank you Disney for making it! The fun part for me was to see both Bruce Boxleitner and Jeff Bridges once more in action. Also, it was fun to be in 'The Grid' once again. Or to see Flynn's Arcade. All good stuff. Now, i don't want to compare both movies, but since it is considered a legacy story, you have to have some reference points.Actionwise: it was good, but i missed some stuff like walking giants, an active firewall surrounding a beam, the creation of something from thin air by a user, the tanks or even Bit; the bit that hovered and said simply ""yes"" and ""no"".Graphics: in '82 they were lightyears ahead and it all looked awesome. Nowadays we live in a cgi-world for most movies and this one was nice to see, but even the costumes lacked some finer detailing, which were done in the first movie with blacklight effect. CGI was okay, but nowhere as stunning as it was in the original.Funwise: i completely missed the fun from the original movie. Example: Flynn get's to fly a machine and it bounces up in pieces with Bit hovering around him. Thát was fun! This movie is too dramatic, too heavy and it could have used a bit of fun at least.Storywise: the current generation of youth can see this movie as a standalone, it works great in that way. But for the generation of '82 i think we miss stuff as described above. The story drags on for almost two hours and the final 15 minutes or so aren't thát 'big' storywise. A suggestion for the writers, director ánd SFX crew: take a look at 'The Matrix' trilogy. Thát's how you do stories, action and special effects for current cgi-spoiled audiences. The story lacks in dynamic telling, energetic play of actors and big things happening on the screen.Finally, the ending disappoints. I know: if a movie does well in the box office, we need more stories for sequels, prequels and spin-offs. But no, this one didn't work for me, i'm sorry to say.I give it 6 out of 10. I still like Tron and this movie aswel, but the original had just more of everything, not lastly more fun.",TRON - Legacy
582,garcia77,Tron - Lunacy,2,19 December 2010,"This movie just did not cut it. The acting is weak, the dialogue is awful, and their is zero character emotion for any of the characters. I love Jeff Bridges but i don't remember him being 'The Dude' in the first tron. I wasn't counting but I'm guessing he said 'Man' 10-15 times. It got comical. He was literally a hippie in a computer game. His son in the movie was OK. Sounds a lot like B.Pitt, wonder when he'll start adopting. The main female character in the movie was very cute, but again, the story was just silly, and at times she was too. It was such a cliché ending. Looking forward to seeing Bridges in True Grit, definitely haven't given up on him yet.The movie just threw all its money into the effects, which at times were fantastic, but the 3D just didn't seem to have any effect on the outcome of this movie. I would say there is about 2 moments where the 3D worked. Otherwise it seemed unnecessary, Sorry Tron-folk 2/10",TRON - Legacy
583,fredwerner,very VERY disappointed Tron fan...,1,28 December 2010,"In the 28 years since the original Tron movie, there have been, oh, a few innovations in the world of computers, networks, electronics, and communications. But somehow, the makers of this sequel seem to have missed inventions such as ""The World Wide Web"". They passed on a tremendous opportunity to make ""Tron Legacy"" as innovative and powerful as the original. Instead, they've merely sullied our memories by reducing what was a tremendous and ominous world into the digital equivalent of Smalltown, USA.In 1982, few people had computers, far fewer had even heard of computer networks, and hardly anyone outside the military had heard of ""the internet."" The creators of the original movie crafted an entire alternate plane of existence, accessible only to computer programmers, in a time when the words ""virtual"" and ""reality"" both still meant ""true."" Their inspired fantasy gave audiences an entirely new perspective on the nascent digital age. The original's bold, limitless universe, is limited in the sequel to ""The Grid"", a small city from which good guys escape from effortlessly, and from which bad guys seem to have no trouble leaving, though you're given the impression it never occurred to them to look beyond the borders of their extremely small town before. And the entire world is wholly disconnected from any computer system used by anyone on Earth. The only link to reality is the exact same machine hidden in a forgotten room. It's as if the film-makers hoped we'd forget that now, 30 years later, almost EVERYONE is on a computer network in one way or another. The original Tron also created real tension by crafting a plot where what happened inside the system mattered. Even before the original Jeff Bridges character was sucked into the digital netherworld, the audience had a palpable sense of the impending doom to all humanity posed by the growing strength of the computer network. In this sequel, the ""real-world"" angle is a lame-duck corporation's unapologetically pathetic efforts at keeping market share. Even that side story introduced in the beginning, isn't given any relevance to anything that happens in the rest of the movie. The larger threat of a digital character emerging from ""The Grid"" into the real world is repeated throughout the film, but never in a credible way. Why should we be scared about him getting out? What would he do here? How would a computer program have any power outside a computer system?There were endless ways the filmmakers could have used today's globally integrated technologies and on-line mania to make Tron Legacy as relevant as the original. The bad guys could have tried to empower Wii systems to control people instead of the other way around, or to animate an army of Second Life avatars, or to rewrite all of Wikipedia to brainwash every student in America, or to take control of every electronic device on Earth (think Y2K).Tron Legacy has dazzling visual graphics, but it falls into that disappointing category of films that match astronomically high priced production values with cut-rate B-movie plots, acting, and character development. Saddest of all is that no one bothered to spend a dime of those hundreds of millions of dollars to follow the true legacy of Tron: to inspire us with the possibilities of where the next digital universe might take us.",TRON - Legacy

585,prospeak,"The movie is a treat for the senses , no doubt about it . The acting , though not award winning , is certainly not bad .....",8,3 March 2011,"Here Goes Nothing ..Rating : 4/5 -----You can skip the first paragraph below if all you are interested is the review-----IMAX has ruined the movie experience for me . Seriously. Try enjoying a 3D movie in a standard theater after watching one at an IMAX . Last January , I saw Avatar at the IMAX 3D in Bombay (Yeah, I still call it Bombay  SUE ME!!) and words cannot DESCRIBE the experience !!! Ever since , every 3D movie I've seen has been a disappointment . Don't get me wrong , I'm sure that the effects would've looked great in a competent theater . But just the thought of ""What tho movie would look like in an IMAX ??"" is just excruciating .TRON: Legacy is a GREAT looking movie to say the least . The effects are just too darn pretty to be ignored !!! And hence that off-topic ""Epilogue"" that was the paragraph above . The virtual world contrary to popular belief is called ""The Grid"" (and not TRON) and is Gorgeous in the typical TRON fashion ( Black Backgrounds with LOADS of cool neon effects make for an interesting imagining of the Virtual World ) . The multi-purpose ""Identity Disks"" are back and so are the Uber-cool ""Light-cycles"" , and they brought some friends too . (We just experienced a slight earthquake here in Noida at 0200Hrs IST . Just thought I should let you know . ) So where were we ? Yes , TRON Legacy  Very pretty .. Moving on .The movie is a direct Sequel to the original and not a ""Spin-off"" or a ""re-imagining"" of TRON . That is a good thing indeed . The movie features Sam Flynn the son of Kevin Flynn as the protagonist and has many of the same quirks as his father did in TRON (I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree ) . The story though simple and predictable , is a worthy successor to the first movie . Its plot and story would easily be applauded by anyone who liked TRON . The rest of the opinions will be polarized . The plot can easily be dismissed as ""Pulp Science-Fiction"" (I just made this word up  cheers!!) and be ignored as ""generic"" or ""ill-researched"" , but COME ON !!! Isn't that the whole point of sci-fi ??? To boldly go where no man has gone before. ? (sigh YES, Star Trek . GOOD WORK !!! ) . But one must keep in mind that the new movie merely adds to the original imagining of the virtual word and hence could not stray too far from that ""vision"" ( which by the way , was considered path-breaking back in the day ) . Considering that , I think that the writers and the director did a fine job .The Acting , though sub-par in a few places , was never bad . Garrett Hedlund (the cousin of Achilles in Troy and the youngest brother in Four Brothers ) plays a convincing ""Heir to a Fortune 500 Company"" . Jeff Bridges' performance makes me wonder why he was never considered for the role of a Jedi (Pity...) . The man is a Zen-Rockstar version of Obi-Wan sans a Light-saber . Don't Worry , Tron makes a cameo appearance as well . Olivia Wilde ( best known as Alex in the second season of The O.C and ""Thirteen"" from House ) and plays her role as a curious program well . The rest of the cast is also solid . Daft Punk make an appearance too (in their Robot Helmets of course ..). The character ""Castor"" played by Michael Sheen deserves a special mention for playing the eccentric Club-Owner rather impressively .The soundtrack was composed by the Electro-Maestro-Duo that is Daft Punk . Longtime fans of TRON themselves , they jumped at the chance of being involved with the second . The soundtrack complements the experience of the movie well . The music suits the mood and is always noticeably present without ever being distracting . That's what you need from a soundtrack don't you ? To set the mood and stay in the background . And that is superbly executed here . To them I say ""Kudos Sirs , you never cease to amaze me"" .The conclusion :The movie is a treat for the senses , no doubt about it . The acting , though not award winning , is certainly not bad ( good even , in places  ) . In the plot though , lies the problem . The movie is every fan's dream come true ( Well , for 90% of the fans at least  the rest are slightly disappointed , ""slightly"" being the keyword here ) . The rest might find the movie confusing . (It's ""Speed Racer"" all over again , though unlike Speed Racer  THANK GOD!! Legacy is financially successful .) My suggestion to to the potential viewers : Watch the source material first (TRON) and if you like it , you'll love the new movie . If you don't (like it) , still give this one a look , at least you won't be bored !!! (and thats saying A LOT considering the current movie scene ) .",TRON - Legacy
586,coolest_hawk2004,An awesome sequel for Tron fans,10,19 December 2010,"OK, high rating is clearly attributed to the fact that I am a huge fan of the Tron Concept as well as the visual appeal of a movie (and the movie did not disappoint me at all); but Tron: Legacy is definitely not a movie for everyone, and those totally uninitiated to the Tron concept before watching the movie will be left scratching their heads for most parts.The movie starts off by neatly picking up from the original movie without actually going into details about Flynn-Tron, Flynn-Dillinger(Encom's current CEO) or Flynn-Bradley (the old guy and father-figure to Sam) relationships. By hastily introducing the events that took place in past 28 years, the movie shifts its focus to introduce Sam's character and highlight the rebel in him. On the advice of his father's best friend, who is also the creator of the Tron program, Sam visit's the arcade and accidentally switches on the laser beam aperture which was designed to transport objects from the real world to the digital world – or the computer-game world designed by Flynn and now controlled by Clu 2.0, a very powerful program designed by Flynn himself. (Clu 1.0 is introduced in the first movie.) Tron world – or the Grid – has advanced over the years. In the backdrop of a father-son story, clearly meant to give a bit of emotional touch to the movie, mainly for non-Tron fans, and the rivalry between Flynn and his own creation Clu, Kosinski introduces the new features of Tron. Those like me waiting for the advanced lightcycle race, disc wars and cool Grid-structure definitely had a treat. :) The film also introduced new vehicles to keep the fans enthralled. It also brings back the character of Tron but does not highlight why Tron – designed to aid users in the situation of a control program – has changed sides. (Technically speaking, it can be assumed that Clu – a powerful program - was able to alter the Tron program since there was no interference from Tron's or Clu's users). The movie also introduces the significant events in the Grid, such as the Purge and the acquired ability of Clu to create programs. Such events can definitely be used for future sequels.As mentioned, this movie is clearly meant for those who appreciate the Grid and Tron. Disney knows this, and hence in order to bring audience to the theatres, they used an aggressive marketing strategy and a great music score by Daft Punk. The movie showcases great visuals, especially a very well done Clu (and young Jeff Bridges) which was entirely done by CGI. Truly, a technical marvel. All the main stars deliver in terms of acting. The only disappointment in the movie was the script. There were not enough twists and turns in the script which might make it a little boring for the fans. It also lacked explanation for a lot of parts and those who were being introduced to the Tron world will find the movie either too complicated or lacking sense. However, it does justice to the main characters as well as the Grid as a whole.Overall, the movie does not disappoint Tron fans. For those who are yet to be introduced to Tron, a simple advice is to know what Tron is all about before watching the movie. Though a dose of the actual movie Tron would be ideal, it is essential to know that the Tron franchise is all about depicting what happens inside a chip in our computers. It's a visual, humanised interpretation of it. Otherwise, you will just have to satisfy yourself with state-of-the-art graphics and an awesome music score.",TRON - Legacy
587,zaudercastro,Disney is dying slowly,3,21 December 2010,"It's amazing the amount of money they are willing to spend in bad movies nowadays. 300 million for this?? I watched Tron-Legacy 3D after reading good reviews here at IMDb, but I'll be more careful about it in the future. Some of these reviews are so positively fancy I now suspect they might have been written by people who have commercial interests invested in this movie.The first Tron, back in the eighties, brought something new to cinema. I wasn't expecting the same feat this time, just more of the same interesting sci-fi they managed to create back then mixed with the enhanced visual capabilities of the studios today.However, Tron-Legacy seems to have been made for kids under 9 yrs old. Some events in the movie make absolutely no sense whatsoever, the fighting scene are unwatchable because of the excess of visual effects, and the always conservative Disney passes a lot of opportunities to make great jokes, just to maintain the politically correct. No wonder Disney cannot produce masterpieces anymore. Go for it, Pixar.My advice for those who care about the quality of the movies they put their brains through: see the old Tron instead and you won't miss anything.",TRON - Legacy
588,vacon16,Great movie. Amazing Soundtrack.,9,26 December 2010,"Since I heard about the Soundtrack (I'm a huge Daft Punk fan) I was excited to see this movie. Before the movie premiered, I happened to stumble upon the two issue comic filler that tells the story of the making of CLU and how he started to change. While they explained the majority of it in the movie, the comic helped me see more into the power struggle between Kevin and CLU. A lot of people have varied reasons for why they didn't like it. I liked it because the story isn't supposed to be extremely complex. Kevin got stuck in the grid and had been missing for years. Sam, his son gets transported to the grid and tries to find him. Daft Punk are amazing and each track goes well with the scene and telling the story. The movie is about a different world, a future of digital living. I think after 28 years, it was done in a great way. The effects were dope, acting wasn't Oscar worthy, but this is great movie, with a good story. I will see it more than once.",TRON - Legacy
589,crazzyboy28,Awesome follow up to a true classic,9,2 May 2011,"As a true Jeff Bridges fan I couldn't wait to see this Tron Legacy, it is a sequel to the 1982 film ""Tron"" which I haven't seen but while doing a bit of searching on IMDb I found a trailer and Tron Legacy clearly looks like the better film. Jeff Bridges returns playing Kevin Flynn and clue, Bruce Boxleitner also returns as Alan Bradely and Tron. Joseph Kosinski makes his directing debut with Tron Legacy and the director of the original, Steven Lisberger returns as a Producer. Tron starts with a young Kevin Flynn telling the story of Tron to his son Sam Flynn, after the story his father promises him he will show him the grid tomorrow after seeing his dad ride off into the night he doesn't see him again for 20 years. The film then returns to a 27 year old Sam Flynn investigating his father's death when he is transported onto the Grid. The Grid is where Kevin Flynn has been trapped for the last 20 years and is much similar to a computer game with gladiator like fights but instead of swords and amour you have a flashy power ranger like suit and near indestructible disc. Sam is then reunited with his father and the story real story starts there.Bringing back the original actors Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner brings a lot to the film I haven't seen the original so I cant say if it worked well by building on the first movie. Joseph Kosinski choose the right movie to make his directing debut on and didn't disappoint, the majority of the film was filmed in 3D and was in films released in 3D but I watched the 2D version so I'm not sure if the 3D would of enhanced the viewing by much but when he enters the grid I think the 3D would have worked really well with all the bright lights and unique costumes. The costume design in this film is really something in some places it reminds me of a cross between Star Trek and Hell Boy. The music in this film was composed by Daft Punk which fits the movie perfectly especially when Sam enters the grid, there music fits in well because most of there video clips feature similar characters to what this film does. Tron Legacy defiantly lived up to my expectations it isn't Oscar worthy Best Picture material because of its story line but it did get nominated for best sound editing which is no surprise when you have Daft Punk to play with. This movie is defiantly something to watch with a group of mates, I'm not sure it's the type of film you sit down and watch with your girlfriend but on a lazy hung over Sunday it defiantly fits the bill.",TRON - Legacy
590,Virilant,pretty but lacking,5,19 December 2010,"Lots of nice CGI and impressive world created... but lacking in story and mild 3D. The film is very dark, and the orange and white lights on black get old pretty quickly, but i guess thats in keeping with the original. There were a few creative moments with a character names Zues that came off really tacky and lame. Almost felt like watching a stage production in a few parts. Was it just me or was the 3D really disappointing? Most of the time It didn't feel like the film was 3D at all. Perhaps the most MILD 3D ever, or maybe I've been spoiled by Avatar.. Not much of a sequel really, apart from the first ten minutes. Most the film was a repeat of the old theme.",TRON - Legacy
591,arjunbagvath,Certainly a Ride in the Grid,7,4 January 2011,"I didn't see the first part of Tron. I had no idea there was a movie called Tron that was released before my birth. I saw the trailer of Tron Legacy and I liked the idea, the plot, the ambiance, special effects and the background score. I find it very unique. As far as the story is concerned it wasn't a big deal but good enough for a movie like this.I booked my tickets in advance and reserved the 3rd row from screen for its 3D effect. The thing I learned about 3D movie is, if you want to enjoy the 3d effects take 3rd or 4th row. Or take a seat such a way you don't see the walls adjacent to the screen but just the screen. The effects are worth.My experience with this movie is like a ride in the grid itself. The background score was awesome and goes with the special effects and action sequences. Tron Legacy is not a movie that you expect some story and characters but rather I would call it an experience. I like the father son relationship and stuffs but at one point you may feel the movie is incomplete. But the soundtrack and SFX is worth the money you pay. I don't think this movie will be good if you watch it in a DVD or something. This movie is certainly a one time watch. Don't go again.",TRON - Legacy
592,Stumidnight,$13 Million for Wardrobe - $0 for plot development,3,21 December 2010,"Oh come on? You've got to be kidding me....In 1982, TRON changed the face of the industry introducing us to ground breaking stuff that had just never been seen. The plot, while a bit esoteric, gave us some really cool water-cooler ""what if"" situations and the movie inspired art, music and of course future film...Jump to nearly 30 years later, and all we have is music and vision. (but not in all of the film). Plot has been dragged off kicking and screaming, shot in the head and buried in a shallow grave somewhere out behind silicon valley.Here's a brief run down:Music: Daft Punk, so it's going to be intense and ""funky-cool"", and it is... They even make a pretty cool (if not clichéd) Cameo to3D: Well it is AWESOME when it's used - but with the ""Some scenes were deliberately left in 2D"" message at the front of the film, it feels like they ran out out budget and made an excuse why they didn't cover the whole film...Young Jeff Bridges: In X-Men 3 the anti-aging effect of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen is fabulous... in this movie, Young Jeff looks like a dodgy cut scene from a PS2 Game. Bad animation and syncing and just unrealistic... and before you say it was ""supposed"" to be that way because he's in a computer - DON'T - it still looks sh*t... considering all the ""Perfect World"" baloney.Plot: NON-EXISTENT, it's like they didn't even try - Kid loses dad, rebels with some small redeeming characteristics, finds dad, loses dad again but with life lessons but still reforms... *sigh - yawn *They spent so much trying to make the few decent 3D scenes look cool they forgot that todays audience still needs a plot. I was annoyed that AVATAR ripped off some many other plots, but AT LEAST IT HAD ONE.If all you want is 20 mins of decent 3D - go see the first 30 mins of the film, but talk to your friends for the first 10...If you want something with a plot... read the popcorn box.. it will be more engaging.",TRON - Legacy

I was quite disappointed. It seems that the ""fan-boys"" really love this movie, but us ""regular"" folks find it quite boring. Or Lame. Lame story line, lame acting, lame dialog, by the end of the show the only thing I cared about was ""I hope this is the last scene"". I know my kids would rate it higher (6 i think they said), but dad gives this movie a 2. Ugh. IMDb requires more lines to the review, so I will state again that it seems like the reviews that loved this movie were also big fans of the original, and have been waiting for this sequel for a long time. I did see the original many years ago, but do not recall it hardly at all. Maybe that would have helped, maybe not. But if you have other choices for movies to see, strongly consider them instead of this one. Also, I expect a Disney to be a good movie, not lame like this was...",TRON - Legacy
594,geosave,Loved it!!!,10,30 December 2010,"I watched this movie on IMAX 3D with my wife last week and absolutely loved it! My wife is not into technology jargon and she said it was OK for her. I work around computers and servers all day and I still remember the first Tron and how excited I was when I watched it 20 something years ago, and I was expecting a lot of visual effects, but not only the effects were awesome but also the plot was excellent. This movie blew my mind! The plot builds up the expectations during the first 30 minutes of the movie with action since the beginning. The plot then changes, taking you to another universe, were the pieces start getting together as the plot evolves. At the end you are hopping to see more, what makes you wonder what is next for the main characters.",TRON - Legacy
595,dtlofton,Even worse than the original,1,28 June 2011,"Let's be honest - the original Tron was a bad movie. With the bar set that low, there was a pretty good chance Tron Legacy would be better. Unbelievably, it was actually worse. The story and dialogue in this film are so bad, sitting through it is worse than mere boredom - it is boredom mixed with continuous disbelief every time another ridiculously stupid plot element is revealed. The bottom line is this: At no point during the entire movie did I care about anything that was happening on the screen, nor was I entertained. Although I did amuse myself just to make the time pass faster and with less pain by identifying the exact scene from each of the films that were blatantly ripped off.",TRON - Legacy
596,N_Guerra_R,Its kind of a passionately built mess.,5,17 December 2010,"I'm of very mixed feeling with the movie. It's in no way bad, but good is a long way off. If the trailers interests you in the slightest, sure go see it, enjoy it if you can, but I found the whole thing to be messy.The story folds over itself in a spectacular self destructive fashion, what started out as a rescue mission turned into a reflection of technology circa 1991, then a reflection on passion and being blinded by ambition with hints of the pursuit of global purity, mixed in with the labors of the father being passed to the son and then back to a breakout rescue.This isn't at all helped by a mixed presence throughout the cast, while Hedlund looks passionate about what he's doing most of the time there's never the sense that he's more than just that surface level character, Bridges comes off apathetic and confused when he's playing his own persona and unrelentingly scowling as his digital doppelganger, Wilde is a mixture of this strange cross between child and genius but shes never given enough moments to really be a beloved character as appose to just token hot action chick.The action set pieces are built to be fantastic but are executed in such a near lifeless fashion and only two really shine, the light-cycle battle and a latter brawl in Michael Sheen's club, which is more enjoyable as a parody. The problem I find is there is no visceral punch to any of the action, nothing feels like it has any weight or danger to them, and at its worst moments I'd argue its look more reflects what these action scenes looked like during rehearsal and no one remembered to polish them up for the finale product.The high note consistently praised is the score via Daft Punk, and I can't argue with that in any fashion.Its just seems like the story was never quite nailed down right, and the really interesting bits of what is there are bypassed as exposition dialog & mystic fortunetelling, and while the setting is interesting in concept as this big electric civilization feels claustrophobic, dark and built without purpose. The grid doesn't feel like a lived in world, in fact there's a constant strangeness to it and to a negative.Another weird note is the direction, which isn't bad but its fairly disjointed. Like the story it flops around a bit but only in tone, the craft is always fairly excellent but the lack of consistency becomes a tiring sore.There's noticeable effort on the aesthetic design, you can see that each actor was working with what they were given, and there is a love for the universe of Tron. But all of these things don't make the movie above its disjointed state. Bit of a shame. But again you won't be angry for going to go see it, just don't be expecting to feel much enthusiasm coming out of the thing.",TRON - Legacy
597,MJLowry23,We certainly ain't in Kansas anymore,6,9 January 2011,"Once Tron: Legacy's final credits roll, I can guarantee you of two things; one, you will be safe in the knowledge that you have just witnessed genuinely the most spectacular visual feast of 2010. Two, you'll have a somewhat strong urge to re-watch The Big Lebowski.The Dude himself plays Kevin Flynn, the former software wizard trapped in a digital world he helped create, and CLU, his virtual counter-part who rules that very virtual nightmare. It's up to Flynn's son Sam to rescue his papa and bring him back to life, back to reality. Inevitably, CLU ain't having that and digital hijinks ensue, all to the sound of Daft Punk.The film starts decidedly rocky, with a neat opening flashback to 1989 featuring father and young son soiled by a strangely terrifying CGI Jeff Bridges. After a montage explaining the backstory of the film, we're presented with a faintly ludicrous scene where Sam plays a glorified practical joke on ENCOM, his father's old software company which he is now the controlling shareholder of. Look out for a ridiculous moment where it appears the height of this squillion-dollar company's security measures is a single bumbling overweight guard waddling uselessly after Sam. Soon after all this mischief, Bruce Boxleitner shows up and urges Sam to look for his father, which is where the movie picks up.Tron: Legacy's main strength is how it presents the virtual world itself to the audience. Make no mistake about it, Disney has created a truly alien atmosphere - we certainly aren't in Kansas anymore. We know as much as Sam does about The Grid (ie squat) and the viewer is as baffled as poor Sam as he enters deeper into the cyber universe. Garrett Hedlund is naturally likable as Flynn Jnr, and his performance is hard to fault. Perhaps his only downside is he's annoyingly handsome, but who am I to argue with the fruit of CGI Jeff Bridges' loins?Likewise, the rest of the cast is solid and do the best they can with a patchy script. Watch out for Bridges' ""Tron, what have you become?"" line, surely the most unintentionally humorous line of dialogue in a sci-fi movie since the Star Wars prequels. Darth Vader-esquire nuggets of cringe aside, Jeff Bridges plays Flynn as a sort of Dude for the Disney audience. I was half expecting to see him sipping on a White Russian during the climatic chase scene commenting on Marmots. In any case, he's as fun to watch as ever and the man is clearly having a blast returning to the role. Olivia Wilde is intriguing as the program Quorra, but doesn't get a lot to work with and frustratingly the character is barely explored. The standout performance is Michael Sheen as the flamboyant program Castor. Sheen hams it up so much you can almost smells the pork, but his Ziggy Stardust meets Frank N Furter meets Tony Blair schtick is a delight to watch. So can I recommend Tron: Legacy? Overall the movie is a classic case of style over substance - bottom line, the story's a wafer-thin rescue caper, and those movie goers whose pants tighten at finding big sexy plot holes will probably have a field day with this one. However, while the story may be secondary, the visuals are frankly too stunning for any serious movie fan to miss - seeing the world of Tron in full 3D is an experience worth the ticket price. Go on, let yourself be immersed in The Grid. Now if you excuse me, I've got The Big Lebowski to watch for the 423rd time.",TRON - Legacy

The film is just bad, bad baddddd!!!!! how could they do this? they ruined all the excitement of the previous one. I know they pretty much always do this, but this time they went too far IMHO, Im quite disappointed. The visual effects are fine, acting is what you can expect from a film like this and the music is maybe the best thing in the film. Daft Punk are good enough to speak for themselves.Don't SPEND MONEY on it, if you liked the previous one.

That's my impression from most of the sci-films that I've seen in the last years. Then something like moon comes out and everyone is like WOW, but Moon was as well pretty bad, but since there's not much to get in sci-fi besides beating up,,, well... that's what happens.

I woke up when Sam was trying to get to the real world, because i thought that part would be interesting... not at all.Why people say this has EXCELLENT effects? Really, it has sometimes good effects, but do you think that a lot of lights and neon tubes are excellent effects? don't think so.So my conclusion is... don't watch it!!! if you want to watch it wait until you can go to Blockbuster and spend about 5 bucks in this.

601,Kuato-Lives,A great way to finish 2010. End of line.,8,9 December 2010,"Tron Legacy is a sci-fi adventure starring Jeff Bridges, Olivia Wilde and Garret Hedlund. The film is directed by Joseph Kosinksi in which he make his directorial debut. It is also the sequel to Tron (1982) The plot of the film is about Sam Flynn who after being informed about a page message that was received and believed to be from Kevin Flynn, his long lost father that has been missing for over 20 years, he goes to the closed down arcade where the page message originated from. On his arrival after snooping around a bit Sam Flynn gets teleported into the world of Tron and his adventure to find his father begins.This film was brilliant and very entertaining; it's a worthy sequel to its predecessor from the 80s. The director Joseph Kosinksi did such a fantastic job of directing this and what a film it was, you wouldn't have thought at all that it was an inexperienced first time director. The camera angles on the action was superb, it didn't use shaky cam effects and you were left to enjoy what was going on on-screen The film was visually stunning and very nice to look at. It stayed true to the visuals of the original but in its own updated way and the world that was created just looked spectacular.The electronic soundtrack that was done by Daft Punk suited the film very well and was used remarkably well too. It went hand in hand with what was happening on screen and complimented the visuals to create such an entertaining and enjoyable vibe. There was also a homage to the original that hardcore fans of Tron will notice as Sam turns on the electricity of the arcade in the form of Separate Ways by Journey.The acting in the movie was top notch, Garret Hellund did good job in making his character likable and carried the film well. The film was a pleasure to watch with him being the main character. Jeff bridges was exceptional as always and he pulled double duty on this by playing both Kevin and Clu. Olivia Wilde had the lead female role which was a good casting choice. There was also appearances from James Frain , Jeffrey Nording and Bruce Boxlietner. The actor that stole the show in this was Michael Sheen with a very hilarious and entertaining performance as a character called Castor which came across campy and David Bowie like.The only gripe I have with this film is that there simply wasn't enough of the character that this film is named after.To sum this up – great visuals, great sound, great story and a great sequel. Tron fans will most certainly love this and people who weren't fans of Tron before will be after watching this. 8/10",TRON - Legacy

It was good overall, but the ending was a tiny bit disappointing when not EVERYONE got to come back to the real world. Very violent and science-fiction based, while also very hard to understand. Definitely a seat-grabber, and full of suspense, but it was certainly... different. If you came to the cinema to watch a comedy or love story, this movie wouldn't necessarily be the greatest choice, yet if you came for an action movie, buy some tickets. The 3D was more expensive, yet there were only about 2 times when the 3D came into action. 2D would have been just fine. There is a tiny bit of romance, but not as much as most young ladies would have liked.

603,DancesInShadow,Aurally and visually stunning.,9,10 January 2011,"I'm old, so I was about when TRON first came out and as a kid loved the world it created and let us see. A place we could only dream about or imagine brought out, teased from the depths of our imaginations and placed on a screen for all to enjoy.I was one of the many who always wanted more TRON, and yet always worried it was not going to touch the epic original or even come close. Hats off to Disney, they did a good job and I am pleased with the project and more so at the potential for more.For me though this film was ALWAYS going to be about the sounds and visuals, so long as the story/script was not a complete steaming pile the film had great potential. & I don't know how much emphasis they put into the Audio and Visuals but I was blown away by them and rejoiced each and every time I got a rush down my spine as a new music sequence tingled my adrenaline to start flowing or a new stunning vista came on the screen and made me make that ""oooh pretty"" noise.As mentioned by some of the other reviews, the story is a Father and Son saga, light and entertaining but nothing deep and heavy. Standard Disney stuff and acceptable for what it is. It's just a form of moving the music and visuals along and it does the job without distracting too much form the important stuff, like sucking you into the world of TRON and blowing your mind with what you are seeing and hearing.There is however a lot of action, and it's pretty good. The pace is fine and the sequences flow well into one another. The plot has a few twists and turns to stop you getting bored and keep you into what is happening. You are interested in the people and places so it ticks enough boxes to keep you entertained between the big set piece Audio and Visual moments. To be honest they did enough to weave in and out of the faster paced sections to the slower plot/story elements without leaving you stuck in a phase for too long so you got bored, and then transitioned back into the thick of the action without leaving you feeling like you missed a section of the film because you blinked.Now, the meat of the film, the music. If you like Jarre or Vangelis you are in for a treat, this has plenty of the old school ambient synth vibe to please the older generation mixed with enough new modern and fresh dance movement to hook a younger audience. They chose very wisely letting Daft Punk do the music, they do not disappoint at all, they also look the part. ;) Only 2 films in the last 10 years have had a soundtrack that made me want to get the OST as soon as I could (Chasing Legends being the other one). It's enjoyable start to finish and for everything from relaxing to out training on my bike.The bones of the film being the effects and visuals, and not let down by them at all. Coming from the roots of TRON the task was no easy one as they were already legendary and had a distinct look and feel. Legacy doesn't set out to try and top the original, just does enough to come level with them but with a modern feel and look so it doesn't look dated or leave you wondering why they didn't put any effort into them. You will spend plenty of time with your eyes wide sucking in rich details and wishing other films could do half as much to make you enjoy just looking at the scenery.All in all, TRON: Legacy is the real deal and not a let down, credit where it is due they did a really good job making sure it stood up to scrutiny from us old timers who remember TRON first time around yet ensuring a new generation could get sucked into the digital world like we did when we were kids.",TRON - Legacy
604,sunny_tirpitz,Sadly i think the movie will be underrated...,10,19 December 2010,"For me Tron Legacy is brilliant! Audio and visual experiences are exceptional and it is by far the best 3D movie i have ever seen! Also the story is quite good, but just like in the first movie it is far too vast to be included in just 2 hours and therefore all the action seems to be a bit ""rushed"". Somehow it is better that way, because it manages to keep its dynamism for the whole duration.Sadly i think the movie will be underrated, as there are some things that will not be understood by those who have not seen the first film. A few days ago i was talking with a friend about the movie and he was surprised to learn that Tron Legacy is actually a sequel and not a remake... My guess is that he will certainly be disappointed by the story... He will not understand for example the way in which Sam is transported from the real world to the virtual world. This is explained in the first film, but for those who have not seen the first part it will seem that everything happens without much logic, in a random and ambiguous way... Same thing with those ""battles"" between programs or even Tron's identity and his role inside the grid and so on... My advice watch the first movie to get an idea of what happens in the second. Only then you will fully appreciate the ""legacy"" of TRON as a reference point for the Sci-Fi genre...",TRON - Legacy
605,dora735,Don't over-analyze. It's great.,7,22 December 2010,"I saw this last night and I have to say, it is one of the most visually stunning things I've ever seen. I was unable to look away from the screen. It was absolutely brilliant. It was everything the trailer promised. Completely incredible; it was a feast for the eyes and the ears as well. The sound quality was outstanding and the music was awesome. The music totally fit with the movie. Most people complain that this movie lacks plot development and direction and say that the actors were mediocre. I actually disagree. For a movie that was about a video game, I felt the plot was good. The actors did the best with the script they had. Sure, Sam's dialogue was not the best. However, I thought that Garrett Hedlund gave a very good performance. Jeff Bridges was incredible, as always. The thing is, people cannot over-analyze this movie. It is not supposed to be the next Godfather, or There Will Be Blood, or The Shawshank Redemption. It is TRON: Legacy. It is about the visuals and the experience of the movie. Obviously it is not going to be a best picture winner, nor is that what the filmmakers were hoping for. What they made was a visually arresting, adrenaline pumping adventure of a movie. And in that respect, they knocked it out of the park. I am definitely planning on seeing this again.

(not to mention how he turns good at the end, you think he dies but then glows white and is never mentioned again!!!) some of the characters are just plain and simply c**p overall, if you have a blind friend with a short attention span that cant pay attention to dialog, take him, he will love it!",TRON - Legacy

The superimposed younger Jeff Bridges face was wholly unbelievable and, for me, remained a major point of distraction throughout the film. The initial 20 minutes setting the scene was fine but once the setting changed to the grid, apart from a good(ish) light cycle contest, it became formulaic and I was actually bored. There was no real plot, very little character development and the whole thing was edited like a pop video. Worse - it handled the ""Kevin Flynn as a deity"" issue as badly as the latter two matrix films dealt with Neo. To cap it all, the climax and ending were as unimaginative and clichéd as the rest of the film - It was a packed audience at my showing and they all left in stunned silence - This was a truly grim film experience and definitely not recommended.",TRON - Legacy
608,NukedKaltak,Never watched a movie twice in the theater!,10,21 March 2011,"This is one of the movies that had a great impact on me. I was reluctant at the very beginning to go watch this movie. People have been telling me this is not that good and that it has a rather weak plot...Well, I completely adored it! I can't say that it is a movie with a GREAT plot, but, come on! Tron isn't supposed to be relying on its plot to seduce the viewer. And that being said, I didn't dislike it neither! The plot was ""OK"".Enough talking about the story. I think that if you liked the first Tron, this one is all what a sequel should be. I'm sure many have told you that this movie is visually stunning. This is a huge understatement. This movie, if seen in 3D or for the lucky ones, in IMAX 3D (As for me I just watched it in Dolby 3D), is a GREAT moment for your eyes! From the moment you enter the Grid (The point where actual 3D pictures begin), it's like that was /you/ who actually is being transported in it. And then, what follows is absolutely marvelous! Battles, views, costumes... You should really experience it by yourself. There are very few words to express the beauty of this movie.And if your eyes are having a great time, your ears are not left alone! Daft Punk had produced a great OST for this movie. It's like the sound becomes an entire independent character! I can assure you, you will consider buying the OST along with the BD 3D.This movie is TOTALLY worth seeing it in 3D!",TRON - Legacy
609,FallingRockCrap,rm -rf tron*2010*.avi,3,18 December 2010,"TRON Legacy is garbage.The trailer looked promising, and the intro seemed to be going in a good direction.But as soon as they started to talk, it just showed how shallow and depth-less this movie really is.The actors are to play ""digital-biological"" beings, no one seems to know how they should act like? In the movie, some act like rigid sentient robots, some act like deranged humans, and some act like exotic futuristic aliens. There's hardly any consistency in the way the characters behave and interact with others in this movie. But it's not really the actors fault, because nowhere in the story was it explained what kind of characters they are, or supposed to be. And so, everyone just seemed to act to their own interpretation of their character, without any sort of structure to their social behaviour.Abysmal explanations for the plot. No effort was given into creating a believable, or even exciting setting for the audience to take in. A useless back-story, and dumb technical meaningless jargon put together to try to describe the creation and history of a digital world. But in the end, it was not even remotely understandable as to what anything was.Insufferable dialogue. There is one scene where Jeff Bridges just points to some special effect and says ""wow, look at that"". It's actually fitting if you go into the movie with an 80's mindset. But the rest of the movie has a modern, dark (The Dark Knight-like) atmosphere, and the contrast is too great to be stomached in the same film.Some of the positive aspects the movie done well are the special effects, the soundtrack, and the action scenes. The biggest problem I have with TRON was that it was so close to being an extremely entertaining and well made movie (with the quirky 80's theme to it as well), but the few negative points were so unbearable that it degraded the movie to the point where all the quirkiness lost value, and in turn degraded the movie even more.I would say it's fairly similar to Inception (2010), in that both movies were creating an imaginative new world that is drastically different from the world we live in. And both had the challenge of making it seemingly believable (or enough to suspend our disbelief). Inception also threw in a ton of technical jargon to make an attempt to explain the complex peculiarities of their world. Even though they didn't explain any of the exact technical specifics for the technology, they left the unexplainable unknown, and made very clear the few basic concepts that needed to be understood to follow the plot and goals of the movie. But Tron failed in this aspect very hard. And the necessity of this factor in a sci-fi movie like this is a huge blow to the atmosphere, and makes it very hard for the audience to follow or connect with the plot.Go check it out, but do not expect a story-telling experience. It is just 90 minutes of visual and audio spectacle.",TRON - Legacy
610,rachel-iriscelendine,"Visually stunning, musically bone chilling, and utterly breath taking",10,18 December 2010,"When I first saw the trailer for Tron Legacy quite a few months ago, I was immediately ecstatic. I could tell just from the short snippet that 1. Daft Punk did the music and 2. The movie looked absolutely gorgeous. My expectations for this movie went through the roof and I must say they were almost completely met.Visually this movie is miles ahead of anything else I have ever seen. The creativity that went into the set, props, clothing, vehicles... it is all absolutely gorgeous. The only thing lacking was the CG for Jeff Bridges. It wasn't terrible, in fact it was really good, but it could have been better. I imagine with everything else in this movie, they were already hemorrhaging money and maybe had to cut a bit in that department.THE MUSIC. Dear lord. Daft Punk is going to start getting some other Hollywood gigs for this film. I had the soundtrack before I even went and saw the movie, but the music still hit me hard in the chest. Paired with the amazing imagery, I truly had chills.The story if fairly interesting, though seems to be lacking a little bit. I read a review on this site of someone complaining that there wasn't a romance. I don't understand why we can't have a blockbuster hit where someone isn't making out with someone else. Keep in mind people, this is a PG movie. Plus, I appreciated the fact that they took a different route and made this much more about Sam and his father. The ending was a tad cheesy, but like I mentioned... it's PG.The acting was absolutely fantastic. Each character was casted perfectly. I must admit that when I saw who they had chosen for Sam, I wasn't too pleased. He looked like some generic male model out of some catalog... and then he completely proved me wrong. Now, I am not saying the kid deserves an Oscar, but he did do a very good job. Jeff Bridges was of course fantastic and the rest of the supporting cast were at his level.Overall this movie was an absolute blast. I saw it in IMAX 3D, which is the only way to go! In fact, I am going again tonight.PS: Keep an eye out for Daft Punk... :) Or at least 2 people wearing their helmets. I think I was the only one in the theater that noticed...",TRON - Legacy
611,anfo13,Another movie from the Star Wars era that's lost its zing,5,18 December 2010,"The incredibly high amount of positive reviews about this movie can only mean one of two things. Every post is added by a Disney Corp patsy trying to promote the film, or the positive reviewers have so low standards that cognitive thought is no longer needed in cinema anymore.What happened to fun engaging action? Yeah sure there is 3D, mind blowing CGI (what sci-fi film doesn't) but why so much mind numbing dialogue? Was this a Quenten Tarantino movie I walked into or Matrix ripoff? I expect if all reviewers saw the original like I did and then were asked to re-review then the results would be hugely different.Sorry Tron Legacy is not a sequel; it doesn't deserve to claim the fame of the original.",TRON - Legacy
612,av_pavan729,"Simple Storyline, Excellent Visuals, Good Cast, Poor Execution of 3D",7,19 December 2010,"Expectations: 1. Solid Visuals – Delivered. 2. Acceptable storyline – Delivered. 3. 3D content as good as ""Avatar"" – Not Delivered 4. Cast – Immensely Watchable.Storyline: Even if you are unfamiliar with the previous movie, you can watch this. It has a good premise and makes you keeps watching, it is a very simple story and doesn't challenge your intellect unlike ""Inception"". So this was a bad point as I personally would have preferred this movie with as many twists and turns as the bright motorcycle chase scenes have.Special Effects: The fight scenes, the motorcycle chase scenes and the flying chase scenes were wonderful. The bright blue and orange lights were captivating and everything destroyed into tiny pixels was highly satisfying. But this movie was meant to be 3D and it was poorly executed, gave me a headache.During most of the movie things were just blurry and depths couldn't be perceived. The 3D glasses provided were very poor in quality and I'm sure they were the cause for my migraine.If my experience was a localized occurring then I would like to say that it is still the Movie-Maker's responsibility. When they want to do a world-wide release then they should make sure good digital prints and quality 3D glasses are available for the screening. Otherwise its just a joke for them to say its a world wide release and keep the quality prints in US.(this I say after reading the reviews of those in the US who haven't had such problems)Cast: Jeff Bridges' characters are solid for their role, I would have liked a bit of moisture on Clu's face to make him more believable. Olivia Wilde along with Beau Garrett added the right amount of gorgeousness to the film. Though i would have preferred a bigger part for Michael Sheen I was satisfied.So in conclusion my biggest disappointment is that the 3D isn't as good as Avatar's. I'm seriously considering watching it again in a different theater to see if a better print has been delivered elsewhere.",TRON - Legacy
613,jhunt26,Why should a film be dismissed simply because its art lies in its aesthetics?,9,28 December 2010,"Despite being a sequel to its 1982 predecessor, the follow-up to Disney's cult classic 'Tron' is its own body of work and newcomers can choose to ignore the original if they so choose. The opening act brings the audience up to speed with the Tron universe and its characters; years after his father's mysterious disappearance, a now adult Sam Flynn is summoned to the abandoned video game arcade that he used to visit as a child. There, he is transported to 'The Grid', a digital frontier of endless possibility crafted by his father, who has been trapped within it after his creation turned against him. Here, computer 'programmes' have a mind and body of their own, and one in particular, coded in the image of Sam's father, is bent on leaving The Grid with an army poised to rid the real world of its 'imperfections'. With the help of a loyal female programme named Quorra, Sam and his father Kevin set out to return to reality in order to delete their opposition from The Grid entirely. As heavy-handed as it all sounds, the plot can be taken on surface value and accepted as a struggle between good and evil. Science fiction fans will relish the esoteric terminology, and flashbacks are wisely implemented with a blurring effect that indicates a change in continuity, easing the audience into the story. 'Tron Legacy' is best described as pure cinematic art. The direction is slick, capturing action choreographed with a precision and attention to detail that reflects the films' digital environment, synchronized to a synth-laden orchestral score courtesy of electronic duo Daft Punk. Their sharp queues and ominous melodies pace the film with an effervescence that maintains a relentless atmosphere through a spectrum of emotion, scoring heart-pounding chase scenes with tense riffs and character work with melancholy chords. The relevance of Daft Punk's sound to the universe of The Grid means their work here embodies the soul of the film.With visuals and sound defining 'Tron Legacy', detractors may argue that the entire film is simply a glorified music video. There are, however strong themes and even stronger social commentaries present that are not merely subtext, but emerge as thought-provoking issues. While at its core 'Tron Legacy' is the story of a son searching for his father, it is also addresses the risks of technology and the corruption that comes with power, not as dismissible connotations but as a bold, insightful premise. Joseph Kosinski, in his first effort at the helm of a feature film, doesn't allocate particular sequences to building character and confronting his subject matter, but rather blends art with action to create a film where all aspects develop together, reaching a crescendo in the finale where conflict meets resolution. At times his artistic merit overwhelms the human drama, but this is a small price to pay for some of the most wondrous visuals in recent memory.Jeff Bridges performs solidly in two roles (a younger version of his character is achieved through disturbingly lifelike CGI), and his likeness in an enthusiastic Garrett Hedlund (Sam) heightens their chemistry. Olivia Wilde calms the abundance of testosterone with an effortless presence, in her gentle turn as a rebel programme longing to discover the world beyond The Grid for herself. Also noteworthy (though not surprisingly) is Michael Sheen, who manages to bring some colourful humour and life to the film's dark universe in his brief screen time.Designed to rouse the senses more than the soul, 'Tron Legacy' is a rare departure for Disney from its family ethos, but a rewarding experience nonetheless. For many the dependence on special effects may seem shallow, but why should a film be dismissed simply because its art lies in its aesthetics?9/10",TRON - Legacy

I would have to say yes. The 3d was uninspiring, the story line confusing at times , i was never dragged into the tron world or held at the edge of my seat. The budget i believe was massive which goes to show money cant by you a film.

I enjoyed the visual aspects of the movie and there were plenty of cool scenes to watch. I just wish that there were more somehow. I feel as if there could have been more to the story or something. If someone were away for twenty years more should have happened to that person, shouldn't there be something more? I feel like the characters could have used some development or something.

In the 70's people were blown away with star wars. but in the 90's i was blown away with tron. Now that i'm 31, i felt like the 10 year old i was when i saw the first tron. It was great seeing Jeff bridges back to playing Flynn. he looked like he hadn't aged a day when playing Flynn and C.L.U.(with the help of computer effects). I loved how the story was emotionally driven and that it was about a son finding his father. the first tron was only about a guy getting sucked into the grid and surviving. whereas this tron it was about Sam finding Kevin. Olivia Wilde looked extremely hot as Quora. after all she's one of my dream girls. The 3D looked awesome. thou it's in 2D 4 the first 20 minutes so if you're expecting a full 3D movie, you might be disappointed. The ending was satisfying yet sad due to Flynn's death. but he might come back for a tron 3.

618,reinhard-hofer,A remake not equal to the original,3,12 January 2011,"The original Tron had a story and a message and both were well connected. The 2010 version has no content at all. It is an empty movie where technical expressions are thrown into. True, it is a remake, so it can not have a unique new idea like with tron original or matrix. Still it is disappointing that all the scenes are not connected and the whole story makes no sense. A disappointment for people who know the original and a waste of time for people who do not.However Olivia Wilde plays very convincingly. I have not seen her in a movie before only in House but she surprised me positively. Her minor role can not do enough to lighten the film up.",TRON - Legacy
619,teddo1032,Most definitely entertaining and well worth your time,7,28 January 2011,"I haven't seen the original Tron, so my review here is based solely on this film alone. To skip ahead, Tron: Legacy is as entertaining as it is impressive.If you are planning to see this movie in theaters, you will be warned that some scenes, mostly in the beginning, are displayed intentionally in 2D. I don't know why they did that and it doesn't make much sense to me. The idea is probably that the digital world is so much more advanced than our own that they had to emphasize this by only showing this world in 3D. But isn't our perspective of our world already in 3D? The more I think about it, the more I get confused. I think this is one of those director's decisions that, when 3D TV has eventually penetrated all our living rooms, he will end up regretting. Rest assured that it did not distract me from the rest of the film, so chances are it won't distract you either, but I felt like expressing it.This movie is truly a piece of art. The visual effects are not overdone at all and details like the simple light strips on every building or costume give a feeling of subtle artistic simplicity that I can definitely appreciate. The action scenes are very exciting and well executed. All characters, with the exception of Castor/Zuse, are well written and well performed. The only reason I didn't like Zuse is because he acts too extravagant, which doesn't fit in his role as a ""digital"" character. Daft Punk's soundtrack is amazing and I could not think of a better picture for them to score, it's a match made in heaven. They do get a little too much screen time for a cameo appearance. The only downsize to this film is that there are some non-action scenes in it that I found out to be overstretched and boring. The other scenes definitely make up for this, but if the boring parts weren't there, I would rate this movie much higher. My prediction is that Tron: Legacy will turn out to be another science fiction classic. It cannot beat films like Star Wars or The Matrix, but it is definitely a welcome addiction and definitely worth seeing it.",TRON - Legacy
620,clint_hamilton_1,True Grid...,9,14 February 2011,"I'll keep this short and sweet, but Tron Legacy was by far the best film i've seen for a while. I liked the look, the style, the story, the music, the atmosphere, the effects, the acting, the casting...start, middle and ending. Jeff Bridges is always watchable and having the original Tron actor Bruce Boxleitner in it was a nice touch. The affection it gave to the first Tron film and the classic 80's feel it managed to still inject into this film was impressive. This along with Daft Punks score gave everything an edge.My only negative, and why i couldn't quite give it a full 10/10 is that i felt the bike action was pretty slow and laboured. Not as thrilling as i'd have imagined. In fact the brief scenes of Flynn's son on a normal motorbike in the real world, seemed oddly faster and more action packed. Compared to the crafts and vehicles in for example the Star Wars films, they make the Tron bikes speed look in the same class as a Sinclair C5. Might seem picky but a lot of the advertisement and why i loved the original was the bikes. To end with the 3D wasn't really quite there. But i don't think the film suffered to much from it.I hope they let us go to the Grid again for another film.",TRON - Legacy
621,margaretajdl,a very good follow up,10,15 October 2011,"This was a very good film. it played homage to the original, but also had a distinct feel and look to it. I mean, take one frame of this film and you can tell apart from any other film of the year. I think the film should be appreciated for that fact alone. I admit the story is lacking, but I don't think the filmmakers were too concerned about the story, and I watching the film was more enraptured by the look of the film. This type of film is about the experience of going to another world, about seeing things we don't see in everyday life. Although the father and son relationship is hinted at in the film, it's not fully played out, but who cares. If I want to see a drama, I can rent thousands of them that came out this year alone. I go into tron to see great effects and to live in a different, beyond creative world for 2 hours. That is exactly what I got from this film.

624,adgarlach,Umm......What?,2,12 May 2011,"Alright, I wasn't one of those guys going into this hoping to have a life changing, reliving of my childhood. Which is good, because I remember enjoying the original TRON as a kid, watching it with my computer programmer of a father who created the sci-fi nerd that I am today.This is not a movie I would want my kids to remember. Yea sure, what everybody says about the special effects is true, it looked cool. But in my opinion, a movie has to do more than that. A movie needs a good story and/or good characters. T:L has neither.Lets start with the story. Sweet boy who's father has gone missing becomes a rebellious young adult. (Feel like you've heard this one? It gets better). Gets cryptic clue about possible whereabouts of father. Finds father trapped in his own creation, rescue attempt begins. Yea...not that original. Add to that an awful attempt at a self-righteous moral that is pounded over your head more times than Mario swings his hammer at Donkey Kong. Add to that, techno babble that is completely unintelligible (I consider myself a relatively smart guy, so either I need to reassess that, or Jeff Bridges was spouting out nonsense for half the movie). Add to that huge plot holes and unfinished plot lines. Add to that an imaginary virtual world that doesn't even follow it's own rules. Vehicles that travel using light yet someone planes stall when flying vertically. Hint to the writers - SOMETHING WITHOUT A MOTOR CAN'T STALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Add to that ..... OK if you're completely annoyed with me by this point multiply by 100 and that is how annoying this story is.Now the characters....let's see there's Flynn who can't seem to decide whether he's a hippie without a care, a zen Buddhist, or a hermit hiding from reality (well hiding form virtual reality).Flynn's son Sam - the rebellious youth with something to prove who's dialog seemed to have been cut and paste from all those other rebellious youths with something to prove out there.CLU - The creation of Flynn (and his identical image that doesn't age) that, following Flynn's command to create perfection, goes totalitarian, genocide and all. Cut and paste other megalomaniac dialog here.Quorra - The girl with a bad side and a hidden secret (bum bum bum she's the last of her race that the above mentioned CLU has wiped out.....a race that ""evolved"" all by itself within the computer system (I think it'd be better if we skipped my rant on that but yes it is as ridiculous as it sounds) Zeus - the quirky bartender with a hidden agenda (bum bum bum he works for the bad guys) and yes this computer world has a bar requiring a bartender where programs go to drink I recommend visiting one yourself after this film and drinking enough to kill the brain cells remembering it.And finally Tron - the character that the movie is NAMED AFTER. Tron has decided to work (unexplicably) for the bad guys, but does this in secret behind a mask under another name that I don't remember or care to look up. Until his final moment, when he (unexplicably) changes his mind and attacks said bad guy, screaming his only line ""I FIGHT FOR THE USERS"" and dies, without taking out said bad guy. My wife after watching the movie didn't even understand that it was supposed to be TRON. Some legacy.All in all this film is just bad.",TRON - Legacy
625,Eddie_A,"A solid, visually stunning movie.",9,5 August 2011,"I watched this movie in a cinema with a friend on opening day, after I had only learned of it's making a few weeks prior, but as soon as I realised that it was being made, I got excited. I remember watching the original TRON on TV about 10 years ago at age 7 and not understanding anything at all, just thinking that all of the blinking lights looked pretty, this viewing was astronomically different. I have since watched it about a dozen times on Blu-Ray and it never gets old.As I noted, I watched TRON: Legacy the first time in a cinema, and the effect given by sitting in a dark room while the movie had a dark background with only bright strips of light throughout was incredible, and it made you feel as if you had been immersed into The Grid and were part of the action.As anyone who has watched the film will tell you, the visual effects are amongst the best, if not THE best, in any movie I have ever seen. The world is ruled by light, and this concept it fully harnessed with the addition of actual light strips throughout the suites worn by the characters, this looks it's best when two people are standing close to each other and the lights from the suits will illuminate the opposite person's face. The environments, vehicles, and light disk sequences are incredible, but it's the light cycles that really steal the show, no matter how brief their screen time.Garrett Hedlund performs admirably for his first leading role, while Jeff Bridges is a treat to watch reprise his role as Kevin Flynn.And last, but in no way least, Olivia Wilde. In my mind, this was really her break-out role that launched her from ""tv star and occasional movie part"" to arguably the most sought after actress around. She delivers an adept, physically demanding performance, and looks magnificent as always.....especially in that suit! Overall, I loved this movie. The nay-sayers who only really payed attention when bikes were racing and disks were being thrown will say that there was no plot involved, when the plot was actually reasonably well planned out. I won't go into details, but I will say that it kept my attention.A solid, enjoyable movie. 9/10",TRON - Legacy

It could have had a stronger storyline.The storyline was good,but not great.But a first film's never perfect,and everything else in it was perfect, so I'm giving it a 10 out of 10!",TRON - Legacy
627,jayzgrrl,Fiine film,7,6 February 2012,"A science fiction movie made by Disney seems interesting enough especially when it's live-action and targeted for kids (Disney targets its movies for kids, right?). And there it is, ""Tron: Legacy"", a science fiction movie, Disney science fiction movie, live-action and targeted for kids. And yet, 3D.""Tron: Legacy"" is actually a sequel to the 1982 revolutionary film, ""Tron"" and marks the directorial debut of Joseph Kosinski. ""Legacy"" sets Kevin's son, Sam Flynn, 27 years in age as the main character who gets a message from Kevin (or so it is) from the world of Tron. He then goes to Flynn's arcade, enters some sort of mysterious room and plays with a computer which digitized him and entered him to the world of Tron. Then, he fights with other programs trying to find his father, Kevin Flynn who disappeared years ago. On the way, he meets Quorra, some cool machines and of course, Clu (Kevin's program).I watched ""Legacy"" and found it to be really good. The rendering of the world of Tron was really breathtaking and got me in awe. All of the world is definitely going to make ""Tron: Legacy"" one hell of a blockbuster film and surely, one of the best films on the year 2010.The acting had no problem. Jeff Bridges, after all those years since the first film is still fresh as ever. Garrett Hedlund was also not a problem in the film. Olivia Wilde as Quorra was stunning. The acting was definitely perfect. Everything.The 3D effects. This was one funny thing. In the beginning of the film, it was noted that some parts of the film were in 2D and some were in 3D and you were asked to not take your 3D glasses off. I did broke the rule several times and saw something unique. Parts that were set in the real world, not in the world of Tron were displayed in 2D and parts that were set in the world of Tron were displayed in 3D. Anyways, the 3D worked pretty well. The Lightcycles in the film and all the things in the world of Tron, displayed in 3D were awesome.The score of the film was also exciting. (The soundtrack was also great as it reached number 10 on the Billboard 200.) It was very awesome and thrilling with all the bass and everything.Overall, ""Tron: Legacy"" is worth to watch. 3D works pretty fine in watching this film. Young kids would not really like this but maybe aged 8 and above would do. I believe this is the best film for December 2010 and is a good way to end blockbuster movies of 2010. Great job, Kosinski.Prince AJB's Score: 85%",TRON - Legacy
628,benji-320-59129,The best film I have EVER watched,10,18 March 2012,"I actually got a little emotional after watching this film, don't get me wrong I didn't cry! lol but I remember as a child watching this film and just being amazed by how beautiful and was actually about the only happy memory I have of my childhood, and again 28 years later they manage to do it again.I have watched this film over and over in amazement, the sound track is just amazing and I've got to say beats any score by Hans Zimmer and that's saying something. The director and writers are pure genius.I hope they make a 2nd!! I will be the first in the Cinema.Amazingly as I am writing this review Tron Legacy has actually just started playing on my TV through Sky Movies!! Creepy!!!! Please watch this film, its visually spectacular and will give you goosebumps..Sheer beauty.Benjamin Holmes",TRON - Legacy
629,hireegy,Sad mass dilution of a great idea,6,20 February 2014,"WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS!! In order to have a well defined idea of that movie, I watched the original Tron (1982) two days before I watched Tron: Legacy.And from there, you see all the flaws of a scenario written too lightly, without proper care. As others pointed out, at some times, it's randomness! However, I must add that the visual effects really are worth the 170 million budget, and the overall design of the universe, although painfully missing the point of the original movie, still has something of its own, even if it has many very clear inspirational sources making it a bit of a faded copy.Now, in detail.The original Tron was a serious movie. It contained serious details, realistic details, realistic in that it really corresponded to what you would expect from a computer world getting ""live"". A lot of imagination, the kind of imagination you don't have to justify to an assembly of cautious shareholders: drinking ""power"" from a water source, tanks, bits saying only ""yes"" and ""no"" to all questions, red programs having root permissions while blue programs having user permissions, the idea of ""the next decision cycle"", being possibly the time at which the operating system takes the hand between program-allocated cycles...all was so precise and cleverly put to image, to story! And the story was clear: the big cruiser with the captain of bad guys was hunting for the fugitives, they escaped on a solar wind spacecraft simulation (I would like to underline these four words, because in the 2009 movie, they say ""they are flying over the sea of simulation"", while trying to justify why the ""freight train"" is actually a copy of that solar wind spacecraft. What the hell, it does not make any sense, same level as the ""unicellular proteins"" of Matrix!) And this example is exactly the kind of moment that made me feel so bad about Tron: Legacy. They tried to follow the 1982 scenario whatever it took, but at the same time, they changed a lot of key elements in the story, and the computer world in which the action takes place. It just fails, there is no other word. While one scenario is justified at all points and cleverly puts things together, the scenario of Legacy feels...empty and awkward. Watch the two movies and you will see why.A short list of other weird moments: ""going in the light and putting the disk up"" is to communicate with the user, not use a ""key"" to go to the real world.why would a freight train go to a secret gateway to the real world that is open once in ages at first, and why then would it go to the secret military base instead, which was just an awkward reason to put the ""cruiser"" in the story, like the cruiser from 1982?CLU ""can't create"" programs but he could sure clone them, have multiple instances of them. Come on.Flynn senior must be 1 million something years old if he lived 20 years by the ""cycles"" inside the digital worldClu was not created to build a perfect world, but just to hack into the MCP.The only good point is this idea of ""ISOs"". At a sufficient degree of complexity, the system could, indeed, have generated its own lifeforms. This was a good idea, but amongst the rest of the world that was stripped of all its original ideas, and brought down to a regular dark urban world with a bunch of neon lights and flames that follow geometric patterns...it was the only good idea among many bad ones, and I'm sure many viewers did not get the point, especially since we see these ISOs maybe 20 seconds in the entire movie!So, to sum up, it's still a beautiful movie to watch, but it's gotten ""regular"", like all other action movies, and although an effort was made to create a dark universe, the fact it was made ""too much like the real world"" killed all its attractiveness, and the fact it makes you dream of that world at night. I won't even remember the world from Legacy...I will only remember it felt random and awkward.And yes, look at all the things they took from Matrix (fight style, Castor = Merovingian in his club in Matrix Revolutions), Animatrix (the house of Flynn senior, in the middle of a rocky dark wasteland, in one of the Animatrix episodes you have a lonely house just like that), and Star wars (double light sabers, disks that cut anything but other disks? Come on).You also kind of get a lot of ""directions"", feelings that at some point one guy in the movie crew put his touch to nudge the film towards his vision of the universe, but every time this happens...it is just off-topic. It would have been good, in a completely different movie, just like that club! A very good club, classy etc, the film makers feel more ""at home"", but it's not what we were expecting to see as the Tron sequel! One last thing: stop making close up 3D animated doubles from actors because they are too old now. It does not work, and it's ugly.That's all I wanted to say :-)",TRON - Legacy
630,joshtbsa,Decent Movie,8,5 June 2014,"Bottom Line:Was the Movie worth watching? - YesWould I watch it again within a month? - Probably notWould I watch it again within a year? - MaybeWould I watch it again within a 3 years? - YesHow family friendly was it on a scale of 1-10? - *8* (Some scenes might be to intense for young ones)This was a pretty decent movie, however it didn't end the way that I thought it would.It probably is not one that I would watch again real soon.I have not seen the original TRON movie so I don't know the comparison in the movie quality, however, I am planning watching it soon!!",TRON - Legacy
631,hokavs,One of the best movies IMO,10,15 August 2021,"This movie is so underrated, yet has so many great moments and symbolism (mostly, but not all, about redemption between a father and his son). But what about Flynn facing Clu for first time? Or Tron fighting for the userse? And the father sacrificing himself for the son? Just amazing. And don't forget the music! It's an amazing movie, and much more streamlined than the first one.",TRON - Legacy
632,rondavidh,Actually fun flick! Worth a watch.,7,19 May 2016,"Honestly surprised with how good this movie is. The setting brings a nice aesthetic, the characters are enjoyable, and the plot is set at a decent pace. My critique to this film is how it has so much potential that is not exploited, despite it being a lengthy film (I consider the standard at 1:30, T:L goes to 2). For example, the Grid where the story is set in is said to be the pinnacle of perfection, yet we barely see any of it, and what we do see is more reminiscent of a gritty dystopia. This also applies to some of the characters, e.g. not using Olivia Wilde's naivete to explain concepts, Sam Flynn's entire character in general.Overall, this is a decent film, and one worth a watch. This will always be remembered by me as the movie with CGI Jeff Bridges, the most badass electronica soundtrack in film history, and my biggest celebrity crush to date (Olivia Wilde ily so hard <3)",TRON - Legacy
633,Radiio,"Basic storyline, but the visuals, aesthetic and music are top notch",7,10 July 2019,"Basically, my title says everything. Daft Punk killed the music, which showed a bit of variety in what they do. Never knew they could do some more orchestral pieces. Loved the mixture of the electronic and orchestral. Rinzler is hands down the most badass song, great introduction for the character.
Although the story is quite basic, I loved everything else in the film.",TRON - Legacy
634,hoobay,Better with every re-watch,9,13 October 2017,"I just watched this again, for maybe the third or fourth time. It seems that I enjoy it just a bit more each time. Visually stunning...I do not get the amount of negative reaction when it was first released. The original had a lot of nostalgia around it, and maybe that colored what people were expecting of this. I enjoyed the original. I enjoyed this one. Both films are a bit different from a lot of stuff that is out there, and that may also have had an impact for people's expectations. Okay...it's not a Marvel superhero movie. But frankly, I am getting a little burned out on those. And maybe that is why I enjoyed this re-watch. Sci-fi/action where I could just enjoy the outstanding visuals, and great soundtrack. It's a great movie to just enjoy, part of which is that it doesn't want you to take it too seriously. Also, because this was a re-watch, I was able to focus a bit more on how the scenes were constructed, the ""art"", versus focusing on the story. Which may be a part of why I enjoyed it more.And now I'm disappointed, as any further sequel seems to be in limbo. I am curious to see what the plan was for where the story would go.",TRON - Legacy
635,seeforyourself1,I'm going to see it again,10,18 December 2010,"Okay real quick I want to first say that I am a big time movie buff and I am very critical of so many movies I lost count. TRON LEGACY is the best of the best! I believe it is better than Avatar by far and I also believe it will break records across the board.Avatar did a great job of making you forget you were human and sucked you into an alien world. Tron Legacy is hands down THE BEST 3D MOVIE EVER MADE, PERIOD and will make you forget about your life for 2 hours! I guarantee it!I saw the original when I was very young and remember very little and that just doesn't matter when watching this brilliantly made film!This movie had everything you want in a film but it had things a lot of movie makers lost touch of over the last 2 decades.As an adult still going to the movies on opening day I must say that when I was young I use to leave the theater feeling like I was stronger as a person having watched it. Now that I am older I don't get that anymore and I recently thought that maybe its just that I am older now but after watching TRON LEGACY I know now that it wasn't me. It was that most of these movies in the last two decades lack the same cinematic power that the 80's movies had in them. There have been some here and there that were definitely amazing films but this film is on it's own new level!Tron Legacy has all of the 80's type of film making but now with amazing special effects. I felt chills as I was watching this masterpiece!I also kept thinking throughout the film that I hope directors old or new in the movie industry watch this amazing movie because it's a definite game changer and I hope it will require new films to do a better job writing and a much better job at matching the musical scores to their new films, which is what most films lost touch of over the years.I cannot even remember a film that had me wanted to go back to pay for a ticket again and again and this was the most expensive movie ticket I ever purchased at $15.50. I saw in IMAX 3D. A first for me to combine the 2. As I write this I can't believe I will say this again but I will go back and pay for the most expensive ticket I ever purchased in my life just to watch this amazing masterpiece again! This movie had me tapping my wife throughout the film as If I was hoping she didn't blink or something, so she doesn't miss a thing! I love movies! I always have and I always will and I am in awe! Wow isn't even coming close to how I feel about this movie!This film is the key that every writer, director, producer, movie company needs to create the future of movies PERIOD. The secret is TRON LEGACY and for those who don't like this film I have only this to say Your crazy and you clearly don't have any idea what you just watched.",TRON - Legacy
636,regemadorate,"High hopes before, disappointment after",4,2 August 2017,"Having seen the original Tron movie from 1982 I held high hopes for this sequel. But I was very disappointed. The story isn't as original as the movie from 1982. It is more like a mixture of Star Wars, the Matrix and the Lord of the Rings. The story line about Cru building a great army that looks almost identical to the drones from Star Wars. The planes with the folded wings is another one that give away the lack of originality in the script. Some scenes are from the Matrix like the wasted landscape seeing from the house of Flynn watching at the Machine City. The scenes with Zuse are a bad copy of the role of Merovingian in the Matrix reloaded. And the ISO are just a faint image of the Elfs from the Lord of the Rings. And that Rinzler was Tron was given away the moment he said: ""User"". The role of Tron was completely undervalued, he is in the movie but at the same time he is more like a shadow. I had hope that the director and cast had shown some creativity but it is was it is and it ain't much.",TRON - Legacy

639,peteroglos,Most underrated film with regards to visual and sound,9,23 October 2018,"I remember watching this movie when I was 10 years old, amazed by the visual light spectacle of the disc wars and vehicle battles. 8 years on and I am not disappointed. The CGI and visuals still hold up remarkably well (if you don't mind a CGI young Jeff Bridges) and despite it's minor plot holes, it hosts an engaging and gripping story. The music, man the music. Daft Punk does not disappoint with an amazing electronic soundtrack that captivates every moment of the movie with magnificence. Jeff bridges continues to be an amazing actor, along with Olivia Wilde, and at times even Garrett Hedlund has his great ""one liner"" moments. Overall this is a highly entertaining and exciting movie, great for teens discovering the grid for the first time or people wanting to re experience the retold story of Tron.",TRON - Legacy
640,dig_Sf,"Frankly, kind of a disappointment",6,2 March 2011,"The firs Tron was great, new concepts and ideas, stunning effects (for those times) etc. etc. Tron Legacy lacks certain things, the first of which, I would say, is a good cast. Garrett Hedlund gives a weak performance, he tries too hard to fill some shoes that just aren't his size, in addition, his ""cool"" guy style...just isn't believable. Olivia Wilde, overall, plays the character pretty good (not exceptional), giving a certain ""charm"" to Quorra. So the only true performance, not surprisingly, is that of Jeff Bridges who brings back to life the original character from the first Tron, with some very ""smooth"" and ""jazzy"" sprinkles of wisdom (some of the lines reminded me of his portrayal of ""the Dude"", in ""The Big Lebowski"". Michael Sheen also gave a good touch to Zuse. The script was pretty good, but it lacks certain ""depths"" (I put this on the account of the movie being mostly based on the 3D effects, thus making it sort of a ""for the masses"" kind of flick), I'm sure the writers had much more in mind than this, but all in all, the script was interesting and intriguing, I would say that it succeeded in overcoming the challenges and rose to the value of the original ideas from the first script.The soundtrack was exceptional, Daft Punk didn't fail in giving a great feeling to the movie, bringing in an almost ""electric"" kind of feel to the whole experience. Where I feel that the movie ""broke down"" was in the lack of a stronger experience from the above mentioned characters. I didn't feel a connection, a ""chemistry"" (how it is often called), especially between Bridges and Hedlund and that kind of ruins some of the important ""spiritual"" moments between the characters.To summarize, I'd say that the movie is worth a 6, for the whole 3D experience (which is very good), the soundtrack (which adds to the immersion into the Grid World) and the script (which I didn't expect to be this good), but for the already mentioned reasons, it lacks a profound depth. I never really ""got lost"" in the movie because Sam Flynn, as played by Hedlund, was never a believable character, and thus never really felt most of the important moments of drama and ""pressure"" that I was supposed to feel, making the whole movie lack emotional subjectivity.",TRON - Legacy
641,chrisneighbour,Amazing sequel to the last one,10,30 November 2019,"This movie is great as a first time view, however benefits even more if you see the original.

It's so much deeper than you would think and the father son dynamic for any son or father is brilliant and moved me.It has so many levels but it's so simple, good versus evil, ideals and morals versus logic and data.This is never going to win awards but it gets a gold star from me.",TRON - Legacy

In my opinion, Tron is a movie that you must watch because it presents an alternate reality between the two worlds. This movie takes place in an arcade game that Sam Flynn, the protagonist, unexpectedly gets engulfed inside. While he's there, Sam meets Quorra, an avatar in the game. They both go on a quest to locate his missing father. During his quest, he meets another character whom he believed was his friend. Only later does Sam realize that his friend was the rival.

644,dmulroy-1,About all they could have done.,8,3 December 2010,"I saw a preview of this last night in London, we were told reviews were embargo'd until Sunday, so these are just my thoughts.First the 3D. Its only really on the Grid, not in the 'real world', so it works really well. 9/10.The effects were about what I expected, although tbh, anyone who has played Tron Evolution (the new game out last month) wont see anything new - in fact I thought the environments in the game were actually better. And I think some of the battles I've had online were more exciting than the Games in the movie. 6/10Storyline is about all the could have done, I wont reveal any of it, but its OK. However, no love story. More of a father / son bonding thing going on. Im not sure on the age rating of the movie, but come on, Olivia Wilde? I just wanted them to get it on with some cyber sex! Not even a kiss. 6/10Acting... again great, all characters were believable and everyone put in a good performance. I've got to give a big shout to Michael Sheen here, his Castor character literally stole the whole show. His performance, albeit relatively short, is the only reason Im going back to watch the film again! Brilliant. 10/10Clu...OK Jeff Bridges. His digitised character was the only disappointment in the movie. Don't get me wrong, sometimes it looked realistic, especially the middle third of the movie, but the rest of the time... it was worse than ja ja binks. 6/10I also think they could have done with explaining a bit of the story bridging the two movies. I finished the Tron Evolution game so I knew what it was all about, but many wont, and will be left without a Clu as to his motives.

648,nickchick17,Thrilling Movie Experience,10,24 December 2010,"I was struck by stunning ambiance created by Tron: Legacy. And this is coming from someone who prefers substance over style, and dislikes 3D movies. But this is one movie that is a MUST in 3D. This movie is absolutely visually dazzling, a true experience. One thing I found very cool was that the cutting edge effects are combined with a 1980's vibe, a great throwback to the original, which was released in 1982. When Sam Flynn visits his dad's long abandoned arcade, Journey's ""Separate Ways"" starts playing on the jukebox. It's like the 80's are waiting to be re-awakened in that arcade. One of my favorite moments of the film, quite honestly. And the ""program"" Zuse, played by Michael Sheen looks about at 80's as you can get, complete with guyliner. Probably the grid was built during that time, and all the computer programs continue in 80's style.Although the eye candy and mood created by this film were what made it great to me, that still would have only gone so far without story. And luckily Disney is known for telling a good story. While not the strongest story they've told, there is still enough plot and heart in this film to bring it to life emotionally.I really enjoyed the score by Daft Punk. While the music is not a John Williams level masterpiece, it fits perfectly with the film, once again evoking the 80's as well as the cold, electronic environment of the grid. Once again, great overall mood both visually and aurally.Being a woman in my 20's, I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the hotness that is Garrett Hedlund. This movie definitely made me a fan. He has boyish good looks, while still being very masculine, unlike some of the wimpy ""heartthrobs"" popular today. Love the deep voice. I recognized him instantly as Patroclus from another one of my favorite movies, Troy. I didn't think he was as hot there, but perhaps the ancient Greek look isn't his best. But I digress. I really enjoyed him in the role of Sam Fylnn in Tron. Olivia Wilde is gorgeous as Quorra, and it was great fun to see Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner reprise their roles. Overall an amazing movie experience. See this one while it's still in theaters! I can't imagine seeing this film on a TV.",TRON - Legacy
649,zarobaro,Spectacular visuals+fantastic sound+ average story...enough for me,9,11 August 2011,"First of all , keep in mind that this is my first ever comment and i'm no movie critic at all, plus i'm a HUGE fan of the old arcades. But i just can't stay silent reading all the negative and from my point of view unfair comments. ------------ spoiler alert ----------------The thing that concerns me is how most of the negative reviews point the ""not so cool/even stupid"" similarity the Virtual world have with the Real one ... like wind,rain,dust,clouds, the programs have clothes,hair ,they go to clubs and so on ... Well if you all MISSED THE PART THAT Actually Flynn, Tron and CLU created THIS(NEW one - NOT the one from Tron 1982) Universe from scratch then its OK - the scene when Flynn creates CLU - a Mirror in a WASTELAND... no city , no programs no nothing...So, now that we know its a DIFFERENT -this time MANMADE World its not so hard to understand why there are clouds/dust/clubs/clothes.... isn't it? How would you shape a digital world of your own is a whole DIFFERENT thing. Now that we got this straight lets take a look of the film... The visuals and sound are EPIC , but if you can go to the cinema or to some friend with serious sound system(big TV if possible too, but sound is a MUST). I'm serious, i watched it at home for second time yesterday and it was good , but not anywhere NEAR the cinema experience. Daft Punk truly deliver in this movie , their sound fits the digital world PERFECTLY and when added to the Visuals it just stuns you(me).As a HUGE arcade fan i so love how the kept the old inventory (bikes,seekers etc.. - i missed the tanks though) and added some new things , so you're happy seeing the old classics plus nicely surprised by the new additions(The plane chase in particular was amazing). There are some lovely little things in the film that won me too - when CLU is in Flynns hideout he looks and touches the two cubes above the fireplace one white , the other yellow-orange - just like them. I like these little things, because the visuals are so good that the movie could go without them , but they still put them in.The acting is decent given the movie storyline. Bridges similarities to the Dude is fine with me ,Wilde/Qurra is interesting and plays well as a digital being with curiosity for the real/other world.Hedlund does well too, he convinced me with his acting that he's a boy missing his father and is truly happy and stunned, that the world his father told him story of really exists.They had their moments in the film(mostly when alone together), which is too little for some , but cmon , the movie isn't mainly about the family drama, it has just enough of it to match its style.Castor was the one that i didn't really like.Maybe it was intentional but he was too over the top.It was the only thing in the film that looked(for me) out of place,he looked like a Looney tunes character somehow accidentally got switched with Castor...This is getting too long so i'll be over with it ... Overall this is a very good movie that is true to its origins.You won't cry being touched by the characters and their drama, but you will be satisfied.The beauty of the Grid will grab you and won't let go until the end.It's not a pioneer, it's not groundbreaking but its Spectacular.Plus .. How many pioneer films have been there for the last 10-20 years? Almost every strange idea has already been filmed.So what remains after there are no major new theories left to film? - It's the little things and the makeup.I give it 9/10 with +1 for me being the fan of arcades that i am , and - 1 for the Castor switched with Yosemite Sam accident. I went to the cinema with mixed feelings , and i got out satisfied.",TRON - Legacy

Now when I watched it again 10 years later I truly understood the beauty of this film. The amazing visuals combined with an above average plot with one of the best soundtracks ever made makes it an amazing. There are something that disappointed me such as the ending I expected tron to return back to his senses and fight CLU and allowing Sam and Kevin Flynn to return back to the real world with Quora.

True: it is not the best 3D movie ever, I think, But the 2nd part where almost everything is CGI is virtual mind-blowing! The Grid and the games are really very good. The story hasn't got the 'oempf' that Tron 1 did, but it will do. It's entertaining anyway. I don't go to a movie expecting to read a book. I want to be entertained! Yes there are minor flaws and occasional inconsistencies but they didn't bother me at all! And the acting is fine! Jeff Bridges plays a slightly mystical Flynn and that suits him as well as Flynn. I especially liked Zuse, played by Michael Sheen. Reminded me slightly of ""Alex"" (Malcolm McDowell) from 'a Clockwork Orange'.

Especially with this year's quarantine and the online world reaching it's peak, the critics and viewers understand the importance of the grid and it's heavy philosophical implications.
This is a story of self-discovery, a story of a son who loses his father, a story of a man reaching ambitiously for the unattainable until fatally destroying himself. The touching nature of this story makes it's lines memorable and impactful.

654,jyn-88276,i will always adore this film,10,28 January 2021,Tron as an entire concept has so much potential and Tron legacy is by far one the best films i have ever seen the design and effects and just the way light reflections and shadows are used in it rivals modern titles to this day and the Tron evolution video game though a little flawed is again a huge mountain of potential and the entire concept and film is a masterpiece of art and film. i love it its amazing and it has so much potential there is nothing i love more in films than a good use of lighting and scale the way the grid is first perceived in the film you think its this vast open empty land only to arrive in a sea of huge mega structures the likes of which you couldn't ever imagine stretching for miles up towards the heavens creating these pillars of light that illuminate the clouds surrounding them and its just an amazing piece of scenery and i pray they make a third Tron film as its so underrated considering the work that went into making it into the work of pure art it is its the Mona Lisa of film design for its story the characters fit their roles flawlessly and the story comes naturally letting you drink in the entire experience.,TRON - Legacy
655,jsnakebreyer,This Movie Will Always Be One of My Favorites,9,17 October 2021,"I recently rewatched the movie Tron: Legacy. After I rewatched the movie I noticed several things that I didn't before. One of the first things I noticed was that I still enjoy watching the lights, fights, and the chase scenes as I did from the first time I saw the movie. However, after rewatching it, I was able to notice the story and how all of the actions connect to lead to the end of the movie.When Kevin Flynn, a software engineer and game designer, disappears, his son, Sam Flynn, sets out to find him after twenty years when Kevin's friend Alan recieves contact from Kevin's office. Sam finds his dad's office under his old arcade and is transported into a digital world called the 'Grid'. Clu, a program designed by Kevin Flynn to turn the Grid into a perfect world, rids the world of its imperfections, but also destroys the thing Flynn has been chasing after. The connection between humans and digital software, which happened to manifest within the Grid, but was seen as an impurity by Clu. Just as Kevin sought to enter the digital world, Clu seeks to enter the real world, but he will need Flynn's Disk, the key to the portal that would allow Clu to transport into the real world.As much as I love the contrasting dark buildings and vehicles with the blue and orange lights, there are some aspects of the film that I think they could've done better. There are some parts that I thought made the Grid too similar to the real world, such as dust and wind, which someone wouldn't really think of when thinking of a digital universe. There were also some moments where you could tell that Clu was just cgi Jeff Bridges (Actor of Kevin Flynn and Clu). I know that's how they filmed it, but there were some scenes where the realism was lost. On the other hand, I think that the fight scenes and the chase scenes were very well choreographed, especially the Disk battle between Sam and Rinzler and the fight at the End of Line Club. Another part I liked in the movie was how Clu gave an opposing speech of the one that Kevin Flynn gave in the beginning of the movie and how it had the same tone, but was reversed. Flynn's speech was about going into the digital world and Clu's being going out of the digital world.Another thing I have to add though, is that there wasn't a complete answer at the end. I wish there was another movie after this one to answer what happened to Quorra and Sam and what happened with Encom after Sam took the company back. I also wish they did more with Tron and his redemption arc. I feel there was a lot of potential that went missing with that. All that aside, I really do love this movie and always will. From the story to the choreography to the acting, I think this movie was a great film of seeing how humans could interact and live with artificial intelligence and programs such as Clu and Tron. Tron: Legacy will forever be one of my favorite movies.",TRON - Legacy
656,masatojpn81,Outstanding!,10,2 October 2011,"This film is one of the best I have ever seen in my entire life! Since I'm usually into the sci fi films (the matrix, existenz, dark city, etc), this film is never going to be an exception! This is my first time I have posted a comment on IMDb, so you can see how much I fell for this film... I'm not going in details about the film here, but this film has some spectacular aspects that make me glued to the film. 1. coloration: I'm talking about the coloration of ""blue"" and ""orange"" that is mainly occupying in this film. I think the coloration is very simple and not earthly, so that makes me feel it MUST be sci fi. 2. story: when I first watched TL the other day, I was just thrilled with the development of the story. I don't know what to say accurately, but it was truly ""intense"", like ""aliens"" I watched at first long time ago. 3. soundtrack: what was really striking was not only the story, but soundtrack as well. Rather, I should say the soundtrack makes the story of TL more intense. I don't think the story of transformers revenge was aided by soundtrack, even though the soundtrack itself was fine. I think it lacks ""the story"", but Tron Legacy was never like that. Anyway, I'm sure most people will like this film, and my verdict is of course 10 out of 10!",TRON - Legacy
657,johannes-94,enjoyably stupid,3,22 January 2011,"Tron is on it's way to become the most over-rated movie of 2010. It's a candy-wrapped insult to intelligence, as well as to the original. First, the visual effects. Although they look stunning in their all-black-and-neon style, there's not much original about them. It's chases and fights like we've seen a zillion times before. The worst thing is that most original idea from the original Tron is dropped. In the 1982 version, the light bikes were making sharp 90º turns without losing any of their phenomenal speed, really like electrons moving over the grid of a computer chip. It gave them an unpredictable and dangerous feel, and the impression of an eerie universe where normal laws of physics don't apply. In the new Tron, however, everything looks much more realistic. The bikes ride like normal bikes, planes fly like normal planes, and people die like normal people. Except for the fact that they disintegrate into little square pieces... Whoo, surprise! What is supposed to be a world of competing digital programs, is just a dark street with people walking around in funny dresses and plastic umbrellas. Yes, it even rains, and there's bums with (how modern!) plastic bottles. The good guys are white, the bad guys are red. Except for that eccentric (read; gay) disco owner who turns out to be a traitor... No, I can't say I've been visually surprised once.Then the story. It's the kind of script that does away with reason. Facts are stated in sentences like ""My disk is the key!"" or ""The portal is only open for 8 hours!"" or ""It will change the world! Science, quantum mechanics, religion, everything!"" without explanation. The most ridiculous are the ""ISO's"", some tribe of digital people who 'just appeared out of nowhere', whose last surviving chick becomes of major importance because daddy says she must -at all costs- become human. All for no apparent reason, other then filling a void script. But our adolescent hero doesn't need reasons or explanations, because all solutions to his problems are handed to him on a silver platter anyhow. When the going gets rough, there's always a car or a train or some pretty girl appearing out of nowhere to take him exactly where he has to go. All he has to do is comply. It's no adventure, it's plain boring. But sometimes it looks nice. And the abundance of little stupidities in this film, like the paper pig they're having for digital dinner, make it funny. So I guess you could say it provides an enjoyable evening!",TRON - Legacy
658,mlh1977,Visually stunning and a better plot thant I had expected,7,14 December 2010,"OK first off I am a huge fan of the original TRON film, it was one of my favourite films as a kid and continues to be so albeit with the visuals taking over from the story as my favourite aspect as I've got older. I would also say that anyone who wants to see this film has to see the first film to get the background on the main protagonists (excl. Sam) and understand a few of the ideas that are discussed.The second point I'd like to make is that this is a KIDS film made by Disney so for all those who are expecting a convoluted and complex plot with big ""reveals"" then I'd say skip this and go watch Inception again.For the film itself I'd like to break it down into some component partsThe Visuals - These are amazing, from the very opening sequence the 3D aspect is brought into play and unlike some other 3D escapades I've seen I felt like it was being put to proper use. I've heard / read some comments complaining that the whole film was not in 3D but I don't see the point in doing the whole thing in 3D, in fact I'd suggest that it would detract from the 3D sections if they had done this.The representation of the updated version of ""The Grid"" was also very impressive with the city & it's denizens putting me in mind of a setting from William Gibsons book ""Neuromancer"". Also the tanks, light cycles and game grid for the original have all been given a more modern tilt. Again I've heard complaints about this but for me it made perfect sense, several times the dialogue alludes to the fact that time is compressed in the grid so that a couple of days there only represents minutes in the real world. With this in mind it is understandable that the technology would have improved over the time period of 20 years. Also whats the point in the film-makers having technology that those working on TRON 1 could only have dreamed of and not putting it to use ? The light cycle battle alone is worth the entrance price.Plot & Characters - As I said at the beginning this is a kids movie made by Disney and as such the plot is in places a bit simplistic and several ideas that are introduced are not as fully explored as they may have been in a more adult film. There are also quite a few ""loose ends"" which do not get answered (i.e. what happens to Tron at the end ?). Having said that I did not find the plot to be boring or rambling and I felt the film moved at quite a good pace.The stars of the show character wise are definitely Jeff Bridges older Flynn (lifted straight out of the Big Lebowski) and Michael Sheens scene stealing turn as the flamboyant Castor \ Zuse character. Garret Hedland & Olivia Wilde are fine in their roles as Sam & Quorra respectively and it was refreshing to see a female character who can be soft, sensitive & even naive and then turn around and kick the cr*p out of her enemies rather than making her the typical angry ""damaged"" female with loads of violence to share. Of course Jeff Bridges also plays the main villain in as a CGI'd younger version of himself which for 95% of the time is pretty convincing (the fact that he's supposed to be a computer programme anyway helps your mind gloss over some of his more animated looking scenes). The relations ship between Flynn & Sam is textbook ""troubled son reunited with missing father"" fodder but it comes across pretty well without going super cheesy.As far as the dialogue goes I felt it was pretty good, no howlingly bad emotional pap and lots of knowing references to the original.The Soundtrack - As well as being a fan of the original TRON film I've also got a lot of time for Daft Punk (you know they watched TRON growing up !) so when I heard they were doing the soundtrack for the new film it was geek-overload.It was interesting to hear their take on the big orchestral arrangements that we are used to with cinematic soundtracks and I thought that they made a fair go of it but for me the soundtrack really shines when it is Daft Punk doing what they do best i.e. ditch the orchestra, get out the synth & the drum machine and make some crazy electro beats. The fact that they also cameo as DJ's in Castor's club was just another reason to enjoy the film.So in summary, this film is not going to change your life but it is the best use of 3D that I have seen to date and this combined with the representations of the alternative cyber-world has produced a visual feast with a great soundtrack. If you like the first film I'm pretty certain you'll enjoy this one.",TRON - Legacy
659,daevil1,Too subtle for most people?,10,17 December 2010,"I fear for Tron Legacy. I was already worried after seeing the scores it got on Rotten Tomatoes. Not because I was afraid it would be bad. But because it seemed that they found little to appreciate where I imagine there is a lot to be appreciated. The main issue I think with this film, is that it's subtle. Especially in regards to it's subtexts. There are a lot of interesting dynamics which mimics religious and Godlike behavior, and the whole movie is really about perfection vs imperfection and the consequence and inherit flaws of perfectionism. However, these are all implied through actions, and are very seldom referred to by itself.And that's a problem. It ends up being a profoundly deep and interesting movie if and only if the audience wishes to look for it. If they do not look for it, they will see awesome visuals, hear a great soundtrack, but the story will seem simplistic, and it will seem somewhat superficial in it's own right. Where Avatar forces it's own morals and perspective onto us, TL does it's thing and expects the audience to invest themselves in it from the get-go. For me that's great. It means that it's more subtle, yet it doesn't detract from the subtexts present. However it is a problem considering that this movie is supposed to make money. Perhaps the visuals and the soundtrack will save it. But if people aren't invested in the movie, and active participants, the accents that the soundtrack provides throughout the movie may feel out of place...Beyond that all I can say without spoiling the movie too much, is that except for a few motivations of characters, which seemed somewhat unclear to me, this movie is unmatched in it's originality in Hollywood as far as I can figure. I will need to re-watch it numerous times to be completely sure (that's a good sign), but I think this may actually be one of the few masterpieces of film that comes along. The only director that comes to mind in regards to rivaling Tron Legacy in terms of subtlety within profound subtexts is Andrei Tarkovsky.Unfortunately though, I do fear for it's blockbuster potential...",TRON - Legacy
660,russkem,Accidental Social Commentary?,2,13 January 2011,"I went to see Tron Legacy at the 3-D IMAX last night and actually lost sleep thinking about how horrible this movie was. But upon further introspection, I wonder...In comparison with the original Tron which in essence makes us ponder our existence in comparison to a computer, is not Tron Legacy stating the same thing, but in a much more dystopian light? Is it not saying that our digital (and social) experiment has failed? Where a once idealistic Flynn (a user or ""god"") now hides ""off the grid"" and meditates all day because his vision was flawed.Is not the movie itself, with its lack of creativity and emphasis on special effects and chase scenes, suggesting how dehumanized we have become as a result of the pursuit of digital (and social) perfection?Yes. I think I see the point hidden subtly below the smoke screen of CG effects and poor dialog. It is not time to reboot, it is time to unplug.Let's start playing in the street again.",TRON - Legacy
661,mmaa1212,Time to reevaluate this movie.,10,23 December 2020,"While I had always been a fan of this movie since its release, I do believe that time will be kinder to this movie than its initial reception 10 years ago. The movie wonderfully transitioned from the original storyline and the visual and music is absolutely mesmerizing. It's really a shame that a planned 3rd movie was never fulfilled (although there are talks about it now). Simply put, Tron legacy is one of those movies that you can watch when you just want to relax and be entertained...for all ages. Nothing too crazy or serious but pure visual and audio bliss. And plus it has Jeff Bridges for crying out loud!",TRON - Legacy
662,kreela,what an unbelievable provoking movie,1,2 January 2011,"Here's TRON: A Real cool guy driving around on his bike, living' on the edge cause ""BOHOOO My father left me"". He base-jumps from a skyscraper and...never mind.I wanted to walk out of the theater at least 14 times. And additionally one time when a ninja-program took a back flip and landed the COOL way, looking down, then slowly looking up. F(/&#! Endless over choreographed fighting-scenes, programs eating a pig for dinner...At that point my synapses overloaded and i felt like that guy in clockwork orange. I wondered if these programs would fart after eating that pork. In this perfected universe they have guns that jams. And why do they have big hangars for planes that actually fits inside a small stick anyway. The universe, the plot, the whole premise is built on a retarded thought you had the first time you smoked weed. Where is this actually happening? On the hard drive? Or maybe in the RAM, driving on light-bikes into the CPU...as a program..not literally of course. There is no new thoughts in this movie at all. I knew what was going to happen in every scene, except in the end when The Dude shows he in fact has powers that bends all rules in this strictly programmed world, and sends out a Playstation-RPG-power surge and helps his moron son get back to reality ""not without you daddy!! GO son..just GOOO!!"" He holds his fathers memory-ring over his head, HE-MAN style, into the bright stream of ...binary light, and gets sucked out of the digital world just in time before the whole shite collapses. Close call!I hate this movie for getting me to seriously consider shooting dirty street heroin into my veins just to forget about it. I will download the movie though, burn it on DVD, write some obscene stuff on it with a black marker pen, and then try to blow it up with firecrackers, if that fails i will simply burn it with a lighter and bury it.",TRON - Legacy
663,alwaysbwithu,A spectacular visual experience to be taken with a pinch of salt!,7,5 December 2010,"Kevin Flynn (Bridges) is the CEO of Encom and the world's best video game developer. One night he simply vanishes without a trace and leaves his company in chaos and his young son. Fast-forward 20 years, Sam Flynn (Hedlund) is a rebellious 27 year old and a thorn in the side of Richard Mackey (Nordling), a suit trying to take over his father's company with the help of a software designer (an uncredited cameo from Cillian Murphy). Though Sam is the heir, he refuses to play an active role in the decision-making process. Alan Bradley (Boxleitner) meets him one night with the news that he has received a page from Kevin Flynn's arcade - a number that has been disconnected for 20 years. Thus ensues the inevitable investigation into his father's whereabouts and Sam's transportation into the world his father has created and been trapped in for decades.Where to begin? Tron: Legacy is a visual feast for your eyes and an auditory pleasure thanks to Daft Punk and Joseph Trapanese. The soundtrack feels ethereal almost and fits perfectly with this new world we have been introduced to for the first time (or the 2nd time if you've seen the 1982 original). 3D, for me, is a recent scourge that has been infecting and affecting the movie industry. Yes, maybe it is a more lucrative avenue for the movie industry after the setback of heavy piracy but enough is enough! Joseph Kosinski, however, had a vision (and an architectural degree behind him) to give us a mouth-opening, simply beautiful world with the correct blend of 2D and 3D! It is quite simply worth it just to go for the visuals.What the movie makes up for in spectacular imagery, it lacks in storyline. Maybe I should have watched the 1982 version as so many people have pointed out to me but even without it, the plot seems a little disjointed. The underlying connections to the real world are numerous such as The Holocaust, God complexes, evil doppelgangers and more. You are left with more questions than answers as it is never revealed just what it is about this world that would ""change everything"" in the real world.Jeff Bridges is great as both the villain and hero and his computer animated self is simply amazing although at the same time off-putting (this might be the Uncanny Valley hypothesis at work). The acting overall is not anything to write home about (no Oscar winners here) but Hedlund as Sam Flynn holds his own against a more charismatic Jeff Bridges. Quorra (Wilde) provides a potential love interest and the key to changing our world and a doe-eyed innocent view of life that is endearing.This is a movie that should be simply taken for what it is, a pandering to the original fan base whilst garnering new ones, one not to be over- analysed but simply to be marvelled at with a group of friends. The actions scenes are just jaw-dropping with light cycles (that I wish I owned!) and deadly Frisbees amongst other things. Disney took a risk to continue a series almost 3 decades later rather than going for the easy option of re-imagining it. A wise move.",TRON - Legacy
664,kellpossible,A feast for the ears (and eyes)...a famine for everything else,4,9 January 2012,"A massive fan of Daft Punk (and, to a lesser extent, a devotee of Jeff Bridges) I knew that seeing Tron: Legacy was non-negotiable. In hindsight, however, the money for my $9 ticket would have been much better spent on purchasing the amazing soundtrack and skipping the movie altogether. That's not to say I didn't enjoy the visual aspect of the film -- the graphics were, altogether, quite stunning. So where did the film go wrong?For starters, the characters were underdeveloped, unexciting, over- played tropes. Although the film seemed to start promisingly with Sam (Garrett Hedlund) presenting a kind of maverick computer genius, he very quickly devolves into your run-of-the-mill, orphan-child-comes-into-his- own hero. The film's principal female character, Quorra (Olivia Wilde), was--if anything--even worse. As a woman I tend to tire of overly- sexualized female leads, but I honestly could've done with a powerful, female temptress in this film. Especially as nobody else in the film seemed to emanate any sort of mysterious attraction, it would've been nice to see any character exert some sort of draw or power over the others -- no such luck. Instead of a strong female lead, Wilde's character is portrayed as a naive, eager-to-please pushover whose strange apprentice-type relationship with Flynn (my beloved Jeff Bridges) borders on creepy. If you're going to dress her in a full- bodied spandex catsuit, at least paint her as something other than a dewy-eyed child. As for Jeff Bridges, suffice it to say that even he could not save this movie; shades of ""The Dude"" do not really mix well with the paradoxically omnipotent and helpless character of Flynn.Whether a result of weak character roles or the cause of them, the miserable excuse for a plot in the movie really drives the nails into the coffin. Once inside ""the Grid,"" any semblance of conflict or tension melts away with a boring (and predictable) story line. I frequently found myself wondering at points in the movie, ""is this actually happening?"" -- and not in a good way. I do not want to spoil the film for those of you still compelled to watch it, but the film's magic plot formula can generally be boiled down into ""Sam gets into trouble by trying to escape + Sam gets rescued + Sam makes off in stolen or illegal vehicle = Sam attempts to escape again and gets into more trouble, at which point the cycle starts over again."" I can count three distinct iterations of that formula. Needless to say, the whole thing is boring, predictable, and a very poor excuse for a plot.It really is a shame this took years of time and creativity from Daft Punk...",TRON - Legacy
665,dmad-2,"Awful, not worthy.",1,10 January 2011,"The biggest movie disappointment. The plot is just non-sense. The screenplay etc. makes the movie look like it was made for 10 year old kids. The special effects were nice. However they could have done could do something more spectacular. All in all I think the movie misses ideas, dialog, unexpected events. The storyline is just straightforward and the end easily predictable. The best work has been done by marketing people apparently as 4 couples went to see it and none of us liked it. I would definitely not recommend this movie to people who want to see something valuable that they would watch again with pleasure.",TRON - Legacy
666,annashiu99,a disappointment,4,25 December 2010,"This was not an awful movie but I would not recommend this to my friends. Honestly, this was the first movie that I have ever fallen asleep during the show (a result from the long day I had, a boring plot, and the constant dark visuals of the gaming world i assume).The plot did not make much sense. I am not sure if it's because I haven't watched the prior movie Tron, but the background was not fully explained at all. Having said that, I must admit I did fall asleep sometime during the show, hence I may have left out some details. The relationship between the grid, the programs and the users was not clearly mapped out. While watching the movie, I had to assume the grid and the programs were similar to that as the Matrix just so I could catch up. Yet there were still a lot of fundamental things that did not seem clear to me at all. For example, weren't the users supposed to be the ones controlling the programs to fight instead of the programs doing all the work themselves?There are some things which I should praise - hence the 4/10 instead of a 2/10. The effects were awesome. I did enjoy watching characters turning a bar into a different vehicle each time, it seemed so real. The music was also good.So, if you just want to witness the amazing effects of the movie, by all means watch it in the theaters as I doubt it would be as great when you get the DVD. It's worth it. But if you are expecting anything other than the effects, please don't have high hopes.",TRON - Legacy
667,bareeder_27,Solid Sequel to a Cult Classic,9,18 December 2010,"Having recently watched the first installment of the Tron franchise: Tron, Tron: Legacy was a solid sequel to the 1982 original. With stunning visuals and alluding to the original canon and storyline, I was very happy with the outcome of this film. I am not typically a big fan of Dysney or it's movies, but I have always been a fan of Tron, so this was a must see. The cast was well chosen and interesting to watch interacting. Being used to watching Olivia Wilde play Dr. Remy ""Thirteen"" Hadley from the FOX's House, it was different and enjoyable to see her play Quorra, a somewhat, naive, courageous heroine in tight leather and raven hair. WARNING SPOILERS BELOW. Garret Hedlund also was a solid choice as Sam Flynn, Kevin Flynn's orphaned son, and was very easy to relate with his struggle to find his father and unravel the mystery of his disappearance over 20 years prior to entering the Grid. It was also a treat to see the great Jeff Bridges on the big screen, re-playing his role as Tron Creator and ex-ENCOM CEO: Kevin Flynn, who mysteriously disappeared in 1989. It was a bit different to see the dynamic of Flynn as he went from god-like creator to betrayed, savior spiritualist. And to see his renegade program clone: Clu 2, who never aged in the amount of time since Flynn created him. Other cameos in the film are Alan Bradley(Bruce Boxleitner) the User who created the security computer program: Tron. The french house duo: Daft Punk, also made their debut as MP3 programs at End of the Line Club atop a the highest tower of Tron City. They also composed 24 tracks for the film which was an auditory spectacle. The only problem I had with the presentation was the portrayal of Clu and a younger Flynn. Bridges had been digitally de-aged, though with close-ups, were not very convincing and could have been made less noticeable with distortion or play-of-angles. Another would be the lack of romance between Quorra and Sam. They could have exploited the tension between them, but have left us a romance plot that can be answered in a later film. Lastly, Yori, a main character, played by Cindy Morgan in the original Tron, was missing from the film, but evidently was married to Alan Bradley in Legacy. All in all, it was a musical and visual wonder with plenty action and suspense and continues the story of Tron quite well. Legacy should be viewed as a transition movie between the first and third films of an inevitable trilogy. If one payed attention, it left open ends to questions, that undoubtedly, will be answered in a third installment. The story of Flynn and the fate of Tron has not ended, but only began.

671,dwroxas,"A technological benchmark, and a stunning experience",10,16 December 2010,"Firstly, Tron Legacy does what very few films have managed to do since the introduction of the 3D ""fad"". Instead of excessively giving the viewers 3D imagery at every corner, it saves it for where it's needed, which definitely ads to the experience you'll get. In fact, I was so involved in the movie that when one of the characters shot a hook-like weapon, I flinched in my seat. The visuals of Legacy are definitely unlike that ever seen before. The bulk of the film will take place on a world known as 'The Grid', and everything in the grid is basically what the creator of the world imagined as inside a computer (that's a very skimmed explanation, there's a lot more to it then that.) Legacy even includes a few throwbacks to ""Tron"".Outside of the technical aspects now. The story of Tron Legacy doesn't require you to see the original film (although it can be helpful). The beginning of the film does explain a few things, but other than the information given to you through the opening scene, nothing else is needed. Your instantly introduced to the main characters, and then introduced to the complexity that is Sam Flynn. Main shareholder in a million-dollar company, he yearly reminds the company of ENCOM who owns the place by playing what he calls ""pranks"".As the film goes on, you are given a great blend of the most visually exciting action sequences, a bit of light comedy every now and then, and then the serious well-written story scenes. To top it all off, you've got a great soundtrack by Daft Punk in the background. While at some very rare points this does affect the mood, it's not something that will destroy the movie for you.A very strong point legacy has is the wide variety of characters you'll see. The seemingly emotionless Sirens, to the eccentric Castor and then the warrior Quorra who wants to desperately see the world Sam lives in. All together, it's got a strong story (which you can't really explain even part of it without spoiling it), a great blend of styles, the most amazing visual effects ever seen in a movie, and strong actors playing very strong characters. and not to mention a truly magnificent soundtrack.",TRON - Legacy

It'll be far more entertaining.Dodgy CGI and Bridges sleep-walked his way through this movie!Look don't get me Started! Just wait for it to come out on $1 blue-ray.It would seem that I have to write at least ten lines about this movie The first 3 lines said it all!

673,TwistedTree81,Style Over Substance,4,21 June 2011,"Unfortunately Tron: Legacy suffers from a problem that has affected many blockbuster Hollywood films of recent years, that of a poor script and bad acting and the hope that great CGI will make up for it. In my opinion this movie is only really worth seeing for the visuals and soundtrack which are truly awesome at times but the story is so dull and packed full of clichés that to be honest it detracts from the artist merit of the film. If a movie is just going to be a showcase of amazing visuals and music then why bother trying to tie it all up with a lame story? I found myself not really caring for the main characters or engaging with their story in any way.",TRON - Legacy
674,nackasnack,Expected more,6,16 December 2010,"Now i thought this was going to be a great and violent movie but after seeing the Disney logo, i hesitated but oh well Disney do make great classics but i would disagree that this movie will be anything close to a classic. The visual effects for the movie is decent, well let me be more generous, it was great but what use is the effect if the storyline is crap. The movie is just plain predictable and sometimes just silly, it won't fit in the comedy genre especially with the topics that its covering so why do the characters act so .. well 'weird', its like they are acting in a whole different movie? Another thing i have to point out is the lack of knowledge about each characters, I hardly got to know the characters and once they die or are in serious and deadly situation, i was pretty much like 'Meh, just either die or live already, i want to see more of the movie's awesome effects' because that is pretty much all i enjoyed..the effects.On a positive note, i do like how they made the GRID scenes 3D and the real world scenes 2D, that was pretty smart although some scene in the real world honestly deserve a 3D effect to it.This movie really had a potential, too bad its now down the drain.",TRON - Legacy
675,JohnWho,"One word - ""Awesome""",9,6 January 2011,"This movie is pretty much awesome,and very much enjoyable.It's an amazing audio/visual experience that will definitely blow your mind (it's really the first time i ve paid for a movie twice and this is my first review - That must mean something)! The acting is great, i think Jeff Bridges as Kevin Flynn and Clu 2 was amazing and so were Garret and Olivia. The directing was great and i was pretty stunned when i saw it was made from a non-famous director. The music score was made by Daft Punk.. and all i can say is that after i saw the movie i was on youtube for hours listening to the soundtrack. I liked the fact that most of the scenes in the movie where introduced properly with some great music piece (i almost felt like watching a well made looong music video and found myself some times wondering if the song's title appearred). I liked that.Now about the story... i don't get it, how can some ppl say it lacks in story (ofc it's not ""silence of the lambs"" or ""shutter island"") but i guess ur mind was blacked out from the visual awesomeness and u didn't pay any attention to the rest of film (yes i know,the sky was dark all the time, no sun at all, and people where wearing costumes with lights on). I believe that even though some details where left out, me/you can use my/your head and wonder about the plot.. a little, rather than waiting for everything to be served in your plate.Other's liked the movie, other's where waiting for a new Matrix and other's where looking at which detail was missing. But overall it's a great movie.I ll give it a 10 (just to go agaisnt the haters) but i really believe it's a movie that deserves and 8-9 for sure.P.S Sorry for any English mistake as English is not my native language",TRON - Legacy
676,druxion,"absolutely overrated, 3d experience even more overrated",4,28 December 2010,"i got nothing more than what was expected, the acting was very detached, i mean eve they cry it feels like Broadway, the main villain is really not that exciting, besides tron (the character, i see no awesome characters in it. now moving onto the cgi? okay i'll give them that. the neon costumes were quite cool and so were the vehicles, but as before nothing astounding happens or is explored even in cgi, the took tron the game, built a great plot around it, but executed it below par.the 3D is chopped up 3d where you merely have the table closer to you and the character further way, nothing at any point ever jumps out of the screen, this is highlighted further by the 3d trailers than happen before the movie, u get awesome effects and things jumping at u, then next thing its tron.flat. still. and not dynamic at all in terms of 3d. im an enthusiast so take my word for it if you must. try watching without your glasses, 89% of the movie is watcahble without the glasses . but it doesn't mean do not watch it, because it is a good watch, its better than watching nothing, i walked in with high expectations and walked out not even remotely satisfied. popcorn was great though :).",TRON - Legacy
677,badboi8169,Massive let down,3,28 December 2010,This was the biggest let down EVER!! its a little small amount of action followed by a whole lot of talking about a mans life with nothing happening!! I paid to see this in 3D n really felt i'd wasted my money! I was waiting all year for this film and was utterly disappointed. They spent millions on this and really cant see what on?? to really enjoy this film u need to watch both back to back as it does explain a lot but u will be bored by the end i fell asleep in the middle but didn't miss anything! Its just about a man talking about his life story if i knew this i wouldn't have paid to see it. I wanted more games in the film more tanks like in the original. The effects in the the action scenes were good but there really was not enough.,TRON - Legacy
678,jeremypoorte,See this movie - very soon!,9,18 December 2010,"Twenty-eight years ago, I watched a motion picture masterpiece in a movie theatre one week after it was released. There were probably ten other people in that auditorium with me, leaving about 490 empty seats. It was for me personally, a life changing experience. The story was something just as much from forty years before as it was about forty years ahead. The emotional impact it left me with still resonates with me to this day. The film had much hype and even larger expectations due to its star and its director. Yet five days after having been released, it was deemed a failure and a waste of time. The movie was Blade Runner. Its place in the history of film, well known.History can repeat itself.Watching Tron Legacy last night, I had moments of deja-vu and feelings of incredible joy and amazement, much like what I felt all the way back in 1982. This time, there were 300 hundred in attendance, filling most of the auditorium. So the experience of Tron Legacy for me was less remorseful at the end of the film that what happened to me at the end of Blade Runner (ten people standing up after the credits and walking out into the blinding summer light, speechless, amazed and overwhelmed). Even so, in terms of today's movie audiences, when opening weekend box office is everything, I fear that Tron Legacy might similarly fail and without deserving to do so. Go see this film.Some reviewers have commented on being lost or overwhelmed by its plot, some spoke of disappointment and those I do not understand. It is King Lear, it is the second coming and many other fine examples of storytelling, concepts and ideals. Tron Legacy is one of the most immersing cinematic experiences I have seen in thirty-five years of watching movies. The effects, the score, sound mix are all technical marvels. By June 1982, there were plenty of movies with quality sound and visual effects, score and photography, yet Blade Runner was on a different plane of existence. I dare say Tron Legacy has accomplished the same. This is was 3-D film can and should be. Not gimmicks, art. Moving and awe inspiring art.Jeff Bridges is a fine actor and his performances in Tron Legacy will show you and convince you if not all ready. All of the other cast performed just as solidly in their roles, major and minor.If history can repeat itself...fight for the users, watch this movie, send a message to the industry that a blockbuster can be worthy of huge revenues through excellence in film making and story telling. Tron Legacy has achieved both.",TRON - Legacy
679,j-m-ranatunga,"Tron is, definitely not a chickflick, but i think it's chickfriendly - I thought it was great!!",9,6 January 2011,"Its plot, touching on issues like the father son relationship, rivalries set in various settings and escapism, is presented just lightly enough in the movie to introduce the world of the Grid - where Tron lives, and where everything looks amazing. Tron is visually stunning, with everything seemingly designed: awesome sets, costumes and, it appears, choreographing of character movement - which all looked great in 3D. Accompanied by an awe-defining soundtrack by Daft Punk which had us rumbling off our seats during some scenes, Tron at moments felt like a film set to the music. if you're into Daft Punk, into anime, or just into 3D movies and music, this offering provides great entertainment.",TRON - Legacy
680,livedog-870-351922,"A spectacular movie, one of a kind.",10,30 December 2010,"People have been saying this movie doesn't have a good story, but thats just because they probably didn't get it, as this movie is for people who are into computers. The special effects are amazing. I caught the movie in i-Max, so you can imagine how awesome it was. If you're watching it in a theater, be sure to watch it in 3D, otherwise there is really no way of enjoying the movie as much. Before watching the story, I suggest you play Tron: Evolution, which bridges the gap between Tron (1982) and Legacy (2010) The light cycle races are brilliant, with lots of action throughout the movie. The end is a bit dragged, I felt, but there might be scope here for another Tron in the years to come. Overall, the movie is great, and Jeff Bridges does a great job.",TRON - Legacy
681,lucasgramajo,Where did Tron go??,5,5 January 2011,"Yes, it looks beautiful and yes, the soundtrack is awesome.The story (like a lot of people in this comments have repeated so many times) starts very well, looks like it's going to be an awesome ride and then ... nothing.Tron is gone... and yet not from the Title of the movie. Why would anyone would want to dump Tron? It's like Star Wars without Hand Solo or something like that.Those special algorithms which will save the world are too hippie like too. Tron was never like that. It was a geek movie.Anyway, I'm not going to write a long review since everyone has done that already. Still, I want to let other people know that Tron is gone. His character plays a super minor role. I waited the whole movie for Tron to show up and make a move in vain.This one is all about the visuals. There's a bit of that trendy future BS where everyone wears futuristic Prada clothes. Kind of like an electronica music video. Yet depth and content, there is none.It really does feel (like some people mentioned here) like a movie which changed writers half way through the movie. But I suspect is even worse. Something went out of hand (budget? director?) and they pulled the plug and finished it early.",TRON - Legacy
682,Malok,Not the Legacy I was hoping to see,6,18 December 2010,"I was able to re-watch the original right before we left so it colored my perception heavily. Also, I wanted to love this movie very badly; it's a cherished childhood memory.The movie had either too much, or too little depth. The original had very little depth but I thought it worked very well. I could have used more action and less exposition or just a better fleshed out story. This movie falls squarely in the middle. The character Sam fluctuates between bad-ass and inept seemingly at will. I wish we could have picked one and stuck with it throughout the film. Jeff Bridges seems very much like ""The Dude"" and nothing like K. Flynn. I had only a few moments where the character seemed to say something I would've expected Flynn to say. Was this the fault of the director, the script, Jeff Bridges or a combination? Personally, I very much disliked the character of Zeus; I thought he didn't fit the world in any way. The fate of Tron left a very bad taste in my mouth. Bruce was underused considering how integral to the original story he was. They should have departed from the original completely, or had more ties with the original. I felt as though the script needed a bit more work before they filmed it. Was this pushed out by Disney instead of taking enough time to polish it? I really liked a lot of the updates. The world looked good; the new suits and discs were great. The gaming area was great; I really liked the new lightcycles; I wanted to see more of them. I thought Olivia Wilde nailed her performance. Hers was the best performance in this reviewer's opinion. The vehicles were all spectacular, and I think the visuals are the redeeming factor for this movie overall. I can also appreciate what they were trying to do in terms of story. Another thing that I appreciated was that there was nothing ""Matrix-y"" about this film.I felt very sad after leaving and I slept on it before writing a review to make sure my opinion wouldn't change. Maybe the new mini-series' like The Walking Dead are spoiling me as a viewer, but I wanted better character development. I felt as though the story could have been vastly improved with a little better editing and tweaking. I didn't hate it and I would recommend that you watch, but it's not the masterpiece I was hoping to see.",TRON - Legacy
683,lhaprods,TRON: Eulogy,5,7 December 2010,"Saw the advance screening in Sydney today.I am one of the ones old enough to have seen the original in the cinema when it hit the screens in 82 and was keen to see the follow up.Overall, there is a fine line between paying homage to the original concept and characters and serving up pretty much the exact same fare 28 years later.This version touches all the familiar points of the original (they have gone all out tricking up the game play on 'the grid' with 3D and CGI) but have essentially rehashed the original story line and not taken it new or interesting directions.A good percentage of the film also takes place in 2D (when not in the computer). Not a criticism, just with all the hype of this being 3D, they might want to forewarn those expecting 100% 3D.I really wanted to like this film but Tron: Legacy feels like more of a remake than a sequel.",TRON - Legacy
684,raybarclay,Ultimately sterile,6,8 December 2010,"Saw it as a preview last night. It begins by stating that parts are intended to be in 2D but you should keep your glasses on. In fact it was quite a while before the 3D kicked in, so wearing the specs made uncomfortable viewing of those low-lit night-time scenes. By co- incidence the glasses helped mask the imperfections of the animated Jeff Bridges.Whilst the 3D was very good, there are problems with action shots. It takes a while for the brain to process the illusion, so when a lot happens (and it does often in in this movie) it quickly becomes very confusing, especially as there is the 3D environment (people, disks, bikes etc whizzing around in all directions) to think about on top of the illusion itself. But maybe that's just my brain - I only have a Ph.D after all.The music was also good, but ridiculously over-the-top. As was Michael Sheen's hammy rendition of a hyper camped-up Aladdin Sane. Most of the time I concentrated on making sure that it wasn't David Bowie under all the makeup.Jeff Bridges shone, though literally too much in his animated self, but otherwise the acting was mostly adequate. There wasn't much in the way of dialogue or acting opportunities for them anyway, due to the limited plot and script. The animated Bridges was hit and miss. The character animation was pretty decent but the rendering was, on several occasions, unconvincing.Plot - what plot? Not all of what the characters said could be heard clearly over the din elsewhere. I don't know if the original JB audio was sampled from Tron 1 but there were several instances where it was difficult to make out what the point was. The difficulty in understanding or finding a plot was emphasised by a screenplay steeped in poorly explained gibberish and mumbo-jumbo jargon. I'd love to say that there is more to the story than what you can see in the trailer - I'm not talking big picture, meaning of life stuff here, just more story! Sadly, at times it was more plod than plot: troubled son enters Tron, meets father (or not), has a couple of fights and chases in 3D then attempts an escape - but not quite as coherent, exciting or engaging as this sentence might imply. It is really down to the technology rather than the story. The father/son relationship felt like an excuse to get someone into the Tron virtual environment and the Tron character himself really did just feel like a bolt-on to retain the movie title.Taken together, like the original, it was technologically brilliant but ultimately sterile.",TRON - Legacy
685,Curtiswolf3,A golden shiny shell with no nut inside,4,21 December 2010,"I would give TRON: Legacy 1 star for its COMPLETE lack of story-telling, and lousy acting (with the exception of Jeff Bridges, of course) but there are redeeming factors to this AWFUL, AWFUL movie.The visualsThe music.And that's about it...The visual flare of this film is so gorgeously executed, that I would recommend it to people just for that reason.The incredible soundtrack by Daft Punk is totally memorable, with that feeling of Zimmer, and really fits in with all the locations, and moments of the ""story"". TRON Legacy is a whole lot like James Cameron's Avatar; a beautiful looking film, but plagued with a less than stellar story, and poor dialog. But sadly, some might actually like this one. Give it a go, and see what you think",TRON - Legacy
686,rottenblackberry,Could have been so good,4,11 December 2010,"""The Grid. A CGI simulacrum of a computer's innards. For some reason, Sam, I live on a cliff on 'the outskirts' of town, the I/O tower gleaming in the distance. The tower is currently occupied by baddies. However, it's not doing much except make a dusty UNIX terminal in a secret room in my old amusement arcade bleep occasionally, accompanied by the sound of a wheezing fan. I'm sorry I haven't been home for 20 years, but I've been shacked up with a sexy self-generative algorithm. And now we have to get back home, because the CLU program, which used to drive a tank when I first came here, is now a slightly more autonomous representation of me. But it's me gone wrong: all naughty. He/It's going to get out and do some BAD THINGS, except I'm not sure how it will, because I actually wrote it/him in FORTRAN. As you know, he might not compile anymore, because I ran a system update, and now the FORTRAN compiler needs updating too. But it's a paid update! I might just BitTorrent it""Sat on the BBC Breakfast sofa, Director Joseph Kosinski claimed that Tron: Legacy was a stand-alone film. Of course, it may be hard to test this empirically. But pretty much 90% of the dialogue and/or sequences in Tron: Legacy give a knowing nod to the original - and it's the 'knowing' component of that nod that makes me doubt his assertion. Still, in places it's quite charming: Flynn junior uses a modified Nokia smart phone to open the 'big door' at ENCOM, rather than the Texas Instruments calculator used by his father decades earlier. Echos of dialogue from the original jumped to characters representing very different story elements in Legacy; acknowledging how our concerns surrounding data and personal freedom in using computers have shifted in light of the web and social media.I think that's the major downfall of Legacy: It really is Tron 1.1. Pretty much the same story, with the message altered slightly to give a 2010 perspective. That is is pretty much the same story has plus and minus points. The idea of an evil master control program (Dillinger's digital alter-ego in the first outing) is replaced by the concept of free versus controlled. For those who don't think as deeply as some on these points, 'free' in software terms has two meanings, often summed up as 'free beer' and 'free speech'. Unlike ENCOM – a representation of a proprietary hybrid Apple/Microsoft, Flynn's machine allowing entry into The Grid runs UNIX: the epitome of free (speech, and often beer). Sam Flynn's personal journey in Legacy could be viewed as a shift in his personal belief: from believing that software should be free (i.e. not cost anything) to believing that it should be free (i.e. without restriction). He shifts from being a hacker-outsider to finally committing himself to leading a new kind of ENCOM. One which presumably would have to lay off most of its workforce and replace them with (probably equally good) volunteers.The effects don't match up to the original, the CGI/film mix looks as off-the-peg as Transformers set in a kind-of-computer-land. The original was groundbreaking because it was so inventive in its visual design. For a film so retro-revivalist as Tron: Legacy, I would have hoped that the director and visual designers might take more of a cue from contemporary games that hark back to 80s graphics but with reflect the increase in processing power, such as Rez (Dreamcast/PS2, 2001; HD XBox), Multiwinia and Gridwars (both Mac/PC). Instead we get a world that looks like glass and light, rather than how glass and light might look in a fantasy computer world. We also have CLU (as the mirror of young bridges) with a disturbing computer generated face, obviously taken from a shot of Bridges grimacing in the 80s.There is a tendency in this film, that fits in with the 'Tron 1.1' label, to take a sequence from the original and add a tweak that reflects a change in computers since the original, especially in terms of games. Take the Light Cycles: these make an appearance in Legacy – fair enough; the flying sequence near the end of the film then extends the death-inducing translucent tracks to three dimensions, which looks a bit like a cross between 'snake' and the tracks of time in Bill and Ted. Ultimately, it's fairly lazy: games have gone from 2D to 3D, so the Light Cycles must becomethe Flight Cycles? The Light Aircraft? The latter sequence contains the most cringe-inducing story element in a film that has a fair few: when evil Tron remembers his original programming and shifts from being bad to good. Unlike say, Darth Vader's similar switch at the end of Jedi, the doesn't seem to be any reason for this switch. A very weak plot element, which makes me think that the script was thrown together in about 15 minutes.Finally, we have the Daft Punk soundtrack. As someone who has everything they did on 12"", books, magazines and stickers relating to everything (in their early days, at least), I was looking forward to it. Derezzed is excellent, as are a few other tracks. However, the soundtrack in many places could have been inTransformers again, or any other big soundtrack of late. Inception had all the same strings, brass and orchestral hits, but managed to sound far more original. I have to say it: even the Daft Punk soundtrack is underwhelming, especially compared to Wendy Carlos' original, which I also have as a much-cherished vinyl album.Tron: Legacy is probably best ignored. It could have been so good, but misses the mark on as many levels as those in the Games of the I/O Tower. Avoid.",TRON - Legacy

Only one of them, however, has been able to move me to tears of exultation and utter, boundless joy. That movie, my friends, is Tron Legacy. The Tron franchise has always been known for its cutting-edge approach to film-making as it tackles tough issues and offers a refreshing commentary on surprisingly deep subject matter. Legacy goes even further than its wonderful predecessors. This movie is the second coming of Christ. It is an orgasm for the senses. It is the word ""perfect,"" transformed into an animated, watchable form. It is love itself. It is like an evolved form of oxygen that is so much fresher than a typical breath of fresh air.

For the purpose of understanding the movie I took time to watch the original Trone, and truthfully the original was way better. The problem of the new edition is not the lack of story, but the execution. The makers gave a lot more effort to visual candy than to the whole experience of the movie. It saddens me that 40% of the movie was actually stolen from other movies (from StarWars to matrix (specifically Matrix: Reloaded). The visit to Zeus has Matrix written all over it????? Bottom line is that the movie is a good idea but lacks the execution. Many ideas throughout the movie started well, but in the end there was no resolution and many questions were left unanswered. For people that haven't seen the original Tron I can't imagine that they would understand some concepts of the story as well as those that have seen the Tron from 1982.

690,dplatt-925-429311,Stunning graphics and awesome soundtrack,9,17 December 2010,"At 1 minute past midnight on the bitterly cold night of Thursday/Friday 16/17 December, I sat down in a 350 seater cinema with just seven other people to watch the first general release screening of Tron Legacy in Huddersfield, England. I watched the original back in 1982 - there were very few in the cinema in Colchester where I watched it then - and marveled at that film. As I left the cinema over two hours later, I turned to my daughter and said 'Well?'. 'Great' she replied. I had read all the reviews - a very mixed set - but nothing prepared me for this. If you are a computer nerd and want to explain the programming behind it all, don't even begin to think about it. This film is escapism at its very best. Put on your 3D glasses, sit back and just let the film wash over you. Immerse yourself in the impressive action sequences. Watch the excellent performances from Bridges and Sheen - Hedlund and the rest are pretty good too. Listen to the Daft Punk soundtrack which is exceptionally strong yet not intrusive. For Sci-Fi films they do not come much better. There is a suggestion that the plot is a little thin but make it too complex and it would detract from the visual and audio experience.

691,cj-ricci-925-507651,This User's Review,8,21 December 2010,"I am going to break this review up into sections as to better address each aspect of the movie in an orderly way.visuals: Maybe the best looking movie I have ever seen, it creates a unique cyber world. What I like about the visuals in this movie is they truly fuse real actors and sets with a CG environment, many special effects movies just drop the actors in a blue room and CG everything. That bothers me because at that point the film is so animated that I can barley see the point of having real actors, it just makes the effects more obvious.I think the best way to tell if a production team has effectively designed a world is think of how distinct it is; is it recognizable? Does this movies world instantly remind of something else? My answer would be no. This definitely feels like Tron and that is the best way to describe it, it is Tron.The one bad thing is the CG young Jeff Bridges, or C.L.U. The effect works in certain scenes but as a whole this is the definition of the term Uncanny Valley.Sound: I have not enjoyed a film's soundtrack this much in a long time. The tech-no beats and rhythms by Daft Punk in this film are fantastic and backed up with the help of Joseph Trapanese who orchestrated the score. I do not buy movie soundtracks often but I will be picking this up soon.Story: This is the weakest part of the film, as is the case with other films the use CG at this level or the equivalent of this level from years past. I found the main problem with this story is that it kept bring up promising concepts but did not elaborate enough on them. A example would be Kevin's relationship with C.L.U. while time is spent explaining their past it is just not enough for the audience to make a connection.Verdict: While it is lacking in story I find that Tron is great ride. This movie's visual and auditory splendor make up for a lacking story. This movie is much like last year's hit Avatar, sure it has a bad story but it really is enjoyable.",TRON - Legacy

As you would expect with a piece of cinema costing 200 million USD, the visual effects are nothing short of breathtaking.

The effects are woven into the movie like an expert tailor crafting a bespoke suit, rather than patched on just ""because we can"".The highly technical visual effects create the Tron universe in a way that feels paradoxically understated ""because this is what it looks like"" rather than ""because we can"".Nothing short of perfect.The main characters Olivia Wilde - Quorra. When I saw the trailers, I thought that Olivia Wilde's character, Quorra, was only going to have a small part. I wasn't expecting her to have such a significant role in the movie and for her to play it so well. For me, she was a very strong female lead and I would say a larger and more important part of the movie than the character of Sam Flynn. Anyone could have come in and done what Sam Flynn did, it could just as easily have been the son of Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) who re-entered the system 20 years later, but no one but Quorra could have driven the plot along, and I don't think anyone except Olivia Wilde could have played the part so well.Wilde manages to pull off the characterisation of a program who is adept, yet unsure. Simultaneously wise yet naive and it is a fantastic performance brilliantly executed.Jeff Bridges – Kevin Flynn / Clu. Given that the majority of the target audience will not even have been born when the original was released, this is an important role not only as a central character to the story but also as the bridge between the two movies and Jeff Bridges plays his part(s) to perfection. As Kevin Flynn he is immersed in the role. He delivers a thoroughly convincing performance, explaining some of the back story in a concise manner for those not familiar with the Tron concept as well as demonstrating how he has developed as a person in the intervening years for those fans curious to know more - yet managing not to patronise older fans whilst not confusing viewers new to the concept. There is no one else who could play this role other than Jeff Bridges. Watching him as Clu is unexpectedly, yet pleasantly, eerie. What is surprising is that he plays two different characters rather than two versions of the same character. What is brilliant is the way he plays the older, wiser, Kevin and the younger Clu who is built from youthful ideas. At times Clu seems to behave like a confused child, doing what the parent asked yet at a loss to understand why the parent is not supportive. Bridges just balances this so well it is a joy to watch. There is a feeling with this movie that Bridges didn't just turn up, get handed his lines and go to work. Somehow it feels as if each of his characters wrote the lines and I can imagine Bridges worked very hard behind the scenes with the writers to attempt to deliver the best performance possible. Bridges, in tandem with the excellent story and characterisation teams of Kitsis, Horowitz, Klugman, Sternthal, Lisberger and MacBird succeeded 100% Garrett Hedlund – Sam Flynn. I expected this character to be stronger, with more of a purpose, yet was left feeling that Sam Flynn was little more than a third wheel spinning quickly but not really going anywhere. Whereas Kevin Flynn has learnt and developed over the years, and Quorra has been given the chance to live up to her destiny and develop from a simple program to a philosopher and selfless heroine, Sam Flynn doesn't seem to gain anything from his experiences in either world and seems stagnant by comparison.Hedlund plays the role well, and it really isn't his fault, but I think there could have been more scope in the writing for some much needed character development. For example, how did his real world experiences apply to the Tron universe? Apart from the physical attributes of being able to drive a motorcycle and jump off buildings, I'm not sure they did. I would have liked a little more depth to the character, a little more philosophy, a little more soul.In a high concept movie you would probably get away with such a shallow character, but set against the characters of Kevin Flynn and Quorra, the shortcomings of Sam Flynn are made all the more evident. The soundtrack. Derezzed fits the mood of the film so well, and with such a strong sonic tool I was afraid it would be overused. However it is deployed to excellent effect, like a rare spice in a recipe, sprinkled sparingly to fully demonstrate that less is sometimes more. The rest of the soundtrack fits the Tron landscape with such precision you barely know it is there, meant in the best possible way. The sound is somehow the atmosphere to the landscape of the film, supporting the visual imagery and storyline without attempting to steal any of the glory from the scenes it compliments. Much like the visual effects mentioned earlier, it seems Daft Punk knew how this world would sound and re-wrote their own rules to fit the Tron universe rather than hammering their own style into the movie in an overbearing way. What they have achieved is truly brilliant.",TRON - Legacy
695,dale_hitchcock,i expected to like this movie.,4,22 December 2010,"i was very very young when the first film came out. i don't remember too much of it, as i must have been about 4 or 5 when i watched it. All i do remember, is that i loved the film. In fact, it was probably what interested me in computers.I was never really interested in a sequel, and didn't expect there to be, so it was a surprise to find this coming out. However i did not hype myself up, as i know these type of films tend to be a let down... so i went in to the cinema with a blank mind.First things first, i don't know if this was at everyones cinema, but a message came up prior to the move saying ""please keep your glasses on all the way through the movie. However several scenes were shot in 2D"". I've never been really into 3d besides gaming (huge gaming fan btw) but to have tacked on 2D is quite bad. Im starting to hate cinemas stapling 3D in their movies just to get more profit.Next plot - or lack their of. Its your typical film. Missing Dad, Upset Child, Found Each other, Battle, a death, End....it reminds me of Avatar with no interesting character or life in their world (i actually liked avatar btw)Acting. Its hard to act well for a film that has very little dialogue or inspiration. I didn't care for any characters or what happened to them.To be honest, the only thing i i liked about this film was the sound track, it fitted the film perfectly. Can't really say much else.",TRON - Legacy
696,pbatik,"Slow, Boring, Incomplete and Pretty",1,18 December 2010,"In a sentence: Go watch the original. Unlike this sterilized computer generated FX production, it has a soul, and a script.I had high hopes for TRON Legacy to rise above the many FX/3D releases that seem to flood the theaters lately. Afterall, TRON harnessed computer generated graphics nearly 30 years ago- and at that time, it was ground breaking. But now? sure, the graphics are improved, but so is every similar FX assisted production since 1982. Computers are faster, designers have more cpu power to play with, and 3D projection systems finally hit it right. But what about everything else that makes a movie? like.. a plot?Sadly, TRON is just another casualty of eye candy. Whether it is the sublime virtual world which rehashes 28 year old ideas infused with modern pixel engines, or the pretty and naive Ms. Wilde tucked in her tights and serving as the Megan Fox of Tronville- TRON does not fly. It grudgingly crawls through a plot that is as expected and transparent as government propaganda: there's good, there's bad, there's conflict, and there's the evident triumph of good over evil. In the way, we meet characters which serve no point, have neither depth nor lifespan, and have nothing but to provide except for additional FX opportunities. TRON closely follows the footsteps of AVATAR: a technological demo with a script that can fit in a brochure. Stunningly boring.The ultimate star of the show, Bridges, tries hard but can't pull the plot on his own. Once in a while, he utters a notable comment with a hint of Big Lebowski which draws a few smiles, but has no one else in the cast to play with. Wilde plays a sexy role muttering a 3rd grader script, while Hedlund's role is the juvenile irresponsible punk with Brad Pitt and Robin Hood aspirations- leaving zero aftertaste. The only other memorable actor (besides Bridges) is Michael Sheen, which we're blessed with for far too few moments. Blame Disney for that choice.Tron Legacy is a waste of time. 28 years ago, Tron felt as if it had been brought back from the future. The new incarnation is technology demo, with sprinkles of Bridges and a remarkable sound track. Do yourself a favor and watch something else.",TRON - Legacy
697,marioamel,Tron borrows from every other movie and comes up empty,1,18 December 2010,"Tron Legacy is so bad, that if I had been in Jonestown and they were showing this film, I would have drunk the Kool-aid half way through the film to end my life.The lines are so bad, the acting is borrowed from every blockbuster that was a success before this film (think Star Wars, Raiders, Attack of The Clones..etc.) the idea is, if they show you familiar themes with familiar frames and a music score that is supposed to be avant-garde but comes up sounding borrowed and repetitive. The Film wants to be Batman, and a video game at the same time, and it never makes sense. For a film that's about computers, the computers seem awfully stupid and the Users even more idiotic...Save your money and see Yogi Bear at least that movie has no pretense.",TRON - Legacy
698,richard0268,Something other than nothing,10,20 December 2010,"It may be just a different approach in making films. Instead of character in first place, after all it is a film of Tron, not Sam and his dad. We don't need to know them.The 3D technology is just used to draw attention, and i don't know why people see it as a only thing can be critised. Not in the same familiar Hollywood film therefore a bad creation? There is not much emotion, true. Computer world does not have emotion, a father being locked from world for 20 years so loss of social ability, a program learning to become human and a separated for 20 years son confronting dad, of course there is no emotion. And it is not important at all.I would like to see it in a different direction when they reinforce the ""In there is our destiny"" and ""Out there is our destiny"" taking the point that Tron is a creation itself that the father believed it can replace the human world as our world is not perfect, but on CLU, their world is created by a human not natural therefore not perfect. They all desire to go to the other dimension to achieve and seek ""perfection"", but things is not perfect, therefore beautiful and predictable other then computer world, so we have the scene of the riding over the world picturing bridges, cities, forests.Tron Legacy is not a ""bad"" film, it is a Disney film, not Hollywood film.Maybe i put too much attention on a ""bad production"". but it gives me meaning not 3D programming. No need to seek perfection, because there is none. Seek what is around, not perfect but unpredicted.",TRON - Legacy
699,markcrx9,thoughtful,9,19 December 2010,"Haven't done this before so I thought I would put a spoiler alert just in case.I watched a fair amount of the first Tron (1982) about an hour before I saw this movie. There are so many subtle nods and winks to the original movie that if you didn't see the first, they wouldn't be noticeable, but if you had they are almost like gentle reminder for the first. Tron (1982) now becomes an origin story.The visuals are visceral in IMAX 3D. When I walked out I couldn't imagine watching this in a regular movie theater, it would diminish it's impact. It had bits of philosophy and psychology in the movie. Clu, even that is a reference to the first movie, his quest to obtain perfection is flawed, but not for a flaw within him, but in the creator.I feel like Flinn's character is essential the same, but after maturing in the world of Tron, his youthful vigor has changed to a kind of learned warrior. Flinn's battle's with Clu have gotten to the point of playing Tic-Tac-Toe and that now he accepts the logic of ""War Games"". His son doesn't subscribe to this. He try's to change Tic-Tac-Toe into chess.The movie comes in waves to me. Quiet then the RUSH, then the quiet again. The humor was a nice touch, not overt but nice. Son searches for Father, the Creation fights it Creator, and the man who is both seeks to find the solutions to each. I would put this as the central story of Tron Legacy.",TRON - Legacy
700,glynn1412,"Fantastic Sci-Fi Action, But nothing more",9,28 December 2010,"I went to see this movie on release day with my girlfriend and loved it. She however, seemingly taking the perspective of what seems to be the majority of critics didn't like it.This movie is exactly what fans of tron, tron universe and the general premise will be expecting, a fantastic CGI filled adventure through the grid. And it lives up to everything, first of all the lore is perfect, the writers of this film had clearly taken into account all of the things mentioned in the original and all spin offs including video games and have compiled a film that fits into the world without any hiccups. The action is outstanding, the light cycle scene, the disc battles, the light jets and the various fight scenes all look fantastic. In addition to this the storytelling, the characters and the visuals all just work, there is nothing more i can say about this film than it just works. Its a very very solid film that is an exciting, interesting, and futuristic development to the tron world.However where it misses out on a 10 is in the few moments that it lacks emotion, i found a few scenes emotionally dry where ordinarily you should be feeling slightly teary and this is where i think for my girlfriend who isn't a massive fan of the lore side felt it fell short to connect. One thing i must highlight is a recurring theme in critics reviews that they expected some form of story profoundly viewing the worlds dependence or hope in technology and in that front they are completely absurd to think that. This is a sci-fi action adventure and nothing else.All in all if you are a fan of tron, the tron universe and the idea of it then you will thoroughly enjoy it and want to see it numerous times. However if you are looking for some kind of emotional deep tale then you will be disappointed.",TRON - Legacy
701,tyler_semple,Mentally Paralyzing,5,23 December 2010,"In the months leading up to the release of Tron: Legacy I was one of its biggest fans. The effects looked jaw-dropping, the soundtrack was a surefire hit with Daft Punk at the wheel, the only possible flaw in my mind was the potential sullying of the Tron cult legacy, but what were the chances of that? Apparently pretty good.The first quarter of the movie is exactly what I expected, amazing visuals, mind-blowing soundtrack, decent acting. Unfortunately after this initial assault on the senses the movie takes a turn for the worst.The middle half of the movie is filled with predictable story and cheesy lines, which i may let slide in the right kind of movie. However when I'm set up for an action packed, visually stunning, dramatic thrill ride, that launches into an hour of lackluster plot development where the entertainment comes from the bright colors and loud music it throws me for a loop.Eventually it seemed like all the visual effects were there to keep my brain focused on the screen while the essential functions like logic and critical thinking were paralyzed by the assault on the senses. By the time the pace initially set resumes, its difficult to get hooked the way the movie grabs you from the start.Consequently I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth wondering how a movie with so much potential could go wrong. Was it Disney not being able to infuse the flair and style of the original? Did it lack the grit needed for a life or death storyline that they were attempting to establish? Was it just a mediocre movie that's only saving feature was the special effects? Probably...",TRON - Legacy

703,jckshrff,even my 6 year old hated this movie.,1,24 December 2010,"** Sorry for the spoiler. But the spoiler is needed to show how ** ** bad this movie really is. I'm not sure what the fans are thinking ** ** giving this movie a 7.6 average out of 10. The spoiler is in the ** ** last paragraph of this review. **I don't want to waste the time of die hard Tron fans, and I will mention up front that I never liked the original Tron movie. I went with very few expectations (stunning 3D special effects), and I was disappointed here. This kind of a cult movie should have looked as good as Avatar or Star Trek. All the vehicles and the flying riding could have looked much cooler if the producers had chosen to not stick with 4 colors of the original. They do depart for one of the vehicles - but it's a let down (I promised that the spoiler would only be at the last paragraph).It might be because I'm not European - but I did not like the whole disco setting. It was bad enough that the movie stuck with the fluorescent colors of the original movie.It might be because I write software for a living. But really .... users and programs ??? Shouldn't Tron have evolved by now ? And the so-called tech lingo is even more nauseating than the Matrix movies (but those movies were at least cool). A word of advice to ALL MOVIE PRODUCERS - when using computers find a way to tell the non-tech savvy audience what's going on without actually showing the computer screen. When us software guys see you keying in ""grep"", when you say that you're doing something cool, it just takes the movie experience away for us. Otherwise hire someone to show something that is more realistic.And finally, another piece of advice to ALL MOVIE PRODUCERS - when a good character turns bad, and you want him to become good again, PLEASE make the process of turning that character back be a little more interesting. I mean ""Tron, What have you become ??"" Were those magic words ? Because, that's all it took for him to turn blue again. And to think that the movie is titled after this particular, and he did not even do anything major in this movie.

704,babar104,Tron Legacy not an evolutionary jump from 1982 original,5,25 December 2010,"Having been privileged enough to have seen the original TRON in theaters in 1982, this review may sound a bit biased, however, i will attempt to point out very obvious problems with the film that i think everyone ( even those un-familiar with the original movie ) can identify with. I have read many reviews on this film and i have yet to see some issues addressed, which i will attempt to do for you. The first thing i would take issue with is not what you would think. Many reviewers have stated that their main problems with this film lay in its plot. This did not seem to be a big issue for me. As stated before, there is a large generation gap between the 2 films, and i understand that many viewers are simply not aware or familiar with the original storyline. I think they did a decent job tying the 2 films together, not excellent, but not terrible.My main problem with this film is exactly the opposite of what many reviewers and viewers alike have said about the film. Many have said that their problems were with the plot devices, and to be sure, there are a few that deserve recognition, like TRON himself playing a very limited role in the film. All of that aside, it has been praised for being an ""eye candy"" film. I am sorry, but i was not impressed. The digital world of the first TRON movie ""felt"" digital. The phong shading, combined with more complicated lighting designs on the characters, made the original more believable. In this incarnation of ""the grid"", every other program is running around sporting some kind of hairdo, a trench coat,and very minimal lighting designs on his or her person. As for the grid gamers, it was very apparent that everyone was sporting a black motorcycle outfit with again, some minimalistic lighting. It was just...obvious. At the very least, no character in the original was without a helmet or headgear of some kind. Even Yuri's character did not have hair. Again, not just the characters, but the environment itself did not feel all that ""digital"", take for example the ""weather effects"" on the grid. Always cloudy, there were even lightning flashes here and there. Did Clu like rainy weather? The Recognizers even emitted what looked like exhaust from their feet...that just looked silly to me, I'm sorry, not very digital. There was something else all to familiar i found lacking in the action sequences involving the ""disc battles"". Their light trails. The trail of light they left in the original movie was fantastic looking, and although the disc's themselves looked better i think in this version, they lacked that ""glide"" effect from the original. the soundtrack, which everybody ""raves"" about, by Daft Punk, i did not think was nearly as good as everyone claims, but, i am an electronic music producer, so that is just a biased opinion i suppose. However, i could name at least a dozen electronic artists that could have done more justice to the sonic influence of this film. I take it that the soundtrack made an impression on people that liked it simply because they did not listen to that much electronica to begin with. My last and final gripe with this bit is in the opening sequences of the film where Sam goes to the arcade and gets zapped. Alright, now THAT was a big deal in the original...and the sequence that followed in the original was one of its most memorable moments, but in this film, it's just zap, and....your in digital space. No journey of digital pipelines and highways, sky's and whatnot, just zap, and....you walk outside and it looks nearly identical to the real world you were just in, with the exception that every hard edge on every building has light on it. Not very inventive. All in all id have to say i was disappointed. The characters did not look ""digital"", There were many unrealistic effects in a supposed ""digital"" environment. The soundtrack was not ""mind blowing"" lol, and above all, TRON himself, the very name of the movie, was a leash boy for Clu, embarrassing. Oh, and one more thing...when Sam is in the disc battles and gets cut, he bleeds...in a world where you have been digitized? Come on guys, you can do better than that, almost like Flynn's furniture and roasted pig at his hidey hut, i was literally chuckling at that point, but whatever floats your digi boat:)",TRON - Legacy

706,hius7294,Worst interpretation of inside-PC world.,2,26 December 2010,"I have never thought that TRON movie (especially the remake of it)will be so anti-logical and stupid as it is now. Looking from the first sign as a Star Wars with main good-bad Characters who are really similar to Obi-Wan and Dart-Vader, this movie is a poor screenplay ever - i am thinking that director must pay more to screenplay-writer to create more sophisticated story. Also after looking into the Graphics its impossible to not notice that after Final Fantasy by Sony we don't see any changes in Character modeling - the face of Tron's ""Dart Vader"" is poor modeled. The story is a vanilla-simple and stupid from the beginning (when nobody even cares what was paged from the FLYNNs game center) to the end, when ""Obi-Wan"" creates a blow (from what? how?) which holds ""Dart-Vader"" from the invasion to the Real World. After a movie such as AVATAR by Cameron, i would love to use negative number for Tron but i can not because i am really loyal to the former Tron version. So its 2!!!",TRON - Legacy
707,Mmmaxr,Let so far down I feel like I'm spelunking,2,26 December 2010,"Note: IMDb will not allow me to enter ""- e s q u e"" (no spaces). Gets changed to ""-esquire"" every time I correct it and hit preview. No related spelling call-out. BizarreTL obviously works for some. But to a stunning degree, not for me.1) That it managed to look so much poorer than 1982's TRON I never would have imagined. TL versus TRON is comparable to Google logo art versus Met exhibits. No sentimentalism in that statement; I love modern FX.TL's light show rates Sharper Image. With a handful of exceptions, it appears they were satisfied gluing scrap neon onto Plexiglass and some wet suits. The effects are first-rate twice, in more places pretty, often tedious, on average boring.Despite the less advanced tech, 1982's TRON is beautiful. TRON's digitally reworked characters and microcircuit-based world comprise absorbing artistry. Both movies lean on simulated neon, but TRON manages to lasso your brain with it.I can't help wondering whether many reviewers who claim to have been amazed by the effects do so only because they're ""supposed to."" Wasn't it a a forgone conclusion in the pre-release buzz that whatever TL did or didn't do well, the effects would, of course, be amazing? After all, this is the follow-up to TRON. Might such expectations influence perception, or at least what some reviewers feel it's ""safe"" to say?Don't know, but you've seen better a hundred times before, I promise.2) It's odd that even with no writers' strike, TL was written by scabs. Or so it seems.Storyline clichés are fine if well-executed and not excessive in number. Neither, in TL. The clichés drown you. My eyes rolled so hard I almost lost a contact lens. Bring ginger tea or a prescription antiemetic.Borrowing is rampant. You can hardly miss their poorly delivered Matrix-, Star Wars-, Blade Runner-, and pick-your-Jet-Li-film-esquire scenes, characters, and action choreography. It smacks of desperation: WE REALLY ARE AS COOL AS THEY ARE! FIST-BUMP? PLEASE?I've heard less plausible movie dialog, but not by a huge margin.

The trailers had more action that the movie. As a matter of fact, some of the action scenes that were in the trailers weren't even in the movie. The CG was the only thing that kept me from giving the movie a ""1"" rating. I am amazed with how far the CG techs have come since the original ""Tron"" movie. As I've stated some years ago when ""Forrest Gump"" came out, it wouldn't be long before the CG techs will be able to resurrect dead actors for future roles.

The whole movie could have easily lasted less than an hour with exactly the same impact. It's a shame that people compare this to the Matrix or Bladerunner.

I later played ""Tron 2.0"" on PC and that was when I got hooked on the Tron franchise. Tron Legacy definitely took the franchise to a whole new level.

As a serious Action/Adventure/Fantasy/Science Fiction fan this movie left me absolutely disappointed. I rather would've waited for the DVD. Action scenes were fine and totally acceptable - storyline completely sucked. The movie certainly doesn't captivate its intended audience in my opinion. I'm surprised to see the IMDb rating this glorified piece of junk actually got. I found myself wanting to walk out at various times in the theatre and at other intervals my wife caught me nodding off just a little.

What they were really doing was setting up the building blocks for an amazing follow-up. Excellent action, special effects, and soundtrack are especially noticeable in IMAX 3D (I'm not a big fan of 3D, but it helped somewhat here.) Intertwined with the action is enough SciFi to make you think - I personally love it when the filmmaker respects the audience's intelligence. The only remaining issue I see in the end is obvious use of plot devices from other SciFi franchises (i.e. Matrix, Star Wars.) I don't think this will go down in history as an all-time great, but it was well worth the price of admission, and worth doing in IMAX 3D. Watching the original Tron movie is not required, but helps.

Of course, to blame the screenplay, the story predictable, but I'm not interested in it now. Flawless work out the re-action sci-fi movies! And I have not even wrote the music ... extremely well suited to the mood, the guys were really good songs! fully integrated, added to the film. Next week I'm going to seduce me again and this delight. And I hope you will soon run into a DVD and Blu-ray too! I hope 2011 will bring similarly good movies in 3D! Thanks",TRON - Legacy
715,tequila_burp,Not recommended,3,2 January 2011,"It feels like the movie was roll in the 80's with nowadays technology. If you have ever seen an old boring movie with futuristic scenes, this is one of them. There is no special 3d effects in this movie. Nothing came out of the screen. I am really disappointment. If you watch it in 2d, you won't miss anything. The soundtrack made me sick, specially an annoying grave sound that was played frequently. Most of the movie was really boring and ridiculous. The action scenes did not surprise me at all, because the movies couldn't involve me in the story. I am surprised that IMDb user's average rating is above 7. This should be rated less than 4.",TRON - Legacy
716,dawolak,Awesome-with-a-capital-A.,10,5 January 2011,"If you were a kid in 1982 and ever used Frisbees to stage Tron-battles, just go see Tron Legacy. Yes, the critics are correct to point out that the plot leaves much to be desired. Or that it is incomprehensible. Or that it is logically impossible. Or that it is just dumb. So what? The narrative was never Tron's point. Have you seen the original lately? Only the 7-year-old me could have loved that movie; the 35-year-old me could barely stand it, with its now-outdated visual effects. The point of Tron is to enjoy the visual treat that is the digital playground, which this reboot has in spades. Tron Legacy is simply a great ride. Awesome-with-a-capital-A. Nothing less, nothing more. Put it this way -- if you remember Tron rivaling Star Wars as one of your childhood fascinations, then Tron Legacy is what Lucas' Star Wars prequels should have been.",TRON - Legacy
717,adrian99,AMAZING! Music scores make the hairs on my neck stand up through the whole movie,10,6 January 2011,"Not often do you see a movie that hits hard at both the visual appeal and it's audio equivalent; the movie is jam packed with special effects that sought to only emphasize the true nature of the film, rather than to simply 'appease' the generalized taste of 21st century film enthusiasts. The music scores were superb, and I found myself reeling in my seat at every fight scene, or personal interaction. I truly wish I could experience a world similar to the one portrayed in this movie. The plot about the Iso's 'beauty in existence' I truly felt; they were indeed beautiful - products of simple existence.Before you die, you need to see this film. If none other, make it TRON LEGACY.",TRON - Legacy
718,marlenetesoro,"Very Disney-ish,, good effects",6,9 January 2011,"I haven't watched the first one, based on this recent movie, it was great in terms of the effects, that's it.It has no anything. No substance or whatsoever. You wouldn't need to think to be able to get the meaning of this story. Plus side is it has a moral lesson. A definite movie for the kids.Story-wise it was so Disney-ish (past preview, rescue the damsel in distress, happy ending), very predictable. Btw, Jill the program girl was uber hotness.. The costumes on the other hand looks cheap on some angles but there are times that it looks cool enough to be so modern. There are also some instances or scenarios that weren't explained, it made the movie's story blurry but maybe it was part of the director's plan to give a mysterious vibe? Not sure.. but there are really parts that suddenly pops that wasn't explained even in the end.",TRON - Legacy
719,thewafflemaiden,Brilliant film to an extent,8,9 January 2011,"When I first heard about TRON: Legacy, I was pretty hyped for it. I read some articles that my film magazine had done about this film, and it was set to do really well in cinemas. So, December finally came, and I got around to seeing it. And, I wasn't disappointed. Ish.So, where do I start? I suppose I should talk about the story, which seems to have loads of critics up in arms. I actually saw the first TRON film before hand, and for the time it was released, it was really good. However, while I was watching TRON: Legacy, I felt that the storyline was pretty much the same, except they threw in some new characters, and updated the visuals. There were a couple of lines that I shook my head at, for example, when Clu 2 said things like, ""Radical"" I felt like slapping him and give him a lecture on how to be cool properly. But that's just my opinion. However, the story had some really strong points, like when Sam reunites with his father, and Kevin's monologue in the beginning. I really felt the passion that these actors were giving. I also loved everyone's performances, I felt that Sam's was very good, even if he did have some pointless lines. I also loved Michael Sheen's performance, even if it was a bit over the top and very brief.Of course, another major point, was the effects. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw these. I loved how the bright colors contrasted with the black, and some of the landscapes I felt were breathtaking. Not to mention I saw this in IMAX 3D, so pretty much all of The Grid looked superb. I especially loved the fight scenes in IMAX 3D, I felt it brought me closer to the action, and all the different modes of transportation they had on offer in The Grid looked amazing too. And a final factor is the music. Daft Punk's soundtrack had me hypnotized from the very start. They did a fantastic job, and no-one could have done it any better. If Daft Punk didn't exist, they'd probably have to be invented for this film. I also liked their cameos in the film as well, as they blend in very well with the scenery.Overall, this film deserves all the praise it gets. Even if the storyline does get a bit boring in places and the effects are very heavy, they both balance out for the length of the film, and it makes for a very incredible experience.",TRON - Legacy
720,ajfrydman1001,mehh,4,11 January 2011,"I saw the original before I went to see this, and honestly I was extremely disappointed on how the movie was executed. Yes of course the graphic enhancements were needed in this movie, but I feel like the effects used in the movie really weren't technically appropriate for the mood or feeling that the original movie set and left viewers with. Being a graphic design student, I loved seeing the effects and the ads for the film, but I feel like the feelings evoked in the posters for the movie really weren't fulfilled with the actual watching of the film. The film itself was alright, not the best ever, but it wasn't as bad as other ""remakes"" have been.",TRON - Legacy
721,rausch_alex,Overall..,7,11 January 2011,"Overall I thought the movie was very good. There was an interesting storyline and a good amount of action. The acting was particularly good. Jeff Bridges is a very good actor and really made the movie for me. I am a die-hard action fan though so the fight scenes were another favorite part of mine.The soundtrack to the movie by Daft Punk was very good as well. It suited the movie appropriately. The scene where they were in the movie in the club was kind of comical as well. The drawbacks to the movie were the slow beginning and the uninteresting ending. The beginning didn't grab my attention but I guess it was necessary to explain the story. The ending was very disappointing to me though. It just kind of ends with them riding off. I am going to assume they did this to potentially allow for a sequel, but it was irritating to me. TThe other problem that I saw with the movie was the filming of the action scenes. Recently, a lot of movies have been using a very choppy, unsteady filming technique to film fight scenes. This annoys me because it makes me dizzy and it makes it hard to follow what is going on in the movie. That set aside I would say overall i was very please with the movie and would recommend seeing it if you are into action and an overall interesting movie for the whole family.",TRON - Legacy
722,padidle-949-205042,one of the worst movies ever,1,13 January 2011,"this movie was really bad...it started off fine...some decent visual effects, but after 20 minutes you could leave and not have missed a thing...i know that the plot/story wasn't the point, because that was horrible... but even the pace which moved like gomer pyle in FMJ, didn't live up to the action of the first TRON... boring and even though it was colorful, the visuals weren't enough to save this dribble of a movie... the worst part of this film is all the other films it ripped off, from the bond style scene that was just like moonraker, to the matrix bite, and coutnless others i picked up on, that were so badly stolen, that it is a shame to mention them as if to give any credit to this waste of time. i want my two hours back... you could keep the money...",TRON - Legacy
723,awaaaaaay,"A fun, beautiful romp back into eighties cyberspace",8,20 January 2011,"So, 29 years later how does the Tron concept shape up? Well its not going to break any intellectual boundaries and that's for sure-most of the theories about cyberspace being 'alive' horses were, after the first film, beaten to death, then beaten into a fine pink powder in most comics during the eighties and nineties. Plus we now know that computers just don't work this way.The first thing that drew me in was the sounds, Daft Punk and the sound- designers have conjured up a delicious combination of eighties electro, modern 'house' music and grand orchestral sweeps that update the original but give it a unique modern flair. I did immediately get hold of a copy as soon as I left the cinema.The movie is well paced, if shallow and misinformed in some details. However, this being a Disney movie, its more for the benefit of the kids watching and whilst I'm staunchly against talking down to children, introducing concepts like the workings of the Stock Market, bandwidth and the complexity of the modern operating system in any detail would probably lose them at the first hurdle, especially considering that this is an adventure movie and is supposed to get to the action as soon as the narrative allows.(This is my first review but I'm pretty sure that character summations aren't spoilers so long as you refrain from revealing anything they actually do)Jeff Bridges produces a characteristically memorable turn as both Kevin Flynn and CLU and, whilst it probably won't be the performance that nabs him an Oscar this year (let's face it, its pretty much inevitable) the sheer force of personality he can put into his voice overcomes the ""uncanny valley"" effect (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley) in his character's digital design. (will anybody ever get the eyes right?)Garrett Hedlund makes a good fist of the role of Sam Flynn, son of Kevin Flynn, but its standard action-hero fare and nothing done will truly stick out.Olivia Wilde surprised by coming close to stealing the show from Jeff Bridges (I had to read that sentence a few times back to myself out loud but it rings true so I'll have to justify that claim). Her character, Quorra, never hesitates to jump into the fray, and yet she refrains from becoming the same supercilious, bad-ass, action chick we've seen in far too many movies these days. When the action dies down she reveals a softer and far more innocent side, which is truly surprising considering the ability she displays when the discs start flying. She does, however, have a near-inevitable kidnap scene- giving our hero, Sam not Kevin, an opportunity to show his growth as a character in a battle with CLU's ""dragon"" (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon)(The spoilers get laid on a little thick in this next paragraph)Another surprise was Beau Garrett who makes Gem into a great ""Siren- type"" character, offering help to the naive Sam whilst thinly veiling a secret agenda. In the hands of Garrett, Gem is an extremely sexy, seductive individual who's ulterior motives are just visible but are just another card in her hand when it comes to getting what she wants.The movie, as a whole, is quite obviously meant to be another ""Curse of the Black Pearl"". A movie that will stand on its own but has enough lose ends to create a good sequel, possibly a threequel too. This is no bad thing in my opinion as the movie does stand on its own very well and the end is satisfying without being too much of a cliffhanger. I certainly hope the next sequel isn't 28 years in coming as I look forward to it with great anticipation.",TRON - Legacy
724,merckle,My review of Tron: Legacy,6,23 January 2011,"I recently saw the movie Tron: Legacy in the movie theaters. Before viewing the movie I had heard many different reviews. Overall I thought the movie was very entertaining. Watching the movie in 3D helped to keep my attention. The movie had extraordinary graphics. I liked all the little details the artists put into the movie. I thought Tron had a good storyline. It brought suspense, sadness and fright. Although I liked the storyline of the movie, it was sometimes hard to follow. I think more character development would help the movie to be less confusing. Even towards the end of the movie I was wondering who ""Tron"" was, and what part he played in the movie, because he certainly wasn't the main character. The movie was also very long, it kept my attention, but I found myself getting ancy for the ending. Throughout the movie I found myself comparing this movie to Inception. The plot of living in an alternate world was very similar. You also had to think about what things mean, and I felt the same way watching Inception. It was hard to believe this movie was produced by Disney. It is very different from many other Disney produced movies, but a good change. Overall I thought this movie was very good for the action genre. It is definitely worth seeing.",TRON - Legacy
725,nicholas-poeschl,What a load of boring bulls#*t,1,31 January 2011,"Okay, I liked the original film when I watched it in the eighties. Definitely would not watch it now, as it has probably aged like zsa zsa gabor - not too favorably.The original film was one of the first films that used computer graphics - so you can add it to a list of films that revolutionized special effects (like star wars, terminator 2 and matrix).But the new film does none of that - the special effects are good, but nothing new, the story is a total disaster - boring, not logical; the actors are extremely poor, ""computer-generated""- Baldwin looks ... well ... computer generated.The main thing is, THIS FILM IS BOOOOOOOOOOORING!!!!!!!!

726,jli92,Awesome Special Effects,10,31 January 2011,"I really enjoyed the original TRON. Now Disney took it to the next level and I must say I was thrilled with the up to date special effects added to the movie. The actors were great despite Garrett Hedlund haven't been in much mainstream films. The Story was however a bit lacking, I feel it is missing a few points and the only way to find out is to play the video game released for it: tron evolution. But apart from that It was overall a very good film, actors were superb, daft punks music fitted well into this and most of all the special effects, such as the CGI version of Jeff Bridges, that really stands out as it clearly shows what Disney can really do with modern day technology.",TRON - Legacy
727,pete_lewis,Drivel,1,5 February 2011,"I, like many people my age had been looking forward to this movie since I heard they were doing a sequel. What a disappointment.The first one was bad, but at least it was fun. This one was wooden on all fronts. The effects were rubbish despite 3D and the script/storyline was unmitigated tedium. There seems to be a trend in recent blockbusters to sacrifice the quality of script and characterisation and pile all of the budget into special effects. In this case that did not even work. I was almost as disappointed as when I watched that dreadful remake of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"". This film actually gave me a hangover. Avoid at all costs.",TRON - Legacy
728,middledagger,True to the original theme,10,14 February 2011,"I didn't expect to like this film as much as I did. I went to the cinema merely hoping that it would be a competent sequel. What a surprise. The story was tight and well-paced. It did not insult the viewers' intelligence by spoon feeding all the facts. It didn't attempt to tie up all lose ends or explain everything. The action, the no-holds barred violence, and the CGI all enhanced this film.The film was also full of computer in-jokes, just as the original had been. I particularly like how Kevin Flynn, an ardent open-source advocate - a liberator of information - reversed the right to travel into and out of the digital world for himself, while Clu, who liberated the digital world from Flynn's rule, promised that he would open up the non-digital world to digital beings.The film stayed true to the original theme. It showed the dark side of the computer world. Programs are visions. The programmer had something in mind, some task, some idea, and he expressed this in his code. The MCP in the first film had been Dillinger's vision: he had brought together code for the purpose of bringing order and control to the system. Clu was Flynn's vision for bringing order, control and perfection to the system. In both cases, the vision turned on the creator. The problem with computer programs is that they will do what you ask them to do even if it turns out that this is not what you want them to do, even if you change your mind.All in all, the film is one of the best I have seen in a long time. I look forward to the sequel.",TRON - Legacy
729,IYellAtMice,How Average Can One Movie Be?,5,14 February 2011,"Well that certainly was...something. Although I'm not quite sure what it was, it was definitely a movie. Tron Legacy is pretty much the Avatar of 2010: very advanced visuals, but almost no focus on story. Aside from the story, which I'll get to later, the visuals have the same problem as Avatar did- after a few hours, you won't notice them. They still look great, but once the movie pulls out all the stops, the visuals just feel pedestrian. Not to say that this movie looks bad though, oh no, it's a fantastic looking and sounding film. The soundtrack was top notch, and even though the visuals started to wear a bit thin by the end, I never thought they looked lackluster. The style of the world drew me in, although they didn't do much to make the world feel believable, which leads into my problems with the movie. It feels like there was more effort put into the visuals than making a believable world for the characters to live in and interact with other characters. The villain, Clu, played by Jeff Bridges, is supposedly a horrible, horrible figure, but pretty much the only evil thing he does throughout the entire movie is kill some folks, and even the main character does plenty of that. He also wants to try and take over the human world, but when you see that his army consists of about 10,000 guys with sticks, his fear factor is diminished a bit. Also, if the portal to the real world is inside a small room, in the basement of an arcade, Clu is going to have a bit of s surprise on his hands once he goes through the portal with his giant spaceship. Also, for a movie with ""Tron"" in the title, we certainly don't get a lot of Tron. Although we later find out that he's been reprogrammed to be on the side of the villain, even then all he does is jut kind of try to fight, and he can't even do that very well. Also (Spoiler) they KILLED Tron! And I've heard that a sequel is coming out, so it's going to be rather difficult to call the movie Tron, isn't it? Anyways, the acting is alright, with the hideous performances of Michael Sheen and Olivia Wilde balanced out by a good Jeff Bridges and an acceptable Garrett Hedlund. Bottom Line is, if you see this movie, see it in 3D. Visually, it's no Avatar, but even with my complaints about the story, at least it's not ripping off Ferngully.",TRON - Legacy
730,lgrnderwal,good movie. Solid 8 out of 10,8,23 February 2011,"The movie was good, do not get me wrong. However, in order to get the full gist of the plot, the original Tron must be seen and understood. For example, the actual ""tron"" from the first movie makes an appearance in the sequel and if you did not see the original, you will wonder who he is and what is his significance. The special effect are indeed excellent and if that is all you are out for, then this film will not disappoint you in the least. The plot and the flow of the story are both good however, I think there should have been a little more in the way of character and cyber-world development. I think this film definitely captures the unique style of the original film that was indeed decades ahead of its time; a characteristic in a sequel that has been rarely seen since the Godfather II. Taken as a whole, I rated the film a solid 8 out of 10. The lack of development in certain key areas cost it 1 point. Other than that, rent the original, watch it and then go see the sequel. You will have fun...no doubt.",TRON - Legacy

First of all, it's not %100 3D, i.e. at the beginning you receive a warning that the movie contains 2D portions and that it's so adapted that you don't have to remove your 3D glasses. What a technological improvement! In the end, it was difficult to judge or even understand which portions were 3D...

I am sad to say not Tron: Legacy.Tron: Legacy is a good movie, it would be a great movie if it was not following its older brother but that feeling of being blown away was missing, that feeling of seeing the future was gone, maybe it's my age, maybe it's the current generation of movies that MUST be the best visual experience sine the last $$$$ blockbuster $$$$ but for my money it was a movie that was high in effects but low on story line.The plot was too simplistic, the character details to shallow and even (in parts) the effects were lacking for a modern day $200,000,000 plus production, the young Jeff Bridges looks like a bad advert for Botox and would make a great collagen poster boy!

And if it's good or worthwhile, or even if it's bad and you can see they started with the seed of a great idea, but ran out of money, ability, clout or control, to make it better, then it still has redeeming qualities.But oh my god!!!... why oh why do the well intentioned but misguided reviewers here even believe that this Disney film deserves anything other than a total smack-down.You of all people should be angry and incensed to have been handed up this clichéd, self conscious, childish, old fashioned piece of tripe as a film justifiable for good reviews! Yep, a lot of work in making it, yep, some passable effects, but there are sooo many things wrong with this hokey, whimpy badly directed piece of shloppy rubbish, it begs the question... did Disney just make a bad mistake and employ the wrong production team who made this very low quality, campy update, or, is it sadly just a cynical marketing direction taken for the ever broadening group of dumbed down film goers, you know people with no class or taste, or just don't know any different, but... they spend the bucks, so let's not aim for a higher benchmark to show or give them something to really appreciate or look up to, let's make everything like a pile of gelatinous ooze, cos they won't know or care! Good god, it was like watching Plan 9 From Outer Space, instead of a great studio giving you a NEW benchmark to think about.When you think Sci-Fi or futuristic films, do you go with the films above or do you appreciate and long for intelligence and real entertainment in films like the Forbidden Planet, or Alien, or Aliens as as examples of well written and directed films (oh, and i'm also sorry to offend, but even though i can just watch it, I think J.J. Abrams Star Trek is another underwhelming film, but not as bad as this one).Pleeeese see some of the better offerings out there and don't just keep going down this 'feel good' route that sadly many American films seem to be just stuck in. Set your benchmarks higher and give big studios like Disney a canning when they produce something as low brow and wasteful such as this movie.Then and only then will big studios aim a little higher and really give you something to be excited and enthralled with.Why do you think Disney has earnt in the past a great reputation, because in the beginning, a lot of what they did was aimed at higher benchmark and then became great classics, to be appreciated for generations to come.Come on, unplug your iPod umbilical cords, take the Red pill and expect more....rant over...",TRON - Legacy

On the surface, this movie (stunning visuals aside) seems simple and predictable. Once you start thinking about the ideas that it discusses, like computers calculating like nature to produce beings, parallel universes that make a lot of sense, religion and digitally constructed things coming into reality, there is a lot to it. I don't think it is perfect or the best movie I've seen, but I forgive it for several reasons. The first being that most of the audiences haven't seen the first one, which is a huge hurdle. The second being that it is the beginning of a new series. It's not easy setting up a universe, starting a new series and being a sequel all at the same time. I look at the movie as a prologue to what will become the Tron universe.There are a few technical things like pacing and dialogue that drag the movie down. There isn't an excuse for that.

There was nothing new and creative about the universe in the sequel, unlike the original which introduced us to a new world -- even though minor things were updated using new technology, there was no additional creativity.

741,otakar,Why call it TRON! seems more of a give us a CLU,2,4 January 2011,"I have not seen the new movie, but have read synopsis of story and read a few reviews.I like the first film TRON, its one of those well crafted scifi's that has just enough special effects to complement your imagination. so really doesn't suffer too much vs to date CGI effects.Also, like it or not! but the P.C. game TRON 2.0 is the true sequel to TRON, both in name and continuity and deserves the title TRON 2.0 as the story line is basically, Twenty years later Alan Bradley, creator of the original TRON program, disappears under mysterious circumstances, his son Jet, a talented young computer programmer, is transported into the computer world in search of answers. oh does this sound familiar.I feel they have missed out on an opportunity to expand on the story, they have just rehashed the game story, accommodating main stream actors, using a plot that sounds very similar to TRON. Yes the new film is eye candy, and thats about it, I'm sure I will enjoy the spectacle but from the previews, this version lacks the ghostly spirit in the machine of the first.",TRON - Legacy
742,bbagdan,TRON terrible,3,9 February 2011,"TRON was the worst film I saw in 2010, and certainly ranks among the very worst films in recent memory, right down there with GI Joe Rise of Cobra.The acting was wooden, even from Bridges. The only interesting character was Zeus. The young Bridges looked totally fake, which I suppose somehow works seeing as he is only a digital replica in the plot, but unfortunately he was also in the ""real-world"" opening scene.Most of the combat scenes involve cliché poorly-skilled adversaries, who are also wearing fully enclosed helmets so you can't even see facial expressions. The fight scenes were pretty lame anyway-- in a world where physics is irrelevant and anything is possible, there is no danger in fighting. Gee, losing a fight, I'll just slam my hand on the ground and create a grid-destroying shock wave. The fights are thus as anticlimactic as those in Matrix Reloaded.It wasn't even that visually beautiful, certainly no Avatar. And the numerous scenes that dropped back into 2D were distracting.Poor story development and denouement.Not good even if you are looking for mindless entertainment. The awfulness overcomes any visual effects or action sequences. Avoid.",TRON - Legacy
743,jkivinn,"Visually absolutely superb, but acting spoils it",6,5 January 2013,"If it was only for the visuals, I would give 10/10. The atmosphere is fantastic, very well done effects keeping in touch with the central idea that this is not something like matrix, a real-life lookalike virtual construct, but quite visibly a construct inside a computer. Just like the original Tron.But the story.. totally expectable, no interesting twists, nothing. And even more horrible is the dialog, which is the worst I have seen in ages in high-budget movies. Lines that have been heard 1000 times before, very weak and limp attempts to roughness and character, failing miserably. Only personality around is Zuse, but he alone cannot save this parade of mindless zombies.",TRON - Legacy
744,emanuelcoffeyrosell,If only the story was better!,7,14 June 2015,"I've decided to keep this review as general and short as I see fit. Wishing merely to outline the overall gist of the film to save the reader time.Story/Characters: It picks up about 20 years after the first film. However, the premise to revive the old Tron-franchise did not feel too forced and actually made some sense unlike many reinstated franchises these days. The story follows the most common story format of all time if I were to paint it in broad strokes. I think a majority of people whom have seen this movie will agree that its main, if only, shortcoming is its weak plot. It's too predictable, but it gets the job done. Most characters in this movie are very ""cookie-cutter"" in relation to the plot, with a few interesting side characters that add a bit of spice to the mix.Acting: Good overall. Jeff Bridges is great; as he tends to be. Olivia Wilde plays her roll well as Quorra and Garrett Hedlund does a decent job as the protagonist of the film, although he lacked a little charisma in my opinion.Directing/Screenplay/Aesthetics: Just like the original Tron movie, this movie is visually impressive for its time. Stunning cyberpunk-esque art style that really makes this film stand out. Its quite far away from the original, but retains enough of the general feel to it to not feel completely foreign. The film was neatly filmed and directed with really cool looking shots over skylines and sweet action shots throughout. This movie simply looks extremely cool overall.Soundtrack: Daft Punk could not have made a better, more suiting soundtrack than the one they made. Amazing compositions consisting of deep and dark electronic synthesizers meshing seamlessly with grandiose orchestral scores. This film could practically be seen as a one and a half hour music video if desired.Summary: This movie would've become a true classic if it weren't for the sub par plot. The music, the atmosphere, the acting and art style are all very well crafted, the only shortcoming is the story. A good watch overall, unless you are looking for a movie that relies heavily on story. I believe that most fans of the original Tron won't be disappointed after viewing this, let us hope that the next Tron will be made to the same standard but with an improved plot.",TRON - Legacy

Then I waited and mulled it over and thought back to my childhood when I first saw Tron the original. Then I realised how far we have come and WOW...this film honestly took my breath away. Do not fall into the trap of judging this film by a contemporary standard; instead look beyond the obvious and note that this film is a revolution, just as the first Tron defined a genre this work takes it to another level. Yes it is pure a SciFi, of course; but it is something more...it is a metaphor for the new digital age. We now live virtual lives over the internet. More than the previous generation we have embraced technology to define our culture and our personal relationships to that culture...""I am not a programme"" says Sam Flint...indeed he is not, however we can argue that we have all become virtual ""programmes"" within the confines of cyberspace, Facebook, Myspace, Twitter and maybe countless other forms of digital self realisation. Do not look on this film as just a popcorn movie...look on it more as a illustration of our virtual lives. We no longer live in isolation...we have become virtual digital beings...and if you are reading this...you may not realise it.....but you are one of them. Enjoy !",TRON - Legacy
747,ashley_dale,A simple film to the unobservant .. worth a second viewing!,9,29 July 2012,"I must say, the first time I saw this film in the cinema, I felt the visuals were stunning but the story was somewhat average. Back then I would have given it a 7/10.A second viewing at home, almost 2 years later, and POW! - where the heck did that story come from!? Quorra and Clu in particular are very complex characters. The relationship between Flynn and Clu is really quite interesting. Gem and Castor have had me confused - maybe they're meant to, maybe the way Gem fills that outfit makes me stupid. The story on the surface is simple, but there is a lot of subplot to think about.I won't gush about the visuals much - all I'm going to say is, like the original Tron 30 years ago, Tron Legacy has written a new chapter in CGI. Just epic in 3D.The score is comfortably the best I've heard. It plays a HUGE HUGE part in the film. Do not overlook it. Daft Punk spent two years working on it and it is just amazing. The Blockbuster-Hollywood sound engineers hired for the film claimed it to be the loudest score they've had to deal with :-P. How the synth blends and mixes with the orchestral pieces is innovative. The music works fluidly in complimenting and even sometimes leading each scene in the story. The director, Joseph Kosinski - a huge fan of Daft Punk, spent 6 weeks locked in a room fine-tuning the coupling between the score and the film. Heck they were nominated for an Oscar in sound-editing and won various other awards so I'm not talking shite.There was a huge amount to this film I missed the first time around, I'm so glad I decided to watch it a second time (and several times more). I'd strongly recommend those that think it's a 7/10 or less watch it again without distraction. A powerful story about a father and his children. In my top 10 collection.",TRON - Legacy
748,kearts,"Boring, visually unappealing, weak plot and storyline.",2,3 January 2011,"Why do the whole movie in B&W? It was striking in Schindler's List, it was atmospheric in Sin City, it doesn't work for a digitally animated action movie; splashes of yellow do not make this a colour movie; my eyes fell asleep looking at it. The 3D added nothing - in fact, most of the movie is in 2D and can be watched without glasses. Jeff Bridges had Kevin Costner Disease - give a man an Oscar and he can't stop himself from over-acting; his Zen Master sequences were like Mr. Miyagi on acid. The action was ho-hum - if you saw the cinematic trailer, you saw the best bits. If you're after action, I warn you that there are extended scenes of Jeff Bridges meditating. And the plot ... ah crap, I've seen Scooby Doo episodes with plots that made more sense. Unfortunately the geniuses that wrote this were trying to produce a universe with the layered complexity of the Matrix, except they failed miserably in producing a world that was remotely coherent. The best word to describe the story-line was ""random"". The characters were flat and there was no development. If Disney is going to make sequels to their earlier successes, I recommend ""Snow White""; please don't make any more TRON sequels.",TRON - Legacy

I loved the first Tron movie when i watched it a few years back. The movie was fun and very enjoyable. That really gave me and a lot of people a sense on how movies should be fun and enjoyable.Tron Legacy was to put it simply, fantastic. The sense that everything had light and the 2 colors represented a theme of good vs evil. The movie plot itself, I thought was very well done and well though out.The entire movie was visually appealing and on blu-ray, it is a whole new ball game! The sounds and visual effects were top notch and the movie as a whole was amazing!I definitely encourage those who have not seen it and have seen the first Tron movie or love action/ sci-fi movies, to see Tron: Legacy.",TRON - Legacy

751,wacka14,More fun than a box full of Bridges,10,18 December 2010,"forget what you think you know about awesome. Forget what Lucas taught you about special effects because Tron just brought sexy back in a big way. This ride's got twice the action, twice the drama, and twice the Bridges.I consider myself a decent sifi fan even though I never actually sat down and watched Tron until high school. But after finally seeing it all I could think to myself was how awesome it would've been to be there on opening night in 1982 when the original came out. To witness something nobody had done before when computer effects were still in the fetus stage. Nowadays movies vomit out cgi and sfx all the time so we're all pretty numb to it. To actually have my jaw drop in awe of what's being projected in front of me, that's something special, that's what I've wanted to feel since watching the original and that is Tron:Legacy.Now that I'm done drooling on all of you, allow me to actually review. We all know the plot so I'll save you the relapse. The Acting is top notch. The main players all brought their A game. Garrett Hedlund has got charisma and good screen presence and (Aside from the travesty of Eragon) has delivered prime performances to this point. He does a good job of taking carrying of the movie when Bridges is away. Olivia Wilde is on fire here as the wide eyed child. She brings rockin contrast to Hedlund and Bridges and helps to bring a lighthearted feel to a film that's so much darker and brutal than the original. The rest of the supporting cast of Boxleitner, Sheen and Frain are golden. Nobody wastes screen time and they deliver even the so-so dialog with so much conviction that you don't let it bother you. But as we all know it's Jeff Bridges in his two roles that take the cake and the cookies after emptying your fridge. His worn out, zenned out, lamenting Flynn and his pimped out, deranged, dictator Clu are two very different very powerful performances and both put me in submission The plot made just as much sense as the first did. we are called to suspend our belief. Simple as that. I stopped asking questions after they teleported an orange into a computer in the first movie. But the story is diffidently there. It's a heartbreaking tale of betrayal. Seriously. Everybody in this movie feels betrayed. Each character has some grand force guiding them to make the moves they believe are right.The music is essential. This is the only movie I think I've ever seen where the music is almost a character of it's own. It guides and carries every scene so perfectly. you feel every emotion as the intensity builds till your hairs stand on end.Obviously the effects are stunning. Lucas and Cameron can chill for a second because this world is something else. The very scope of just how big it all seems is daunting. This is Joseph Krasinki's first film and he knocks it outta the park. The action scenes were done masterfully and are intense to the Nth degree. And the dramatic scenes are also handled with care. Just about every shot is perfect This obviously won't be everyone's bag. We got a lot of techno-flashy lights guys. The short screen presence of Tron may be off putting for some of the fanboys but I believe it was a bold move not to just retread the same ground as the first film. Tron wasn't always around to help which made this journey more difficult. This movie is about Sam and his father, not Tron. Though Tron still does play a very key role.The biggest complaint so far is obviously that Clu doesn't look real enough. I didn't encounter this issue however and the performance behind the mask shined through, but I can understand the difficulty of trying to truly get into his scenes when you're twitching in your seat because of his plastic looking face.Another major complaint is about story but unlike the Cinemas most previous box-office smash (Harry Potter 7), I had no issue knowing what was going on. Flynn explained everything pretty well. If the audience is listening as well as gawking at the pretty images, they should be fine Was I taken in by the spectacle? Yes. But I truly believe this movie has enough heart to go along with the groundbreaking visuals that will clearly be the biggest selling point. Is it the deepest, most insightful, well written, emotional roller-coaster ever? No. But it is the most fun I've had in a theater all year. And that is that kiddos.",TRON - Legacy
752,nyla-fox-007,Really good!!!,10,1 August 2013,It's a very good movie. I enjoyed it. The scene where they ride on those motorcycle things was the best scene in the movie at least that's my opinion. If you like a bit of sci-fi combined with a bit of action this movie is the perfect one for you. The actors & actresses did an amazing job in this movie. The ending was also very beautiful. After seeing this movie i really wanted a sequel. I laughed a bit when i saw Michael Sheen in a white wig cause i'm not used to the color. But the movie on its own was amazing if i describe it in one word. I like sci-fi so if you don't like sci-fi and fantasy together you should still watch the movie cause it's an very amazing movie.,TRON - Legacy
753,E-Talker,Better when you watched the original TRON,8,4 March 2015,"I first saw this movie in 2011 and decided to give it another try yesterday as I got both TRON Legacy and the original TRON on Blu-ray from a friend. Another try? Well, yeah. I did like the movie the first time I saw it back in 2011, mainly because of the gorgeous visuals and the fantastic soundtrack by Daft Punk (I'm a fan). But I found the storyline a bit thin and even quite odd at certain moments. Little did I know back then that TRON Legacy was no remake of the original TRON, but a real sequel.Right before watching TRON Legacy for a second time, we took the time to watch the original TRON from 1982 as well. And this made a huge difference! TRON Legacy is full of subtle references to the original TRON. And furthermore I was able to understand the story a lot better now which made me enjoy it more. The jump from 1982 to 2010 became even more enjoyable for me thanks to the return of Jeff Bridges as Kevin Flynn. So should you watch TRON Legacy? Yes you do. But you have to make sure you get the maximum out of it. Watch it on a beautiful television including a decent surround set, because the visuals and music are really worth it. I watched TRON Legacy in 3D and this is one of the few films I really recommend as a 3D showcase movie. And finally I really recommend you watch the original TRON first, which is a classic you should watch at least once in your life anyway. It made me upgrade my TRON Legacy rating from 7/10 to 8/10.",TRON - Legacy

756,adamspetstore001,Long time fan... Hopefull for trilogy conclusion.,8,19 December 2010,"Although a lot of people might have been disappointed with the film, I believe it was meant to be taken in the context of a trilogy. There were too many unanswered questions in Legacy to leave it at that. What happened when Tron fell into the water at the end and turned from red to light blue? What was on the storage card at the end that Flynn's son downloaded from the grid after getting out? These and other unanswered questions could and should be explained if the trilogy were to be completed. On a side note, I will compare this to Avatar in that, yeah the extended version didn't add that much, but what this film lacks in the plot seems more like time and money saving cuts than intentional sabotage. Hopefully in the near future a more complete version will be released.Either way, even though i sound like i'm knocking the film, I'm not I gave it an 8/10. I'm glad I went to the Imax to see it. My only regret is that I left the theater with more questions then I went in with. And if I hadn't seen the original i would have even more.

And the graphics have a uniqueness make the movie stand alone. In the documentary that comes with the Tron, 20th anniversary DVD, the director speaks that Tron was special because along with star wars and star trek It was breaking out of a long reign of formulaic movie making. Well Tron:Legacy is incredibly formulaic.The Directer of Tron also speaks of the special effects lending to the story. That they are part of the storytelling. The special effects in Tron:Legacy don't lend any thing other than an attempt to distract you from the lack of a convincing story even existing. Also the 3D is very unimpressive. I still think that the little orb and the dog that barks at it that played before this movie and Avatar is the most impressive use of this effect. Its just another gimmick. Why a 3 instead of a 1? Well, I didn't leave in the middle of the movie. And I didn't leave the theatre in a aggravated rage over how bad it was. It was just flat and unconvincing. Gimmicky. Boring fight and racing scenes.

After having my childhood memories of Indiana Jones sullied by 'The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' a couple of years ago was bad enough but surely they wouldn't ruin Tron too. I needn't have worried,'Tron: Legacy' is a fine film that in my eyes harks back to the glory days of 80's Sci-Fi. It feels a bit like the film that the original Tron could have been had the technology been available. No such Problems now, the special effects in the latest iteration are a tour de force! The 3D is the best I've seen since Avatar and set the mood perfectly on the dark ominous space of 'the grid', as does the music, Daft Punk perfectly drawing upon there own skills and classic Vangelis scores. There are a few bum notes, although acting well as always, Jeff Bridges' 'Flynn' is a little too Dude Lebowski at times. Also the digitised version of Bridges is a bit wobbly when viewed in the 2D real world, though it must be said that at times it appears exactly like a young Jeff is staring in the film. The story is not quite as dark as it thinks it is at times but its a fantastic trip for 2 hours and has some great stand out moments. My advice if your in your mid twenties is sit back, take a trip back to childhood and let the effects blow you away!
