0,TheLittleSongbird,Enjoyable,8,11 January 2011,"This movie is not as good as Alien and Aliens, which are quite rightly called sci-fi classics, but it is an improvement over Alien 3(though I don't think it is as bad as it is made out to be). There isn't really anything new here admittedly, despite the film making a fresh slate, and it isn't as efficiently paced, but Alien:Resurrection cleverly makes an enjoyable enough film knowing that. The film looks great, as is the case of all the movies in the series, and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's direction is adept. The story is more consistent I feel, the script has its fine moments and the atmosphere is just terrific. Alien: Resurrection also is tense, pretty suspenseful, has its moments of humour and is very graphic and bloody, definitely the most graphic of the series not that it's a bad thing. Sigourney Weaver is also on top form here. Overall, enjoyable film that does its best despite having a lot to live up to. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Alien - Resurrection
1,Leofwine_draca,Dodgy sequel in which the aliens feel like an afterthought,5,17 March 2015,"In the beginning, in 1979, there was ALIEN. It was more of a horror film than anything else, and had a lot of suspenseful and sickening moments in equal amounts. In 1986, James Cameron made ALIENS, which blended action with horror brilliantly. In 1993, there came the much maligned ALIEN 3, which most people hated but which I thought was pretty good, and suspenseful like the first. And now there is this, the fourth instalment in the series.Sad to say, it doesn't reach the heights of the first film, nor the second, nor even the third. The trouble is that it doesn't really feel like an alien film at all - just another science fiction piece, with some alien creatures as the monsters. I mean in the other films we felt that the aliens were powerful, prowling and totally terrifying. Now, they pop up now and again to kill some hapless person, but most of the film is spent in conversation as we learn of Ripley's new character.This was, I felt, the film's main failing: the lack of the Ellen Ripley as we used to know her. Weaver played a strong, yet sympathetic heroine in the first three films; now, she is a half-human, superhuman alien clone with whom the audience shares zero sympathy or understanding; she is not even likable. Or hardly believable. Weaver does the best with the character she has, but too much of the dialogue is given over to stupid, repetitive one-liners, or incessant swearing.Jeunet at least assembled an interesting, international cast for his film, which makes the proceedings a little easier to swallow than if it had been some group of B-movie nobodies. Winona Ryder is top-billed as a woman who turns out to be hiding a secret, unfortunately I knew what this secret was long before I actually got around to seeing the film, so I knew what to expect. I've never liked Ryder much and don't really consider her as much of an actress, and this film does nothing to make me respect her further.Thankfully, the supporting cast itself contains some notable character actors. First up is Brad Dourif, who enjoys himself in a small role as a nervous scientist who brings Ripley's character 'back' to life. Dourif is as good as ever, and proving himself to be the king of the bit-parts. Secondly we have Ron Perlman as a tough, scarred soldier, and although his character is highly clichéd, he's about the most likable of the bunch and lends plenty of humour to the action. Michael Wincott also appears as the leader of a band of smugglers, and it's good to hear his gravelly voice again.Which leads me on to one of the main criticisms I have of this film: the lack of originality. Much of the action, when it eventually comes, has been lifted from the other films in the series, so what we're seeing is merely regurgitated. Saying that, the action parts are all quite good, especially the famed underwater sequence. Unfortunately, as so much of the film is given over to dialogue and banter, there is little action to enjoy and hardly any suspense built up.The special effects themselves are all average, with the CGI aliens looking reasonable although not as good as their counterpart in ALIEN 3 did. Unfortunately the much-touted alien/human hybrid at the end of the film is a huge disappointment and laughable, and feels totally out of place. And it looks like a pining dog too, which is damned annoying, although the death sequence, where it gets sucked out of a window, is quite good. There is also a high level of gore for horror fans, but Jeunet frequently overuses this in favour of building up suspense as in the previous films, and there is a noticeably 'empty' feel to much of the film.Which leads me to my final point: if this were not the fourth part of the ALIEN saga, I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more. But, with such competition from the other three, Jeunet comes across like he's more interested in set design and style than the actual aliens themselves, and betrays the series fan by seriously losing touch with the 'feel' of what an ALIEN film should be like. Not totally bad, but not very good either.",Alien - Resurrection
2,SnoopyStyle,Fun New Ripley,6,26 October 2013,"It's 200 years after Alien3. The company has cloned Ripley and the alien inside her. It has created several aliens on a research vessel. One Ripley was successfully recreated with some of the Queen's DNA mixed in. Another ship Betty delivers a cargo of people in hypersleep for implantation. When the aliens escape, the crew of the Betty must fight with the help of the clone Ripley.This is the 4th installment of the franchise, and it has return to more flashier digs. The moody ugly sets are gone. Winona Ryder is really a godsend to this movie. She brings back a similar energy as Newt. She has an innate ability to project vulnerability. It was sorely missed in Alien3. And Sigourney Weaver is giddy playing this creepy feral version of Ripley.The premise is a bit out there. It doesn't really make complete sense. The ending is a big mess with the different versions of aliens. As much as it likes to be something profound. It makes the climax one crazy mess.",Alien - Resurrection
3,kosmasp,The other Alien,6,19 May 2020,"This was quite the ride. Sigourney Weaver had a lot of cloud by this point (deservedly so), but also a weird choice for director (probably) and allegedly studio interference again. The latter is not as obvious as with the third installment. But many people trying to get things they want in an Alien movie ... well the end result couldn't really be another masterpiece.And wo while the previous movie started a sort of decline, this continues the same path - so not really good. After the how the third movie ended you may wonder how Ripley will return for this one ... well the mystery is solved quite quickly at the beginning. Though there is some other revelation saved for later. Still the whole premise is ""bananas"" to say the least. But whatever - and especially if it means we get an Alien 5 sometime in the future after those ""story additions"" from Ridley Scott the last couple of years.Great cast, Weaver having a blast (even if her character is quite inconsistent) - there is enough for any self proclaimed (or otherwise) Alien fan to enjoy here. Or any Science Fiction fan for that matter. This can be fun and it has enough suspense and winks to the other overall Alien world/fan base ... not to mention quite the interesting take on humor and other things. The director again",Alien - Resurrection
4,classicsoncall,"""The best thing you can do is pray for a quick death.""",8,21 March 2015,"If you ever had any doubt that comic book or movie characters don't have to stay dead, ""Alien Resurrection"" is your proof. Sigourney Weaver is back as Lieutenant Ellen Ripley, two hundred years following her demise in Alien3, and cloned from her remains found on Fiori Sixteen. One would probably consider this film another installment of the original Alien saga, but it has a decidedly different twist with the cloning angle and the experiments aboard the USM Auriga designed to produce a new breed of alien to serve a military master.For the most part, I'd say the film makers did a successful job in bringing their vision to the big screen with a credible balance between sci-fi and horror. The movie touches on the familiar aspects of the earlier trilogy of films with chest bursters and synthetic robots while adding a new element in the concept of a host queen Alien that bypasses the egg cycle to produce a new generation of monsters.Weaver's character has a difficult task in requiring her new cloned form to summon up remembrances of a long ago past, and I found it intriguing the way she displayed her motherly instincts just before dispatching the Newborn to the depths of space in a creative way. I also liked the way the writers linked the story line to another franchise when Brad Dourif's Dr. Gediman described Ripley as ""something of a predator, isn't she?""So overall I didn't seem to have the same problem with the picture some other reviewers and fans seemed to have here. I think it works either way, as a follow up to the original trilogy or as a stand alone film combining elements of horror and science fiction in a compelling manner.",Alien - Resurrection
5,gavin6942,Joss Whedon Does Alien,6,30 September 2017,"Two centuries after her death, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is revived as a powerful human/alien hybrid clone who must continue her war against the aliens.Roger Ebert felt ""there is not a single shot in the movie to fill one with wonder"", later naming it one of the worst films of 1997. The first part may be reasonable, but the second part is a bit much. I mean, heck, this is a Joss Whedon script with the director of ""Delicatessen"". How can that fail? Really, the issue is the tone. As a Joss Whedon film, it works. As a film in the ""Alien"" franchise, it feels out of place. Something is off. And not just the nonsense about being able to clone someone with their memories intact...",Alien - Resurrection
6,lee_eisenberg,dichotomies in life,6,29 October 2007,"While ""Alien: Resurrection"" continues the story of extraterrestrial monsters going after humans, there's something of a dichotomy with Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). Certainly she's in control and as much of a bad-ass as she was in the previous movies; hell, she beats the men at basketball. Which makes it all the more surprising when she utters ""How many men do I have to f--- to get out of here?"" If you're going to all the trouble to turn a woman into Rambo, why have her say that? Maybe it was partly that around the time when this movie came out, Sigourney Weaver also starred in ""The Ice Storm"" (and played an icy character), so it was a little perplexing as to why she chose to continue playing Ripley when each successive movie focused more on the gory aspect.Truth be told, I can't fully explain why Ripley does what she does, and I don't know whether or not the movie would qualify as sexist. I did find it pretty enjoyable. Weaver, Winona Ryder, Dominique Pinon, Ron Perlman, Leland Orser, Dan Hedaya and Brad Dourif play some neat roles. Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet more recently directed the Audrey Tautou vehicles ""Amelie"" and ""A Very Long Engagement"".",Alien - Resurrection
7,jboothmillard,Alien: Resurrection,8,15 June 2005,"If you thought Alien³ had ended the series, director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Amélie) had found a way to return, quite a clever one. It has 200 years since Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) killed herself on the prison planet, being impregnated. After many attempts, scientists from The Company have successfully managed to clone her into an alien/human hybrid clone using her blood samples (from the planet), and removed the alien queen from her. Ripley, known as Number 8, does have blurs in her original memory, and she does need to relearn things, but she seems to have developed much more power, e.g. acidic blood, strength, ability to hear and smell the aliens, and obviously with these they won't kill her. They are keeping the growing queen in a high security room, and breeding new aliens (with face huggers) insanely with crew members in hibernation, and eventually, they all break out on the ship. So with the help of Ripley, a group of smugglers, including: Annalee Call (Winona Ryder) (who turns out to be an android), cripple Vriess (Amélie's Dominique Pinon), Johner (Hellboy's Ron Perlman), Christie (Gary Dourdan), Sabra Hillard (Kim Flowers) and Vincent Distephano (Raymond Cruz) are trying to escape the ship before they enter the Homeland, Earth. Ripley does have contact with what she has become though, including meeting the new hybrid baby from the alien she had inside her, a hideous pale yellow alien with what looks like a skull for a head, who mistakes Ripley for her mother. In the end they do escape though, the aliens are destroyed, and the pale yellow thing is sucked (by the vaccuum) into bloody chunks going into outer space. Also starring Michael Wincott as Frank Elgyn, Dan Hedaya as Gen. Martin Perez, J.E. Freeman as Dr. Mason Wren, Brad Dourif as Dr. Jonathan Gediman and Leland Orser as Larry Purvis. The fantastic sequences include Dourif face to face (through glass) with the alien queen making it pull faces, the underwater chase, the alien birth through both a guy's stomach and a guy's head, and almost all of the gory effects. I have seen the re-edited version, which is ridiculous, e.g. the opening being an alien turning into an insect being squashed, although Ripley being reminded of Newt (she can't remember her name though) is interesting, but just see the original. Winona Ryder was number 87, and Sigourney Weaver number 20 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!",Alien - Resurrection
8,Tweekums,An interesting end to Ripley's story.,8,30 August 2008,"Having seen Alien³ I was surprised when I heard that a fourth film was to be made and that Sigourney Weaver would still be acting in it. In the opening minutes we learn that the Ripley we see in this film is a clone of the original, not only has she been cloned but so has the alien queen that was in her. The military remove the queen before it bursts from Ripley's chest.Shortly afterwards a small cargo ship docks and its crew of smugglers unload an unusual cargo; twelve people in their cryogenic sleep tubes, it turns out these people are to be hosts to the next generation of aliens. One of the smugglers, an young engineer named Call, played by Winona Ryder, has an ulterior motive for being there; she has learnt of the military plans and had intended to kill Ripley before the queen could hatch. While the military are trying to apprehend the smugglers for Call's actions the Aliens escape from they holding cell and the alarm sounds ordering the evacuation of the ship... of course that doesn't go quite as well as it might as Ripley and the smugglers struggle past numerous aliens as well as encountering an entirely new type of alien that was live-born rather than needing a host.This film is probably the lightest in tone of the four films, the smugglers are a varied group who are likable and quite funny, especially Ron Perlman's character. Another surprise is that more characters than usual survive... I won't spoil it by saying which ones though.I found the story to be well written by Joss Whedon and the acting and direction was good too, I particularly liked Winina Ryder as Call. While it isn't the best film in the series I'd certainly advise those who liked the previous films to give it a go.",Alien - Resurrection
9,ma-cortes,"Spectacular sequel with twisted intrigue , disgusting special effects and lots of blood and gore",7,12 June 2014,"This is a visually impressive and exciting Sci/Fi following plenty of thrills , action , chills and many other things . The story takes place in 2379, 200 years after ""Aliens"" and ""Alien 3"" (2179) and also takes place 257 years after ""Alien"" (2122). As 200 years after her death, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is revived as a powerful human/Alien hybrid clone who must continue her war against the Aliens . Meanwhile , military and scientists (Dan Hedaya , Brad Dourif , J.E. Freeman) are carrying out strange experiments . As Aliens escape and then the Earthlings (Winona Ryder , Dominique Pinon , Ron Perlman , Kim Flowers , Gary Dourdan and Michael Wincott) have a hard time figuring out the whereabout of the heinous beings that are running amok . This horrifying as well as heart-pounding movie contains shocks , stomach-churning violence , chills , profanity , thrills and results to be pretty entertaining . This nail-biting picture contains tension from start to finish , gory scenes aplenty , thrills , some strong scares , slime , emotion , entertainment and good acting . It is a superb cinematic combination of Sci-Fi , monster movie and terror . This is a brutal , considerable violent and exciting sci-fi thriller that scales new heights of savagery even by the standards of the 70s , 80s and 90s. The result is a throughly violent but undeniably thrilling action movie with a strong cast giving sweatily good value to their abrasive characters . Spectacular as well as bloody slaughter sequences took long time to shoot and were extremely difficult to make . Magnificently designed creatures , originally created by the artist HR Giger . However , this time H.R. Giger was openly displeased that he wasn't given a credit for his alien designs and fired off a letter of protest to 20th Century Fox . Interesting as well as twisted screenplay by Joss Whedon , though he has commented on his dissatisfaction with the movie , fans had speculated that the finished article deviated from his original script in some fatal manner, however he put such rumors to rest ; his dialogue, action and plot were essentially intact . However he had written with a playful, tongue-in-cheek tone, which didn't work when the director decided to ""play it straight"". Sigourney Weaver breathes fire into Ripley and remaining actors are all magnificent as the crew of a futurist starship . This is the only Alien movie not to be shot in England , one of the reasons for this was that co-producer Sigourney Weaver didn't want to travel . Sigourney Weaver was paid $11 million to come back as Ripley, which was the entire budget of Alien ,(1979) . The ending part is particularly exciting with Sigourney Weaver battling the malicious alien and with exciting underwater scenes that took three weeks to film . The underwater segment was shot on a specially constructed sound stage on the Fox lot, which was converted into a permanent water-tank . The production had trouble finding enough studio space as major productions like Titanic (1997), Starship Troopers (1997) and Jurassic Park (1997) were all taking up most of the available studio space in Hollywood . This ¨Alien: Resurrection¨ by Jean Pierre Jeunet has an extraordinary cast such as Winona Ryder , Dominique Pinon , Ron Perlman , Gary Dourdan and Michael Wincott . The picture packs an original music by John Frizzell , plenty of thrilling and moving sounds . Colorful and adequate cinematography by Darius Khondji . The $50-60 million budget was significantly lower than the director Jeunet and writers originally imagined , being filmed at Fox studios in Los Angeles, California . Therefore, sets were toned down in scale and a more claustrophobic shooting approach with a lot of close-ups to characters' faces was taken . The gaps between the four Alien films steadily decreased. There was seven years between the release of Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), six between Aliens and Alien 3 (1992), and five between Alien³ and Alien resurrection (1997). The original and the best was ¨Alien¨ by Ridley Scott , it was starred by Weaver , John Hurt, Lance Henriksen , Ian Holm , Tom Skerrit , Harry Dean Stanton , Ian Holm , John Hurt ; it is followed by ¨Aliens ¨, also visually astounding by James Cameron with Paul Reiser , Bill Paxton , Jenette Goldstein , Lance Henriksen ; Alien 3 ¨ in which the alien regenerates and causes wreak havoc on isolated planet prison , being directed by David Fincher with Charles S Dutton , Paul McGann , Charles Dance . All of them starred by the great Sigourney Weaver who performed one of the best female leads created in years . Furthermore, ¨Alien vs. Predator¨ (2004) by Paul Anderson with Sanaa Lathan , Raoul Bova , Lance Henriksen , Colin Salmon , Tommy Flannagan and ¨Aliens vs. Predator 2¨ (2007) by Strause Brothers with Steven Pasquale , Reiko Aylesworth , John Ortiz , Johnny Lewis and Robert Joy .",Alien - Resurrection
10,BA_Harrison,Alien Desecration.,2,17 May 2007,"With Joss Whedon's annoyingly smart-ass script delivering annoying comic-book characters spouting annoying one-liners, and director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's annoyingly incongruous visual style, Alien Resurrection is a truly dreadful film that besmirches all that has gone before. In shortit is annoying.With characters that wouldn't seem out of place in Whedon's terrible Serenity, some very bad CGI, awful acting (Wynona, how did you ever manage to become a film star? Sigourney, were you having a laugh or what?) and an ending so bad I was unsure as to whether I should laugh or cry, this film is a failure on almost every level.Ripley, having died at the end of Alien 3, is cloned by the military, so that they can lay their hands on the alien queen that is inside her (is it just me, or does this make no sense whatsoever?). The new Ripley's DNA, however, is a fusion of alien and human, meaning that she now has superhuman strength, cool basketball skills and a liking for leather pants.With a queen now in their possession, the military scientists quickly grow themselves a batch of aliens, using some poor saps, kidnapped by a bunch of unlikeable space rogues, as hosts for their creatures. However, once 'born', these aliens prove smarter than your average ET, and they soon escape to cause all manner of bloody mayhem .Ripley, along with the rough and ready 'pirates' and an android terrorist, must try to escape death whilst also ensuring that the aliens do not successfully make their way to Earth.I will confess to enjoying the gratuitous gore in this chapter of the franchise but, between them, Jeunet and Whedon have loaded this film with so many naff elements that fans of the series will surely curse their names for what they have done.",Alien - Resurrection
11,paul_haakonsen,Starting to get back on track...,6,17 January 2016,"Recovering from the mediocre blow that was ""Alien³"" put a lot of pressure on ""Alien: Resurrection"", and it was steep hill to scale for director Jean-Pierre Jeunet. With that being said, don't get me wrong here, because I am not saying that he failed, nor am I saying that ""Alien: Resurrection"" is a poor movie. No. The director managed to steer the franchise back towards the right track, which was established with the first two movies. But it just didn't fully reach the same level of entertaining or intensity.Personally I didn't get the aspect of cloning would mix the DNA of Ripley and the alien that she had inside her at the time of her death in ""Alien³"". But hey, I guess it made for a theatrical twist to the storyline. And also the super-human direction that this was steering the Ripley character was also a bit too childish, in lack of a better word, in my opinion.The story in ""Alien: Resurrection"" takes place 200 years after ""Alien³"". Ripley has been cloned and the alien queen inside her surgically removed, but the cloning process has mixed the DNA of Ripley and the queen, giving Ripley a mutated human/xenomorph DNA structure. And as the military is trying to breed the aliens for biological weapons, they soon find their space vessel overrun by perfect killing machines.The effects in ""Alien: Resurrection"" were adequate and getting back on track after the abysmal gallery of effects shown in ""Alien³"". And it was, of course, nice to have multiple aliens and even a queen throughout the movie. Which leads me on to the creature birthed by the queen, as she no longer lays eggs, but gives birth much like humans do. The creature which was now closer in resemblance to a human that ever before, well of course it is a matter of personal preference whether you enjoyed that or not. Personally, I didn't like that creature particularly much. Sure it had some nice touches and details, but in overall it just deviated too much from the original alien strain. And furthermore, where did all the eggs in the kitchen area come from if the queen no longer laid eggs? That was a puzzle to me.""Alien: Resurrection"" doesn't have as much of an impressive cast as the previous three movies did. Sure, Sigourney Weaver is the main attraction, but aside from here then there isn't that much of an impressive ensemble of cast for my liking. The only two other people that really pulled their weight was Brad Dourif and Michael Wincott.Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet started to steer the franchise back on course, but just fully reached the endline with ""Alien: Resurrection"".",Alien - Resurrection
12,Quinoa1984,Ripley's Believe it or Not,7,11 August 2009,"One wouldn't think of pairing Jean-Pierre Jeunet, a half of the directing team responsible (in the 90's) for the very good Delicatessen and visual masterwork City of Lost Children, and Joss Whedon, a comedy writer fresh off an Oscar nomination for Toy Story (yes, there was a time) and just about to start Buffy the Vampire Slayer. But here they are, taking the franchise that started with Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) into another direction. It's one that's very promising, and in a very ""sci-fi""-like approach: 200 years in the future, the little remains left of Ripley after the end of Alien3 (you know, the one where she, uh, throws herself into the fire), is taken by evil corporation guys who clone her after several tries and extract from her the alien being still inside her to make, what do you think, MORE aliens to, you know, get them to do tricks and cure diseases and things like that. I smile just writing it.Of course, almost immediately, the aliens break out of their hermetically sealed cages (oddly enough through slaughtering one of their own for the benefit of its acid blood), and wreak havoc, once again, on a vessel carrying Ripley and a motley crew of bandits on a ship called ""Betty"", who were originally hired to get some extra clones to the military dumb-asses. After this, along with some of those juicy scenes of tough-but-funny dialog, Whedon kicks off a series of action set pieces that leads up to a revelation that is... not entirely satisfying. But it's got characters that, as unsavory (Ron Perlman) and strange (the clone-dude from City of Lost Children) as they are, we care about for the same reason we did in Alien and Aliens; they can take care of themselves pretty well, but only so far as in the midst of a dozen aliens - that have already hatched, of course.Sure, the tropes of the series are well worn by now, and perhaps Whedon and the producers knew this too. That is some of the fun of it, though its familiarity keeps it from being completely fresh (i.e. another ""a-hole"" robot on board, you might guess who based on star ranking, traitor on the ship) and there's a couple of things the characters do that seem a little stupid, or rather stupider than one would think to be done by either the director or writer (i.e. bringing along the guy infected by the alien egg), its the re-fresh part that makes it worthwhile. It's visually got the same kind of knock-em-off-your-feet flair that Jeunet made his name on at the time, particularly with an underwater sequence and just the way his camera can VROOM (not zoom) in on a character's face or a moment of action. And the storytelling, however old-hat in parts, tries for some clever things and even tries to lighten it up, ironically, with sarcastic touches and even campiness. Not to mention the actors all having a fun time, even if they don't show it a whole lot (Weaver especially rises up her flat Ripley into something cunning and sarcastic) At the same time, there's a few glaring things keeping it from real greatness. Aside from the conventions that in previous times Ridley Scott subverted as opposed to just taking along and charging up with adrenaline and ultra-violence, there's the factor of the ""human-alien"" hybrid. Its design isn't that bad, but what it does is never really made too clear. How much does its human side end up affecting the alien part? Is it cause its a baby, or has it grown super-fast? And before we can have some time with this creation that has some interest even in its silly dimensions (ever seen an alien 'lick' someone with its tongue, don't think so), it's given one of the most needlessly gory death scenes I've seen in recent memory. I find it hard to believe it was originally planned for the first Alien movie, but even as such its presentation here from Jeunet is just mind-bogglingly over the top, and not in a funny way. Up until this point I had been with the movie, more or less (mostly more), as a work of commercial Hollywood art. And then it had to go into pricey-goofy Troma-vision. 7.5/10",Alien - Resurrection
13,hitchcockthelegend,Let sleeping dogs lie?,7,18 July 2016,"Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the makers here basically stick safe to the formula of the series. This time it's a space station with space pirates and a cloned Ripley (Siggy Weaver of course) - yes! A cloned Ripley, only this time she's devoid of human compassion - kind of... The gore quota is significantly upped, which makes for some serious sci-fi terror, and some of the imagery crafted is outstanding (a clone lab sequence is shatteringly unforgettable). A tip top cast featuring Ron Perlman, Michael Wincott, Brad Dourif, Dan Hedaya and Winona Ryder, all give good shows, whilst the photography (Darius Khondji/Se7en) and art design (Steve Cooper, Andrew Neskoromny and John M. Dwyer) takes the breath away. Yet come the final straight it loses its way, sinking into a mire of over confidence, topped by a crown of thorns involving an albino baby alien hybrid.

14,Theo Robertson,Flogging A Cloned Horse,5,13 September 2004,"A lot of people were bitterly disappointed by ALIEN 3 because there wasn't enough action . Personally I liked that movie though not as much as I liked ALIENS and seeing as ALIEN 3 performed badly with cinema goers and critics the studio has decided that RESURRECTION will be an action fest similar to ALIENS . Unfortunately they made a mess of it !!!!! SPOILER TO ALIEN 3 !!!!!First of all did they have to bring Ripley back ? She was seen plunging to her death in ALIEN 3 and by a totally unconvincing plot device involving cloning she's back . There's another problem with this and that's her character has been altered , she's no longer capable of showing much in the way of sympathy as in the previous two sequels and therefore the audience find it hard to sympathies with her William Gibson wrote a script for ALIEN 3 set on a space station dealing with modified aliens and space commies but was eventually turned down because there was little substance to the story which was basically just a series of action set pieces . RESURRECTION involves a space station where space villains battle modified aliens . The first half is set up to introduce the wafer thin characters while the second half is a non stop auctioneer featuring set pieces of humans against aliens . I was just wondering why Gibson's ALIEN 3 script wasn't good enough to be produced this rather similar script was ? I guess it's all down to box office considerations . Unfortunately by trying to make money at the box office the studio have ruined the franchise with this movie I haven't seen ALIEN VS PREDATORS yet and to be honest have little inclination to , but ALIEN RESURRECTION is by far the worst of the first four ALIEN movies I've seen",Alien - Resurrection

Probably, an inevitable inclusion in the popular Franchise considering the Creature and where it had yet to go. Over the top and then some. Not a bad idea in the ongoing Saga of the ""Thing from Another World"".Fans are mixed on this with most leaning to the ""forget this one and call it a trilogy"" and many stick to that Mantra to this day. But lets take a look. Speaking of look, this is a slick, funk-punk, biker bash of slime and grime with a sheen of Violence that Fangoria types might appreciate.The beyond the pale goings-on that have a certain Pulpy charm is almost ruined by one Scene that is so gut-wrenching and ugly that, after viewing, the pit of your stomach may never be the same. Its the Window Vacuum Scene of course.But that God-Awful display aside, that dare it be said, truly sucks, this mostly can pass as a pretty good, very violent and horrific extension that, let's be honest, was certainly not going to end when there are cash registers to ring, to this day is still trying to expand.",Alien - Resurrection

The sinister & misguided Dr. Mason Wren (J.E. Freeman) & his team have recreated Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) by cloning her using blood samples, some 200 plus years after she originally died. They want the unborn queen alien inside of her & surgically remove it. Wren has military backing & General Perez (Dan Hedaya) pulls the strings & gets him what he wants. Enter 'The Betty Commercial Freighter Standing Crew: 6 Unregistered', it's crew of criminals & general scum have a delivery for Perez.

Ripley, aided by the alien DNA inside her, must once again do battle with the alien & prevent them from reaching planet Earth...Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet I liked Alien: Resurrection, I would probably rate it as third in a very good series of horror Sci-Fi films behind Alien (1979) & Aliens (1986) but ahead of Alien 3 (1992). The script by Joss Whedon isn't a massive departure from the previous instalments, a group of people trapped in an isolated location in a race against time to survive &, of course, plenty of dark corridors. Alien: Resurrection tries to take the best elements from the first two, the spaceship setting from the original & the action from the second, & it does a pretty good job at entertaining for an hour and fifty odd minutes. The strong paternal themes are here again & run throughout the film, the character's are a bit clichéd like the obligatory tough guy, the token black character, the young female & the disposable character's who get no screen time at all except for when they are killed but Ripley is very different this time around which makes for an interesting new angle if nothing else. It moves along a nice pace & is never boring or uneventful. I must admit though I didn't like where Alien: Resurrection went with that stupid looking alien human hybrid at the end.French director Pierre Jeunet (who apparently spoke very little English & had a translator on set at all times) lights the majority of the film in dark browns & oranges which gives it a slightly drab & dull look. He films the action scenes quite stylishly with some nice shots although that ricocheting bullet is the height of stupidity, I would like to see anybody actually try it! Overall the film has a nice style to it & is pleasing on the eyes. Thankfully he doesn't forget about the gore & Alien: Resurrection has to the goriest entry in the series, people have the tops of their heads bitten off, heads squashed, someone is frozen & breaks apart, aliens stick their tongues into & through people, a room full of dead bodies with their chests burst open & a cool bit where an alien burrows through someones head & pops out of their forehead plus there is a room full of gross genetic experiments gone (very) wrong.With a supposed budget of about $70,000,000 Alien: Resurrection is undoubtedly a fine looking film with that big budget Hollywood polish to it. Slick cinematography good production values & sets while the aliens themselves have never looked better, apart from one or two poor, by todays standards anyway, CGI shots. I love all that thick slime the aliens drool as well, of which there is plenty. Unfortunately I think the alien hybrid thing at the end looks absolutely awful & like someone wearing a rubber skull mask brought from a joke shop. The acting is OK but they aren't given much to work with.Personally I think Alien: Resurrection is a pretty good action/Sci-Fi/horror film that delivers on all counts, although it's nothing we haven't seen before. Still, definitely worth a watch.",Alien - Resurrection

What a shithole.",10,14 July 2007,"Amélie director Jean-Pierre Jeunet did a fantastic job and gave us the best Alien film of the lot.I loved the first two, but this was so much more.First, there was the lighting. It may seem trivial to some, but this film was much more enjoyable due to the fact that everything didn't happen in the dark. I do not think the darkness enhances the thrill of the series. The creatures are awesome themselves, and the new creature was magnificent. Seeing them in brilliant lighting made them even more thrilling.Sigourney Weaver and Winona Ryder were awesome together. They made an almost erotic team and I loved seeing them act. The ""too humane to be human"" line was a stroke of genius.I have always liked Gary Dourdan, and he did well in this film - a positive addition to the cast. And, no one could have done General Perez better than Dan Hedaya.Really enjoyed this one!",Alien - Resurrection

Performance-wise, nothing to write home about. even Signourney Weaver seemed to be going through the motions. Winona Ryder was unsuited to her role.

In fact, maybe this one's even one of the most extreme in that respect. But this is just... a minor complaint would be events and actions in general that are bizarre, but there also bigger issues. For one thing, so many situations are solved in an unexpected way. Now, kudos for not just taking the easy way out, but it almost comes off as overcompensating, going so far in the other direction that the viewer feels completely disconnected from it... the illusion cracks, and we find ourselves wondering why we're giving this piece of fiction, which at these bits, not so much makes no attempt at convincing us, but more goes out of its way to taunt and push us away. The humor is seldom all that funny, and more often than not common sense is its expense. It should not be thought that Jeunet is not skillful; tension is mustered up(if, as others have said, there is hardly any character development), the creatures, as well as various parts of the movie, are effective. The plot is more or less empty and by-the-numbers once the initial stuff is out of the way(save for one or two ideas and scenes, which admittedly are pretty darn good and interesting), and its overall progression is mostly devoid of surprises(which is not to say that everything herein is figured out ahead of time). Something that, at best, at least nags is how this seems to try to fit in what was in each entry to go before it(which, sooner or later, has got to get to be ridiculous). The effects are great. There are some rather grotesque sights and sounds in this, anyone considering watching should take that into account. The action isn't that involving or entertaining. This did have the worst start-off point, and they did actually manage to work around that, if in a way that is far-fetched. The behavior of the Aliens is somewhat messed up. Furthermore, I wasn't scared of them at... anytime, really. The acting isn't particularly impressive, same goes for some of the character writing(Ripley, what happened to you? Is it the black nail-polish(I know, I know, someone told you it would look wicked)?). Perlman is reasonably cool(but the man probably delivered a one-liner as his first words). The Special Edition, briefly introduced(in less than a minute) by he who helmed this, holds an alternate opening and ending, among other things, and is worth it for those who want more of what this is. The commentary track is also fine to listen to. I recommend this to... maybe more fans of Jean-Pierre Jeunet(as well as Joss Whedon? I... wouldn't know, this appears to be the only thing of his I've seen firsthand) than those who dig the franchise. 5/10",Alien - Resurrection
20,view_and_review,"Ripley, Believe it or Not",6,3 November 2020,"The last time we saw Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) she was falling into a vat of molten metal killing herself and the alien inside of her. We are now 200 years later and she's back thanks to the wonders of cloning. Somehow, and this requires a lot of suspended disbelief, the military was able to scrape up enough of Ripley's DNA to clone her. Don't ask me how. They also found some alien xenomorph DNA which allowed them to do what they really wanted to do: clone a xenomorph.Ripley 3.0 is stronger, has keener senses, and a mind meld with the aliens. The rogue military crew aboard the ship she's on wants the alien inside her and they want to make more aliens as well. For that they'll need more hosts. There're always some space pirates willing to do something shady for a little cash. Hence, we got some space pirates who hijacked a ship with inhabitants in cryo-sleep, stole them and delivered them to the military vessel. Now these military morons can try again at what so many before them failed at: farm aliens for fill-in-the-blank.Of course, things went sideways.As a stand-alone movie, ""Alien Resurrection"" is cool. But as an addition to a storied franchise I didn't like it. I thought ""Alien 3"" was good and a boss way to conclude the franchise. It would've been a trilogy (a top ten trilogy IMO), Ripley was gone and so were the xenomorphs. Alas, greedier heads prevailed, and we got a part four. Why bring Ripley back? Or more appropriately, why bring her back in such an absurd fashion? You found her blood samples on Fiora 16, the space prison, where she died. How? Where? Did she just leave blood samples lying around? And why her? Why did you need her as the host? It didn't make sense to me.Take that aspect away and we have a better movie. Don't get me wrong, I like Ripley a lot; I just don't like the idea of shoe horning someone into a plot for the sake of familiarity.",Alien - Resurrection

The good includes: The return of Sigourney Weaver as a Ripley with a new spin; A decent premise for a fourth entry; Brad Dourif, creepy as ever; A quirky, unusual, and effective supporting cast; A horrifying sequence where Riply discovers her genesis; Excellent production design; Some solid set pieces.The bad includes: A script which doesn't live up to expectations; Some dodgy CGI on the aliens; A distinct feeling of knocking cast members off by numbers; An appallingly badly realised hybrid.On balance, a worthwhile entry in the series but, if you are watching them through in sequence for the first time, be prepared for some bits which will make you wince.",Alien - Resurrection

The characters are great, Joss Whedon's writing excellent as always, however the Betty crew of 6 could have been better cast even. Ron Perlman a welcome addition to any film and Weaver superb and having fun. The evil doctors are well acted by Freeman and Dourif as well.

Doesn't look like a resurrection as it does something that should be buried in a septic tank. Ripley is now over 200 years old thanks to cloning technology. There is an alien inside her and the crew fish it out and sew her up then study twelve of them behind unbreakable glass. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that the unbreakable glass is about as effective as a one-legged man at an ass kicking contest. Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet should have save his money and join the circus and do really cool acts with used snot rags. These films have directors of high profile but only the first two seem to be rewarding. Predictable circumstances include one's announcement that an alien inhabits him and that it will burst out his chest. They might as well have a welcoming committee ready. Sigourney Weaver was a great trooper in Alien and Aliens but now she is basically showing up for the job. Winona Ryder reduces the android to a moron the moment she opens her mouth. They should have added a laugh track just for her scenes. Ron Pearlman, Dan Hedaya and Michael Wincott play fast food and finger licking good to monster aliens.

24,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Grossly underrated sequel with a lot to like about it.,8,11 October 2011,"Years into the future, a clone of Ellen Ripley and other survivors find themselves trapped in an abandoned research ship overrun by the aliens they bred from her remains and try to escape before they're killed one-by-one.This here is an unjustly maligned sequel and actually has a lot of good stuff going for it. One of the better areas in the film is the high-intensity action that permeates the surroundings, really from the start and manages to get in a lot of great stuff from it. There's a multitude of chases here that are a ton of fun and really high-energy, from the walk-through of the flooded corridor and the swim through the underwater section all the way through to the trap with the eggs and the resulting shoot-out there, as well as other scenes from the rampage through the ship and taking out the evacuees in the escape process as well as the rather impressive attack in the escape pod at the end which contains a lot of great parts to it and really works well. This is helped by a rather well-designed ship location that allows for these tension-packed scenes to take place and generate a lot of fun. Another good plus is the high gore on display, from scarred faces, jaws ripped open and other extremely graphic kills that give off a great feel, and as usual the aliens are incredible. The only real flaw to this one is the rather inane segment that keeps a dead crew-member around for no reason than to keep a big-name member more involved in the film at that point. Also problematic is the early scenes of the clone interacting with the crew which goes nowhere, but overall this one is a lot of fun.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language",Alien - Resurrection

Perfect symmetry in how utterly wrongheaded both the real and fictional attempts to keep things alive were; awful script and direction, unappealing characters and inept humor all contribute to this pointless debacle.The first two ""Alien"" pictures are still masterpieces, fun-house and roller-coaster rides reflected darkly and grotesquely by the next two; let's hope the planned fifth solo ""Alien"" film rectifies this situation!",Alien - Resurrection

As good as the first two, no, but at least it was a lot better than part three which I did not really care much for at all. This is also the fastest paced and more humorous of the four movies and that only adds to the appeal. You never get as tense as you did watching the first two, but that can be a good thing if you just want to watch the aliens killing and being killed rather than watching something that makes your heart race. Weaver is back as a clone of her former self, and quite frankly she seems to be having a lot more fun in this one than in the others. Ryder and Pearlman make great additions and really add the overall effect of this film. The aliens are once again reborn and they take over a ship as of you expect to happen. No one ever listens when they are told that the aliens can not be controlled. A group of mercenaries join forces with Weaver to fight their way to freedom off the alien infested ship. Good movie, though there is a few bizarre scenes here and there including one with Weaver and an alien. This one is not the best of the series, but it is a fun movie to watch.",Alien - Resurrection

The diverse cast is great but I started to get bored by the end of the first act. Thankfully, the movie perks up with an outstanding underwater sequence that recalls ""The Poseidon Adventure"" (1972), albeit more amped up.The peripheral cast is highlighted by the voluptuous Kim Flowers as Hillard and the formidable Gary Dourdan as Christie. But you just know they're the equivalent of red shirts in Star Trek.If you've seen the first three entries, there's no pressing reason to see this one. It has a been-there-done-that vibe. However, if you appreciate those films and want more of the same with a new cast, ""Alien Resurrection"" is well done for what it is, proficient sci-fi/horror.

29,Mr-Fusion,Witness the series running out of steam,5,19 May 2017,"Well, at least there were no more favored characters to be killed off.""Alien Resurrection"" is a movie I paid to see in the theater, and I was even disappointed when it fell to ""Flubber"" at the box office. This is just to give you some perspective. Twenty years hence, it plays as something very French, very weird, and way too sluggish (and I'm not all that sure what I saw as a 17 year-old). It's certainly lost any of the spark of its predecessors, and the motley group of smugglers assembled here feels more like systematic xenomorph fodder. Even Ron Perlman(!) is wasted.What I will say is that Sigourney Weaver embraces the off-kilter vibe of her lab-reproduced Ripley. The character's lost somewhere between human and alien, and she plays it with a mix of cynicism and wicked curiosity. She also has the best scene in the movie when she discovers one of the lab failures that came before here and puts it out of its misery; it's a hard scene.We can probably all agree that cloning Ripley was a desperate attempt at keeping the series going, and it really shows.5/10",Alien - Resurrection

If you simply want a rehash of any of the previous three films, this is not for you.Resurrection is not a perfect film, there are some scenes - dialogue mainly - which can make one cringe, but overall I found it to be the almost perfect mix of horror, action and irony. With the storytelling talents of Dan O'Bannon and Joss Whedon, you get layer after layer of interesting plot, while Jeunet's directing shows what a movie can be if creativity is let loose.I've seen this film several times now and I am pretty sure I am going to like it every time.

""Alien 3"" was an alright movie, with a few disappointments. But now I finish up these movies with a pretty bad ending. I think that ""Alien: Resurrection"" was trying to get back to the original. But it just couldn't. Even though I worship Joss Whendon on his very awesome screenplays, this movie couldn't work. I'm sorry, Joss! Please, get back to Buffy! Ahem.

The Queen then goes on in giving birth to a deadly new breed of its kind that would spell trouble for the human race, leaving Ripley, along with a group of space smugglers, to stop the creature and the ship from reaching Earth. Jean-Pierre Jeunet did a pretty good job directing, creating an intense atmosphere full of non-stop thrills and action, and directed a cast who is pretty forgettable yet decent in their acting for the most part, but I think Weaver carried the movie. Joss Whedon wrote a pretty exciting story for the plot that I thought wasn't as intriguing as Aliens, but definitely better than Alien 3 - not as dark, gloomy and depressing. ***spoiler ahead*** In order of time-line if you include the Predator and Promethesus movies, Alien: Resurrection is the final chapter, and I thought it closes out the saga on a positive note.

35,thesar-2,Alien: Redemption,7,23 January 2011,"Honestly, I wasn't a big fan of Alien: Resurrection when it was first released. I saw it at Harkins Arizona Mills and walked with distaste because, at that time, I was a thorough lover of the Alien³ film. Years later, I would reverse my opinion by simply opening my eyes to the (literal) horror of Alien³ and realizing, despite the ""humor"" of Alien: Resurrection, it was 10x the movie part 3 was and a good conclusion of the series.The movie wasn't taking itself too seriously. If it did, it would be very odd for the once-great Ripley character to be spewing lines that only (other Sci-Fi great) Spock would recite. It was fun, scary, adventurous and just enough suspense and originality to be added to any Alien franchise lover's collection.Unfortunately, you kind of have to see the wretched Alien³ to get the background needed: (and believe me, this is a spoiler for those who haven't seen part 3) Ripley's partners from Aliens died, including the young girl, Newt and Ripley gets stranded on Fury 161, a prison planet, but not before being injected with the queen alien. Ripley attempts at destroying the *only* queen by killing it along with herself.200 years and 8 attempts later, the new ""company"" of militants, clone her and remove the queen alien in order to spawn more alien warriors for the battle..of a war we've never seen. Anyways, they decide to keep #8, or Ripley, alive and she slowly, but surely, regains some of her memories of her uncloned past. Meanwhile, we have on this cloning ship a group of renegades who brought the hosts to those aliens. They're very rambunctious with this new model Ripley, but all hell breaks loose when the inevitable happens: the aliens, smartly, escape on board.So, here it turns into the past, once again, making this a thankful last chapterthe movie turns to escaping off the ship to avoid being either eaten or harvested for the Queen. Luckily, Ripley (Weaver) keeps it interesting with dialogue and quips and they introduce the NEVER-SEEN-BEFORE alien swimmersnot that that's a big deal.The movie's finale still puzzles meeven after watching this several times. I don't want to spoil it even further, but the two (vague) things that bother me was Ripley's willing to go there and why one character/creature kills another immediately. This could just be me, but I can see why they were trying to change it up at the endeven though it ended just like part one?I have already stated to stay away from the ""Special Edition"" of Alien³ and I might have repeated that hereif only for the incredibly awful, ""Men in Black"" opening segment. Don't let that discourage you or set the scene for Alien: Resurrection. Simply, get the DVD that contains both, watch the original (theatrical) opening credit scene – though it looks like some Child's Play horror sequel beginning – and then continue on with the rest of the special edition. Seriously, the MIB terrible ""special"" edition should be avoided, while the rest is just fine.It's a watchable movie, with some really funny lines and scenes – I loved the ""it was in my way"" bit. It's nowhere near the caliber as Alien or Aliens and it's 10x higher than Alien³but it's worth a viewing to complete the series.Side Note: (spoiler) Once again, they kill off one of the best characters almost immediately. In Alien³ the doctor was axed prematurely and Newt, Bishop and Hicks earlier. Here, it was the captain, Frank (Wincott)he got the same quick fate. Yeah, I get this is not supposed to be a bed of roses, but come on, for oncelet someone other than Ripley prevail.",Alien - Resurrection
36,lost-in-limbo,"""Hey, Ripley. I heard you, like, ran into these things before?""",7,26 December 2009,"I actually read the novel before I had ever seen the feature, and I really enjoyed it. As I remembered being on holidays with my family soon after it just opened at cinemas and grabbing a copy to fill in the time. The aspect I liked about it was that the fact you could read that of the thoughts of the aliens. Sure it wouldn't work on film (well it might --- however it would feel quite odd to tell the truth), but it was an interesting touch in the book. I seen it a couple times now and it remains just as adrenaline pumped and enjoyably over-the-top entertainment.Anyhow French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and writer Josh Whedon (best known for penning ""Buffy: The Vampire Slayer"" TV series and than later on the TV show and movie ""Firefly"") would definitely change the tone of the franchise with this well-budgeted sequel ""Alien Resurrection"" as its broodingly surreal visual edge and venomous tongue-in-cheek approach were the signature styles of its creators. Was it better for it well, yes and no. While for me it doesn't come close to the first two films, I believe it to be an improvement over David Fincher's ""Alien 3"". Which I don't believe to be as bad as many make it out to be, but still a disappointing experience (although the producer's cut fixes up some problems evident in the theatrical release).Whedon's story is a perfect blend of sci-fi/ horror / action that starts off with an interesting vision, before transcending into the same old formula. Nonetheless director Jeunet's clinical, but streamlined handling constructs some twisted images (like that of the newborn alien) and exciting passages outside the graphic jolts, liked the sequences staged underwater and involving some ladder climbing. The atmosphere is dark and shadowy with vast, open long wide photography and an expansively simmering score.Special effects remain impressive as ever. Mixing with effective puppet work (how can you forget the second tongue and constant drooling!) and decent CGI work. The competent make-up FX stands up with moments of graphic carnage and new creation or two. The ensemble cast do decent job. Ron Pealman pretty much steals the show and Sigourney Weaver seems to be relishing her return. Winona Ryder is okay. Then there's solid support by Michael Wincott, J.E.

37,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Worse than its predecessors.,5,14 April 2020,"'Alien: Resurrection (1997) is markedly worse than its predecessors. With its confused tone, bland characters and ridiculous story, it makes for a less than compelling experience. It isn't scary and, worse still, it isn't particularly entertaining, either. It does, however, feature a few scenes that are so silly they're actually laughable. They feel like scenes from a genuine comedy, more parodic than some of the stuff seen in 'Scary Movie (2000)', and are the only really memorable or enjoyable sequences the film boasts. The screenplay is peppered with little jokes and tongue-in-cheek moments that simply don't translate to the more 'straight' version we see on screen. This makes the more overtly funny stuff all the more perplexing; surely, these scenes are so over the top they had to be made like that on purpose? In either case, they don't mesh with the overall vibe of the piece and they don't elevate it beyond the bland action-horror it otherwise is. 5/10",Alien - Resurrection

Its sequel, Aliens, cranked up the action and is also regarded as one of the best sequels ever made. However, Alien 3 started a downward trend that fans were left wondering how this happened when there was so much rich source material to build on. Alien 3 was not up to the quality of its predecessors, but it had its moments and, if you look at it as a 'stand-alone' piece, it's better still.Therefore, Alien: Resurrection is the studio's attempt to make up for part 3. Do they? Well, sort of. For a start they realise that having only ONE alien and NO guns was a mistake in part 3. Now we have guns and about fourteen aliens. Unfortunately, this still means it's a step backwards from the planet full of aliens we saw in part 2.Ripley is back and, seeing as she's now part alien herself, is enjoying playing her 'duel role.' Plus the supporting cast are good. But, again, if you've seen Aliens, they you'll probably realise that they're all just there to make up for the characters (needlessly?) killed off in Aliens.At least the direction is good (as per all its predecessors) and the film looks brilliantly dark and foreboding.Alien: Resurrection is a good film, but, as keeping with part 3 rather than parts 1 and 2, it's better more as another 'stand-alone' film. An Alien film shouldn't just be 'good,' it should be absolutely amazing, setting the standards for adult sci-fi/horror to come. This one is a nice effort at the mistakes made in part 3, but it's still inferior to Aliens, sadly.",Alien - Resurrection
39,ThomasDrufke,The Basketball Scene...Enough Said...,2,19 May 2017,"Alien 3 is a mess, but it's nothing compared to the abomination that is Alien: Resurrection. One wouldn't be wrong by saying that there isn't one good thing to say about this film. Sure, everything isn't horrible, but just about 95 percent of it is. Last time I checked, that's not a good percentage.Resurrection is a shell of the films that made this series great in the first place. To start, the film's tone is all over the place. It feels like the script wants the film to take a lighter direction but the direction does exactly the opposite. You have characters that don't feel like real human beings and always seem to overact to the conflict, why the conflict itself is overtly gory and grotesque, just for the sake of being gory and grotesque. I'm still not sure what audience this film was trying to appeal to. It's neither a scary thriller like the first film nor an exciting action film like Aliens. But that's not for lack of trying.Who thought it would be a good idea to have Ripley come back as an uncomfortably sexualized version of herself without any explanation as to why she was cloned in the first place? After the semi-heroic act at the end of Alien 3, there's absolutely no need to go back and recycle the same characters. And really, what was the point of bringing back Ripley if she wasn't even going to have the qualities we love about Weaver's portrayal. This does way more to hurt Ripley's legacy than it does to amplify it.Written by Joss Whedon and directed by the guy who made Amelie makes this film more puzzling than its predecessor. We know there were severe behind the scenes issues with Fincher's Alien 3, but who could have possibly greenlit Resurrection? There's nothing redeemable about this film. And I mean nothing. Great actors and actresses like Ron Perlman and Winona Ryder give less than stellar performances (and that's generous). Even Weaver, who has always been the light of this franchise was just passable as Ripley. Heck, the Xenomorphs themselves were pathetic. The special effects looked off, they were kept up in cages for most of the film, and the hybrid alien at the end? My god it was all-time awful.-Tone is all over the place-Script and direction take the film to separate places-Performances2.9/10",Alien - Resurrection
40,g-bodyl,The Worst Alien Movie but...,6,19 August 2011,"I still kind of liked it. I didn't like it as much as the predecessors though. Alien and Aliens were two excellent, genre-defining movies. Alien 3 is much better than people give it credit for. I can see why people despise this movie. The beginning of the movie is very slow. But from the halfway point, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.Ripley returns two hundred years later as a clone...and an alien inside her. Along with a group of mercenaries, Ripley has to save the day again.The acting is pretty good. I enjoyed another great performance by Signourey Weaver. Winona Ryder does a decent job as Call. I like Ron Perlman even though he seems to be in every terrible movie.I thought the final alien shown is a great design. That thing is very ugly. I knew what the other aliens were gonna look like though.Overall, this is a good movie but nothing more. If you really wanna see a great alien movie, check out the first three. I rate this film 6/10.",Alien - Resurrection
41,ericstevenson,"What's with you, Critic?",5,28 July 2017,"I really admit that if it wasn't for the Nostalgia Critic's funny review of this movie I would have probably liked this more. Then again, I noticed a lot of the problems while I was watching the movie. It looks like this is the last in the Alien series chronological wise. The new movies are better, but of course not as good as the oldest ones. I actually really did like the special effects in this movie. It's weird because it actually starts with this really stupid CGI shot of a fly, but it gets much better. There are so many things that don't make sense.In the scene where the guy with the Xenomorph was attacking the villain, I had no clue what was going on. Was the alien mind controlling him? Well, it does lead to a pretty cool scene. The first half hour of this movie is pretty boring too. Around the third part, it does get its best parts because the action is nice. The problem is, this film doesn't bring anything new to the Alien mythology. I guess there is this new alien creature that appears at the end, but even that was poorly designed. Sigourney Weaver is still nice and yes, she actually literally made that backwards basketball shot in the film. **",Alien - Resurrection
42,lesleyharris30,"An Unnecessary Sequel that never Dazzles,",4,22 January 2016,"Alien: Resurrection is a poor film with a really mediocre storyline and a decent cast that weren't enough to make this any better. There are certainly impressive visual and special effects, but that means nothing when it isn't one bit captivating, the story is formulaic, it's the fourth film in the Alien series and really feels like that, a film that was only made to make a bit of money. Sigourney Weaver is the only returning cast member as her character is resurrected 200 years after the events of the third film, but this interesting and unique set up never manages to bring any real excitement, Weaver's heart wasn't in the performance, it was clear she didn't want to do this movie. It also tends to drag far too often, investing too much time on a certain scene and over developing characters that no one cares about, it focuses a lot on Winona Rider's Call, easily one of the most irritating characters in sci-fi history, the writers clearly struggled to make her likable and never achieved that goal. Alien 3 wasn't outstanding, but it's just as good as Alien or Aliens in comparison to this mess, Alien: Resurrection is s boring, slow and underwhelming fourth installment. A replicated Ripley must fight the creatures once again in the far distant future. Best Performance: Ron Perlman",Alien - Resurrection
43,A_Different_Drummer,A 20 year re-review,6,20 July 2016,"I am one of those older (mature) reviewers who can claim to have seen this series in real time, in theatres.First I will share my recollection of what that was like at the time.Alien 1 was magnificent. If you were to make a list of the greatest films of all time (and all reviewers do this, if only subconsciously) Alien 1 would be make the list. Alien 2 was doubly astonishing because it was almost as good as Alien 1 and, as any film buff knows, the sequel is rarely if ever that good.Expectations were high going into Alien 3, the prison planet movie, but the entry was disappointing and for the first time fans started to wonder if the franchise was going to self-destruct.For this reason, Alien 4, Resurrection, was disappointing in every possible way. It was a weak concept, poorly timed and poorly executed. The template for the story was more ""haunted house"" than sci-fi. Not only was the story flawed but at the end of the day it ran out of steam after the first 30 minutes and became tedious for the audience, a sin no film should ever commit. All the characters were so unlikable -- including to a large extent Weaver's saucy clone -- that even if the audience WANTED to root for a character, there was no one worthy of the effort.I got hold of the director's cut and re-reviewed this film because another member posted a review saying this film was unappreciated.OK, so let's appreciate it for what it is -- a flawed entry that almost destroyed the franchise. The IMDb rating is solid -- in other words, this is really a very weak film.(To date Alien 1 and 2 remain the best of the series. AVP is a remarkably perky little entry that somehow manages to polarize reviewers who either love it or hate. I have re-watched AVP more than any other entry. It is not elegant but it is very very entertaining.)",Alien - Resurrection
44,CuriosityKilledShawn,A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT,8,22 April 2001,"This movie rocks. It looks and feels more futuristic than the first 3 and for once the characters weren't boring, annoying or blank. The space pirates, the mad doctors, the marines and the new, very sexy and very seductive Ripley are very appealing.The mad doctors wanted to bring Ripley back because of the Queen that was inside her. So she is cloned, but only the eighth copyworks. All of the others crashed, like computers, and look way gross. She has partial memories of her past, has superhuman strength, has acid for blood (cool) and is connected to the creatures in a weird way.The mad doctors want more hosts for the aliens so they can breed them and train them for Biological Warfare. The space pirates bring a cargo full of frozen prisoners to them for that reason and bring with them Call, an android, who takes a large interest in Ripley. It was inevitable that the aliens would break loose and when they do, all hell breaks loose.
This time round the Aliens seem cooler and smarter, unlike in Aliens when they were just there as a reason for gunfire, they can talk to each other and can figure out how doors and buttons work. Although they are mostly CGI, they still look scary and the swimming sequence in the flooded dinnerhall is cool to the max.Many critics disliked the ending immensely, but I think that the beautiful sunset over earth infinitely better than the ending in Alien 3. The ""Newborn"" Alien is gross, creepy and way disturbing. I have no doubt that you will feel the same and the ""death by suction"" is sickening.
I hope that there is another Alien movie that is as cool as this one. But it seems that the odd numbered Alien movies are crap and the even good. Or am I just talking nonsense?",Alien - Resurrection

It's far from being at least partly good as those two, but it's a descent ""Alien"" movie on it's own, on the same level as ""Alien3"", which was OK. It has some style, some interesting shoots from visual point, it has OK acting, so this movie is just OK for spending one evening with, but don't expect to be so engaged in story and movie itself to come back to it for repeat viewings. Unfortunately ""Alien: Resurrection"" doesn't have the suspense the first two had because of characters – they are not so sharply written so you could really care for them the way you did for characters in ""Aliens"". The situations they encounter are menacing, well shoot, but again, the characters that you could care is what missing in those scenes – and what a great action sequence underwater – simply the best in whole movie.Overall, ""Alien: Resurrection"" is not bad movie at all, it has cool visuals, OK acting, some great action sequences and Aliens themselves! What is missing is better characters, and more human Ripley – and didn't care for her in this movie at all which is strange when I consider her one off my favorite movie characters in the history.",Alien - Resurrection

49,tabuno,Weaver as Riply Saves the Movie,8,11 January 2019,"18 April 2017. Sigourney Weaver saves this movie. It is valuable to note the she was given a co-producer credit for this movie and her sublime individual performance in it testifies to her influence in transforming this movie from a poor parody of Alien into a singularly powerful character driven movie. Yes the rest of the movie is pretty much a mishmash of typical science fiction outer space horror fare. Yes the script and dialogue is pretty lame by comparison, especially the General Perez who comes across as a crazed, weirdo military leader.Nevertheless, the plot outline is decent and the one-liner humor is amazingly spread well throughout the movie and deliciously pungent with irony in reference to the original 1979 classic. There are a number of parallel scenes, particularly towards the end with a shot resembling Ripley and her cat and later in Aliens (1986) and Newt. Ripley's character is likely to have been overlooked by many. The complex hybrid synthesis is quite amazing with Weaver's performance. Her sensual mother-child emotive and psychic relationship is something to really experience. Weaver manages to lay the ironic humor, dialogue, and a otherworldly, almost alien shimmer to her performance, one that is simply worth experiencing for watching this movie for itself.",Alien - Resurrection
50,The-Sarkologist,The fourth movie - does she get home now?,9,23 September 2011,"After a very disappointing Alien III, the forth offering to the Alien saga, by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, promised to bring redemption. Could an alien movie supersede Cameron's Aliens? Well, in my opinion, no. Resurrection began having a lot of promise, and held on to this all the way through the movie with excellent characters, but it was at the end that it all fell apart. This was to do with a problem with the storyline, but I will explain a little before going into how the plot falls apart. The movie is set two hundred years after Ripley (Sigorney Weaver) died aboard a military medical research ship. The movie does follow along the alien tradition with having a small group of people aboard an enclosed space so the aliens cannot escape a wreck havok across the universe. The aliens are supposedly all destroyed, but they have managed to get hold of some of Ripley's blood and from this they managed to clone her. Later in the movie it is revealed that this is not the only clone of her made but this is the first functional one. They remove the queen from Ripley and then help it grow. We slowly come to find that the cloning process has not worked entirely, Ripley has inherited the alien's aggressive nature, and also seems to be able to sense them. The scientists then get the alien eggs (which we assume the queen laid) and cause them to open in front of some human captives, originally prisoners but captured by space pirates employed by the military. This is not the only place where the eggs have been laid, for we discover later that the eggs were laid as an ambush on the route back to the ship, the Betty. Now, as Ripley had inherited things from the alien, the alien inherited something from Ripley; the movie says that it was the womb and we watch the queen give birth to a half-human/half-alien hybrid. This causes problems with the plot because I do not know where the eggs came from. This research facility was conducting highly illegal experiments, that is trying to create the aliens to use for humanity. What we see is that what used to be a natural monster has now blurred with what humanity created. The monster is no longer from outside, it has now become us. The original alien movie put the monster inside of us so that we would feel defenceless against it, now Resurrection has made us the monster because what we are watching is what we have created. The final alien reacts in a very interesting way. It hates humans and kills all in sight, but it does not harm the synthetic nor does it harm Ripley. Ripley feels compassion when she watches it die, and the creature calls out to Ripley to save it. We can almost feel the regret in Ripley's heart when it speaks her name. No longer is this alien horrible, but what it has shown us is that beyond all the horror there is a human heart inside (or liver or stomach, depending on the culture you are from). This makes us realise that even the most horrid person we know is capable of love. The plot discrepancy destroyed the movie for me, but compared to Alien III, this was far better.",Alien - Resurrection

This didn't seem like the fourth film. It felt fresh and new thanks to Jeunet's unique vision. We saw a very different side to the alien creatures, held captive for study and experimental purpose.

54,tomgillespie2002,Not the Alien I know and love,4,8 September 2017,"Despite plummeting into a fiery furnace while carrying an unborn alien queen inside of her at the climax of David Fincher's messy- but-interesting Alien 3, Fox saw more money to be made in carrying on the franchise started by Ridley Scott back in 1979. For the fourth instalment, French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, hot off the success of The City of Lost Children, was brought in to inject some life in the stuttering series, bringing a unique aesthetic to the ongoing battle between us puny humans and the superior xenomorph. Sadly, this unique aesthetic is muted and ugly, perhaps even more so than the incredibly miserable Alien 3, and the European sense of humour and quirkiness Jeunet also brings to the table doesn't quite fit the tone of the Alien series. If this was a stand-alone, unconnected genre movie, Alien Resurrection may now be fondly remembered as an offbeat, cyberpunk oddity.It's 200 years since Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley sacrificed herself to finally rid the universe of the xenomorphs, but humanity's stupidity apparently hasn't wavered in that time. Ripley is cloned by some mad scientists from a single drop of blood, for the sole purpose of removing the queen inside of her (how the queen got inside her from the cloning process isn't quite explained), and turning its offspring into weapons and/or subjects of experimentation. She tells them, ""she will breed, you will die,"" but naturally this falls on deaf ears. As the inevitable happens and the aliens free themselves from their cells, Ripley falls in with a rag- tag group of mercenaries. But Ripley is different; she can smell nearby aliens and seems to possess super-strength, and when she receives a jab to the face, her blood burns through the spaceship's floor. She clearly shares a bond and possibly DNA with her 'children', and the grizzled space pirates don't know whether they should trust her.Alien Resurrection is the worst of the franchise for two reasons. One is that the film is so damn ugly. Aside from the wonderfully weird moment in which Ripley writhes in the slimy tentacles of her 'daughter', there isn't one shot that feels truly cinematic. The sets look expensive, certainly, but there's a TV-quality running throughout, backed-up by a pre-Buffy the Vampire Slayer show Joss Whedon script, which often feels like a precursor to the wonderful Firefly. The second is the casting of Winona Ryder as daughter- figure Call. Ryder is a terrific actress, but every line she utters here is without conviction. She stands out like a sore thumb when sharing scenes with such reliable character actors as Ron Perlman, Michael Wincott, Dominique Pinon, Dan Hedaya and Brad Dourif. Jeunet amps up the gore factor, which is something the Alien series was never about, and neglects suspense and terror in the process. The climax is weird and disgusting, and may have been delightfully bonkers if this was unshackled by a franchise tag and was the director's way of letting loose with a generous budget. But this isn't the Alien I know and love.",Alien - Resurrection
55,johnnyboyz,"Seems ironic now that a film with the word 'resurrection' in the title would ultimately kill off a series, but this Alien film does not deserve the reputation it carries.",5,22 October 2008,"I don't think it's that Alien: Resurrection is a bad film, just a film that pales in comparison when it comes to the mainstream's opinion of films that preceded it. But what films to have precede it; Ridley Scott's brilliant Alien, a film that helped pioneer that formula of the human, non-human and the anti-human archetype within a certain space together as events played out, more often than not the anti-human element 'jumping' out at you and picking off the hapless character. What happened in Aliens made everybody gush, some even more than Scott's effort and what happened in Alien³ largely has everybody point fingers at the studio simply because it's a David Fincher film and he directed Fight Club and that's 'brilliant' thus; he cannot make a bad film which means it was the studio's fault.But biased opinions on directors, films and studios aside; Alien: Resurrection is a sort of hybrid of all three of the films, more so the first two than the third alone. As a film of the genre, it's relatively well paced with a host of characters that threaten to break into the anti-hero vein but all of whom are given their fair share of screen time and all of whom have their traits and quirks. This is a far cry from Cameron's Aliens, which is the worst of the quadrilogy in my opinion, which had a series of soldiers or space Marines or whatever all wear the same uniform, speak and act in the same manner and generally shoot and scream and panic their way out of obligatory action set pieces that would come along every so often.If Alien was a science fiction that fell into the horror subgenre, Aliens was a science fiction that fell into the war subgenre. Alien: Resurrection is a science fiction film that just teeters over into horror meaning its core is taken from Scott's film although it has the elements of war from the second instalment although we never feel the group of protagonists are fit or equipped enough to take on the group of Aliens because of lack of firepower. The film isn't as good as the first one but then again, given the set up Alien had let loose to filmmakers after its release, no film that had been made in the genre by this time was as good.Alien: Resurrection sees a band of space travellers land at the ship hosting events in this edition. Their timing of arrival co-insides with Alien series veteran Ripley (Weaver) getting cloned for the purpose of extracting the Alien queen inside of her by the nasty, greed driven guys in surgical suits. Little does everyone know, the ship is an experimentation lab of horror and soon their own fates will be rendered ambiguous when some of the Aliens break out. The set up sounds similar to the following year's Deep Rising, itself a film about a group of 'bad' people who hijack a large mode of transportation, that time it was a cruise liner on the open sea, just as the anti-human element of the piece decides to strike. Rest assured, it's a lot better than Deep Rising.So the set up is one thing but the real meat of the film sees these rouge space travellers, of whom include Ron Perlman's Johner and Winona Ryder's Annalee Call as well as heroine of the hour Ripley fight and fend their way off the ship to safety. This is where it could be argued the film slips into ""Aliens"" territory in the sense it's a bunch of characters on a ship, with guns, trying to get the hell out of there. So the question is, what's wrong with that? It's not as if the films descends into out and out chaos complete with choppy editing and dodgy one-liners, more so a more calm and drawn out exercise in travelling to a certain location and weathering the storm. The group must deal with underwater travel, the problem in dealing with a character in a wheelchair and how all these elements might affect them.But it's the character of Annalee Call that garners most of the attention, not least for the twist that arises to do with her. As a character, she is the voice of reason; she is the audience within the film, stating things and saying things aloud we might say or questions we might ask. At one point she stops Ripley from killing one of the ship's lab technicians after the grizzly hybrid findings in the laboratory; instead, she beat the official following Annalee's interruption and the audience perhaps feels relieved there is no blood shed between humans within the human prism of the human-nonhuman-antihuman triangle. Similarly, when it arises the ship automatically negates itself back to planet Earth following a revelation Annalee is there to once again announce, out loud that ""we should blow the ship up."" There's a beat between her (and us) hearing this information before her reacting during which time some audiences members might have already come to the conclusion she announces out loud.So while the film isn't brilliant, it is far from the disaster its reputation embeds it with. The film is a little bit of the previous three moulded into one but with a European director at the helm stamping his own mark on proceedings and allowing new ideas such as the hybrid monster at the end to step up. With hindsight, it's a far cry better than the path the producers took the franchise down most recently; that being Alien vs. Predator and more-so its respective sequel.",Alien - Resurrection
56,johnnyboyz,"Some interesting ideas, but falls short in too many departments too often to work",5,24 January 2020,"The annoying thing about ""Alien: Resurrection"" is that it is primarily an action film that comes with the odd scare, rather than an actual horror film which happens to include the odd second-unit set piece. It is additionally lacking in that atmosphere most science fiction films have when they place characters far off into the future or depict events on other planets or in the vast chasm of space. Things here feel more synthetic than the other films, and it makes you appreciate even more what Cameron did in the first sequel when he managed to keep ""Aliens"" genuinely frightening in spite of the heavy artillery its characters had access to.""Resurrection"" unfolds on a heavily guarded space station, a few hours from Earth, in the distant realms of the 23rd century. After the moaning and wailing which greeted the aftermath of the killing off of three beloved characters at the beginning of ""Alien3"", ""Resurrection"" rather curiously opens with the bringing of another one back to life. Look away now if you haven't seen ""Alien3"", but following the death, nay evisceration, of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley, scientists, in a film shot the year of the cloning of Dolly the sheep no less, have managed to recreate her as she was just prior to her decision to extradite herself from this mortal realm. The decision behind this is/was born out of the fact she possessed inside of her a young alien queen, likely the only one in left in existence, at the time of her plunge, which is a shifty organisation's only means of obtaining the spawn of this queen - the likes of which they require for their own ends.The base soon welcomes a motley space-crew who are delivering people in hyper-sleep to the scientists and military personnel while Ripley undergoes the death-roes of her treatment. The gang offer somewhat fertile ground for characterisation - the captain and pilot are in a relationship; Ron Perlman plays the rugged equivalent of a twenty-third century seadog; there's a mechanic in a wheelchair (but wouldn't robotic technology enabling him to walk exist by now?) and a young angelic looking woman named Call (Winona Ryder) who holds her own in the rough, working-man dominated space. Frustratingly, few get beyond a perimeter of stock status.What is additionally curious is that Ripley is not the protagonist per se in this edition; her mannerisms and behaviour, whilst executed flawlessly by Weaver herself who must play someone who is neither human nor animal and, on top of that, artificially created in the first place, are cold; detached and strangely invulnerable - she is not the Ripley of the franchise prior to now and this sits a little uncomfortably. The film, in fact, lacks any kind of presence of a hero around which we might revolve our interest. Much time is spent in the opening act on characters that are removed within minutes of the second, while Weaver plays someone whose arc has already been completed in the other three films when she played out some interesting dynamics with the alien creatures to do with motherhood and fostering children.The Queen they get out of Ripley does what they want and the staff get their aliens on cue, only to see them escape, of course, and wreak havoc on the spaceship, all around the time the transporters come to blows with the marines on board when Call, the one we thought least likely of the crew to start trouble, breaks house rules. Confusingly, the vast army of soldiers already on board abandon the ship at the first sign of a problem, thus calling into question as to what their purpose was in the first place in case of an emergency, and the film beds down into a nice, comfortable groove of depicting an array of people, military personnel included, striving to get to the remaining route off the ship, which is the craft the mercenaries arrived in, which of course is miles away from where anyone begins.I suppose there is an air of unpredictability in who will live and who will die, but this doesn't compensate for much when we realise how poor characterisation has been to this point. To everyone's horror, the mother ship's programming has automatically kicked in, meaning it is in the process of returning to Earth - an odd contingency if you know what you're dealing with on board is as dangerous as it was. There is much talk on concepts of universal brotherhood and sticking together from one character among the band of survivors, but as soon as they realise Earth is the ship's destination and that these animals will probably ravage the planet, making a dangerous detour to try and stop it seems unappealing. Where else did they expect to be able to go if not Earth?""Resurrection"" falls rather a long way short in the pacing and atmosphere stakes - it unfolds on a ship too close to Earth in the first place for it to feel like we're lost in the barren wildernesses of outer space, unlike ""Alien"", and where in Ridley Scott's film the characters had to make up a course of action as they went along as they faced their situation, they plod their way to a fixed destination in this entry, knowing full well a sort of reprieve awaits them when they arrive. What was additionally lost on me was the film's commentary - does it disapprove of the science behind cloning? Is toying with genetics a bad thing? That cross-breeding is a dangerous game? Long after you realise the new addition to the franchise, a giant white mutant, can understand English, it will probably be lost on you too.",Alien - Resurrection

Our fellow Jeunet has better understood this franchise as Fincher but he has to deal with a very awful script (motherly love, a baby Alien???).

The commitment it makes to its own weirdness is certainly noble, but unfortunately it's nearly as stupid as it is bold.

63,Anonymous_Maxine,"""Was it everything you hoped for?""",8,30 May 2008,"Alien Resurrection was released about six months after I graduated from high school, and at the time I wasn't very familiar with the series. I took my first film class about six months later, at which point I learned to really appreciate the great films and filmmakers, and one of the first things I learned was that the first three Alien films are spectacular achievements of science fiction cinema and the third sequel is a sad, ridiculous mess. This happens all too often with sequels and yes, part four is not yet another amazingly impressive Alien film, but come on, it's not THAT bad. I watched it last night for the first time in almost ten years, and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It's strange that I liked it so much, because it shows all the signs of a botched, modernized sequel of a series that should have been left alone long ago. The characters, most of all, are almost all goofy caricatures with preposterous dialogue and routine motivations, and some just don't belong at all. Personally I am a pretty big fan of Winona Ryder, but only in roles that suit her, and she has had a lengthy list of roles that suit her, but Annallee Call in Alien Resurrection is just not one of them. Too often she comes off as a tough talking teenager in this movie and it just gets hard to take her character seriously. She's like Ja Rule in Half Past Dead, but less ridiculous.Then again, this could just have been a result of her starring alongside Sigourney Weaver, and that woman is just awesome. Dan Hedaya is suitably over-the-top in his role as the gleefully neurotic General Perez, and I have to admit that I was curious to see the performance of Gary Dourdan as Christie. Lately I've been watching countless hours of CSI on DVD, and it's amazing to see how different his role is in this movie from the most serious role he would play later in that show. I prefer the later performance, myself.The resurrection implied in the title refers to Ripley being borough back to life 200 years after her death for the purpose of creating one of the alien queens, and then breeding the animals for twisted scientific purposes. They decide to keep Ripley alive for observation after surgically removing the alien from her chest, only to discover that she and the aliens are clearly more than they are prepared to handle. There is a negligible subplot involving a group of shady characters headed by the wonderfully sinister Michael Wincott as a Frank Elgyn, who promises his men won't start trouble or get into any fights if they are allowed to stay on board for a few days and nights. I also have to mention Ron Perlman, who just has a face for this kind of movie. Probably most recognizable lately as Hellboy, this has to be one of the least appreciated actors of the last few decades. In just over 20 years he has acted in more than 150 films and TV shows, and at the time of this writing he has 18 projects in the works. Unbelievable! He also has one of the best lines in the movie (""Why the waste of ammo?! Must be a chick thing"").The aliens are probably the thing that will make or break this movie, and in my opinion they were impressive enough. The occasional CGI effects are never convincing, but then again they never are, so luckily they didn't overdo them. Even the aliens swimming underwater was not too much for me to accept, perhaps given the automatic tension that is immediately generated in almost any movie where someone has to hold their breath for a long time. This went on far too long to be anything remotely realistic in this movie, but it was a good scene nonetheless. I would also argue that this is the goriest of all of the four alien movies, particularly at the end, but also contains some of the best comic relief. This combination makes the movie highly entertaining, even following in the long shadows of its spectacular predecessors. There is a high energy scene in the third act of the film where Perlman's character performs a daredevil stunt to shoot one of the pursuing aliens dead which is followed by what has to be the funniest spider killing in film history. I haven't laughed out loud like that at a movie in a long, long time. In browsing through the posts on the message board for Resurrection I have been inspired to raise my rating for the movie from a 7 to an 8, if only because it is so obvious that everyone is jumping on the bandwagon about bashing this movie. I see nothing but whiny, pouting little brats whimpering and griping about little nitpicky details in the movie, condemning the third sequel in the Alien quadrilogy as a travesty and an embarrassment and a pathetic way to end the series. Stupid people in large numbers, man. It's sad to see such a clear mob mentality slamming a movie that is about 100 times better than most people say. No, it's not up to the same level as the first two films and it definitely has its drawbacks, but it is definitely a good installment in the series, and you could certainly do a lot worse for some fun popcorn sci-fi on a Friday night. I'll admit that my judgment might be a little skewed because I watched the staggeringly awful Eaten Alive just before seeing this, but it is clear to me that Alien: Resurrection has yet to receive the respect it deserves.",Alien - Resurrection
64,imseeg,The Monster's Mother,7,28 March 2018,"Accidentally stumbled into Alien 4 (Resurection). Remembered it as a watered down version. But I enjoyed it beyond expectations, although the ending seems a little cheap. Maybe they ran out of money because the special effects at the end are somewhat cheesy, but as a whole Alien 4 has almost the same energy and feel as Alien 2 (Aliens). The acting is particularly good in Alien 4. Better than in 2 and 3. I loved the stereotyped characters. The music is glorious as it should be. The effects are deliberately scaled down to gritty and dark, which is the way I like it. The first half of this movie is just as in the other versions the best part, because of the building up of the suspense. However once the monsters are beginning to attack it sort of demystifies the suspense and the action is not as well visually portrayed as has been done before, probably caused by the studios refusal to invest more money. This was a shock for the director who expected a bigger budget. But if you can look past some very cheap backsets and cheap explosions than the action, story and acting are enjoyable.Alien 4 was co produced by Sigourney Weaver so it is safe to assume she has had some influence on the story. She always had said before that she wanted to ""mate"" with the monster in another sequel. And that ""mating"" with the monster is what makes Alien 4 so special. Sigourney Weaver has become the mother of the monsters in Alien 4. Alien 4 has got some great humoristic oneliners that wouldnt look bad in an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. The jokes are good so they add to the general funny feel of this Alien version.All in all a very enjoyable light Alien version but certainly not the best. But I like it more than Alien 3. Too bad for the cheap ending otherwise this 4th sequel could have been as enjoyable as some of the other editions.",Alien - Resurrection
65,FiendishDramaturgy,Superior to Alien 3,8,22 January 2005,"While this is commonly thought of as the weaker installment of this line, personally, I believe it to be superior to Alien 3 in many important ways.200 years after Ripley's death, she is cloned and brought back to life. The cloning process, however, also involved the DNA of the Alien Queen, giving her superhuman powers and abilities. After several failed attempts, they finally make good with a humanoid Ripley/Queen with superior intelligence and talents.According to the Making of documentary, this installment was very unlike the disorganized mess which was Alien 3 in that this attempt was together and ready to go a year before they actually started shooting. The story was polished and perfected, and was a unique and creative story in comparison. It was a big script in Hollywood. The buzz about it was that it had elements which made it a worthwhile successor to the first two, completely ignoring the third installment all together.Alien: Resurrection takes the Alien franchise to places fans would never have dreamed, without compromising the key elements of the Alien world, and does it successfully.The studios did not want a typical Hollywood popcorn movie to be part of this franchise, and therefore hired Jean-Pierre Jeunet (City of Lost Children, if you can dig it) to bring in a unique interpretive eye to the direction of this project. His visual style is quite distinct and permeates this work in a pro-active way. It was, perhaps, the most shrewd move Fox could have made in that his unique perspective was the single-most saving factor of this attempt.The action sequences are quite rousing, the story here is once again solid and convincing, and the performances are still the top row quality you expected from this line. The fight sequences are well choreographed and executed; beautifully done, as is the rest of this movie. While I cannot rate it as high as I did the first two, it is obviously superior to Alien 3 in all ways that matter.It rates a 7.9/10 from...the Fiend :.",Alien - Resurrection
66,bsmith5552,Slime Gentlemen Please!,6,13 September 2003,"""Alien Resurrection"" is the fourth and final (to date) installment of the alien series starring Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. This episode was directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. The story takes place 200 years after ""Alien 3"". A military ship commanded by renegade General Perez (Dan Hedaya) has replaced ""The Company"" in trying to capture and ""tame"" the alien creatures. two doctors (J.E. Freeman, Brad Dourif) have managed to clone Ripley from a DNA sample complete with an alien creature in her body. After they remove the creature the cloned Ripley begins to exhibit unusual powers. A pirate freighter arrives on board with a cargo to be used in the cloning experiments. The freighter is led by Elgyn (Michael Wincott) and includes among others, Call (Winona Ryder) who has her own reasons for being there and macho tough guys Johner (Ron Perlman) and Christie (Gary Dourdin). One of the crew is an advanced android, but who? By now the alien creature has matured and multiplied and wouldn't you know it, escapes captivity and begins to wreak havoc. The creatures rack up a pretty gruesome body count before the film's climax. There's lots of blood and gore and slime (perhaps too much) and brutal murders to go around. The film's climax is a little hard to believe but hey, this IS science fiction. Not the best of the series but a treat for those who enjoy blood and gore.",Alien - Resurrection
67,generationofswine,An Honest Review,1,23 December 2018,"I can't believe how the Alien franchise has been politicized in two directions by the same side of the political debate.I pointed out Ripley as an example of a strong female lead that everyone loves, and that got me the ire of the intersectional crowd. It's not politically correct to like Ripley when you have worse and more modern strong female leads.But, I really didn't like ""Alien: Resurrection"" and that earned me the wrath of the exact same people!!!!So, I guess the basic rule of thumb is that you are only supposed to like the bad movies to be politically correct?I don't know how it works.For those of you that are rational, ""Alien: Resurrection"" stinks. For starters, Ripley is supposed to be dead. Bringing her back the way they did, well, that's not only an insult to us fans that love her, but to Ripley as well.Seeing her like that left a sour taste in my mouth.And though I always loved and will likely always love both Winona Ryder and Ron Perlman, and though they did as good of a job as they could...they couldnt act their way around a horrible script and a terrible premise.You can't blame the actors for this nightmare. You can see that they are actually trying to salvage something from the mess. In the end, you have to blame it on the fact that this is an Alien movie that no one asked for, and it's a plot that should never have been.In 1997 this movie was trash. In 2018, however, it's fresh air considering the Alien movies we have now. But still, I'm giving it the 97 rating.it was over at 3, no need to insult a stellar franchise.",Alien - Resurrection

After three dark films that all looked like they were set in the same universe, Alien Resurrection went in a different direction because of Joss Whedon's distinct style of dialogue and Jean-Pierre Jeunet unusual visions. The characters did not feel anything like they were in the previous films and it wasn't as funny and fun as it thought it was. There were some good moments like how the Aliens escape captivity and Ripley killing the failed clones. It was the embarrassing sequel in the Alien series that should be locked in a cupboard.",Alien - Resurrection
69,Polaris_DiB,"Well, okay then...",8,1 September 2006,"*Sigh*... and here is where I ruin all of the other reviews I've written, all of any objective respectability, and imagined audience I probably didn't have in the first place.I liked it. A lot. In fact I think it's the best film in the series.Outrage! Horror! How could he say that when he says Alien 3 is terrible! I can say it because this movie is fun, it's very visually amazing, and best of all, it's complete. Joss Whedon has done an excellent job with this, something most people didn't notice probably because they were too distracted by Winona Ryder's terrible acting and the huge change in Ripley's character, along with a good ol' fashioned distrust of modern sequels, to notice that he has tied together some open threads that have existed basically from the very beginning.The thing I want to remark upon, that is, stress very importantly, is that Ripley's life throughout the Alien films is very horrible. It's an obvious assessment, but so obvious it's not often noted. She literally exists, by this film, to fight the aliens... there's almost no other purpose to her life. In fact her past is utterly removed at this point. She and the aliens have become a continuing conflict of good and evil, and it's gone so far that she's literally become a part of the alien world. So Whedon actually makes her an alien and the aliens a part of her. It's brilliant, really.Secondly, I think this film is a lot of fun. Ron Perlman and Dominique Pinon, Jeunet regulars, make wonderful supporting characters to Sigourney Weaver's new interpretation of the cynically stuck Ripley, the Ripley who went from androgynous to motherly to nihilist to an almost perfect conglomeration of all three in this last film. Other supporting actors are very well-placed too, such as the guy from The Crow and Dan Hedaya.Jeunet's visual activity is in full force here as well. I have to laugh and admit that it's completely over the top... and yet with the excellent cast it makes it more fun than the action bonanza of the second and more interesting than the brooding nihilism of the third. There's no attempt to be the first one with psychological horror. There's no attempt to be the second one with masses of aliens everywhere. There's just a defining compromise: a dozen of them. And mystery as to what their motivations, at this point, really are.There's a lot that needn't be in here, too much. It's too modern, the alien/human hybrid at the end is pretty ridiculous (though I still think a good continuation of what has been happening between Ripley and the aliens), too much modern fear of cloning, and too many characters trying to be ""bad-ass"". I can understand entirely why people hate this movie so. But I still think it's really good.It also has the perfect ending to the series. Ripley returns to Earth, and it's at this point that it should be noted: we have never seen Earth throughout all of the movies, and yet the whole reason why Ripley seems to exist is to protect it. It's transcendent, it's remarkable, and it's a beautiful scene. Remember that this is four hundred years and four stases since Ripley left Earth merely as a cargo carrier. She's been through a lot, and now look what she's become... This is why I think this is a really good movie.Bring on the neggies. I guess I deserve it.--PolarisDiB",Alien - Resurrection
70,kevin_robbins,This is a movie I'm not sure they needed to make but isn't a complete waste of time either,6,9 November 2021,"Alien Resurrection (1997) is in my DVD collection and is also available on Tubi. The storyline follows Ripley being reincarnated as a drone on a ship doing testing on Alien DNA. After the ship loses control of the aliens onboard the survivors will need to rely on Ripley if they hope to escape the ship alive. This movie is directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Amelie) and stars Sigourney Weaver (Ghostbusters), Winona Rider (Beetlejuice), Ron Pearlman (Hellboy), Brad Dourif (Dune), Raymond Cruz (Training Day) and Gary Dourdan (Thursday). The storyline for this is fairly terrible with a mix of some good sequences and some cheesy ones. Some of the science fiction elements are cool and there's some great kills and gore. However, the basketball scene is pretty cheesy and the overall premise is disappointing. The ending of this movie always felt terrible and the new alien concept was horrible.

71,dee.reid,The resurrection of a popular series,10,4 December 2002,"Let's recap.The first alien film, which was directed by Ridley Scott is the film that started it all.  Scott's direction was sharp and ""Alien"" had the most tension-filled setting of the series and it brought to life a truly horrifying creature.  But that was twenty-three years ago.  ""Alien"" since it was released in 1979, has become seriously dated and seems to have lost some of its potency.""Aliens"", which was directed by James Cameron, is the most well-known film in the series and the most successful.  This time instead of Ripley going up against one alien, she must now go up against an entire nest of the deadly creatures, but with the help of a few good marines added to the bunch.  The ultimate question was of course, would excellent firepower be enough to combat the aliens?  Cameron focused a lot on action and tension, which transformed ""Aliens"" into a war movie of sorts.  I liked ""Aliens"" the most and hasn't lost any of its ability to still shock its audience.""Alien 3"", directed by David Fincher, is the most underrated of the series. Fincher changed the series by doing something new with it by adding his trademark dark settings to the film.  Instead of continuing the trend that was pioneered by James Cameron, he went back to step one, while still taking the series in a new direction.  He created one of the most dark and depressing horror films ever brought to life.  Though for some odd reason, audiences missed that entirely.  Fincher had originally intended the film to be much longer and with more character development, but executives at Fox had cheated him out of his own vision by removing most of said footage.Now we have ""Alien: Resurrection"", released in 1997 and directed by acclaimed French film maker Jean-Pierre Jeunet.  Set two-hundred years after the events of ""Alien 3"", Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been cloned from a sample of her DNA and must continue her ongoing fight with the deadly alien this time with the help of a group of futuristic space pirates and a mysterious woman named Call (Winona Ryder).  It goes without saying that Jeunet is a visual genius.  He has a real sense of bringing life into his scenes and giving the movie a fantastic look.  The gore here is pretty extreme and some scenes will certainly make your skin crawl, turning the movie into a freak show of sorts.  But that could ultimately be what Jeunet was trying to do, I'm not quite sure.  That is no reason to hate this film however.  An excellent addition to the series that is not to be missed.",Alien - Resurrection

73,JoeB131,Mixed feelings about this film.,5,30 January 2012,"How can so many good people be involved in such a train wreck? This had a lot of good actors in it. Sigourney is back, they have Winona Ryder, Gary Dourdan, Brad Douriff, and even Ron Perleman is properly cast for a change. The writer is Josh Whedon, who would later go on to delight us with Firefly.Side note. Notice how the crew of the Betty seems to be rough drafts of the Serenity Crew? You have the sweet girl with a secret, the tough guy who hurts people and the warrior babe. Throw in a preacher and a prostitute, and it would have been feeling like old times. So anyway, through the magic of cloning an a co-producer credit for Sigourney, Ellen Ripley is back from the dead. Except this time, they kind of got the alien and human DNA mixed up. So Ripley has alien acid blood and the alien Queen has a womb.I really think the problem is in the direction. You have this French director who managed to screw everything up, because he didn't realize he was directing an American film. The first time I realized something was wrong was when the Dan Hedaya character gets a crazy look on his face when they explain to him that the Ripley Clone might have memories.There are a lot of other scenes in the film that just seem odd or out of place.Whedon's script is actually pretty decent, if it was better directed and they didn't make some of the acting choices they made.

Where a rogue military organization sourced her blood samples, not to mention how they also managed to duplicate the queen xenomorph incubating in her torso, well, let's just try not to think about that. The screenplay certainly doesn't.Whatever the scientific explanation, it isn't foolproof. Both Ripley and the alien are imperfect replicas, each retaining bits and pieces of the other (temper, blood type, reproductive cycle) like a space-bound version of The Fly. Predictably, this experiment soon leads to disaster and we get back to the usual territory: Sigourney Weaver, sprinting through dim hallways and firing bulky weapons, en route to the last remaining escape vessel.Screenwriter Joss Whedon (I know, I was surprised too) apparently intended this as a tongue-in-cheek take on the sci-fi genre, territory which he'd soon explore in Firefly and Serenity, and was aghast to see everything played so straight in the final film. I don't think the Alien franchise is a great place to experiment with that kind of tonal shift, but yes, Resurrection shouldn't be a source of pride. It has strengths - the special effects, for example, are a marked improvement over the last film - but they're quickly overshadowed by the rudimentary plot, repulsive climax and hammy, made-for-TV acting. That last point is surprising, given the big names in the cast. We've got Ron Perlman and Winona Ryder, in addition to Weaver and a bunch of seasoned supporting players; they just can't work any magic with this brand of stiff dialogue and cruddy genre tropes.

The premise of the film sees 200 years after alien 3 Ripley is found and cloned including the alien inside of her. Her and a team of mercenaries attempt to escape a facility fro! These cloned xenomorphes. Sigourney weaver legitimately only returned as Ripley for this film because she was offered a ridiculous amount of money. It clearly shows, as she gives a pretty bad performance in this film and I hated the fact that they decided to use her character in this film after the events of the previous film. The supporting cast at least has some recognisable faces in it, Winona Ryder plays call and she is just ridiculously bland in this movie. She adds very little to her character and you really won't care about her or anybody else in this movie. Ron perlman is in this film and he does add a little bit of charisma and entertainment but even he is a joke in this film and just spouts stupid one liners. The rest of the cast are just cliché and dull which will make you check out. The story in this film has absolutely nothing to it, it feels like a really bad pale imitation of alien mixed with a bit of alien 3 and there is nothing unique here which makes you think why was this film even made. The script has nothing really special to it and absolutely nothing memorable to it whatsoever which is poor when you consider the great alien films. The style of the film is pretty awful, the action scenes are really poorly filmed and even though it is better then alien 3 I really didn't like the design of the aliens in this film especially towards the end of the film.

76,MaxBorg89,"In space, no one can hear you scream...",6,16 May 2007,"... in rage! Alien 3 was supposed to end the saga, but since they wanted to make more money, Fox decided to make another sequel. Only problem: how were they going to do it? As you may remember, David Fincher's underrated third installment ended with Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) sacrificing herself to put an end to the alien threat for ever. As there can't be an Alien film without Weaver (and those who have seen Alien vs. Predator know it), something had to be done to bring her back convincingly. Hence Alien: Resurrection.Taking place 200 years after the events of the third film, Resurrection solves the death issue in the most original way: cloning. That's right, the movie opens with a group of scientists finally succeeding, after seven disastrous attempts, in creating a perfect copy of Ripley. While the people involved in the experiment are thrilled, the crew of the Betty (a spaceship that stopped by for supplies) are not as excited. It does not take long to figure out why: the scientists' real purpose was to revive the Alien Queen that was inside Ripley at the time of her death, and use the offspring as biological weapons. And when the creatures start spreading terror and death, everyone realizes that maybe it wasn't such a good idea.To be fair, the premise was not that bad: the idea of a cloned Ripley and the conspiracy regarding the aliens could have been awesome, if used correctly. Which is something neither writer Joss Whedon (who usually is a terrific storyteller, as Buffy and Angel prove) nor director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (yes, the same guy who did a masterwork like Amélie) know how to do. While the production design is superb and the special effects are generally good (with the exception of the hideous ""Newborn"" alien), the suspense and claustrophobia that made the first three movies unique are gone. What was meant to be a blend of sci-fi and horror is turned into a straight-out action flick, complete with loud guns, lame dialogue (maybe Whedon was suffering from writer's block in that period) and lousy characterizations: apart from Weaver, who does her usual job with finesse, and Ron Perlman, who plays a rude-yet-charismatic scumbag, no one is able to add something extra to a bunch of disposable, two-dimensional stereotypes, not even a clearly miscast Winona Ryder, who seems to have lost all the charm and intensity she had in the likes of Heathers and Edward Scissorhands.Once again, the law of diminishing returns has been confirmed: aside from a few inspired moments early into the film, Alien: Resurrection is the most disappointing movie in the series. While Ridley Scott, James Cameron and David Fincher's contributions knew what they were aiming at and hit the target, Jeunet's franchise-closer doesn't even know where to aim.5,5/10",Alien - Resurrection

There will be a good 'humane' robot in one of the crew and eventually the alien will only die by vacuuming in space.Also I am not able to understand one thing. Why the alien kills people when it doesn't eat them.Acting is similar like the previous movies. Screenplay is also similar as alien releases from containment starts killing people and eventually gets vacuumed in space.Watch this movie if you are a die hard fan of this franchise or you like alien movies as nothing is new in the movie.",Alien - Resurrection
79,lukem-52760,My All Time Favourite Of The Franchise Is A MASTERPIECE.,10,12 August 2020,"I grew up watching & loving Aliens like everyone else, i loved Ripley in that outstanding sequel & the Queen Alien & Bishop & Hicks & Hudson all fantastic bits to a Classic movie but when the 4th Alien movie came out in 1997 called Alien: Resurrection i fell in love with it!!!This movie introduced me to Awesome Ron Perlman.The underwater scenes are Outstanding.Alien Resurrection is my favourite of the whole franchise & that's because i think it looks Amazing & i love the whole gritty-grimy Space Scavenger style this film has. The group of battle-worn Smugglers are fantastic characters, especially the legendary Ron Perlman as ""Johner"" the big tough & scarred warrior of the rag-tag team. Now i gotta say I'm a huge Ron Perlman fan & that's because of his Awesome character & performance here in Resurrection, after this flick i discovered Ron again in the excellent t.v movie Primal Force & again Ron was great on screen & then he disappeared for a while or he did to me as he didn't pop up in any of the movies i was watching until the excellent sequel Blade 2 & once again Ron stole the show, Perlman was fantastic in that sequel & was even better than Wesley Snipes as Blade!!! Blade 2 was even better than the first film & that's because it was way better directed by Guillermo Del Toro & because of the presence of Ron Perlman.But the great Ron Perlman aside, Resurrection is beautifully created with stunning production design that looks ridiculously detailed & rich in texture. The look & Cinematography is dark & smokey & Sigourney Weaver is great as usual & i really like Raymond Cruz who has a good part in this slimy, violent & action-packed Sci-fi Horror-Thriller, also the creature effects are incredible, really slimy & gory-as-hell special effects that make this the scariest of the franchise & the best.Legendary Sigourney Weaver is excellent as the new version of Ripley & gives a more sinister performance & the great Winona Ryder is excellent too in a sympathetic & delicate role. All actor's give it a classy ensemble structure & created a bunch of interesting characters. The movie has a very dark atmosphere & feels scary & almost dreamlike or Nightmarish I'm not sure which lol but it's a unique feel created by the extremely visionary Director Jean-Pierre & his incredible cinematographer Darius Khondji, a real otherworldly french flavour in this Masterpiece.""Resurrection"" is so richly textured & detailed that the sets look real, aged & always interesting to look at, this movie is a work of Art that alot of creativity went into its making & crafted a scarily, dark space-set Horror Thriller.Really this horrific, disturbing & relentlessly gruesome sci-fi Horror is a work of dark gothic art, just look at the sets, the design, the practical effects, the colour pallet & the detail in everything on screen, i can't believe how underrated this is? Too much to love.The music is moody & exciting & some of the set-pieces are the best of the franchise such as the flooded-under water scene that is amazing, exciting, scary & suspenseful & the fantastic sequences where their all climbing a huge ladder & Perlman has to grip his legs in the steps & leans back upside-down & starts blasting Aliens that are following them!!! Best scene in the whole movie & franchise!!! Thank you Ron.Ridiculously underrated but definitely the most creative, exciting & brilliant of the whole Alien franchise in my opinion, a misunderstood Masterpiece.",Alien - Resurrection
80,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Very underrated. Unique, expressionistic Sci Fi at its best.",10,24 March 2016,"To this day it still amazes me how under appreciated and misunderstood Alien Resurrection is. The four films in the series are a quartet of vastly different stories, due to the fact that the torch was passed to four very diverse directors over the course of the legacy. Ridley Scott crafted a tense, claustrophobic catalyst. James Cameron made a rootin, tootin Wild Bunch set in a galaxy far far away where no one can hear you scream. David Fincher gave us an odd, inaccessibly disturbing thriller where the real monsters lurked inside the humans, literally. French Maestro Jean-Pierre Jeunet, best known for his own charmingly surreal quartet of distinctly European wonders Amelie, A Very Long Engagement, City Of Lost Children and Delicatessen, made the final film in the franchise. I once saw a post on IMDb which prompted users to describe each of the Alien films in one word. The one response that stuck with me was: Alien-suspense, Aliens-action, Alien3- unpleasant and Alien Resurrection-weird. Is this accurate? Depends on your opinion of the series. Resurrection is my second favourite, after Aliens. To some it was weird, to many a failure, but to me it's a bona fide, rip roaring odyssey of gorgeous, gory design and offbeat ideas fleshed out by an absolutely legendary cast, headed up by Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. Two hundred years after she died, she is cloned using parts of the Xenomorph's DNA, and kept sequestered on a titanic pseudo military ship run by whackos who have never heard of a certain expression involving curiosity and a cat. She awakens, the alien genes giving her a decidedly heightened awareness which Weaver plays with giddy, sinister glee. This ain't the stalwart Ripley we are used to. Her eyes dance with an unearthly fire that pronounces 'here be dragons', in the spaces beyond science that humans foolishly venture into. The station is run by creepy, power hungry Dr. Mason Wren (underrated J.E. Freeman is almost ickier than the monsters themselves), and his sidekick Gediman, played by Brad Dourif in his final form, resembling a demented Pokemon who also raises more goosebumps than the aliens. The good doctor has commissioned a ragtag troupe of space pirates to bring him kidnapped humans in cryogenic sleep to be forcefully impregnated with alien fetuses. Lovely, right? This is where it gets interesting. Joss Whedon penned the script, and the crew of intergalactic badasses in this film are in fact the prototype for his endlessly successful TV series Firefly. Now, he claims that everything about the tone, delivery and execution of this film is wrong, and that the end result butchered his work. Here's my take: I've seen Firefly. It's good. But the team of space pirates in this movie are eternally more fascinating and worth spending time with. I feel that he really abandoned part of a great premise here, opting for a chipper, watered down version of a vision which presented itself to him and begged for further exploration. Firefly is fun, and it's characters are a veritable Partridge Family of interplanetary characters to chill with, but it lacks the steel edged nastiness and grit that he began with here. Michael Wincott is a blast as the captain, Frank Elgyn, in a role that's cut entirely too short but is aces while it lasts. Ron Perlman is a primate on earth and proves the same in space as Johner, the lovable lug of the crew. Gary Dourdan, the only black dude I know with blue eyes is Christie, with more than a few high powered tricks up his sleeves. Jeunet disciple Dominique Pinon plays wheelchair bound Riess, a tougher cookie than one might imagine. Lastly, Winona Ryder is Call, a doll with a pixie cut who takes an immediate shine to Ripley, leading them both to dark and dangerous places. Dan Hedaya makes lively work of Perez, the military honcho in charge, with Raymond Cruz, Kim Flowers and a shrieking Leland Orser rounding out the dream cast. As one might expect, all hell breaks loose in outer space as the creatures breed and hunt anything in their proximity. This provides loose cannon Jeunet with reason to fire off many a special effect that will give your gag reflex a workout and your pulse a solid pounding. There's seriously gnarly stuff here, especially near the end with a certain terrifying monster of an alien hybrid that acts as pure nightmare fuel while also being a bucket of fun at the same time. One of Whedon's complaints was that his lighthearted script was given the heavy treatment, which obviously clashed with the vision he had. Fair enough. It was his baby after all. But for me though, it works bettering he ever planned. The characters maintain a sense of gallows humour laced with very real danger, garnished with cheeky levity in the face of unimaginable horror. That's a good recipe to follow in any book I can think of. This one is ripe for redemption, certainly in the eyes of many who panned it upon release, and always ready for a revisit from myself.",Alien - Resurrection
81,davispittman,Better than Alien 3,7,18 September 2016,"I will say that alien resurrection is better than its predecessor, Alien 3. But it is not nearly as great as aliens, no other Alien movie will be, because it is incredible in ever way. This movie once again, stars Sigourney weaver, and co stars Winona Ryder. I really loved Winona Ryder here, I loved her character and how she played that character. Sigourney is good here as usual, well, her character is very different in this final movie, Ripley is a clone, the real human Ripley is of course dead. So, at the beginning, I wasn't really enjoying her character because she is just so empty and hollow. But as the movie goes on, her character gets better and becomes more real, which is good. The action here is pretty good, again, it'll never compare to aliens, but it's still pretty nice. If you cannot stand gore, then you may wanna think twice about seeing this movie, or see it edited, the bloodshed in this film is a good bit stronger than in the previous ones. I do think they took the goriness too far in a few scenes towards the end. But I did love the ending, the newborn was very cool looking and I think the effects were very good looking during the birth scene, the effects throughout were nicely done. But dealing with the birth scene in particular, the effects NEEDED to be top notch, and they definitely were, that scene was just very cool looking and interesting. So overall, the acting is pretty good, the writing suffices, and the action/effects work. Not the best in the franchise, but certainly not the worst. 7/10 for alien resurrection.",Alien - Resurrection
82,hu675,This silly but interesting odd-ball sequel to the Alien Series is quite entertaining.,8,5 September 2006,"200 years later... Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been brought back though the magic of DNA, because Ripley killed herself by destroying the Alien Queen inside of her. The Military Scientists (J.E. Freeman and Brad Dourif) decides to keep her alive and wanting the Alien for their weapons/science division. When a team of space pirates (Winona Ryder, Ron Pearman, Dominique Pinon, Gary Dourdan, Kim Flowers and Michael Wincott) arrived in a military space station. Which these space pirates has kidnapped people in their hyper-sleep, which little do they know, they are being killed for the Alien Species. When one of the group discover that Ripley is been brought back to life as a Clone. But this clone Ripley has an different side to her, which she's now half human/half alien. Once again, Ripley has to deal with the Aliens again but now she has to face also a complete different Alien is waiting to be born.Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Amélie, The City of the Lost Children, A Very Long Engagement) made a complete different sequel to the Alien Series. Jeunet's strange visual style and his sometimes humorous black comedy, certainly makes this one, the oddest of the four films. Which is somewhat uneven with the director's french sensibilities crossed with American mainstream film-making cinema. Weaver gives an complete, different and interesting performance as the clone Ripley. Which as Usual, she's very good in the film. One of the serious flaws in this sequel is the third act, especially the newborn Alien is a bit of a letdown. Although the newborn Alien does have some odd human facials. Which does look like the lead actress in several brief moments.The original DVD has an strong anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD's only extra is the three minute featurette, trailers and a collector's booklet.The latest Two Disc Set is a Collector's Edition. Which this new edition, includes the original theatrical cut and a special alternate cut with the original opening sequence and a slightly different conclusion than runs 8 minutes longer. The DVD has the same Widescreen transfer and Sound (Also included DTS 5.1 Surround Sound). DVD has an entertaining commentary track by the director, cast and crew members. Disc Two has over three hours of featurettes, which they are intriguing. Disc Two also has all the production photos and artwork of the movie.Filmmaker:Jeunet admits that, he's still very proud of the original theatrical cut but with this alternate cut, he got to finish his original opening sequence that sets up the blackish humour of the picture. Some might enjoy this but the real die hard fans of the series will certainly enjoy it. Written by Joss Whedon (Who's best known for creating T.V.

84,gcd70,Hopefully the last,6,27 March 2010,"Big Sig is back (cloned actually) in what I truly hope is the last in the ""Alien"" series. French director Jean Pierre Jeunet helms this time, so the fourth instalment goes a little art-house. The style ends up a lot like a cross between the first three films.Sigourney Weaver is great, though she doesn't really get to be herself, literally. Winona Ryder does not get to do a lot as the surprise packet of the pic. Also stars Jeunet regular Ron Perlman and J.E.

Only here does ""Alien Resurrection"" inspire.Another sequel consigned to the shadows.Sunday, January 31, 1999 - Video",Alien - Resurrection
85,Agent10,"the weakest in the series, but still had its moments",6,5 May 2002,"Obviously, all of the problems experienced in pre-production doomed this film. While the trippy nature of the film was intriguing, it was lacking in so many areas (I mean, how big is this ship where you have to run for seemingly hours to get from one point to the other). Anyhow, this film needed a few more drafts in the script, and it was obvious Winona Ryder phoned in her performance. However, the lighting, cinematography, CGI and editing was excellent. Even the aliens looked better than ever. Sadly, nothing else exceeded any expectations.",Alien - Resurrection
86,davidmvining,"Kinda works as a comedy, but only kinda",5,26 November 2019,"This is the first movie in the Alien franchise that makes no attempt to be a horror film. Instead, it's a blackly comic action movie, and I think it sort of works. Sort of.There's a lot of handwaving away of certain practical elements like the source of DNA used to clone Ripley, or how her DNA includes the DNA of the alien, or how, if they had both, they couldn't just clone the alien and not Ripley. But, hey! If they don't do this, then there's no movie! So, handwaving is somewhat appropriate.What that creates is a character that looks like Ripley but is not actually her. There's talk about her inheriting the original Ripley's memories (through some handwaving), but there's never really an exploration of Ripley dealing with the fact that she's not really Ripley. She just kind of becomes a more badass version of Ripley because she's got some alien traits now. This could be an interesting place to start Ripley. She's new, not quite the same, not quite sure of who she is or what her new relationship with the aliens is. But, she's lost in the movie.The plot of the film is standard Alien stuff. A shady organization (the military this time) wants to capture the alien and use it for its own purposes, but the alien cannot be controlled and runs amok. At the center are a group of working class people who have to find a way to fight back and escape the enclosed space they are trapped in with the antagonistic aliens. All of the Alien movies have this basic plot, so it's hard to hold that against the fourth entry.The single largest problem with the movie is the fact that it tries to be an ensemble piece, but it's a grand 108 minutes long with extended action sequences. That's not a lot of time to spend with the array of characters that Joss Whedon wrote and Jean-Pierre Jeunet created as the writer and director. Ripley gets lost among the other characters like General Perez, Call, Dr. Gediman, and Vriess. You would expect the movie to cull the herd like the rest of the franchise does, but a shocking number of characters survive to the end, further muddying the waters. Cutting the cast down from the beginning, or killing off a lot more at the start of the mayhem, may have allowed a bit of narrative clarity that the movie as it stands currently lacks.Where this movie shines is in how it embraces weirdness and black humor. Reactions to deaths, odd designs, and Dan Hedaya's entire performance provide regular, if intermittent, comedic value to a movie that would otherwise be rather dreary. Ripley's own complete nihilism is a good source for some laughs as well, though her sudden scene of attempted pathos when she comes across the seven previous attempts at clones falls flat in comparison.Probably my favorite bit of weirdness, though, comes near the end. Long after the Queen taken from Ripley's chest has laid a series of eggs that have birthed facehuggers that have subsequently impregnated human subjects with xenomorphs (this life cycle is complex), we discover that the Queen isn't actually laying eggs anymore. There's no real explanation for the change, but we do get the magnificent image of an alien Queen laid back with her legs spread wide and a giant womb that births a weird alien human hybrid. I do not understand how that image could have ever been intended as something serious. It's just simply way too out there and bizarre for that. It has to be an attempt at absurdist humor, and I embrace it as such. The design of the hybrid seems like a reasonably logical extension of the idea, but it's still so thoroughly off-putting (especially that little upturned nose at the end of its snout) that it feels like poorly executed weirdness.The action scenes are reasonably well executed, but the only one that really stands out is the underwater chase. I suppose it stands out most because it's unlike anything in the franchise up to that point and it's the first one that includes a fully CGI (and rather well done) xenomorph that moves swiftly through the water. There's no real terror to the image, though. The movie embraces the visceral nature of the beast but never really tries to make it scary.Still, the movie's a mixed bag. I appreciate the humor and some of the design, but I find the story overall confused and the rest of the design uninspired or off-putting. It's not the complete disaster some people make it out to be. If it weren't funny, I'd agree, but those chuckles I get through the film carry it quite a bit.",Alien - Resurrection
87,nycritic,Out of Gas and Nowhere to Go,5,18 February 2006,"It should have ended in 1992 with Ripley's self-sacrificing jump into the pit, clutching the baby alien bursting out from her chest, forever denying science any chances to use this species as a springboard for heinous experiments. But of course, when scientists and corrupt organizations want something they go after it No Matter What and ALIEN: RESURRECTION, like its human villains, ensures that the franchise lives on. Setting the events 200 years in the future, scientists have done wonders with the trace DNA they have found in the pit and have genetically created not only new aliens but hybrids as well: progressive clones to what they will call # 8, whom we know as Ripley. Why, that remains unclear: perhaps because it was necessary to bring Weaver back on board? Not that it matters, in no time she's being trained to speak and act human, and contrived events have her half-battling the aliens kept in captivity, half embracing them. There's not a shred of the old, real Ripley in her: not even when in horror she kills a live clone gone bad and destroys a lab filled with botched experiments. Female angst aside, Jean-Pierre Jeunet manages to make the production look gorgeous and takes the opposite direction that Cameron usually does with his characters: he makes stereotypes behave like they knew what they were and reacted against it with horrible performances. Clever. Winona Ryder plays a fem-bot; Dominique Pinon is a cripple who is actually the strongest of the bunch, Ron Perlman plays a tough guy who is funny, and Gary Dourdan is the black guy who isn't as black as he seems (but gets killed off, if late in the film). Michael Wincott, Kim Flowers, Dan Hedaya, and Brad Davis fill in small roles with no substance. Not a fitting closure to a quadrilogy, but there it is, neatly packaged in your boxed set.",Alien - Resurrection

Featuring Sigourney Weaver along with newcomers Winona Ryder and others, Alien Resurrection combines the action of Aliens with the suspense of Alien to create one of the scariest sci-fi horror movies of 1997, alongside Event Horizon.",Alien - Resurrection
90,lemon_magic,"They gave it a good try, but ""Resurrection"" just doesn't work",5,6 May 2007,"Part of the problem with Alien: Resurrection may be the sheer amount of time that has passed between the first one and this one, and the fact the Alien 3 was such a depressing downer. 20 years is a long time for a movie franchise, and there was no real reason to make another sequel; that they did it anyway betrays the audience's love and respect for the first two movies. ""Alien: Resurrection"" probably looked good on paper: Get a good European director with great credentials (the guy who did ""City Of Lost Children"") who might bring a fresh sensibility to the franchise and take it in a new direction; get Sigourney Weaver to reprise her role as Ripley; get some excellent character actors to back her up (Brad Dourif, Ron Perlman and Micheal Wincott are always interesting to watch no matter what they are doing), and give the characters lots of snark and dry gallows humor to keep the viewer happy between action scenes. But somehow the whole came out less than the sum of its parts I've watched this movie on cable a few times in the last few years, trying figure what went wrong. My conclusion: I think what screws things up is the pacing, the inability of the screenplay that to live up to the idea of a centuries long time lapse, and the portrayal of both the evil Corporation and the military as dim-witted, fumble fingered clods. Two whole centuries have supposedly passed since the last ""Alien"", but apparently the only advances in technology since that movie have been in cloning. (Compare the differences in military technology and air travel between 1797 and 1997). That's a plain failure of imagination. And the Corporation scientists work for 200 years to be able to recreate Ripley and her alien egg, but once they have the aliens they are able to hold them for less than 24 hours before their security measure fail and the aliens infest the ship. That's a failure of respect for the shadowy figures who've been driving this plot's backstory for 20 years. And meanwhile the military has apparently degenerated from hard-core veteran Colonial Marines to a a bunch of wimps who can't handle a bunch of free lance traders on their home ground - and who cut and run the instant there is a problem on their space station. This is completely unlike Alien 1,2 and 3 where the Corporation goons are ruthless and powerful and oppressive in its power, and the military personnel are hard-nosed and ruthless xeno-killers who are simply outmatched. That's a failure of nerve, to have to portray the bad guys and soldiers as simps and wimps. IMO. these failures drain the movie of most of its potential gravitas. Instead of being horrified and angered by the sheer ruthlessness and sliminess of the ""suits"" who throw away the human lives for a buck, or dismayed and frightened by the way tough veterans of dozens of campaigns were summarily dispatched, I was angered and irritated by their stupidity and thoughtlessness. In the movie's favor: the rag-tag crew of the Betty are fun to watch in action, and I think the screenwriter is at his best portraying their interaction with each other and Ripley, both before and after the crisis breaks out. Winona Ryder is (surprisingly) the least interesting actor here (not entirely her fault, given the nature of the character), but it was good to see her on-screen again, even in a place holder role like this one. The other problem is the visuals. The movie looked pretty good, but it just didn't have the punch and grandeur of the previous installments; it's as if the scale was simply too small. (Although Alien was pretty claustrophobic in spots, the ""Nostromo"" seemed to go on for miles). Even though I didn't care for Fincher's oppressive visuals on Alien 3, they were at least as striking and memorable as Scott and Cameron's visions in 1 and 2...but visually, A:R is just another science fiction movie. At some point during the making of ""A:R"", I am sure that the director and the producer knew that they had lost the chance to make a great movie in the labyrinth of collaboration and production choices that every movie entails. So they went ahead and put out a flawed one and hoped that no one would notice. Well, everyone noticed, and I'm pretty sure that there won't be another ""Alien"". It's probably just as well.",Alien - Resurrection
91,Rob_Taylor,A good film on the whole and a worthy fourth installment.,9,17 December 2002,"There's something rather sinister about Sigourney Weaver in this fourth installment of the series. She's part alien herself. In a way, this twist is much more interesting than the aliens themselves, which we've all become familiar with by now. The aliens run around, killing people or dragging them off to be hosts for more aliens etc etc... yada yada.But Ripley is new and improved. Pretty much right off I had a certainty that she was not only going to survive, but not even be really tested by the aliens this time. And I wasn't disappointed. She was far more deadly than they were. No the focus became would she side with the humans or aliens. And which of the humans would survive.The rest of the story is pretty standard fare for the series. Foolish humans capture aliens, aliens escape, kill humans, remaining humans fight for survival and a way of escape. Nothing new really.Ron Perlman has a good part, although it's his usual tough guy role, and he has some good scenes. Brad Dourif is just plain creepy as the mad scientist in love with the aliens. That guy scares me! Which goes a long way to saying he's a good actor, I guess.But on the whole the movie is carried by Ripley's character to the extent that you don't care about any of the others, you just want to see what Ripley will do next.Of course, the lame mutant alien at the end is just truly awful and reminded me of one of the muppets from the Muppet Show (without the hair and with more slime, of course) and was just well....crap. Truly worthy of derision.A good film on the whole and a worthy fourth installment.",Alien - Resurrection
92,PredragReviews,"The Good, the bad and the ugly.",6,4 July 2016,"Every Alien installment has had a new director at the helm, also bringing about a new style for the series. While Ridley Scott made a more claustrophobic sci-fi horror, James Cameron went all out and made a big combat movie and David Fincher made a more bleaker film which looked better and more ""arty"". After that film's failure, people thought the series was doomed and wrote it off until a 4th Alien film was announced with Jean-Pierre Jeunet at the helm, director of Delicatessen, City of Lost Children and the later film Amelie. So is it good? Heh... nope. Is there any redeeming quality to it at all? Well let's just say this: you know the film's in trouble when you actually have to think what was good about it.The story... Ripley's blood/DNA, taken from the hospital ward of the prison colony, is used to create a clone of her former self. Aboard a military science vessel, where now the Alien species are being bred by some deranged scientists, a group of smugglers are hired to provide ""bodies"" for these disturbing actions. Sigourney Weaver is haunting and rather creepy as this new Ripley who has Alien DNA and a ""relationship"" with the creatures. Winona Ryder is Call, a renegade and obsolete android who's a recent addition of the space pirates, that get more than they bargained for on this delivery. Fittingly Ripley and Call show the most human character despite their strange background. Most of the other characters are nothing more than bait for the Aliens. Dominique Pinon as the crippled pirate is an exception. Being there are few surprises, this film works better as a Sci-fi/horror adventure film. The story itself is worthy and interesting but underdeveloped. Too much time is spent on the gory attacks. There are too many unnecessary characters as well.The action in this movie wasn't even slightly believable, starting with the shootout between the criminals and the soldiers aboard the ship. At very short range, every soldier is killed and not a single criminal even wounded. Ripley escaped from certain doom on several occasions - I never felt as if she was in any peril at all. Then the action kept coming to a dead stop just when things were getting interesting. For instance, when everyone is in a huge hurry to get off the ship, Ripley decides to stop and wipe out a room full of failed clones. Truly one of those ""Aw, you gotta be kidding me"" moments. The set design and the look of the film though was starting to get better, relying on dim corridors and small lighting, much like the first film. And an action scene involving an underwater set is quite thrilling and the aliens certainly never looked better. But ultimately these are kind of superficial since a great scary experience like Alien or a blast like Aliens is sorely missing here. Overall, this movie is not a worthy sequel to the other films. Even Alien 3 was much better than this - it had loads of atmosphere, characters that one cared about, and you actually felt as if they were in extreme danger.Overall rating: 6 out of 10.",Alien - Resurrection
93,eric262003,Creature Effects Are Impressive Over A Plodding Plot,7,27 February 2017,"Like every continuation of a series, ""Alien:Resurrection"" has the instincts of a child who has a fit after their parents took their favourite toy away. The sketchy, slimy alien creatures and the dark, claustrophobic scenarios are curiously provocative. However, the story fails to deliver even through its hardest effort in adding a new twist in the franchise. The film itself had the right material for newly inventive ways to make the series fresh, but it never tugs at your emotions and the impact falls flatter then diluted soda. In fact I was surprised more at just how fuzzy Dan Hedaya is and he's not the main attraction here. Sure fans of the series had came into the theatres in drones and it did do quite well at the box office, but it was highly doubtful if its welcome was long termed.Sigourney Weaver is back for the fourth time returning from the dead after 200 years as a hybrid human/alien Ellen Ripley and she's still just as tough as ever battling those slimy aliens as she's been doing since 1979. It's no surprise that Weaver is in her comfort zone and still looks buff and sexy and boss for a person who's by now in her late 40's. And when she did that back basketball shot, I think she's the only person who could get away with doing that.As the franchise continues, the alien creatures continue to get more awkward each time. But the looks still have some originality each time and in this movie the aliens depicted here stand out above the rest. The inspiration for the alien creation comes from director Jean-Pierre Jeunet who got the horrific physicality of the creatures from his previous outings ""Delicatessen"" and the always inviting ""The City of Lost Children"".The horrific characteristics of the film blends nicely to the dark settings, the heavy metal and the disgusting manifestations coming out of the creature's vials along with an exciting underwater scene along with the fear and the loss of humanity are just some of the spectacular traits from Jeunet's warped mind. Plus he brought his favourite actors Ron Perlman as a heavy-hitting antagonist and Dominique Pinon for some much needed comedy relief.Winona Ryder was a nice new added attraction to the series as an engineer aboard the spaceship Auriga the centrepiece to where all the fun takes place. Unfortunately 12 sniveling aliens are heading to Earth, planning to conduct evil biological experiments to the civilians.Ryder arrives on the scene with a ragtag group of smugglers seems out of place with the kind of cynical, barbaric individuals that make up the population in this franchise. Her chocolate brown eyes and her deadpan dramatic expressions has that token bright light for what has been a dark and dreary journey so far. Finally we can say this movie has a character with a small dosage of humanity.Mean is the focal characteristic in this film and the violence renders no apologies about it. We are treated to a delightful opening scene where we get an up close look at some performing open-chest surgery with barf-inducing detail with Brad Dourif as the mad doctor. The final result is that Ripley has given birth to a bouncy baby alien. You don't see that everyday that's for sure.Like every splatter fest in movies the aliens dine on delicious cuisines like guts, severed heads, and yummy brains. We also get insightful information about predatory subjects very few people talk about like predatory alien sex. Yeah ""viewer discretion advised"" makes its mark here.Granted the film does have creative vibes going for it, so there's no need to go through plot details no matter how narrow it is. The thick of it all is that this film depends too much on the visuals and not much emphasis is based on the story.We get fragments of a story that Ripley returned from the dead after two hundred years and her alien child has come back as well and she's on the hunt to slay these hideous evil creatures. The aliens are still the same gross, slimy creatures we all seen before, only now they're populating.In the span of five years since the last ""Alien"" film back in 1992, the special effects have truly come a long way. The transformation from archaic puppetry to the more advanced use of CGI has created a new, but not entirely for the better way of upgrading the franchise. Plus these new batch of aliens possess a more humanoid look to them and can display emotions. It's something to think about here.",Alien - Resurrection
94,Matt_Layden,It Had Interesting Ideas,6,16 May 2010,"Ripley is cloned and brought back. She wasn't alone though, they also brought back the alien that was inside her. With a crew bringing some cargo on board the same ship these alien experiments go awry and the aliens escape. All that is left is Ripley and the crew of the Betty. The reason why I think this film gets so much hate is because it seems to cheapen the ending to Alien 3, which was the best thing about that film. It ended her legacy and the story in the franchise and now comes a fourth film that many thought was a cash cow waiting to be milked. Alien: Resurrection has some interesting ideas, but the execution of the film as a whole just seems like a misfire. The first had terror, the second had action the third had the ending, the only way to end the series. What does this one have? Again, the cash cow thing comes to mind. The producers thought if they got geek writer Joss Whedon and French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, they could fool the audience. It would seem that two rights can't make a wrong. Joss Whedon's original script was obviously changed, but in interviews he said that his final draft is what is seen on the screen. So what's the problem? The execution apparently. While Whedon went for a tongue in cheek aspect, Jeunet went down the straight and narrow and made the film serious. So I guess two rights can make a wrong. The characters are interesting and the actors portraying them I thought was the best thing about the film. Ron Perlman and Gary Dourdan are the two stand outs in my opinion. Weaver isn't the same Ripley we once knew and loved. She is different. Part alien, she acts like one in the film. Again, it was an interesting idea, but I found myself liking her less and less. Not as much as I hated Ryder though, she was irritating and boring. The film is looked upon as the worst one. Or the one that could be tossed up between Alien 3 as the worst. It's no bag of dirt. It's watchable, a lot better than the last two alien films we got. The problem was there was no emotion, specifically for a character who was different than what we knew. The script was written one way and the direction went in another. Neither was right or wrong, but together it doesn't work that well. The underwater sequence is great though, definitely the stand out scene among a bunch of boring running down corridors bits. Alien: Resurrection has no sense of danger or terror. All three previous films had this in abundance. The story tried it's best to bring back the character of Ripley, but we got a shallow clone. The human/alien hybrid wasn't scary, it looked like less of a threat than the normal aliens. The climax was non-existent and should have taken place on Earth, it would have added a bit more urgency. The film looks great though. Cheers.",Alien - Resurrection
95,brando647,Maybe the Franchise Should Have Died with Ripley Back in 1992,6,19 February 2010,"Here is the third direct sequel in the ALIEN franchise and, by this point, the series has all but completely lost the essence of the original. The film, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, contributes nothing new to the series aside from better quality visual effects and a reason (albeit, a weak one) to resurrect Ellen Ripley. The film occurs 200 years after the events on Fiorina 161 and the military has used DNA samples from the impregnated Ripley to cultivate a Queen. Things get out of control and Ripley bands together with the crew of the unregistered freighter BETTY to escape alive. Whereas David Fincher's ALIEN 3 almost seemed to hearken back to the horror/suspense vibe of Ridley Scott's original, this film seems to aim more towards the man versus alien action of James Cameron's ALIENS. Unfortunately for Jeunet's film, it doesn't come close to matching the awesomeness that was Cameron's film.This installment feels hollow and meaningless compared to the previous. Instead of focusing on interesting characters or claustrophobic paranoia, the movie feels more focused on the deaths as the aliens one-by-one pick off the survivors. The only scene with any real impact behind it is Ripley's discovery of the seven failed clone attempts that came before her, and the horror of confronting mutilated versions of herself (while showing her only instance of humanity in the entire film). Otherwise, it's just a paint-by-numbers survival horror film...a two hour period where you watch the survivors get dropped into situation after situation where someone is bound to die. As for the ending, I'm not all that keen on it. The conclusion involves an unforeseen result of the cloning process: Ripley has developed minor traits similar to the aliens (acidic blood, heightened senses and reflexes) and the Queen has developed human traits, namely a uterus that presents the film with it's final threat. The concept didn't sit right with me and it felt to me as if screenwriter Joss Whedon was stretching for ideas.Perhaps the film would've been stronger if they had placed more of emphasis on the characters so their deaths would have an impact. Most of the characters are two-dimensional, with few exceptions. Sigourney Weaver returns for the fourth time as Ellen Ripley or, more accurately, Ripley clone #8. Weaver's spent three films building up a strong but empathetic protagonist and sacrifices it for an extra sequel where her clone is a cold, callous, hissing shell of her former self. Apparently, while Ripley's clone has managed to maintain all of her original memories, it's walked away with none of the best traits that made her who she was. I'll give her credit though, she still looks damn good in this movie.Most of the supporting cast don't fare well. Michael Wincott shows promise as Elgyn, captain of the BETTY, but isn't around long (similar to the filmmakers' treatment of Charles Dance in ALIEN 3); I also enjoyed Gary Dourdan as Christie, though he is also underused (I'm seeing a pattern here...). I'm a fan of Ron Perlman and his tough guy routine, which is all he does here as Johner. Winona Ryder is beautiful but feels incredibly out of place in this film as Call, the newest crew member of the BETTY with her own secrets and intentions. I still don't understand what was up with Dominique Pinon as Vriess; the rest of the ""good"" guys (Kim Flowers, Raymond Cruz, and Leland Orser) never really evolve past fresh meat that scream/yell a lot. The film's ""villain"", Doctor Wren, is dastardly cartoonish in his portrayal by J. E. Freeman, though it doesn't get much goofier than Dan Hedaya as General Martin Perez. The cornball factor doesn't lend well to a series renowned for it's suspense and horror, and I really felt it weakened the film as a whole.Probably the only aspect of the film that didn't underwhelm me was the visual effects. The shots of the AURIGA and the BETTY were fantastic and the xenomorphs are looking their best since ALIENS. Visual effects technology had improved greatly since 1992's ALIEN 3 so the CG aliens were much more impressive. There is plenty of gore this time around, giving the film a hard R rating, and should satisfy even the pickiest of gore-hounds. In that regard, the film entertains. I hate to sound as if I'm completely slamming the film because it's not terrible, it just doesn't live up to its predecessors. It's a bit more entertaining than ALIEN 3 but it's shallower in depth. The third film at least tried to have more substance whereas this movie accepts it's cookie-cutter format and runs with it, surviving on visual effects and gore.",Alien - Resurrection
96,moviewizguy,Witness the resurrection.,5,25 August 2007,"Ellen Ripley sacrificed her life to destroy the Company's desires to use the alien as a weapon. 200 years and seven horrible experiments later, she is resurrected on the USM Auriga using blood samples from Fiorina 161, for the purpose of extracting the alien queen inside her. After a band of smugglers, hired by the government, bring the crew of a hijacked transport to the Auriga, all hell breaks loose when the aliens bred from the hijacked crew escape. When the Auriga is set to automatically pilot back to Earth, its up to Ripley and the smugglers to stop the Auriga and escape with their lives.After the great conclusion of ""Alien 3"", I really thought there shouldn't be another sequel, but there is. It's called ""Alien: Resurrection"", a truly unnecessary sequel probably to just make money from the fans. Many people called ""Alien 3"" the worst of the bunch. I'm with the people who called ""Alien: Resurrection"" the worst of the bunch.When saying ""worst"", I don't mean it's a horrible or stupid film. I actually liked the first hour and ten minutes. This film is by far the best looking film from the series. Obviously, modern technology has grown. The special effects are much better and the Alien make-up looks much scarier.And although some franchises get a little repetitive and boring, this film manages to use some new ideas. On the down side, the new ideas are a bit awkward and uncomfortable to get use to. This movie is unlike the previous three films. Instead of a movie driven by characters and its plot, it's driven by visuals and action, which is called a popcorn movie.I'm all for a popcorn Alien movie, like ""Alien vs. Predator"", which I truly enjoyed. Yeah, this film has cheesy one liners and constant chase sequences. What I didn't like about this film as a popcorn film is that the film falls apart by the last 45 minutes into the film. It all gets ridiculous and stupid.There's also a time in this franchise where you are all Aliened out. I felt that way when watching this film. Sigourney Weaver's performance is decent but she acts like a jerk, for some unknown reason. Another good performance was from Winona Ryder.If you're up for another Alien movie, go ahead and watch this one. It certainly gives you something new and awkward at the same time. The action and chase sequences are well done but I didn't like the story as much as the last three films. I will conclude that this is the worst film in the series, although not a very bad one.",Alien - Resurrection
97,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Alien: Resurrection""- A fun big-budget 'B-Movie.' Trite and a bit mindless, but ferociously entertaining!",6,26 November 2017,"One of the longest running modern day horror franchises, ""Alien"" is a fascinating beast in the world of entertainment and media. With its humble origins as a quiet, slow-burn sci-fi thriller, the series evolved through sequels and spin-offs into something else entirely. Whether it be through James Cameron's exquisite action-extravaganza ""Aliens"", or the Paul W.S. Anderson schlock-tastic crossover ""AVP: Alien VS Predator"", or even series co-creator Ridley Scott's own pseudo- philosophical quasi-prequel ""Prometheus""... ""Alien"" has changed and evolved quite a bit over the past forty years.But one release in particular has attracted an almost unanimous scorn and unending ridicule from all over the fanbase. A film that's so reviled, it's almost become a prerequisite that you're just expected to hate it. That being 1997's ""Alien: Resurrection""- a strange little footnote in the series that tries its hardest but never quite comes together into much of anything. An attempt to turn the series around after the mixed reception garnered by ""Alien 3"", this fourth film aims for the stars, but stumbles and falls flat on its face. Although, if I am to be completely honest... I actually don't mind it too much. It's silly, but quite amusing and thrilling, with stylish visual direction and plenty of laughs and thrills to go around. Yes, ""Resurrection"" might be a mindless and trite exercise in style over substance... but it's also bold and extraordinarily entertaining. It's a ton of fun, even if it is objectively a ""bad movie.""Two-hundred years after the events of the previous film, scientists working for the military successfully clone Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and the queen embryo she had been impregnated with, intent on allowing the alien life-form to reproduce so that they might study its race. This ""new"" Ripley has retained some faint memories of her former life thanks to genetic memory, but as a result of the cloning process, has also taken on some characteristics of the dreaded ""xenomorph"" species. When the offspring of the alien queen manage to escape, however, Ripley is forced to team up with a group of mercenary space-pirates (including Ron Perlman, Winona Ryder) in order to escape. Along the way, she will uncover startling and deadly revelations about the project that brought her back to life, and come face to face with a devilish new threat...Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet from a script by the world-renowned geek-god Joss Whedon, ""Resurrection"" does so much right that it's frankly a shame it's so routinely dismissed without much thought. It's essentially an incredibly slick and exceedingly well-made crappy B-movie. The plot is ridiculous. The characters silly and archetypal. And it's filled to burst with nonstop gore and effects. But it's made with a massive budget, an A-list cast and comes from a wildly talented director with a clear vision. Even on a pure aesthetic level, it's one of the most striking films of the franchise, with Jeunet's wonderful eye for flow and composition delivering many incredible set-pieces and designs that'll stick with you. It's just a gorgeous film all around.The cast is an absolute blast, with Weaver once again knocking it out of the park. Especially as this ""new"" Ripley also goes through some fascinating changes that both allow Weaver to stretch her acting chops... and have some fun chewing the scenery from time to time. Perlman and Ryder are good fun as members of a space-pirate team, with Perlman in particular being a good fit for the franchise. He's a criminally underrated performer and it's a joy seeing him on- screen. We also get small but fun turns from the likes of Brad Dourif, Dan Hedaya and Michael Wincott, and all serve the film quite well. The effects and action are top-notch for the time, with many sequences still holding up quite well to this day. An underwater chase-scene and a trippy climactic battle against a potential new threat in particular being eye-popping and absolutely jaw-dropping. And the wonderful cinematography and almost amniotic musical score add much to every single scene.But yeah... despite that praise, the film does have a lot of problems. Like I said above- it's basically a big-budget B-movie filled with the tropes and archetypes you'd expect, and it doesn't fit in with the rest of the series quite well. Unless you're willing to forgive a lot and go with the flow, you're not gonna have a good time with ""Resurrection."" There has been a lot of talk of how Whedon disowned the film and felt his script wasn't translated properly to screen, and I could definitely see shades of that. For all the amazing things he does, Jeunet seems less interested with story and more interested in increasingly psychotic visuals. And if you're looking for anything more than surface-level entertainment, you'll be sadly let-down.But me? I take movies for what they are and what they aspire to be. It's clear everyone involved on-screen is having a lot of fun. It's clear that Jeunet is trying to build a wild thrill-ride of a monster-movie. And it's clear that this is a film more concerned with crazed displays of gore and effects than a cohesive story. And you know what? I had a lot of fun with it. It's technically a ""bad"" movie, but to me... it's a FUN bad movie. And I'm giving it slightly above average 6 out of 10. Give it another shot with an open mind. It just might surprise you how enjoyable ""Alien: Resurrection"" really is.",Alien - Resurrection
98,valadas,Nothing original,5,5 August 2005,"The problem with these stories that develop themselves in several successive episodes is that quality deteriorates from the first on. This saga of the alien monsters doesn't escape this rule. If the first movie was good mainly for the originality of the main theme and the creativity of its conception the following ones became repetitive and mere action movies for lack of ideas(I must say however that I have not yet seen the third one). If you still recall the first movie you may remember that the monsters' image was only suggested by some glimpses which left large field for the viewer's imagination to conceive them. From the moment they began to be shown entirely they lost much of their power to thrill or scare us. This 4th episode has indeed some good and some original ideas. But like someone already said about a certain novel, the good ones are not original and the original ones are not good. The rest is mere action to rivet your attention till the ending which is moreover predictable. There is therefore not much to credit this movie except that it's technically well made but you know the part that computers take nowadays in this kind of sci-fi movies. A final note to say that the acting was not very good with the exception of Sigourney Weaver of course. All the others were much stereotyped some of them almost as monstrous as the monsters themselves mainly in moral terms.",Alien - Resurrection

But, there are just about enough new ideas here to make one final outing the for the aliens (I quite like the offspring of Ripley and the alien at the end too, although it's a little cheesy)If you have been avoiding this, then give it a chance, it is not as good as the first two, so don't expect too much.7/10",Alien - Resurrection

Get it at Amazon.)Just ugly, kind of like a perverse Star Trek for horror fans. The dialogue is particularly bad, one of the worst scripts I've encountered lately. The actors curiously talked like they thought they were making a prison film or perhaps a low-budget Mexican western. Clint Eastwood extras would be embarrassed to say some of the lines.Winona Ryder is horribly miscast and looks and sounds stupid, although her voice is kind of amusing, especially if you like to hear her say ""f---."" Sig Weaver is semi-interesting in a bloodless and buff sort of way; but the rest of this dreary, low-brow space shoot 'em up with monsters, is a yawn. If you get off on gross biological freaks in formaldehyde, however, or like to pucker up to T Rex teeth dripping acid, or go for that special feel of flesh being ripped, etc., this might be for you.Absolutely worst line (but funny as twice-removed accidental humor) is Ron Perlman's comment (after Weaver burns and blows away the grotesque embryos and her own twisted, misshapen clone) ""Must be a chick thing.""Banal observation: you'd think after all the years in space, evolving away from mother earth, there would be some advance in degenerate habits; but no, these space terrorists still smoke cigarettes and drink whiskey-and I'M SURE basketball with metal nets will still be played on the playgrounds orbiting around Jupiter. Banal observation number 2: with all that fire power, you'd think they'd blow holes in the ship and lose all the air. Alas, no.There's a special place in hell for people who produce movies like this. In it they are fastened into seats with their eye lids propped open, forced to watch their creations for eternity. I think they should also be forced to talk about how good the movie is and how they've done something just wonderful. And could we hear Winona Ryder tell us once again what a thrill it was working with Sigourney Weaver?",Alien - Resurrection
101,Screen_Blitz,"There is plenty of gore and gross special effects to go around, but not enough flair and scares to resurrect the series",4,25 May 2017,"The Alien franchise had a promising debut when Ridley Scott ignited the first film in 1979, and James Cameron embraced the spirit of the film with a highly enthralling follow-up in 1986. This series however, met an unexpected downward turn when the third installment came in, not only butchering the franchise but placing director David Fincher on a not-so-compelling directorial debut. Since then, Fincher is now disowned the film. There was only hope that this unexpected fourth installment would be pull the franchise out of its rusty pit. Unfortunately, that was a dream that went to die. Taking the director's chair this time around is French filmmaker Jean-Pierre Jeunet who manages to strip the film of the beauty that made the first two entries hits and slaps it with an inept script by Joss Whedon, placing this installment in a borderline laughable debacle. Now the franchise opens the door to the question of how and who is supposed to get this now-gloomy franchise back on its feet. Set in 200 years after the events of 'Alien 3', this film follows a space crew consisting of Call (played by Winona Ryder), ""tough-guy"" Johner (played by Ron Perlman), wheelchair-bound Captain Vriess (played by Dominique Pinon), Christie (played by Gary Dourdan) along with several others who conduct a biological experiment to extract the Queen Alien out of the long- dead Ellen Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver)and resurrect her back to life. However, her DNA has already been paired with the Queen, and the crew must now face against a vicious alien bloodbath that places the lives of everyone in grave danger. This dour fourth entry suffers from not only failing bring anything new to the table rather than recycling the nearly all the same elements from before, but somehow managing to produce more unintentional laughter than scares. If there are any accolades that surround this movie besides taking the crown of drenching the screen with most gore and slime, is coming up just a few fun action sequences involving the space crew chased down the tunnels by the ugly extraterrestrial creatures and a few scenes of our heroes mowing down the aliens with loud, noisy bloodbath. Beyond that, it appears that Jean- Pierre Jeunet struggles to execute the action without it feeling like a tug-o-war between the grim atmosphere and Joss Whedon's otherwise more light-hearted script. Recycling on run-of-the mill formula, this movie journeys through the characters' battle for survival, while adding some awkward elements to the mix including giving Ellen Ripley what appears to be sexual tension between her and the Queen Alien. This accounts to an awkward scene toward the end that is bound to spear viewers with a sense of embarrassing discomfort than scare. Who wants to see Ripley get intimate with a flesh-eating xenomorph? If that isn't farcical enough, Whedon's script also manages to pair each character, particularly Ron Perlman, with a large surplus of one ludicrous one-liner after another. In addition, how funny does this trying to by poking fun at Dominique Pinon's character being in the wheelchair in the midst of all the chaos? As for the performances, there is not much gold to offered here, even from Sigourney Weaver. While her performance is not necessarily bad, the unwholesome portrayal of her character strips the actress of all her charisma that made her a powerful character in the beginning. Alien: Resurrection marks a dismal attempt to revitalize the broken franchise, and settles for both an unpolished direction and script that accounts for more silliness than white-knuckle thrills. Not many can doubt that this entry had a fair amount of potential. But oh boy! It only corresponds to a soul-sucking letdown.",Alien - Resurrection
102,oneguyrambling,Less bitchy this time round.,7,27 January 2012,"200 years on from the events of Alien 3 – and the death of Ellen Ripley and she's back, cloned from DNA retrieved prior to her death aboard a massive spaceship.Why it had to be Ripley and not some random? Who knows aside from the obvious cinematic reasoning, but after a few tries #8 comes good and supplies the diabolical scientists with what they are seeking – a Queen alien.After it is surgically extracted and the former host Ripley #8 is patched up she calmly tells the giddy scientists ""It's a Queen she'll breed you'll die."" Now if a clone 200+ years into the future knows what lies ahead (maybe she has seen the first 3 films?) we shouldn't be too surprised that she is right.The scientists eventually decide to keep Ripley #8 alive and she exhibits miraculous healing powers and almost superhuman tendencies – the fact that they use basketball to highlight some of these new abilities lead to a scene best described as uncomfortably corny.Once the aliens put their heads together and come up with an embarrassingly easy escape the usual modus operandi begins, only this time more than a dozen aliens are criss-crossing the ship in search of tucker. In the early stages everyone able to escape does just that, for the rest it is every man, woman, android or cloned-alien/human hybrid for themselves.There is a cool underwater sequence that looks particularly cool (and as usual in film everyone can hold their breath for around 4 minutes). The Queen seems a lot bigger this time out but gets minimal time on screen and even less to do when she finally arrives and a finale that leaves me on the fence, it is either plausible or lazy – I can't decide.Aside from dredging out the same basic formula of Ripley + stragglers once again the main problem is that Alien: Resurrection is spectacularly miscast. The ship's commander is Dan Hedaya and he's just wrong – but believe it or not he isn't the least appropriate – that would be Winona Ryder as Call, a member of a group of less than honourable space cowboys. The team are allegedly tough, rough and dangerous to know, and with Ron Perlman and the excellently gruff Michael Wincott among their number some of them are – but Winona and a physically challenged and over-acting guy named Vriess it's more of an impractical eyebrow raising joke of a crew in reality. Some of Winona's dialogue sounds plain bizarre when she says it.Team that with a cartoonishly over the top Brad Dourif as a cuckoo scientist and you have a higher ratio of perplexing decisions than you have realistic characters, never a good thing.In reality this is a 6.5 – a film with a couple of marginally entertaining moments but overall a patchy disappointment, but I owe Aliens so much that I can't bring myself to do that to Ripley, soFinal Rating – 7 / 10. (But read the paragraph above) Alien 4: Resurrection is far and away the least of the series, but it has a couple of decent moments. Ripley – even a cloned hybrid Ripley – deserved better.",Alien - Resurrection
103,PimpinAinttEasy,Fun film that does tackle some existential issues .....,8,16 June 2017,"Alien Resurrection is very camp and funny compared to the dark tone of the first three films. The alien has penetrated into the resurrected Ripley. In fact, she is part alien. Ripley does not look tortured or depressed anymore. A quiet strength has replaced the ruthless pragmatism.The film does tackle some existential questions like in the exchanges between cloned Ripley and the robot played by Wynonda Ryder. I liked the part where Wynona asks Ripley - how do you go on living despite knowing what you are? Ron Perlman is a great addition to the cast. This film was pretty good fun what with the scenes of the aliens attacking underwater and all. More big budget films should try to be like this. I am sure a lot of people would disagree with my 8/10 rating. But nobody can deny the fact that it was an entertaining film.",Alien - Resurrection
104,BrandtSponseller,Another excellent film in a series of solid 10s,10,8 February 2005,"Series note: It is strongly recommended that you watch this series in order, as each entry is a direct continuation of the story, as if chapters of a book. The previous films, in order, are Alien (1979), Aliens (1986), and Alien 3 (1992).Taking place 200 years after the events of Alien 3, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is now a clone living on a military ship as the subject of scientific experiments. Unfortunately, they also get a hold of specimen of the titular malevolent aliens. Shortly after a ship of ""space pirates"" docks to complete a deal with the military ship's shady General Perez (Dan Heyda), things start to go haywire, and once again, humans are fighting for their lives.Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's series entry is most similar in tone to Aliens, James Cameron's action-heavy take on the alien mythology. The primary differences are those rooted to each film's place in time--Aliens is a typical mid-80s actioner, this is a typical late 90s actioner--and distinctions due to James Cameron's style versus Jean-Pierre Jeunet's, although in some ways, this is a more unusual film for Jeunet, who has leaned more towards surrealism and ""art films"" throughout his career.On the other hand, the script for Alien Resurrection, which was written by Joss Whedon (of television's Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel and Firefly fame), can be easily seen as more surreal than the other entries in the series, if not darker (the tone of Alien 3 makes it difficult to call anything darker). After all, Ripley is a clone here, there are lots of bizarre almost X-Files like government conspiracies and experiments going on, and on a subtextual level, the whole film is a very disturbing take on motherhood. So even though both Aliens and this film are primarily action flicks, there is less of a focus on firepower here, and more of a focus on sci-fi weirdness. I love both, so it's nice to have different films in the series with different focuses.We also get ""Super-Ripley"" in this film, which for me was a hoot. Sigourney Weaver was always one of the best things about the series--she presented a deep, intelligent, resourceful character, and in Alien Resurrection, she gets action hero-like physical prowess to boot. She is also able to add a slightly sinister, slightly inhuman edge, which brings a whole new dimension to the films. The rest of the characters were almost as enjoyably over the top as Cameron's Marines in Aliens. My only complaint on that end was that I would like to have seen both Brad Dourif and Dan Heyda much more.Jeunet gives us some of the more haunting scenes of the series, one of the best being an extended underwater trek through a flooded deck, as our heroes attempt to escape. Alien Resurrection's climax also features what very well may be the most disturbing creature in the series, and no, I'm not referring to Ron Perlman.It shouldn't take much to recommend this entry.

106,baumer,What was a great series is now old like the Fridays.......,6,27 July 1999,"I'll try to make this brief.  Alien was good because it set the tension up and then unleashed the terror.  Aliens was one of the best films ever made because James Cameron is brilliant, the supporting cast was spectacular and it was a terrifying experience.  Alien3 was okay because Ripley looked and sounded exhausted from facing the alien one too many times, and she dies with the monster.  Alien Resurection is just okay because there is nothing new to do here.  We have seen it all before and there is very little chance that the directors of 3 and 4 know how to create tension the way that Scott and Cameron did.  The film is tiresome.  Ripley isn't the frightened but tough heroine that she was before.  Now she is a terminator.  And that takes away from one of the elements that made the first and especially the second one so good.  In Aliens, Weaver had lines like,  ""I hope you're right. Because just one of those things managed to wipe out my entire crew. "" Now I expect her to say "" I'll be back. ""  It's just not the same.  And her bravado does not bode well for the picture here.  Having her this tough and emotionless would be like having Rambo as a wimp that begs the bad guys to stop before they torture him.  It just doesn't fit.Alien 4 is not a terrible film.  It is okay, but it does not have the feeling that a good Aliens film does.  And maybe that is asking too much of it because the first two were really incredible films.  But the series is tired and I really hope it is over.  The only way I would like to see another one is if Cameron directs.  And seeing as that is not going to happen, let this series come to end.  It's dead.  Ripley is dead.  The Alien is dead.  All the cool characters are dead.  May the series rest in peace. It's time to leave it alone.Alien series 1979-1997 R.I.P.",Alien - Resurrection
107,baumer,The end of what was once a proud series,6,13 August 1999,"I really hope this is the end of this series.  Alien was a good film with lots of atmosphere.  Aliens was one of the best films ever made and it was one of the few films that I can say actually made me frightened and nervous. Alien 3 was stylistic but annoying and Alien 4 displays nothing that made the first two great.  In the first and especially the second, Ripley was a scared but tough heroine that knew better than anyone what the Bitch was capable of.  In the second film she says things like "" I hope you're right because just one of things managed to wipe out my entire crew. ""  Now she is a cyborg and she has no fear and that takes away one of the most rudimentary things that made the first two scary.  We could live vicariously through Ripley and her fear.  But in this one, it is just a bunch of idiots running around that we don't care about.  In Aliens we had Hudson ( is this going to be another bug hunt SIR? ) Hicks ( okay, we waste him, no offense ) Vasquez ( I just need to know one thing, where they are ) and even Apomb ( look into my eye! ).  These characters added an element to the film that Alien 4 could never hope to copy.  So what are we left with?  I'm not sure, but it is not a good product, that is for sure.  Even Winona Ryder can't do anything with the role that she was given.  So the series has worn out it's welcome.  It's time to put it to rest.  I have heard that there is talk of a fifth, are these going to go the way of the Rocky's?  I hope not because the first two were really superb films.  I really hope they end it now.  Please.  This is not a good film and I can't see how the next could be any better, unless Cameron directed..... nah, that would be too good to be true.",Alien - Resurrection
108,DunnDeeDaGreat,Decent movie when it comes to Part 4's,9,30 January 2002,"Alien: Resurrection is a decent movie when it comes to part 4.

109,vithiet,This movie was made too early,5,13 June 2020,"If Whedon wrote it and Jeunet directed it later in their careers, with not only more experience in their respective styles but also the professional credibility and weight to push for their exact vision, this could have been a great movie. Each Alien installment has chosen a completely different genre angle and this could have been a great gore/satire take on it. Unfortunately it is just trying to be a little bit of everything and doesn't succeed at any of it. Also what they tried to go for would have benefited from more modern visual effects, another argument for wishing this had been made at least 10 years later. As a standalone sci-fi flick it would have been decent for its time but it just doesn't hold up to the 3 previous ones in the franchise. RIP(ley), franchise!",Alien - Resurrection
110,mentalcritic,"It tried, and that's more than can be said for the next sequel...",6,21 December 2004,"The first time I heard of Alien: Resurrection was when a reader of those Hollywood magazines reported reading about a new Alien sequel rumoured to be in the works. According to his statement, Ripley would be ""brought back"" by cloning. Given that Sigourney Weaver insisted that she be killed off at the end of the previous film, those in the know were skeptical that she would even appear. In spite of all that, they found the right price for her, and the rest is history. Thankfully, she had the good sense to avoid the dreadful Alien VS. Predator project. Apparently, she read that script and said it sounded like a dreadful idea, which makes one wonder why Fox has never examined some of the ideas in such sources as Dark Horse comic books.Thankfully, Fox learned their lesson from the Alien 3 experience. Instead of rushing an incomplete script into production, they hired a decent writer and gave him time to come up with something watchable. As with Aliens after Alien, the decision was also made to attempt to follow up a slow, languid science-fiction/horror piece with a fast-paced, breathless science-fiction/action piece. The results, while not even remotely able to compete with the best of the series, are such an improvement upon Alien 3 that it makes the elements of Gibson's Alien 3 script that can be seen in Alien: Resurrection a bitchslap to Brandywine Productions.However, a number of problems keep Alien: Resurrection from really achieving its potential. One of them is the casting. While Brad Dourif can be believed in a film like this in spite of his relatively tiny size, Winona Ryder screams out ""miscast"" like Roseanne Barr would as the lead in a porn film. Not only is she tiny even in comparison to Dourif, her mannerisms and voice scream a softness that the world of the Alien series will not suffer. That she lives to see the end while more appropriate characters like those portrayed by Michael Wincott or Dominique Pinon bite it about forty minutes after they are introduced indicates that plausibility was a secondary concern to the director.The design of the Alien-Human hybrid in particular makes one wonder exactly what was going on in the minds of the production team. Apparently, a more crab-like version was originally proposed, but changed in order to make it seem more ""plausible"". That... thing... is meant to be plausible? I must have been asleep when they redefined that word. The statement that the Alien Queen also now has a Human reproductive system is a bit of a joke, given that it is implied in the same monologue that she reproduces asexually. Then again, given that the prologue expects us to believe they can obtain an Alien by cloning someone who carried one once, I doubt that respect for the audience's sense of the plausible was a big concern.To the credit of the film, Ron Perlman makes an excellent addition to the canon. Unlike Ryder, one has no trouble believing Perlman could survive well in a universe like this. Weaver has also grown in terms of acting to the point where the role of Ellen Ripley fits her like a glove. She could practically portray this role in her sleep, so there's not much chance of her not giving an awesome performance. With the new direction the character is taken in, she shows that there is nothing she cannot do if given a chance.In the end, however, the flaws outweigh the strengths. I don't know whether the seven minutes added to the Special Edition for a 2003 release fix this, but I doubt it. As a result, I'd rate Alien: Resurrection a six out of ten. It is far better than its most immediate predecessor, but long-time fans of the series had a right to expect more.",Alien - Resurrection
111,Joxerlives,Third best in the Alien series (but a LONNNGGGG way behind Alien/Aliens),8,18 May 2013,"Alien is rightfully considered possibly the finest horror/sci-fi film of all time (The Thing and The Fly its' only real competitors, interestingly both remakes). Aliens is the best sci-fi/action film of all time and for a long period my favourite film ever. And then we had Alien 3. If they had been deliberately TRYING to make a bad film that would ruin the series I don't think they could have done a better job and really the franchise never recovered. Alien; Resurrection was a valiant attempt to put things right and my boy Joss Whedon does a commendable job. But he had a long way to climb after the debacle of Alien 3. Really Resurrection isn't a great film overall but it has some terrific things about it. Sigourney is great as always, Wionna does OK in her role, the relationship between Cal and Ripley 8 is brilliant and spawned a thousand slash fanfics. You can see the beginnings of Firefly here, even down to a prototype Jane and River. The scene where Ripley 8 looks longingly at the picture of the little girl who reminds her of Newt is just heartbreaking (come on Joss, why didn't you include a scene during the evacuation where a Michael Biehn lookalike is glimpsed escaping the ship with a little blonde girl, they could always have cloned them too). Love the fact that Walmart have now taken over Weyland-Yutani. The female space pirate has the most AMAZING figure and the director takes pains to show it off. Set pieces like the underwater battle are terrific. OK, so the newborn looks stupid and it rather spoils the implied parent/child relationship with Ripley (note the newborn actually chooses its' human side over its' Alien heritage). It's a little hard to sympathise with the pirates when they kidnap the poor workers but you have to assume that they didn't know what was going on. The idea that the scientists would be so stupid as not to acid proof the Aliens' cells is ridiculous. A better storyline would be if the space pirates were actually condemned prisoners the military were going to use for alien breeding but when Cal stages a breakout in order to get to Ripley it frees the other prisoners and they inadvertently release the aliens.Is it just me or is there something a little GOT-fic about the Alien drone carrying Ripley away? Joss sure has his heroines have some deeply weird sex! Great ending though, the bugs blasted to atoms (along with poor Angola!), Ripley has her ship, her crew and her little girl back and can now become a female version of Mal Reynolds, she has her happy ending at last after all she's been through and finally returned to Earth (which she never did in the previous 3 films). She and Cal gaze at the beauty of their world and Ripley observes that she's a stranger to Earth herself...Ripley has become the alien. I was actually only going to give this film a 7 but thinking of that final scene I've decided to give it 8.",Alien - Resurrection
112,hall895,Let it die,4,7 June 2015,"Ellen Ripley is back for another Alien adventure. Kindly ignore the fact that when last we saw her Ripley was quite dead. How to continue a franchise when you've killed off your star? Cloning of course. Duh. So 200 years after her demise Ripley is back, the military having cloned her because they want the Alien queen that was inside her when she died. You think the military would have learned better by now than to try to harness these Alien killing machines. But of course had they learned their lesson there would be no movie. And the studio wanted to make some easy cash off another Alien movie so here we are. After the disaster that was Alien³ the franchise should have been allowed to die. This movie is slightly better than the last but that's not saying much. Enough is enough.As ever with this franchise Sigourney Weaver is the best thing about this film. Another strong performance as she portrays a strong heroine. And this time there's a little mystery to Ripley, with the cloning process she's got some Alien blood mixed up inside her. That raises some interesting issues. Indeed the first part of this film does show some promise as we get to know this new Ripley. But it devolves rather quickly. It turns into just another rehash. Aliens attack, blood and gore, repeat as necessary. We've seen all this before and quite frankly we've seen more than enough of it. The story does have a few new twists as it moves towards the finish. But by the time the ""big"" moments come you'll probably have lost interest. Weaver gets very little support. Winona Ryder is the big co-star here and she's all wrong for this movie. Sci-fi action is not her thing. The only other actor who stands out at all is Ron Perlman. Unfortunately he only stands out because of how annoying his character is. Reminiscent of Bill Paxton in Aliens. Perlman isn't quite as annoying as Paxton was but it's close. There aren't enough good things here to make the resurrection of this franchise remotely worthwhile. Let Ripley and the Aliens rest in peace.",Alien - Resurrection

114,vip_ebriega,"The brainless, violent monster movie that it is.",7,20 February 2007,"My Take: While not the best in the ALIEN saga, this fourth chapter brings along action-packed thrills fans found lacking in ALIEN 3. (This is an extension of the review I wrote in February 2007)Fans consider ALIEN: RESURRECTION as a remedy after the doom-filled and much-maligned ALIEN 3. After all, after much of the pulp has already been juiced, it's only appropriate that this fourth ALIEN film declines to a mindless monster movie of the summer. Under those warrants, ALIEN: RESURRECTION gives you your end of the bargain. ""Alien: Resurrection"" is a good film. Lets not say excellent, but still a very good entry in the series. Sure, it does some things that should have ended in the previous chapter, but still makes up for it. The Ripley here is a clone, bred by scientists who plot to exploit and study the alien creatures. Okay, the film doesn't explain how they got Ripley, or the alien queen inside her (she supposedly burned in boiling lava in the previous chapter). But hey, those are somethings only sci-fi can answer. Anyway, the main attractions are those mean green mothers from outer space, slimier than ever. And then there's Weaver, returning to her competent, female Rambo, able to widen her characteristics when given the chance to make Ripley (or clone Ripley) a meaner and more complicated critter. Overall, not the series' best, but it's definitely the best movie gross-out carnage and slimy monsters has got to offer. Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",Alien - Resurrection
115,one9eighty,When alien hillbilly cousins mate - a ugly mess is born,5,12 February 2020,"Dear oh dear or dear - Sad face.What the hell happened?What was that?What did they do to it?Those were just some of the things that I thought after watching this film. There were more things I was wondering, but such expletives would get me banned from reviewing films on here so I can't write them. This was slightly annoying, slightly horrible and a bit weak too.So, 200 years after Ellen Ripley sacrificed herself for the good of humanity to make sure Aliens didn't become a menace to the universe, she is reborn. A clone of her is created in order to extract the Alien that she was carrying. In recreating her, the alien she was carrying is also recreated. Unfortunately as they both share one body the DNA gets a little mixed up and they both become part of each other. The ship where she was created is attacked by hijackers/ protesters/ smugglers and becomes unstable subsequently freeing aliens. She forced into teaming up in order to survive, in teaming up she learns information that puts her in a conflicting position that tests her allegiances.Amongst some of the other questions I had were; why contain aliens with acid for blood, in containers that aren't acid proof? Why have autopilot sequences that return the ship to earth the minute the aliens escape? What is plan B for emergencies - or is plan B just run for your life and hope to escape? Also, Winona Ryder - why? In the world of sequels this feels like ""Batman and Robin"" - it's almost cartoon and colourful in its appearance, it contains stupid segments that add nothing to the plot or universe, and it might as well have nipples on the alien suit (a-la Batman). Sure there are worse film in the world, but for a franchise that had so much potential in the first films and in novels and comics - this is served up as a lite version of aliens which looks like it's just there to gross some money from fans willing to pay for anything Alien related. It's formulaic; it's ill-conceived, woefully executed. Maybe as stand-alone film you find on the Sy-Fy or Horror channel this works, in the franchise of Alien films, not. 5 out of 10 is a bit kind but this review has found me on a good day.",Alien - Resurrection
116,CitizenCaine,Inferior to the first two in the series,6,14 September 2003,"The fourth installment of the alien movies is like the third one: Clearly inferior to the first two in the series. It starts promisingly enough with Sigourney Weaver appearing as a clone of her original Ripley character. However, the movie unravels after the aliens escape as usual. As a result, the focus becomes merely another ""us vs. them"" plot in the second half of the movie. Interesting story elements are presented, but never expounded upon or completely discarded altogether. These include Ripley's superhuman/alien strength. What's the point of giving her that strength, if she rarely uses it? The ambiguity of Ripley's genetic make-up is never addressed satisfactorily either. Why do the space pirates really need her anyway? What's the real motivation for the conduction of the experiments to begin with? Giving Ripley more humanity than the fully human characters is literally a gross attempt to add melodrama to balance the action. If one were to read more into the movie, the ending could be interpreted as a metaphorical abortion of sorts. Winona Rider seems out of place in this movie also, and the full frontal nudity, or simulated nudity, of Sigourney Weaver might be cause to shield the eyes of younger audience members. There is some strong tension in here in certain scenes, most notably in a scene where two space pirates are ascending a ladder trying to escape. This movie is really an action movie masquerading as science fiction. As in most creature features, the more we see the aliens, the less we fear or are surprised by them. In this movie, the aliens can jump, swim, and give birth, no less! Perhaps, one of them could have written a better script. **1/2 of 4 stars.",Alien - Resurrection
117,Stampsfightclub,a couple of fine moments can't stop the narrative raising questions,4,24 January 2009,"Two hundred years after her death, Ellen Ripley (Weaver) has been resurrected into a human/alien clone that sets on continuing the ongoing battle against the aliens.The forth instalment of the series sees Sigourney Weaver (Working Girl) reprise her role as the Sci-Fi icon Ripley, the character who sacrificed herself to rid the world of the alien inside her. One of the few things good about Alien3 was that ending. A dramatic turn of events that not even the most critical of person could foresee. 200 years on from the third part and she's back, brought through scientific experiment to bring the Alien queen out of the opinionated experienced warrior. The whole question of science and resurrection in this manner over such a long time and the effect on the character is exceptionally questionable, especially with the scientific jargon the scientists use.But this is almost irrelevant, Ripley returned, and she is the Alien series. Weaver is the star of the poorly constructed narrative, making the new Ripley an intelligent and cunning protagonist, and her facial expressions convey that she has something to hide, which makes her an absolute joy to watch.Alien3 made its mistake by justifying itself to the action convention cinematic formula and not focusing on the domineering presence of the finest Sci-Fi villain ever. Whereas this 1997 picture is more sophisticated in its approach to storytelling, the action, illogic and narrative in general still bring the premise down.Action-wise this feels very basic and ordinary, with the Alien hardly scary once again. Not hiding and always inevitable, it's hard to imagine it was scary in the first place. There are however some finely directed scenes. Rare, but on screen critics are forgotten, particularly the underwater chase which is a fine adrenaline soaked thrill ride.The science behind number 4 is frequently questionable. The film raises eyebrows with its debate over lengthy survival, alien/human relations and history. It seems very incidental, throwing in these concepts whilst the action does the talking otherwise.Apart from some fine direction during the action sequences, the narrative is inconsistent with these bizarre topics and the predictable action and incomprehensible science destroy the promise of another horror.Though Weaver once again shines, Alien Resurrection is as much of a let down as its predecessor was, though with thankfully better characters and direction",Alien - Resurrection

But it's not just her genes but a mixture that includes alien genetic material.  She still looks human but is not, now she can play a killer game of basketball.  Stripped of her humanity Ripley fails to pack the dramatic punch that was so much a critical element of the earlier Alien movies.  And the aliens, well, they are now just another part of the cast, ho-hum.  The plot, and other characters are cartoonish and stereotypical.  What a waste of acting talent!  And the grand finale is so bad as to be laughable. My advice is to avoid this movie.",Alien - Resurrection
119,KnightsofNi11,When writer and director don't see eye to eye,6,10 September 2012,"After the Alien saga was treated by a Brit and two Americans it was time for a Frenchie to step in and take the reins. Enter French auteur Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the man to helm the fourth Alien movie, Alien: Resurrection. This fourth installment takes place 200 years after Alien 3. Scientists have gathered blood samples from Fury 116, Lt. Ellen Ripley's final resting place, and used them to create a super strong alien/human hybrid clone of the Xenomorph slaying expert. These scientists pulled the Queen alien that was inside of Ripley out of her and used the Queen to start breeding the Xenomorphs. And, as one would expect, things quickly go wrong. It is, once again, up to Ripley to save a rag tag gang of space pirates from these horrific creatures running amok on a ship that is headed towards Earth at an alarming rate.Alien: Resurrection is undoubtedly a Jeunet film, with its darkly comic atmosphere and animated and eccentric style. He adds all of his usual European flare to this exciting and explosive film. Alien: Resurrection reverts back to James Cameron's way of doing things in this saga, making the film an action film rather than a suspense horror. Honestly, this is something I was happy about. It was neat to see the series switch back and forth between these two genres with Alien being a true sci-fi horror, Aliens being a strictly action packed film, and Alien 3 returning to the horror roots. Alien: Resurrection is non stop action and with Jeunet's visual brilliance it is an absolute visual spectacle.Where Alien: Resurrection fails, however, is in its script. Not so much because the script is bad, but writer Joss Whedon and director Jean-Pierre Jeunet had two different visions for the film. Whedon wrote a crazier and more tongue-in-cheek script, while Jeunet directed a more straight edge final product. This clashing is what makes this film falter the most. The style doesn't match the script, and when characters say or do things that seem a little silly in a more serious environment it feels awkward and cringe worthy at times.Also, Joss Whedon made a very bold move in what he did with the space pirates. He tried to create a group of characters who we could believe have worked together for a very long time and he tried to create an atmosphere around them that made them feel like a true space crew, not just actors thrown together to play certain archetypes. This is one of the most revolutionary things that the original Alien succeeded phenomenally at. No science fiction film has ever created this sort of atmosphere, and Alien: Resurrection does't even come close. Whedon tried to pay a great homage to the first film in doing this, but really he just revealed to us the things that made the crew of Alien work by showing us what absolutely doesn't work.Visuall, Alien: Resurrection is astounding and as pure entertainment it works pretty well. It's definitely fun and a great way to kill two hours. But with a script that is mismatched with the film's style and a story that is full of odd plot holes that continually take you out of the experience this film is kept from being much more than just a fun little action film. It has some great moments and if you've seen the other three films then definitely see this one, but don't expect the kind of quality you are used to with this franchise.",Alien - Resurrection

122,The_Movie_Cat,Weakest of the series,4,26 November 2000,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSI couldn't believe Resurrection the first time I saw it. Isn't the biggest pile of pants you've ever seen? Well, maybe not. Second time around, I didn't find this low-brow edition so bad, though maybe that's because this time I'd won a free ticket. And can you really blame the producers for making it this way? After the failure of the introspective third, the logical progression would be to return to the previously successful format.Where the first two sequels had used Alien as their template, Resurrection seems to think James Cameron's was the first film. Categorically set 200 years after the third, which was set possibly 200 years after the second, we get an action movie c.2299 with excessive gore and wisecracks. And that's really what dismayed me the first time. For while the movie never gets out of it's mainstream trough, the last twenty minutes scrape the barrel for tacky excess. Worst moment has to be the guy with an alien inside him who gets shot multiple times then bangs a man's face against a steel bar. With the man's head at waist level, he screams, and the camera pans down his throat to endoscopically reveal the alien. Then the alien rips through his ribcage, and in so doing tears through the face of the other man, all in blood-spattered detail. Or maybe you prefer the bit where the General picks his own brain out the back of his head, or the alien's guts getting sucked out of a g-force crack in slow motion. Just have a glance through this entry's ""quotes"" section. Nearly the entire list contains profanity or crude sexual references, clearly indicating the mentality of the piece.But away from the juvenile gore, the underwritten characters and the non-literary narrative, there are some good points. The aliens themselves are utilised better here than in the third, probably because the ""Rottweiler"" alien could never be played by a man in a suit. CGI is used, but sparingly. Still a little primitive, (note to CGI workers on soon-to-be-made Alien 5: the aliens are black, so why design them as silver?), but rarely used, it is passable. The aliens are shown to be intelligent, a throwback to the lift-operators of Aliens. Again, there is no horror, but that is because the creatures are perhaps over-familiar to audiences now. In fact, so docile are these aliens that this is the only film in the series with more than four survivors. The use of clones to bring back Ripley seems more of a logical plot extension than the gimmick it seemed first time around, and this does add an interesting slant to her hybrid character. Though once more, this doesn't really add to the dramatic tension, as the new, sexual Ripley, amazed she's alive again, doesn't care whether or not she lives.Ultimately, though, it comes down to who's your favourite Spice Girl? Scary? Action? Moody? Or Dumb Spice? They are the products of four very different writers and directors and do not gel together particularly well as a whole. Taken alone, Aliens is great entertainment. Watched concurrently with Alien, it's mindless slop. Yet while they're all entertaining, none of them, not even the first, have got above a ""7"" rating from me. For whatever you say about these four movies, they are just ""bug-eyed monster from outer space"" vehicles, the original no-brainers. Maybe that's why the fourth really disappoints. The first three try to disguise this fact, the fourth makes a celebration of it. 4/10.",Alien - Resurrection
123,fernandoschiavi,"The Resurrection searches for a new beginning, however the film lacks the fragility that such changes are presented, due to the absence of justifications",5,2 November 2020,"When Alien was released in 1979, the 8th Passenger had no intention of becoming a franchise - a term that is even more contemporary in the world of cinema. As Hollywood cannot resist a public success, means (and stories) were quickly sought for Lieutenant Ellen Ripley to star sequences - in the plural. From a space traveler, she is transformed into a survivor, then into a combatant, then into the mother of an alien monster, and now, closing the circle, she herself becomes an alien monster. Although Alien 3 and Alien - The Resurrection are films that fall far short of the first two, the character's evolution is undeniably very interesting and even innovative and courageous. Unfortunately, this sequence results in the sum of everything we see boils down to a great and poorly made recycling of concepts presented in the previous episodes - either in the little creative plot or in the characters that get lost in clichÃÂ©s that the series itself created.Joss Whedon's script focuses on genetic engineering. The Ellen Ripley seen is a clone, revived 200 years after the heroic attempt to extinguish the aliens - obvious ease in making possible the pursuit of such a lucrative franchise. Alien: The Resurrection is hesitant between pertinent discussions and the ""need"" to offer frantic action. Examples of under-exploitation, the crew mercenaries of the Betty ship, appear only as prey to be slaughtered sequentially, without much dramatic effect beyond pure support. This fourth part only exists for overtly commercial reasons, coupled with a hint of disappointment caused by what should have been the end of the series. Still, it offers some interesting and original elements, when analyzing the Ripley saga as a whole. Starting with the character's own moment, now a clone, being part human, part alien. Such a characteristic not only allows for such a resurrection of the title, even though the reason why this happened just 200 years later is never justified, as a real transformation in the character. Safer and more decisive thanks to the conquered powers, Ripley appears somewhat dubious, provocative and even seductive - with men and aliens, it is worth mentioning.Although his Alien: Resurrection presents some script problems that could compromise the film, the visual solutions found by the director and the good performances of the main actors end up paying off. Screenwriter Joss Whedon himself admits, for example, that Ripley's 'cloning' was a forced but necessary solution. After all, how else could they bring Sigourney Weaver back to the series? Despite this, Whedon found an interesting way to 'tie' his solution to the context of the series. Alien: Resurrection is a mixture of the first three films. From the first, Ridley Scott's classic, he inherits Ripley's innocence and idealism. Only now, the naive and idealistic character is Winona Ryder. From the second film, by James Cameron, comes the constant, unrestrained action (despite the slowness of the first 20 minutes of this fourth film). And finally, from the third (directed by David Fincher), we have the emotional complexity and bitterness of Ripley. Together, these elements create a tense and well-structured story.
Sigourney Weaver has a good time. One of the best scenes in Alien 4 is one in which Ripley (or 'Number 8') finds the other 7 clones made from his blood - in fact, genetic aberrations, experiments with bad results. His astonishment and suffering are perfectly portrayed, including this scene among the many memorable sequences in the Alien series. On the other hand, the idea of bringing the character in the form of a clone manages to mischaracterize Ripley in a frightening way, being unlike anything seen before, completely disfiguring his persona. At one point, she looks less human and even says, ""Who do I have to sleep with to get off this ship?"" Seriously, Ripley would never say that. Weaver, obviously already quite used to his role, makes an almost robotic Ripley, perhaps due to the hybrid nature of his character. It turns out that Ripley is not a robot, but Weaver gets stuck in this kind of acting limbo, unable to find himself.In the rest of the cast, we have the beautiful and talented Winona Rider (from Black Swan, 2011) as Annalee Call - the most intriguing character in the film, who not only recovers the technological side that has existed since the original film but advances towards artificially constructed humanity, something wide open when analyzing his behavior towards his spaceship colleagues. Dan Hedaya, for his part, takes the bias of human greed in an absolutely caricature, while Brad Dourif embodies the eternal human aspiration to become, also, creator - which, curiously, will only be worked with more depth in the preludes Prometheus and Alien: Covenant, produced years later.Thanks to the superficial approach of the plot, none of these characters has any kind of depth, even the smallest one (or the minimum expected from a production of the type); it is obviously impossible to empathize with these expressionless figures, without a past and without charisma. Better not to despair, we can only hope that they will be devoured as quickly as possible. The group of mercenaries comes on board, without any minimally plausible excuse, an intrusion that includes contact with the former lieutenant, who proves to be a basketball genius, the perfect combat and predation machine, and with skills similar to xenomorphs, such as corrosive blood property. The squad of assassins, which at first should have been a version of the Aliens - Rescue mariners, is caricatured, with archetypes drawn from cartoons, second only to the stupid scientists who allow one of the creatures to escape, in the most shameful way that the script could build.The most difficult thing is to believe that all these mistakes were orchestrated by the Frenchman Jean-Pierre Jeunet, a filmmaker who brings in his curriculum very interesting works, of very strong visual appeal and incontestable successes of public and criticism such as La citÃÂ© des enfants perdus (1995), Delicatessen (1991) and Le fabuleux destin d'AmÃÂ©lie Poulain (2001). Mysteriously, Jeunet makes an unforgivable mistake, which is to ignore the basic and simple, but efficient, strategy of structuring the ""suspense"" effect - a strategy taught with mastery by the first film in the series. Artifices such as the dark scenes (Alien - The Resurrection is irritatingly well lit), the tight corridors, the claustrophobic mood, the incisive soundtrack (John Frizzell's compositions for the film go totally unnoticed), the rhythm of increasing tension that anticipates a not very optimistic, none of these ideas are used by the filmmaker.
Needless to say, the fantastic look of the creatures designed by H. R. Giger has always been the main attraction of every franchise. But it is not quite like that in Alien: The Resurrection. The producers decided to innovate exactly where they shouldn't. The result was that the design of the creatures turned out to be much less than the original. Right at the beginning, we see a surgery in which a small alien ""puppy"" is removed from Lieutenant Ripley's chest. This puppy grows up and becomes what is called an alien queen (one of the most poorly made creatures in the entire series). To make matters worse, unlike the others of her kind, this queen does not lay eggs; she gives birth to her young in a manner similar to human females. And it is she who will generate the alien protagonist who will face Lieutenant Ripley in the final sequences: an amalgam between a human being and an alien creature.
Although not as engaging as the first two films, Alien: Resurrection has many scares. The problem is that most of these scares are due to unheard-of features: soundtrack suddenly increased; sudden appearances of some character in the frame of the camera, etc. Normally, the series didn't need that. But, let's be fair, this was due to the fact that 'aliens' were misunderstood, mysterious creatures. After three films, there is not much to reveal, anymore. In this last film, therefore, the monsters are seen with unprecedented clarity. Unfortunately, this alien - which was conceived by Jeunet himself and the special effects company Amalgamated Dynamics Incorporated (ADI), the same as Alien 3 - in no way resembles the features of the artist H. R. Gigger. The monster, an animatronic puppet, gained a human appearance that gave him a pathetic air of pity. Yet another great opportunity was missed in the scenes in which the aliens chase their prey under the water. For these sequences, somewhat compromising effects were used in CGI. That is, in terms of visual effects, Alien - The Resurrection was also disapproved; almost 20 years after Alien - The Eighth Passenger, even with a ten times bigger budget and much more advanced technology, the result was shameful. To make up for the lack of surprises, the script creates a new type of alien: the 'Newborn' - a hybrid between the alien species and humans.When analyzing The Resurrection within the Alien series, it is clear that there is a search for a new beginning, based on precepts established there in 1979: strong female characters, the relationship with artificial intelligence, the claustrophobic side. If on the one hand there is the merit of daring to change, no matter how much Ripley's transformation into a superhuman species is questionable, and an effort to build a convincing and even coherent graphic environment, the film lacks especially the fragility with which such changes are presented, due to the absence of justifications. Resurrection almost manages to finish the series in a minimally dignified way, but it skids so much at the end that it can't get past the first trilogy.",Alien - Resurrection

The film has a solid cast of actors.Plot: Alien Resurrection takes place 200 years after Alien 3. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been cloned on the outer space military science vessel USM Auriga using ""blood samples from Fury 16, on ice."" The United Systems Military wants to extract the Alien queen embryo that was implanted in her before her death in Alien 3. After successful extraction of the embryo, the scientists decide to keep the Ripley clone alive for further study. They raise the Alien queen and collect her eggs for further use. As a result of the cloning process, during which Ripley's DNA was mixed with the Alien's, she develops enhanced strength and reflexes, acidic blood, and an empathic link with Aliens.The Betty, a ship full of mercenaries, arrives delivering several kidnapped humans in hypersleep. The military scientists use them as hosts for the Alien facehuggers, raising several adult Aliens for study. The mercenaries encounter Ripley, and their youngest member Call (Winona Ryder) recognizes her name. She attempts to kill Ripley, believing she may be used to create more Aliens, but Call is too late; the Aliens have already matured and quickly escape their confinement, damaging the ship and killing most of its crew. Dr. Wren (J. E. Freeman), one of the ship's scientists, reveals that the Auriga's default command in an emergency situation is to return to Earth. Realizing that this will unleash the Aliens on Earth, Ripley, the mercenaries, Wren, a marine named DiStephano (Raymond Cruz), and a surviving Alien host, Purvis (Leland Orser), attempt to escape on the Betty and destroy the Auriga.As the group makes their way through the damaged ship, several of them are killed by the Aliens. Call is revealed to be an android after Wren betrays the group. Using her abilities to interface with the damaged ship's systems, they set it on a collision course with Earth, hoping that the Aliens will be destroyed in the crash. Ripley learns that the Alien queen has gained a human ability from her DNA as well: now possessing a womb, it can give birth to live offspring without the need for eggs and human hosts. The resulting offspring, which bears a mixture of human and Alien traits, recognizes Ripley as its mother and kills the Alien queen.Ripley and the surviving mercenaries arrive at the Betty. As they launch, the human/Alien hybrid attacks Call. Ripley kills it by using her own acidic blood to burn a hole through a viewing pane, causing the creature to be sucked violently through the small hole and into the vacuum of space. The survivors escape in the Betty as the Auriga collides into Earth.10/10 points.

126,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,"Decent, until...",6,19 April 2004,"*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***OK, so this film was your typical run of the mill Hollywood cash grab. However, being a fan of the Alien films I liked to some extent. Unlike other Alien movies, here you can see Aliens through the work of CGI magic, yes Alien 3 had computer graphics, but the ones here are much much better. So after so many years we finally get a good look at a regular Alien. Also the cloning story is kind of interesting especially since when this movie came out cloning was a hot news item, so you can't really say this film is a piece of trash that came from nowhere.Despite all this this movie has its faults. First is the surprising lack of Aliens. The characters only kill two! I was expecting some balls out gun battles with some crazy stunts and CGI effects, but none of that, though the action scene with the two Aliens is pretty cool. Second, the movie's biggest fault: The last 30 minutes. Basically summed up in a couple of words - Ripley has sex with an Alien queen. From earlier in the film we find out this is the alien she had inside her! Incest? With an Alien? Please, spare me the BS. And then there is the grotesque child monster which is an alien-human hybrid. I was ready to go with the fact that Ripley copulated with the Queen if the resulting Alien was a cool foe that could provide for an exciting climatic action scene. But that didn't happen and the climax is rather dull and the child alien looks quite stupid.Ergo - this film is only for fans of the series, others steer clear. As a fan of the Alien movies I rate this 6/10. It would have been higher if the last part of the movie wasn't so dumb and pointless.Rated R: graphic violence/gore, and profanity",Alien - Resurrection
127,swilliky,A fun expansion of the Alien franchise,6,21 May 2017,"The fourth installment in the Alien franchise resuscitates the series with a clever conceit from the writing of Joss Whedon. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been cloned by remnants of her DNA in order for the military to harvest the xenomorphs. Weyland has long been defunct, bought out by Wal-Mart, but the military of the United Systems is still making the same mistakes by training to gather and harvest the alien creatures. A crew of smugglers led by Elgyn (Michael Wincott) brings a human cargo to the military spaceship in exchange for money and a brief stay. The aliens are tested by the researchers Gediman (Brad Dourif) and Dr. Wren (J.E. Freeman). General Perez (Dan Hedaya) leads the military operation.The aliens learn quickly and kill one of their own to melt through their enclosures and escape. They proceed to kill the military but the smugglers remain alive. Call (Winona Ryder) was secretly working with the smugglers in order to kill Ripley and stop the aliens. Elgyn is killed by the aliens during the initial attack, and the remaining smugglers including Johner (Ron Perlman), Christie (Gary Dourdan), and the handicapped Vriess (Dominique Pinon) attempt to escape. Along with fellow smuggler, Elgyn's lover Hillard (Kim Flowers) and another surviving soldier Distephano (Raymond Cruz), the crew tries to make it past the 12 remaining xenomorphs.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Alien - Resurrection

Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is created by scientists on board an intergalactic research vessel where she's forced to incubate a new generation of aliens. Naturally, they escape...Against all the odds, ALIEN RESURRECTION is a popcorn triumph. The quirky humour evident in previous works by Gallic director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (DELICATESSEN, THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, etc.) has been replaced by an American sensibility - Ripley's clone is much stronger than her 'regular' counterpart, which allows her to physically dominate an otherwise imposing cast of strong alpha males - but the film retains the director's unique visual sense (evident in the fantastic spaceship designs and muted colour scheme), and Joss Whedon's pacy script acknowledges previous entries in this particular franchise whilst adding its own distinctive layers to the mythos. As might be expected, the alien threat has been upgraded and expanded from previous entries, culminating in the emergence of a truly nightmarish (though oddly pathetic) creature during an extended climax which reworks a similar scenario from the original ALIEN (1979) before closing on a uniquely gruesome image of death and horror.Winona Ryder takes second billing as a secretive young woman on a mission to prevent the aliens from making their way to Earth, while Michael Wincott (THE CROW), Ron Perlman (THE NAME OF THE ROSE) and beefcake Gary Dourdan (TV's ""C.S.I. Crime Scene Investigation"") provide excellent support as members of a pirate ship which docks at Ripley's research vessel shortly before chaos descends. Brad Dourif steals the show as a scientist with a hidden agenda (he shares a priceless 'personal' moment with one of the captive aliens when they pause to contemplate one another through a glass partition, one of the best scenes in the entire movie), and Jeunet regular Dominique Pinon makes his Hollywood debut as a disabled member of Wincott's crew whose wheelchair proves a hindrance during their headlong flight from the alien beasties. Mean, moody, but only slightly magnificent, the movie is sleek, engaging and fun. Followed by ""Abbott and Costello Meet the Alien""... er, I mean, AVP: ALIEN VS.

By Blake French:	""Alien Resurrection"" does not carry the tradition brought to us with ""Alien,"" years ago. This film is contrived, flat, and relies heavily on special effects and enormously gruesome creature attacks to pull the movie through a lengthy running time of nearly an hour and fifty minutes. Sure, the visual atmosphere, special alien effects, and science fiction action are all impressive, and I liked much of the film thanks to those elements. I did not care for the movie, however, for many reasons. Mainly due to the absence of a story line beyond scene after scene of violent behavior. 
	The story takes place 200 years after the last ""Alien"" movie. Ripley has been cloned from a drop of her blood and is still the main character. All this takes place on a massive space ship, where the government wishes to breed alien for medical reasons.  Most of the movie takes place on a freighter ran by a homeless crew. Something goes wrong, aliens break out of their restraints, and wreak havoc on most of the members of the crew. However, they have Ripley with them to explain what is going on. One of the group members is named Annalee Call (Winona Ryder), whose identity may not be what it seems. She and the rest of the band are placed in situation after situation with a simple gimmick of how they must reach their way back to earth without aliens on board. Most of the production is spent detailing these situations, and at times, perhaps in a little too much detail. 
	Some of the film's violence gores a little over the edge at times. Lets say an individual excepts the fact that aliens tare off and or crush victims' heads frequently, as well as doing their gobble de gook scare scenes when they kill no one. There are even murder scenes under water, obviously taking some pointers from ""Jaws."" And the stomach churning suction sequence in space where the aliens and the last of the remaining humans are placed on a shuttle, will stick with you long after the ending credits roll by. This is not a movie for the faint of hear, young, or squeamish.Most of the performances were modicum satisfactory, but none were anything noteworthy. Sigourney Weaver is surely running out of energy with the Alien series, and seems a bit lost here. Winona Ryder suffers from the exact same syndrome. Her character inhabits such a big twist near the end of the film, it is a shame that it isn't very effective. Since characters are such in lacking of humanity, and the aliens are so brilliantly crafted, it is hard not to root for the monsters here.Brought to you by 20th Century Fox.",Alien - Resurrection
133,anselmdaniel,Departing from the previous installments,5,16 January 2021,"This review contains spoilers.Alien Resurrection is a science fiction horror movie that premiered in 1997. The movie is directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and with the story written by Joss Whedon. The movie stars Sigourney Weaver as Ripley 8, a clone of the original Ripley and Winona Ryder as Annalee Call. The movie is a follow up to 1992's Alien 3. Ripley is cloned and Weyland-Yutani continues to raise the Xenomorphs.Alien Resurrection is an extremely contrived movie. These is not any reason for this movie to exist other than to create another Alien movie. This movie contrived a ridiculous way to bring back the Xenomorphs. The belief that a clone can contain the Alien embryo is ridiculous and harms the believability of the movie. The movie feels incredibly superfluous because of this aspect.Sigourney Weaver feels weathered from the movie. The script does not give her many opportunities to have a varied performance. Instead the movie uses Ripley as a stoic superhuman which has never been the case in the past Alien movies. This departure is one of the reasons why the movie could not live up to the strengths of the previous installments in the Alien franchise.The story uses the survival elements of the first two movies but it does not execute it well. The movie has a surprising amount of slapstick comedy that is ill fitting for this movie. I did not appreciate that this element was in the movie and it made for a movie that appeared to be parodying the original movies rather than continuing the horror genre.The newer characters do try to give it their all in this movie.

134,SoumikBanerjee25,Worst among the franchise!,4,16 July 2020,"This is the Fourth Instalment in the Alien Franchise, Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a over the top, corny and messed up film that might deliver guilty pleasures to some but a whole load of headaches to the others!Film started in an interesting shape, slowly gravitating towards heavy Sci-Fi approach.
I was seriously craving for more. After a while; writing takes a huge tumble and it becomes a stalemate. As the plot progresses further, the blend of Action and Sci-Fi can easily be noticed. Had the writing and performance been better; this one surely had a spark that could have been utilised for the good. Sadly that wasn't to be.Terribly written dialogues and similarly worse performing actors made the script unbearable at times. Overly dramatized sequences ruined the eccentric vibe and Corny & Cheesy dialogue deliveries made it even worse. Apart from Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley; Others were forgettable and lacks depth. Characterization is one of the weakest link here; hence I couldn't care for any of them nor that I wanted to.If you have been following my reviews lately, you know how much I praised technicalities in previous productions but this time that too has some serious issues on its hand. Especially the Cinematography!
What about those awkard zoom in, zoom out pan shots whenever there's a hint of action or tension comes up on screen? How about the Bizarre editing? That transitions in a messy incoherent fashion all the time! And what's wrong with the soundtrack? Lame and disappointing for sure!Fortunately the CGI looked decent except few places where it seemed cheap. Overall the VFX department had done a better job considering the other departments' progress reports.Before I finish...Finally after the completion of Alien Franchise, I must provide some pointers.# If you love Pure Atmospheric Horror Go & Watch ""Alien (1979)"" by Ridley Scott.# If you're someone who prefers blockbusters more and enjoy typical big budget Hollywood movies then ""Aliens (1986)"" by James Cameron is the one for you!# If you have become enthusiastic about Alien Franchise then Finish the third movie as well i.e. ""Alien 3"".

140,dr_foreman,The weakest link,2,27 June 2008,"Ugly. Slow. Tacky. Stupid. I have a truckload of negative adjectives that I feel like applying to Alien: Resurrection, and I think they all fit.I know some people don't share my appreciation for Alien 3, but good grief, I think it's miles better than this installment. Indeed, Alien: Resurrection strikes me as one of those train-wreck movies that leaves the average viewer scratching her head, wondering why a studio would ever give the green light to such a misguided project.Alien 3, unpopular though it was, brought the Alien saga to a very definite close by killing off the protagonist, Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. In this film, Ripley is not-very-convincingly brought back to life as a clone. Indeed, this whole movie focuses on the cloning issue to the exclusion of all else; it's clearly trying to say something about genetic manipulation, or parenthood, or whatever, but the message (if any) is lost in a quagmire of grossness and bad writing.Speaking of bad writing, the movie's scriptwriter was none other than Joss Whedon, he of ""Buffy"" fame. I gather that Whedon has sort of disowned Alien: Resurrection because he doesn't like the way his script was realized, but I'd argue that the script was fundamentally unsound to begin with. It's loaded with techno-babble, profanity and pilfered ideas, and populated by a cast of seedy, cardboard and thoroughly unlikable characters. Apart from Ripley, the only character who gets any development is Winona Ryder's cyborg-lady, but Ryder's acting stinks and her motivations aren't that interesting anyway.Really, this film is the worst possible blend of elements from previous Alien movies. Unlike the first Alien and Alien 3, it lacks the presence of a single, unstoppable, awesome alien creature - and unlike Aliens, it lacks the excitement of a whole hoard of alien creatures. In Alien: Resurrection, there are 12 *somewhat stoppable* aliens - ho, hum. So we haven't got the sheer terror value of the first film here, or the raw energy of the second. We've got 12 aliens milling around yet another boring spaceship setting. What an ill-conceived idea.There's only one really good scene in this film - the underwater action segment, which is more sophisticated than any of the battles in the other Alien films. But since I don't care about the characters, I don't care about who dies in that scene. And, apart from that one exciting bit, the film has few merits, choosing to get mired again and again in disgusting concepts and disgusting imagery of mutants, clones, and a half-Alien half-human creature with saggy boobs. Gross.If the tagline for the second film was ""this time, it's war,"" the tagline for this one should have been, ""this time, bring a barf bag."" Or, better yet, ""this time...stay home.""

Things don't stay as plan when they escaped while the Queen is breeding a new kind of alien.Written by Joss Whedon, the guy who wrote Buffy, Firefly, Toys story and so on; this guy got his own fans – whatever he does or he touches turn into gold for them. Sadly it ain't me, I see movie for what it is. And despite the great potential in this movie – it fail.I do not blame Joss for this failure since there seem to be quite a change in the script and how it was executed. But overall there ain't anything much in the storyline to hold on to. It was kinda lame and predictable storyline (maybe in 1997 it was awesome, but in 21st century it wasn't – it was dated). The only memorable scene might be the underwater fight (still, it last only few minutes).What I suspect was there has been a great influence from the studio to change the feel of the movie (almost half of budget has been cut) and the story and production design has been change. The movie feels like an ordinary - man versus extraterrestrial movie and not an ALIEN movie. It is not much of a thriller ride anymore.Anyway I don't get why they always give to the project to the unknown director (first it was James Cameron, and then it was David Fincher, now this - Jean-Pierre Jeunet). (James only did Terminator and Piranha) (David only did commercial before that) (Jean can't even speak English – maybe that is the reason he can't communicate with the rest of the crews and casts).Overall the movie lacks the very ALIEN feel of the first three that very unique in its own way. This was very commercial. The story was weak and the execution wasn't very plane movie – nothing really stand out. Not even the newly hybrid Alien that suppose to be one of the most fearsome creature in the universe. It was disappointment.Recommendation: Sure why not, it wasn't all bad if you have low expectation and not compares it to its predecessor.Rating: 5/10 (Grade: C-)",Alien - Resurrection
142,LoneWolfAndCub,"Terrible Alien Movie, A Little Better Than AVP",4,28 January 2006,"Alien Resurrection is a HUGE disappointment to the Alien saga. Alien was brilliant, Aliens was different, but still very good and Alien 3 is also a masterpiece. Alien Resurrection can't compare to any of these. It is NOT scary, NOT tense, NOT claustrophobic and some bits are downright stupid.After Ripley's suicide in Alien 3, scientists try to clone. After many failures they finally are able to clone her, and the Alien inside of her. No sooner have they cloned her, do the Aliens escape and create a ruckus. Along with the crew of the Betty, Ripley must find a way to escape.Sigourney Weaver returns as Ripley and she does a pretty good job. Winona Ryder offers support, along with an OK cast. But, its not the cast that lets this down, it's the script and the silliness of the story.This is for hardcore Alien fans and I MEAN hardcore, I loved the first three and I was majorly disappointed by this.2/5.",Alien - Resurrection

Ripley (long dead) lives on in clones grown by evil military scientists on a space station for the purpose of hosting alien babies. Yes, these stupid humans see aliens as a species to be exploited.One Ripley-like clone (not quite human, well played once again by Sigourney Weaver) knows better. When all goes wrong (as she and you know it will), she's joined by a hard-core mercenary crew (including Winona Rider and Ron Perlman) in an effort to escape the doomed space station.Despite the time leap, this movie captures the spirit of the first and second films. Weaver is great, as are the rest of the cast. Lots of gore, near misses, slimy alien craziness. The clones and crossbreeding were suitably horrifying. Well executed, some good lines, some interesting scenes, a few real surprises. There are some scenes here that are difficult to forget. It's all steel, weaponry, toughness, sweat.This movie impressed me 20 years ago, and I enjoyed it again just now. I'd give it an 8, but I'm rounding it down to 7 because, well, it's the fourth in the series and I'm tired of it. I don't think they need to do a fifth film.

144,departed07,"Better than Alien 3, but not the same",7,19 February 2008,"Alien 3 was a survival movie without any weapons in a prison camp. I hated the film so much that I consider it the weakest of the saga. I couldn't even care for the Ellen Ripley character where even after her death, I was glad the film was over.Alien: Resurrection is the fourth film in the series where the writers figured out a way to bring back the Ellen Ripley character just so it can make more money and show more blood. In this saga, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is a clone lab rat where the doctors want to see what they can do to her after being resurrected. Not only is she a lab rat, but the doctors and scientist have managed to capture the aliens and the queen and test them like lab rats along with bringing the queen's eggs and experiment human guinea pigs.Other cast members include Winona Ryder as Annalee Call, a member of a mercenary team led by Michael Wincott where other supporting characters include Ron Pearlman as a hotshot gun-shooter who remains a likable for the fans to enjoy. Brad Dourif (the voice of Chucky) is a doctor who gets victim to one of the experiments; Dan Hedaya has a short role as a general while Leland Orser has the same psychotic energy he brought in Seven (1995).What saves this movie is the action and usage of guns compared to the survival and no weaponry of Alien 3.

147,harryplinkett14,Moronic film,1,22 September 2014,"Where does one even begin? I guess the first thing I want to say is that this film has absolutely no redeeming features whatsoever. There is not a single line of dialogue, a single shot, a single performance or detail that is actually good.So let's get to the bad things, then.The director. That deranged, surrealist Frenchman should never have had anything to do with the project. The script. It is as though it was intended as a kind of parody of the Alien films, which was a horrible idea. But in the hands of the aforementioned director this would-be parody becomes a surreal mess that is simply unwatchable.The cast/characters. Winona Ryder's character is irritating and irrelevant for the plot. Come to think of it, all of these characters are irrelevant. They just run around while we wait to see how many will make it until the end of the film. Sigourney Weaver is now a psychotic bitch, which means she talks nonsense and none of her actions seem to have a discernible motivation. Dan Hedaya plays a general whose character is straight out of a cartoon. Seeing him do these comedic bits is probably the first shocking thing. A film that starts like a straight horror in space takes a strange turn as soon as he enters the stage, and the confusion thus created never ceases. Of course, the confusion and incredulity are exacerbated by further......Nonsensical moments. A guy fires a gun at an angled surface on the ceiling, thus shooting an adversary. This is straight out of Looney Toons. To make it more baffling, that same character cannot hit an alien from three feet away, even after unloading an entire clip at it. Then he falls into a pool of water and everyone assumes he is dead. Why is he dead? Can he not swim back to the surface? Who knows. And who cares? The director certainly doesn't care, so why should we? But let's look at the very basics: They are running this super secret, expensive project... which relies on services provided by space pirates. They breed aliens that bleed acid... in containers that are not resilient to acid. They are a military facility, crawling with troops, yet they never even attempt to contain the escaped aliens. For some reason, they just run for their lives without even taking the time to assess the situation. Was that their emergency plan from the start? Run for your life? And just to make things even more interesting, the ship is programmed to return to Earth... in case deadly aliens break loose, making the entire garrison flee in disarray. Great idea. By the way, although the ship is supposed to be far away, far from sight of the various government agencies, it makes the trip to Earth in a matter of hours. I guess it makes sense the crazy Frenchman took the job as the director - no one else would touch it, while he clearly couldn't care less about plausibility and saw the whole thing as a way of shoving in some of his favourite implausible plot elements. I'd like to point out another inconsistency here: the plot only seems to remember aliens bleed acid when it needs the acid to be used to make the aliens escape or to help Ripley cut something open with her own, acidic blood (the result of cloning). In other situations, aliens that have been shot dead do not bleed acid. The script simply doesn't care. The alien hybrid. Apparently alien has been fused with human DNA and is now being born like a human baby, and looks like Pumpkinhead. You don't know whether to laugh or just feel uncomfortable watching that thing.The lesbian overtones. Ripley is not only psychotic, apparently she is now a lesbian as well. I guess they thought that they could score some points for that. But Ripley looks godawful and frankly watching her make sexual advances towards that little twerp Wiynona Ryder is just creepy.Boring. Yes, it's boring. We couldn't care less about the characters - in fact, they are quite unlikable so we might find ourselves cheering for the aliens to get them. And when they do get them, it doesn't involve suspenseful scenes. The only action scene people will remember from this film is the one where they are being chased by aliens under water. It's interesting to see aliens swim, but then again, they do not look convincing at all. They are being chased by CGI. Ending. I have no idea how it ends. I have seen this film several times and by the time Pumpkinhead makes its appearance I am sick of it. By the time we get to about ten minutes before the end I can't take it any more. I know how it ends, though, but only because I have seen some reviews of the film on Youtube. I literally cannot endure to watch this nonsense until the end.So there you have it. You still want to watch this thing? It just occurred to me that I somehow still haven't been able to explain just how awful the viewing experience of Alien Resurrection is. I guess that final touch of awfulness comes from the French auteur himself. Think of Alien Resurrection as a cinematic turd with an attitude.",Alien - Resurrection
148,PeachHamBeach,"As a standalone, fun & surprising, as a part of the ALIEN legacy, kind of silly!!!",4,22 December 2014,"PLEASE, BE SMART. IF YOU WANT TO SEE THIS FILM AND DON'T WANT SPOILERS, DON'T READ THIS REVIEW!!!!!!!!! ALIEN: scifi, drama, horror, with a first-rate cast and very spare dry comic relief. ALIENS: scifi,action, horror, with a VERY likable cast, and some fitting comic hysteria from Bill Paxton. ALIEN 3: scifi, drama, horror, a very gifted first time director, and again, very spare comedy, almost no comedy at all, and acting wise, surprising for all of its other disappointments.ALIEN: RESURRECTION...hmmmm...as a standalone movie, this is kind of a treat as a scifi, horror, camp-comedy. Some pluses: Like ALIENS, it has a lot of action and gunplay, and like ALIENS, it has human villains and hordes of vicious aliens. And I LOVE John Frizzell's score. Completely awesome, evoking horror and suspense. The only score I like better is Jerry Goldsmith's from ALIEN. The cast is pretty good, though I thought a few characters were pointless.As a member of the ALIEN franchise...perhaps not so much. Minuses: I hated Michael Wincott's sleazy and uninteresting Elgyn and was happy to see him offed early. Kim Flowers' Hillard was pointless as well. Ron Perlman's Johner was insufferable in his character and dialogue: ""So Ripley, I heard you, like, ran into these things before...So, like, what did you do?"" Winona Ryder. As with Ash, there is a big ""reveal"" scene with Call. But she absolutely has no place in this kind of film. Why would an android complain about being ""disgusting""? Just no. Pluses: I liked Dominique Pinon's Vriess most of the time. I liked Gary Dourdan's Christie, but he was one character whose death was not only too damn early in the film, but totally ridiculous. Was it a suicide to save Vriess' life? Or did an alien grab him once he hit the water and take him under and kill him? Hitting the water from a ladder is not instant death, but the way Vriess was wailing, ""Don't do it, Christie!"" you would swear it was! More pluses: Brad Douriff played the 2nd most evil scientist I have ever seen in history. J. E. Freeman narrowly exceeds him. This movie is a great scifi illustration of pure instinct vs. pure evil, and Wren is one evil bird. I have always seen the alien xenomorphs as instinctual creatures, not evil ones. Like lions, tigers and bears, they will kill you, but it's not because they are evil, it's because that is what they are hardwired to do, by God, by nature, by evolution, or whatever. Douriff, Freeman and their cronies? Evil as hell. The unholy glee with which these people watch the facehuggers attacking a crew up KIDNAPPED men is very sickening. So, see below...Big minus: It was bad enough to realize the scientists are evil, no doubt seeking to build an alien army that would strike fear in the hearts of anyone opposing some fascist government somewhere. For this same reason, it was hard to really empathize with any of the pirate crew. The humans are the more evil of the villains. Big plus: The aliens are only animals...at least until now. Sigourney Weaver delivers again, though I'm not sure why anyone felt this film had to be made. Maybe because ALIEN 3 was so dark and ultimately depressing. And most certainly, it's preposterous to think the evil scientists could clone an ALIEN queen, as well as a Ripley, but she is great fun nevertheless. Anyway, this ain't the Ripley who died. In their evil experiment, the scientists created a Ripley who has lots and lots of alien DNA in her. In short, she is an alien who is physically a lot more strong, and mentally, a lot less kind-hearted, than her deceased human ancestor. She has just enough of the real Ripley in her to almost remember Newt, but otherwise, she grins instead of frowning when the evil scientists horribly overestimate their ability to ""tame"" and to ""train"" the aliens, and horribly underestimate the aliens' endless capacity for ingenuity. Because these aliens are also descendants of a human being, Ripley, they are ""smarter,"" and not above killing one of their own and using it as a means of escaping their cells. Of course, the alien in ALIEN and the aliens in ALIENS were descended from humans as well.Ripley 8 is like the aliens, half innocent predatory animal, half intelligent and kind of evil human. She only begins to realize how awful those scientists are when she meets her seven ""sisters"" in the medical lab, how they heartlessly keep one clone alive with tubes and machines. Ripley 8 only begins to become our hero yet again when she decides she must not let her ""children"" live to destroy everyone on pitiful earth, which looks like it's been thru a few nuclear holocausts lately.I see I am really Over-analyzing this movie. It's great to see the evil Wren get his ultimate reward from one of his victims. It's also great to see the other evil scientists end up in cocoons, but wait! The Queen that they created along with Ripley 8, the OTHER mama to the fearsome xenomorphs evolves from having an insect reproductive system to a human one! No more egg-laying!!! What?! Yes, Queenie now has a uterus!!! She's having another baby!!! What a busy Mom!!! And the only thing freakier than the Newborn itself is Douriff's delirious and hilarious verbal cooing, ""Beautiful, beautiful little baby!!!"" That newborn is the stuff of night and daymares, be warned!!! Strangely enough, many, including myself, feel a little sad (as well as VERY repulsed) by the newborn's death sequence.4 out of 10 .",Alien - Resurrection
149,chrisbrown6453,"Ah, the magic of Hollywood!",6,17 May 2002,"Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), last seen leaping into a flaming pit in Alien 3, has been brought back from the dead. Seems she was impregnated before her suicide plunge, and we need her alive and breeding for the popular sci-fi/horror series to continue. Ripley, who has been cloned from a blood sample, has just given birth (would you call this a C-section?) to the ugliest little sucker this side of Uranus. Welcome to Alien Resurrection. This fairly engaging sequel may not be as scary as Ridley Scott's Alien or as action-packed as James Cameron's Aliens, but at least Ripley has hair. Weaver gets some good lines and is an energetic force cloning around at the center of this very particular universe. The supporting cast is colorful too, including Brad Dourif, Ron Perlman and Dominique Pinon.  The Frenchman at the helm certainly has a way with atmosphere. Cinematography, lighting and set design are tops. A terrific underwater chase scene also left me breathless. Too bad much of the plot seems jumbled, at times I just wasn't sure for whom I was supposed to be rooting, or why. The drooling, slimy aliens themselves are technical marvels, I guess, but too familiar to be very frightening. One drawback, Winona Ryder, who seemed to have booked a ride on the wrong flight. Here she's just a little girl lost in space. Interesting note, Aliens Resurrection's screenplay is by Joss Whedon, who also wrote TOY STORY. Now that's a change of pace.",Alien - Resurrection

The added scenes (as far as I could tell) were just a different beginning, a bit of extra (mainly pointless) dialogue and a little bit added to the ending. I think that the theatrical release is better. The film itself is definitely the weakest of the Alien collection. The first three are really good but this one is just a bit crap. Everything about this lacks the standard of the others. The acting is average, the story tot, the direction uninspired, the effects average, the new cycle in the Alien's life at the end pure garbage and overall very forgettable and pointless fourth installment in a strong trilogy.

151,lagudafuad,Not bad,7,11 April 2012,"The fourth installment in the Alien Franchise was Alien Resurrection which had Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), cloned after she died 200 years ago in Alien 3. The cloned Ripley had in her, the DNA of the Alien so what they company had ""CLONED"" was a hybrid, a human and the alien DNA mixed.The new Ripley had in her chest the Queen Embryo, which was removed as soon as the cloning process was a success, and she was studied and she bred a new kind of Alien.Well, the company also had Alien eggs and they captured men in hyper-sleep and used them to breed the Alien. They caged them and tried to train them but soon the Aliens got smart and broke free and again all hell broke loose.What makes this last installment to the franchise good was the suspense, in every turn there is something you thought you had figured out till it changes the next second making the story also dynamic. Written by Joss Whedon, who had worked on Buffy the Vampire slayer before this, the story and screenplay had enough action to keep you on the edge of your sit.The actors were on their toes delivering their lines and their interpretation of character with finesse. Another thing that did it for me was the idea to use the Alien's blood as part of the script, not much about this acid blood has occurred in the previous two installments. But here it played a vital role in the story.It was also directed by another director, a French director Jean-Pierre who I have to give kudos to, as he did a fine job in delivery. The CGI and the effects in this installment was better than all previous 3 put together, and it has to be said even though this is not better than 2 (Aliens (1986)), it redeemed the image of the franchise.All in all, it is not a bad re watch.",Alien - Resurrection

You'd think that after the ending of Alien 3, they would have stopped making movies. Then upon first hearing of a 4th, people were probably thinking negative thoughts already. However, as a surprise to everyone, this is not a bad movie. However, I did NOT say it was without its share of flaws and holes. Sigourney Weaver amazingly returns AGAIN as Ripley and manages to play her very well again, however she is very different in this movie than in the other 3 and I personally have to say sometimes her performance here is rather irritating. Ron Perlman plays the loud-mouthed Johner very well actually, considering the ""cool/laid back"" personality he appears to have. Wynona Rider is actually sort of annoying in this movie but I can't say she should be replaced. Gary Dourdan is also very good as Christie. Brad Dourif was excellent as Dr. Jonathan Gediman also.

The movie was solely made just to cash in on the title without having any creativity or narrative to the stories franchise whatsoever. The thought of bringing Ripley back as a clone is just an outrageous plot line to begin with. Ripley's character completely 180'd in attitude and spirit and other characters in the film are weak, stale and have little character development. The vast majority of this movie is just a big stretch including the ending.

It's probably what lured her back a fourth time, playing such a wild variation of the character.

155,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,7,13 April 2005,"The final entry in the series, so far, and perhaps one entry too far considering Ripley's nightmare was finally ended in Alien 3. However, as is the case with nightmares, they always find a way back. Being 1997, DNA and cloning was all the rage so the guys in charge decided to bring Ripley back using advanced cloning techniques 200 years after her death. With Jeunet directing, one of the most original upcoming directors, and Joss Whedon with the script this had potential, and all thoughts were of taking the series back to an action style. Get together a talented cast and this should have been much better. Though for some reason it simply does not live up to the hype.Those evil scientists have been chasing the alien Ripley encountered for centuries now, and finally after many failed attempts they managed to clone Ripley with the Alien DNA inside her. Using this they created a number of Aliens for observation, but Ripley has also become a cross-breed with all the strengths of both species. Meanwhile a cargo ship has landed on the floating base where these experiments are being made, and soon the aliens have found a way to escape. Most employees try to flee, leaving the cargo crew and Ripley to fend off the aliens. Though it is uncertain which side Ripley is on. As they try to escape The Queen gives birth to a new breed of Alien, more deadly than all the rest. Their ship is drifting towards Earth, and if the creature makes it there, humanity could be over.The inclusion of quality actors such as Ryder, Perlman and Wincott add to the film's strengths, but the whole thing seems hollow, lacking both the excitement of Aliens and the scares of Alien. There are twists, lots of gore, some good effects and ideas, but perhaps it tries to be too clever for one movie. Mostly the performances are good, though most of the characters are not given a chance to grow or get our sympathy. Weaver is again good as the new Ripley, but one of the main good points of the other entries was that she was human, mortal, weak but when in danger would fight. Now we cannot relate to her and none of the other characters really draw our attention as they are all cold and hardened smugglers. Only Ryder gets some emotional value, but then again she has a twist in store for the viewer. It seems to be a film which tries to blend all of the past films into one, and therefore does not excel in any one place. The visuals are very good, as are the sets etc, but with this series we have come to want excellence.7 out of 10",Alien - Resurrection

Winona Ryder - wow, talk about a terrible performance. Far too much attitude in her android. The script is pretty bad; the terrible acting combined with cheesy dialogue makes it sound even worse. Not to mention the story is just lame. The 'love scene' was one of the funniest scenes I've ever watched. The visuals are a marked improvement over the other films, but it's to no avail. The underwater scene is kinda cool, but ruined by the acting; the scene with the hybrid getting sucked out of a tiny hole in the window is incredibly gory, but, again, ruined by Weaver's crying face.

157,TheEmulator23,Better as time goes,7,14 January 2006,"I am probably biased, OK not probably... I am, but this film was better when you see the directors cut as part of the Alien Quadrilogy, with half-assed special effects and all. Is it a classic, well no it it is not, but compared to all the crap that came out in 2005, well yeah it could be considered a decent film. I am willing to be that Joss, (Whedon that is who wrote the screenplay I believe) has had many more ideas of what else he could have changed and/or added since he wrote this many years ago. All in all if you are a fan of what Ridley Scott's original 1979 ""Alien"" was or James Cameron's ""Aliens"" and even David Fichners ""Alien 3"" you will enjoy this film. I know myself and others would go and watch every single ""Alien"" film even if they made 50 of them. Sigourney seemed to kind of phoned this one in as well as Winona, (even though Winona really seemed to try, she was just not suited and or believable in her role.) The main problem to me seemed that there were way too many throw-away characters. Granted in a film like this we know that most of them are not going to make it, but it just seemed like they weren't trying to give any sort of personality at all. I have seen much worse and all in all this is not a bad film, hell the whole mutant ""Ripley"" lab thing as been made fun of and teased to death, so obviously people enjoyed parts of this film at the very least! If the ever do make a 5th film, it needs to be focused more on the ""Aliens"" and have very little to do with Ripley's character, if at all. If you love the original, at least see the sequels, (especially the sequel ""Aliens"") so you know what else is left in this franchise so it can be possibly resurrected. It is looking less and less likely now that it has been almost 10 years since the last film. I just hope that this isn't abandoned because there are so many more stories that we have not explored yet. But when in doubt thank the original director Ridley for welcoming us to a new type of film and has had a bunch of copycats since, but no one can come close to this original.",Alien - Resurrection

Alien 4 would have been a brilliant movie if the other three weren't around but now it's just a sort of rip-off from a rip-off.

It steals left and right from the other films: the traitor from Alien, the guns and action of Aliens, the color palette of Alien 3... Joss Whedon's screenplay tries to shoehorn in character prototypes from his aborted ""Firefly"", and Jeunet's bite is less fierce without Marc Caro.

The Alien saga is unique because it has two central pillars: - strong main character - fascinating mythology left almost completely unexploredAll successful film series built around a recurring film character are either episodically built around a main conflict (Harry Potter) or inevitably are ""comedies"" because there's only so much a main character can take (Indiana Jones and James Bond, we're looking at you).The Alien saga could have gone back to the roots of the mythology Ridley Scott and Giger brushed up against in part 1. Instead it tried to emulate what James Cameron did in part 2. It worked in part 2 because Ripley was playing against type, an emotionally limited intellectual having to be a soldier and a mother, and face her worst fears. We were all the better for it.And then came parts 3 and 4, and while the budgets rose, the ideas dwindled. Attempts to breathe new life in got stiffed, and however bonkers - Vincent Ward's medieval take, watch the DVD special features to believe it - original concepts were better than what landed on the screen.Maybe, more than anything, this is a perfect case-study for how badly Hollywood can treat its star franchises: with total aversion for risk-taking. Nobody expected the first film, and it reinvented horror aesthetics. Few people knew what to expect from the second one, and James Cameron turned the tables on them. But as the franchise grew in fame, so did the stakes, and for all the talented people involved behind the camera - Giger, Fincher, Jeunet, Ward... - the series lost the power to awe and terrify us.And now, after all these years, we are headed back to the darkest recesses of Scott and Giger's minds, with Prometheus.We will see what that brings. Its colossal budget might bode ill, its refusal to claim too close a relation to the Alien universe is probably wise. Until then, we will have the sometimes fascinating wreckage that are Aliens 3 and 4 to marvel at.",Alien - Resurrection

164,Cinema_Fan,Come Fourth and Show Yourself.,6,11 March 2006,"Alien Resurrection here is the fourth movie of the Alien epics, the directional duties are given to Frenchman Jean-Pierre Jeunet. As usual, the writing credits go to Dan O'Bannon, Ronald Shusett, and Joss Whedon.Alien Resurrection has a unique blend of individuality, contrast and occasionally containing an analogous trait, where as with the first three movies, which binds in with each other as conjoined triplets, Alien Resurrection breaks free to hold its own pace and style of what is the Alien mould. The concept of Alien Resurrection is not all together unique by any means, but the delivery is done brilliantly and all with the right amount of flair, action, tension and suspense, which are all very good ingredients for any Horror Sci-Fi, the overall effect is a superb conjunction of Sci-Fi and Horror mythology.Using set designs as impressive as these, though a little trite, they do their job well, with the help of Iranian born Darius Khondji as Cinematographer, having also worked with Jean-Pierre Jeunet on Delicatessen, 1991, they have combined their talents to bring a very dark and interesting atmosphere.The panoramic shots of space, and the ships that glide motionless passed our eyes, are done to an impeccable visual detail, this segues the action shots to the scenic views in an artistic manner that is now the high standard of this movie genre.Having physiological mind games played against one another, with the upward spiral of fear and paranoia, the trapped captives and their impending attack from the eleven Alien creatures is done to a fashion that is more than adequate to place any self-respecting Horror Sci-Fi movie as this, in a category of high ranking and World-Class status.",Alien - Resurrection

There are some amusing interspersed with scenes of all out action. The performances are strong if lacking any real standout's. And the special effects are very good.Both Ron Perlman and Dominique Pinon have appeared in previous films for Jeunet who really does seem to have a taste for unique faces which he also gets from Brad Dourif.Jeunet has made two much better films, Delicatessen and the brilliant Amelie.",Alien - Resurrection
167,GeorgeRoots,"In The Multiplex, Everybody Can Hear You Scream.",3,28 June 2014,"This is where the series got REALLY far-fetched and considering what this franchise is about, that's saying something. In the first 5 minutes they completely retcon the final events of ""Alien3"" (1992), by cloning Ripley to the point when she was carrying the Alien. Obviously money grabbing scientist's (One played by Brad Dourif) never learn, and of course (SHOCK) the aliens escape.Our supporting cast comes in the form of mercenaries, namely Winona Ryder and Ron Perlman. Not one of them are likable, but hell what can you do with such a p*ss poor script. Even with Joss Whedon coming off ""Toy Story"" (1995), I just did not connect with it considering how much I am a fan of his other work. And now this is what I really want to dig into, the handling of Ripley is horrendous. As much as I enjoy Sigourney Weaver, even she cannot save this emotionally detached performance. We became her in ""Alien"" (1979), became stronger with her in ""Aliens"" (1986) and ultimately conquered everything by ""Alien3"". There is nothing left to do, and nothing new to overcome as she has pretty much became an alien now (I don't know she has acid blood or something). Some new alien comes along with pinkish flesh and looking back it was ridiculous, telling me that this movie just doesn't know what to do with itself and would rather sacrifice suspense for a few oddities here and there.Final Verdict: When I first saw this, I was 15 and accepted it as decent conclusion to the series. Seven years on however, I can't believe how they got away with something so half-baked. In a sense the movies style is reminiscent of ""Aliens"", but in the end all it does is make you wish you were watching that movie instead of this trash. 3/10.",Alien - Resurrection

169,mnpollio,Beating the dead horse,4,13 April 2011,"If Alien was a sophisticated sci-fi thriller set in outer space, Aliens was a virtual textbook on the correct way to make a sequel and Alien 3 was a wall-to-wall catastrophe that put the nail in the coffin of a stellar series, then Alien: Resurrection is little more than a cheap attempt to wring one more round of cash from a once durable tentpole. After the disastrous third entry, it was difficult to see where this film could go or why enduring leading lady Sigourney Weaver would want to go there with it.A couple of hundred years after the last debacle, the Company has once again launched an effort to clone the aliens and also end up with a bizarre hybrid of Ellen Ripley (Weaver) who also shares alien DNA. During a visit by a group of mercenaries, all hell breaks loose with the aliens going on the rampage and the mercenaries forced into a prickly trust with the hybrid Weaver to escape with their lives intact.On the plus side, while practically nothing works in this sequel, it still manages to surpass the wet fart of Alien 3. Although it would have been in her best interest to take a powder after the prior film, one still has to hand some credit to Weaver for still managing to find new facets to play in a role that should have been played out. The problem here is that Ripley has always been an audience favorite and too much time is spent with the viewer wondering how far this latest incarnation can be trusted. This is a bit sad since this film desperately needs some rooting interest.The screenplay feels like it is at least four drafts from being completed. It is a veritable skeleton, which barely gets its sketchy characters into position before starting the pursuit. It never gives a compelling reason why the Company maintains its compulsion to exploit the aliens, much less why they want a clone of Ripley hanging around. The new characters are without exception badly written and underdeveloped, which means the only way of having any impact is by shamelessly overacting. Ron Perlman, Dominique Pinon, J.E. Freeman and Brad Dourif indulge in laughably hammy over-the-top performances that make them memorable, but not in a good way. Michael Wincott, as the leader of the mercenaries, is barely introduced before being discarded and Dan Hedaya is simply dreadful as the leader of the military contingent on site. Apparently remembering that James Cameron had much success introducing a mother/daughter relationship in Aliens, the filmmakers here try a clumsy stab at the same thing between Weaver and series newcomer Winona Ryder. Unfortunately, the film offers no time for such trivialities like character development, and the dialog is groan-worthy. Ryder spends her time on screen looking ill-at-ease, miscast and fails to find any sort of camaraderie with Weaver, rendering the mentor/student relationship that the film half-heartedly introduces utterly pointless.Director Jeunot's direction reminds one uncomfortably of David Fincher's previous effort, but without some of the ponderousness. The visuals and special effects are merely adequate, trodding ground that the prior entries have done better. Worst of all, this film squanders the opportunity presented by the return of the alien queen by rendering her harmless in favor of an ill-conceived alien/human hybrid that makes an appearance in the final stage of the film. This proves to be one of the most misguided developments because this new creature seems to look upon Weaver at its mother and astonishingly manages the feat of being the only character in the film to elicit any sympathy. The final moments where it is betrayed by its ""mother"" and its all-too-realistic shrieks of agony and looks of uncomprehending betrayal during its uncomfortably protracted death scene serve to emphasize that none of the ""human"" characters that one has wasted an hour or so with previously were remotely as believable or worth their screen time.If one could only scour one's mind of Alien 3 and now this entry (to say nothing of the Alien vs. Predator foolishness), the world would indeed be a better place.",Alien - Resurrection

Certainly this film (directed by French stylist Jean-Pierre Jeunet) is an improvement over Alien 3, with a script that breathes exciting new life into the franchise. This chapter is set even further in the future, where scientists on a space colony have cloned both the alien and Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), who died in Alien 3; in doing so, however, they've mixed alien DNA with Ripley's human chromosomes, which gives Ripley surprising power (and a bad attitude). A band of smugglers comes aboard only to discover the new race of aliens--and when the multi-mouthed melon heads get loose, no place is safe. But, on the plus side, they have Ripley as a guide to help them get out. Winona Ryder is on hand as the smugglers' most unlikely crew member (with a secret of her own), but this one is Sigourney's all the way.",Alien - Resurrection

173,ExpendableMan,Runaway egos and unnecessary sequels,4,23 April 2007,"Back when I was about thirteen, I remember cheering with delight upon hearing that this movie would be made. I was born too late to catch any of the preceding films in the cinema but thanks to play ground gossip and not-entirely-wholesome class mates I'd managed to catch all three on video in those heady few hours between getting home from school and the scramble to hide the boxes when my parents got in from work. Needless to say then, my hormone addled teenage self practically foamed at the mouth at the prospect of more alien carnage, especially when somebody mentioned they were bringing the guns back into the franchise. However, I was of course still too young to see it on the big screen and it wasn't until a plane flight back from Florida a year later that I finally caught Alien: Resurrection in all it's glory. I whooped and hollered with delight and thought it was the most bad ass thing I'd ever seen. However, upon watching it again recently, all it really achieved was reminding me of the old me (which ironically was the young me) and how easily pleased I was. So I guess the whole point of this whimsical and nostalgic tale which has most likely caused the majority of you to skip to the next review down after clicking the ""not useful"" button is simply this; for gun crazy, early teenagers wanting gore, violence and acid bleeding monsters, this is a an absolute must once you've seen Aliens. For the slightly more seasoned film goer however, the ones who would have chosen The Third Man, The Seventh Seal, Cool Runnings or Citizen Kane on the flight instead, Alien: Resurrection is ultimately unrewarding.Now, for all the plus points (Ron Pearlman!), the minus points (alien sex???) and the sitting on the fence points (is Distephano awesome or not? I can't tell), the principle reason for dismissing Alien: Resurrection is this: it's completely and utterly unnecessary. The original trilogy as I'm sure you're well aware runs in sequence quite beautifully. It moves from a haunting, slow paced opener, to a fast paced and action packed middle bit before climaxing in a grim, nihilistic opus of despair. Alien: Resurrection doesn't fit the storyline at all, it feels tacked on, the last slow gasp of the horse as it gets beaten to death. And given that two hundred years after Alien 3, scientists are able to clone Ripley and the alien inside her makes the character's noble sacrifice at the close of the third act less heroic and more of a delaying action.Credit where credit's due though, it does have a very striking visual style. The influence of French director Jean Pierre Jeunet has carried over into the Gilliam-alike cinematography where everything is filmed with muddied, hazy colours and bizarre machinery waits round every corner. The appearance of the scientists in particular is pure nightmare fantasy; all shiny white suits that lead up to heads wearing quirky optic goggles and topped off with slick, greased back hair. The corridors of the ship meanwhile are dimly lit, endless octagonal constructs that fittingly enough, look like the inside of an alien's intestinal tract. Alien: Resurrection may not be the high point of the franchise, but it sure as hell is the weirdest looking one. In fact, the best way to describe the whole thing would be as some kind of dark, science fiction carnival of the grotesque, with the 'grotesque' part ably supplied by a smattering of gore in which the human body is ruined in some incredibly inventive ways (at one point a man quite literally picks apart his own brain).Unfortunately though, imagery, gore and violence alone do not a good movie make. Unless it's 300. 300 was great. But I digress...At the forefront of the problem here is this new version of Ripley. I hate to pass judgement on an actress the calibre of Sigourney Weaver but it does seem as though her ego was left to run rampant on the film every step of the way. This carries over into her performance as well, with this version of Ripley remaining nothing more than an aloof, nonchalant presence to such an extent that even the emotional outpouring when she torches a clone lab feels altogether forced and unnatural. The Ripley of the previous movies was an impassioned and determined survivalist, this one is just sterile. This wouldn't be so bad if the rest of the cast could fill in the blanks but sadly, they're the most uninteresting bunch of xenomorph ready meals yet. There's none of the natural charisma or camaraderie of the marines or the inmates and with the exception of Dominique Pinon as an ass kicking, handicapped mechanic and Ron Pearlman as Ron Pearlman, they're very difficult to root for.By and large then, not a great film. It has its plus points but an uninteresting cast, silly concept and uninspiring heroine bring it down terribly and it's only real worth when compared to the rest of the series is as a catalogue of inventive deaths, best of which is undoubtedly the ""chestburster out the torso and through a man's head"" bit. It all reaches its zenith of course with the unveiling of the new monster, a human/alien hybrid that resembles a New York sanitation commissioner who just had the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man detonate above his head.And Winona Ryder was rubbish.",Alien - Resurrection

I saw it, and during the first few minutes I was semi-enjoying until the corny scene with the bullet bouncing off the walls.Then things got bad to worse amongst some gory scenes which lacked the suspense and the fear elements of the first three. Winona Ryder made a completely lame android compared to Ian Holm and Lance Henrikson. All the characters had no depth, I mean how can an audience feel suspense for an android and a clone with some Alien DNA? The worst aspect of this film is the stupid motherly connection that Ripley had with the main alien who resembled a retarded puppy dog.Besides the cool gore scenes, this film resembled some overblown action film rather than an action/suspense/thriller that James Cameron pulled off with Aliens.The franchise would be hard to take seriously after this film. * out of *****",Alien - Resurrection

The producers and screenwriters found a believable way to bring back Ellen Ripley once again to kick the alien butts. And they've got a good supporting cast of Ron Perlman, Winona Ryder (in a somewhat unusual role), Dan Hedaya and others.Although the film follows a storyline that somehow resembles 'Alien', which is good since Alien 3's complex story was a reason of its failure, 'Resurrection' remained a mediocre film mostly due to lack of twists in the plot and cheesy dialogues. The story is too much linear and the only plot twist involving the character Call was not directly related to the story. Yet the whole alien/human hybrid concept was entertaining enough and the bits of action were made well enough to watch. I feel the film did not aspire to be a cinematic classic like Alien or Aliens, but it did well enough to keep the saga alive after the disappointing Alien 3. It should be well enjoyed by the series fans.",Alien - Resurrection

This is another raging rant on Alien Resurrection! Sigourney Weaver returns as Ellen Ripley and she is a clone now. This must be a joke, why is she a clone now? After 200 years with DNK they cloned Ripley and they took xenomorph queen out of her chests. They grew up in to 2 Aliens and since when an Alien kills his own species? It is beyond me and that was never in Aliens before. The Alien creature can not kill one of his own that is breaking the rules. Aliens creatures have to stick together.This movie lacks the story, or something new or different, it is almost the same as Alien and Aliens. Third movie was boring trash this movie was a little better at least it did had an action and they did not offended me by kill in a dog like Alien 3 did. I like some of the cast: Ron Perlman, Michael Wincott and Kim Flowers I like those three, but that was all. Nothing likable is in this movie there was nothing I liked about.What makes me angry on this film is Sigourney Weaver she is now the mother of these Alien creatures she gave them a birth. She doesn't act like Ripley did in the first two movies. She is not a leader or a bad-ass she is now a selfish clone chick who want's to go out of this ship. She cusses a lot and beats people up. She betrays her own child on the end the film I hate it. I hate this character she is unlikable character. She is no longer a heroine from the first 2 movies sadly she failed. How much was Sigourney Weaver paid for this 2 movies? Sigourney Weaver is selfish, she doesn't care anymore about us fans.The ""newborn"" designed was so disgusting horrible I hate too see that person playing newborn hybrid. It was ugly and I did not like it. The movie was boring, the pacing was slow and it felt been rushed. Alien: Resurrection is a peace trash it can't hold a candle to Alien and Aliens. If people like those 2 movies it is fine I hate them so much!This is forgotten lackluster I really don't have nothing good to say about this movie except it did had happy ending. But I just did not care about other characters in this movie or been killed. Since when Aliens can swim? Or they are intelligent I don't know if they can swim.I hate Alien 3 and I hate so much Alien: Resurrection I don't have those 2 movies on Blu-ray only on DVD for the collection. I do have Alien and Aliens separately on Blu-ray disc. That is why in 5 years I haven't seen Alien 3 or this movie because they are offensive trash movies to me.

The new Ripley is even tougher than before, since some of the alien's DNA mixed with hers. She now has superhuman abilities and can sense when aliens are nearby. A group of mercenaries (headed by Wynona Rider) invade the scientific research ship, which results in the aliens being released. Where ALIEN 3 was dark, dank and depressing, this one is brightly lit and played, at times, for laughs. There's a sense of wonder and excitement at some of the new alien breeds on display here. Performances are, on the whole, good. And the movie's ending brings the series to a satisfying conclusion.

Add in the factor of second and third instalments, both very competent in their own right, and Alien 4 never really stood a chance. Plus, the options for expanding on the theme of 'nasty alien infiltrating spaceship' are severely limited. Given the number of years between these films, it is almost inconceivable that anybody might come to this one without having seen the previous three, perhaps many times.I believe that explains some of the critical reviews, and it does tend to dull the experience even for die-hard fans. I think this movie would stand up in it's own right, but I could never know that. I think the Ripley plot is an interesting twist, and the presence of Winona Ryder is most welcome to me, one of her greatest fans. Ron Perlman is perhaps not at his very best here, but still very watchable. I can't really say this is a bad movie, but it's getting tired now, 18 years after it's incarnation. Perhaps a change of scenery would have helped - space may be big, but it is very 'samey' unfortunately. They say familiarity breeds contempt, and I think that's what I feel for the alien.

She got cloned and had her DNA mixed with another queen alien, that then gave birth to another alien, and now Ripley has moved from being prey, to being mommy.

Alien Resurrection was nothing special to me and it really did not stand out at all.Basically Ripley gets brought back by some scientific process so that they can remove the Queen Alien from her. The people that remove it then plan to use it to produce more aliens that they can use for research with the military. Ripley then has to help a group escape the complex they are on before it is destroyed and also stop the Aliens from getting to Earth.The story was all over. It seemed simple enough at the beginning, but then it got really complex and scientific. Also it had lots of holes in it. If they used a sample of Ripleys blood to bring her back, why would that contain the Queen Alien that was in her? I know breaking down science fiction films is not a good idea, but come on.The aliens are cool as always, but I think they looked better in other films when they were not just CGI. These CGI aliens just look fake to me, and I strongly prefer the aliens from the other films that were guys in costumes. Those looked way more real. Also, in this film why do the aliens roar like lions? They always made that screeching noise in past films, but not this time.The aliens do get in a lot of violence that is pretty cool, probably the most redeeming factor from the film.Ripley is different in this film, not bad just different. Sigourney Weaver does a decent job with the new form of Ripley, part human and deep down part alien. Very layed back and quiet and just odd in a way. More so the directors idea than Weavers I am sure, but I am not entirely sure what to make of Ripley in this film.The other human characters are just bland and not interesting at all. I did not feel like I could get behind any of them. Pretty much the opposite of the film Aliens where there was a great cast of humans that you could root for and felt you understood. Winona Ryder was OK, but probably over rating her because I think she is hot.The idea of having a human and alien hybrid is an interesting idea, albeit a disturbing result.THis is not a great film.

The film also has many great confrontations with the Aliens and the final act of the film provides one of the strangest and most rewarding finishes of any of the Alien films.The film's only real weakness is that it doesn't quite match the emotional conviction of Aliens and the story is more of a wrap up then a stand-alone chapter.

They extract the alien and keep it safe, and Ripley wakes up with superior knowledge as to what has happened to her, and an uncanny ability - her blood is acidic, as is the alien's blood.A gang of roughs including Call (Winona Ryder) arrive on the ship to assist in an illegal transaction for the alien, when the alien (and some of her offspring) escape. Now Ripley must once again battle the aliens that already took her life once.Sure, it's not even close to being as good as ""Alien"" or ""Aliens,"" but when you stack it up against the recent ""AvP"" series, it looks like cinematic genius. Weaver rocked it once again as Ripley, and it's really not a true ""Alien"" movie without her.",Alien - Resurrection
185,kingofdanerds,Alien: Resurrection,4,14 October 2020,"Oh boy. Here it is, the worst Alien film out there. If you really did not like Alien 3, (I liked it) then you will be very dissappointed with Alien: Resurrection. Alien: Resurrection was made in response to the mostly negative feedback of Alien 3. The film had several problems finding a director and even figuring out the best way to end the film. Another problem was trying to get Sigourney Weaver to come back for another film and they did because ""she liked the script"". The film was released in 1997, five years after Alien 3. The film was directed by French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and with a screenplay written by Joss Whedon who is known for writing The Avengers. The film did alright at the box office (by no means the highest grossing film) by making $161.4 million against a $70 million budget. The film got mostly mixed to negative reviews (and strangely has a higher score on the Tomatometer than Alien 3) thus making any hopes for a sequel to the film unlikely.It is 200 years after the events of Alien 3 and we see that military scientists have cloned the famous Ellen Ripley (still not entirely sure why they waited 200 years but alright). They do this in hopes of being able to clone the Alien that was inside her (and I am not sure if that would work either). The military has a bunch of these Aliens that they are using to study and what appears to be them bringing the Aliens to Earth. Some space pirates come on board the ship and some Aliens escape and Ripley (who has some Alien DNA inside her) must decide to either help the humans or not.Let's get this out there. Alien: Resurrection is bad. The first time I watched this film, I was mad at the complete shift in tone from the previous films. This film comes out more as comedic than dark and serious like the previous films and I honestly believe that that is the intention. Well, it is a dumb intention. If Alien was the horror film, Aliens the action film, Alien 3 the melodrama, then Alien: Resurrection is most definitely the comedy. Everything from the laughable dialogue, to just some completely absurd scenes. Wanna see Ellen Ripley play some basketball? Well, this film has it. But, with that aside, there are some serious moments in this film. For example, the cloning room with the failed Ripley's is truly a good scene if you are looking for something that matches the tone of the previous films. But the problem is is that scenes like that add nothing to the story and can easily be removed from the film which is a bummer. If you are also looking for scenes that attempt to match the tone of the previous films then anything scene where a character is by themselves and everything is quiet. A great call back but the problem is is that the overall tone drowns out the other scenes. While there are more Aliens in this film than in the previous film, they just are not scary in this film. Even the Queen Alien who really does nothing much in this film. And yes, there is a Alien hybrid. (That is Alien and human mixed together). First of all, it comes off more as cute and not scary. Alien: Resurrection has a lot of unique and possibly interesting ideas, but they do not add up to much at all. One thing that Alien: Resurrection manages to do somewhat better than Alien 3 is giving characters charisma. Sure, they are not written well but they sure have lots of charisma that makes some of them pretty likeable. They are most definitely not the bald headed men that were in Alien 3. This is probably my least favorite incarnation of Ripley in this film. Yes, I am aware that she is not the same and yes, I am completely aware that she is part Alien. But her actions just come off as uncomfortable. (Rubbing face and all that? No thanks.) Ron Perlman is lots of fun in this film along with a few others (but not Winona Ryder). The practical effects are really good here in this film and there are several instances which have really good practical effects. This film has some of the best kills/gore in any Alien film. Want a frozen nitrogen death? You got it! The CG is pretty obvious here but I won't say it was awful. Much like in my review of Independence Day, the effects might have been good for the time, but now is not that time.Alien: Resurrection fails to be better than Alien 3 (but I somewhat liked that film). The film loses me with the complete change in tone from what was previously a dark and suspenseful film, to a comedic, popcorn flick. It is entertaining to watch, but for die hard fans, this sequel will most likely dissappoint.",Alien - Resurrection

187,yossarian100,Solid entertainment!,10,6 December 2003,"With Resurrection, we finally get to have fun with both the story and the characters, thanks in large part to fine performances by Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder, and Ron Perlman. A French director puts a different spin on the storytelling and makes the movie much more entertaining. In the special edition, there's a funny new opening scene and an even better ending, along with added scenes which go a long way towards making this a better movie. Ripley becomes Maximum Ripley and almost every scene with her is a real jaw dropper. The movie is filled with witty and outrageous dialogue and most of that comes from Ripley.

This is a violent surrealist nightmare that has some really wonderful visuals, and some really bad ones too. I also question the validity of keeping Ripley in the story. I understand why she's there but the character becomes a bit of a joke in this film.I love it for its nastiness, its gore, its attempt at a new direction for the franchise but it doesn't feel like an Alien film to me. It feels like a separate, big budget entity that borrowed from the Alien series but innovatively. I do like it though and it's underrated.",Alien - Resurrection
189,MF210,"Its not the best entry in the Alien Series, but its better than Alien 3",8,13 September 2003,"My Rating: *** out of ****.Alien: Resurrection may not hold a candle to Alien or Aliens, but hey its better than Alien 3. Its obvious that ideas in the Alien series are not too original anymore. It slightly borrows from Alien and really borrows from Aliens. However, Alien: Resurrection is entertaining.The acting is particulary mixed. Sigourney Weaver is quite good here, but I have no idea why she has nail polish on. Winona Ryder is very stiff here, but I think she is miscast. There are only a couple of supporting characters that are likable at all and some arent used at all, they just fade into the background and get eaten by the monsters. Ron Pearlman is actually good, he makes his character likable for being such an asshole.
Alien: Resurrection has some other problems, at times I thought it was kind of stupid and at other times I found it kind of thrilling. The special effects, particulary the ones with the Aliens, are kind of fake looking. The ones with the ship and the planet look quite real. The film also tended to be overvioelnt, but not as gratuitous as Alien 3. The script was also weak, but again not as weak as Alien 3.The one thing I did like about this movie was the idea of a humanlike Alien. I loved the design of the creature. Many people found it disgusting but I thought it was the most original idea of the film. It was kind of weird how he got on the ship at the end but I thought that creature was a brilliant idea.It may not be the best, especially compared to Alien and Aliens, but it is entertaining.",Alien - Resurrection

Don't get me wrong, there is probably more Alien engagement in this movie than any of the previous three films. The ending of course being a very infamous scene. I would say this is a pretty good film, but again I must stress that it seemed rather separate from the original series. I truly have to appreciate the fact that there is more creature feature and not as much human solution.",Alien - Resurrection
192,BrickNash,Great film.....until the end.,8,3 February 2018,"This film can be summed up in one sentence - ""It's fine until the big white thing appears"".This of course refers to the newborn creature which was created for the film (with zero input from Giger I might add). The lumbering atrocity was one of the worst decisions ever made in this franchise and is there for sheer shock value alone. The makers obviously didn't know how to end the movie and so descended into schlock and gore with this horrible beast as some sort of cheap climax which caters for the lowest common denominator. Absolutely unintelligent and utterly tasteless!The rest of the film however, is great! It's a really good, solid action sci-fi with some memorable characters, and there's some really interesting sections like the clone room, the man who is told he is impregnated, and some new behavioural traits from the Aliens themselves. The film wasted a tremendous opportunity by killing off most of the crew from The Betty. They could have very well taken over the franchise from Ripley, becasue we've had the tragic personal tale already, so an ensemble piece concerning mercenaries hunting down the creatures for profit could have really opened up some doors to interesting stories.That being said, the movie could have been a smashing 90s sci-fi film in its own right if it didn't house the Alien name, but the weight of the franchise brand plus some quite awful decisions drag it down to just ""decent but flawed"".Worth watching for the first hour and a half for sure, but after that it descends into gross out pap.",Alien - Resurrection
193,spencergrande6,A goofy B-movie comic book throw-away Alien universe film,6,28 July 2017,"A one-off goofy, campy, B-movie comic book throw-away Alien universe film. One last ride but knowing full well the Ripley saga was truly wrapped up in the last one. Again though, as is the case with this franchise, this film has its own personality, look, feel and genre to call its own.Ripley is a superhero now, and she's explained as emotionally autistic so as to not question why she's so benign the whole film (it's clear Whedon knew not to have her slinging quips the whole film, but he didn't know what else to do with her so he turned her into a superhero, surprise). Whedon apparently complained about the delivery of his lines in this film but I don't know. I think most of the actors are game and his dialogue is just OK.The bigger problems are the lazy plotting (really, 200 years in the future the company still wants an Alien and they still weren't prepared for acid blood? or had a contingency plan in place...) and the lack of characterization of Ripley. There's nowhere else to take her. The only interesting thread involves Ripley kind of becoming an Alien queen at the end (there's mention of cross hybrid DNA) but this an end game play and it's interesting, it's just too bad it doesn't take up more room in the overall film.Jeunet is not suspense generator, nightmare-maker, or an action stager. He has some pretty sets, and does well with the beautiful Alien special effects (not the CGI though, shudder). The only indelible image in the whole thing is the final shot of the new white Alien thing getting sucked out of a tiny hole. That looks painful, and it's harrowing to watch - notice that Ripley is almost crying seeing it. It's almost like the film made Ripley a mom again only to have her rip it away from herself, but I'm not entirely sure the film understood that, or knew what to do with it.",Alien - Resurrection

195,deacon_blues-3,The salvation of the epic saga!,8,20 December 2012,"Say what you will, this installment definitely saved the saga from the premature demise that was almost engineered by Sigourney Weaver when she indulged in way too much PMS hostility toward the series while making Alien3. The slaughter of all our darlings during the course of that film spelled desolation and oblivion for any hope of further sequels. But, lo and behold! Jeunet & company have done the impossible in a very houdinian escape from what looked like certain destruction with this film!I say HOORAH! Yes, it's very icky and slimy in its own way, but is that out of keeping with this tradition? Au contraire!This film also has its own original brand of beauty and elegance, perhaps more than any other installment thus far. Each installment makes its own special contribution: Alien=Atmosphere and suspense. Aliens=Action, adventure, and human interest. Resurrection=Visual effects and sheer creativity. Aliens3=Stupidity and forgettable-ness! The character development is wonderful. Ripley as Alien/human hybrid is a revelation of sinister anti-heroism. The dialog is snappy and often very funny. Ron Perlman is also wonderful as the hulking merc who is devoid of etiquette.I was so relieved when I saw this film! Once again, a great director adds his own genius to the anthology. But I still regret that David Fincher didn't get his fair shot at contributing with Alien3. If only Ms. Weaver had been in a less bitchy frame of mind back then (sigh!)Ah, well!

As in the last film, none of the elements that made the first two ""Alien"" movies so great are present. The premise cloning Ripley, complete with the alien embryo inside her, with a drop of her blood (how did they even find one 200 years afterwards?) just so that they could study a dangerous, long-extinct alien race is completely illogical. Come to think of it, the whole movie is completely illogical. It's easy to see why screenwriter Joss Whedon (of ""Buffy"" fame) was so disappointed with the end results of this movie.I've head talk of the possibility of another ""Alien"" movie being made.

197,twanurit,Tacky,5,22 November 2002,"200 years beyond ""Alien 3"" (1992) scientists have cloned the DNA of Ripley to create an Alien/Human hybrid (Sigourney Weaver). What was a competent end to a thrilling trilogy has over-extended into a mishmash of one-liners and grotesque situations. Weaver, who sported 4 hairstyles from the 4 pictures, here perpetually damp-haired, is exceptional, as usual. Wynona Ryder, pert and small-boned, is mis-cast as a heroic type; other characters are either obnoxious or undeveloped. The Alien costumes, almost black, are ferocious and look great, except for the underwater sequences. There, they are CGI-created, and look cartoony and lack weight and enough blackness. The film's best sequence is an emotional one, with Weaver finding the lab of previous failed dead clone experiments of herself, culminating in the discovery of a live one. The new monster creation at the end looks like an albino Barney the dinosaur. And the climax takes the first two films' endings to despicable extremes, cruel and bloody.",Alien - Resurrection

It still has it's moments, but it's not as good as Alien and Aliens or even Alien3.Acting? It's okay... but could have been a lot better. I have to admit that even Sigourney didn't perform as good as she did in the first 3 films, but then again, she is now in a completely different role.The story is not excellent, nor is it horrible. It's just your standard scenario. There are tons of films who have a story development like this.The effects on the Aliens have once again improved and the creators really like to show it off. Almost every scene where Aliens lurk, they show on the screen. Sometimes full body, other times just heads or claws. This, in my opinion, is bad. The fact that CGI exists doesn't mean you have to show it every 5 minutes or so. They really over-used it and it damages the quality of the movie.A few new twists and better effects.That's basically what Alien: Resurrection adds to the series.It's a shame that this movie ended the Alien saga.

201,lucasversantvoort,"Too postmodern for the franchise, but still quite fun",6,5 May 2015,"I suppose people should have been wary once they saw the subtitle... Alien: Resurrection hit theaters five years after Alien 3 received a mixed response and that's putting it lightly. Whereas 3, while not as tight a film as its predecessors, still had a number of things going for it (dark humor, religious themes, acting), this film is the first within the franchise to suffer from nothing less than a full-on identity crisis.If you thought Alien 3's opening ruined Aliens' happy ending, wait until you see Resurrection's opening: Ripley—and therefore the alien inside her—are brought back from the dead through the wonders of modern science. Yep, no sacrificing herself for humanity this time à la Alien 3; Ripley's just brought back. (Technically though, she's cloned and it's only the eighth one that's a success.) What's especially bad is Ripley could have very plausibly been written out of this film. The doctors extract the alien from her stomach and the lead doctor is asked what they should do with the Ripley clone. He decides that though the alien queen is their priority, they might as well keep her alive for further research. He might as well have shrugged and said ""meh, why not?"" Anyway, the Ripley clone and the alien queen are alive and held in separate parts of a ship that belongs to the military. Then another ship arrives, controlled by a mercenary crew. They're there to deliver some cargo, another ship's (now unconscious) crew. The trade is done and the mercenary group's leader asks if they can stay for a few days. The general in charge of the entire thing agrees. Naturally, things start going south very quickly from here on out. Several aliens birthed by the queen escape and crew-members are quickly picked off. Ripley also escapes and teams up with the mercenaries. The ship is now on auto-pilot and returning to Earth. Realizing it'd be the end of humanity, Ripley and the others seek to simultaneously destroy the ship and escape from it.If Alien 3 sought to replicate Alien in terms of the overall narrative and pacing, then Resurrection is trying to replicate Aliens. There's more action here and much of it is overly choreographed, the worst offender being a bullet that ricochets two times before landing in a guy's dome. And it's scenes like that make you realize you're watching a film that's afraid to be dramatic without simultaneously being self-aware. On the one hand, you've got pretty riveting scenes like the one where Ripley discovers a lab filled with her failed clones, but on the other, you've got stuff like the ricocheting bullet scene. Needless to say, the film doesn't marry these elements together as well as it should. The presence of director Jean Pierre Jeunet and writer Joss Whedon attest to that fact. While Jeunet's sense of visuals ensures the film looks mostly great and atmospheric, one has to agree that the future director of Amelie directing an Alien film isn't a scenario many would label 'ideal'. Writer Whedon has also gone on to claim his final script was adhered to, but executed in a different way than he intended. It's obvious that, despite all the talent involved, there was a lack of a singular vision for Resurrection which resulted in this walking identity crisis of a film. I find it really ironic that what makes Resurrection unique within the franchise is its identity crisis.So what do you do as a viewer? The only way to approach Resurrection is by realizing it's an incredibly self-aware postmodern flick. In other words, lower your expectations. Maybe then you'll get a kick out of the handful of action scenes that are moderately well-executed (the underwater scene) or some of the underdeveloped ideas (the newborn and the concept of cloning). But save for scenes like that, it's as far removed from being a true 'Alien' film as can be. Oh well, at least we got Sigourney Weaver's basketball shot out of it.",Alien - Resurrection

Whedon seems to have a Star Wars hard-on for wisecracking space smugglers who save the day and AR is no exception. How many hackneyed one-liners can you cram into a movie? I lost count after ""Who do I have to f*** to get off this boat."" This isn't a franchise buoyed by timely wisecracks and Whedon's corny writing not only undermines Ripley, but it singlehandedly destroys AR. Considering the abilities of Jeunet and Khondji, who do add a visual flair to this otherwise waste of time, this film is proof positive that Mr. Whedon should stick to writing campy TV shows in lieu of destroying worthwhile movie franchises.",Alien - Resurrection
204,rcolgan,This resurrection should have been aborted,5,25 August 2014,"I'm not certain of why this film came about. Whether it was because of a desire to end the franchise in a better way after the failure of Alien 3 or just cashing in on the name of a popular franchise. Either way Alien Requiem is a weak addition to the Alien franchise and one that does not live up to the legacy that preceded it. This time it doesn't even feel like a sequel, but rather like a reboot. 200 years after she died, Ripley is resurrected by a mad scientist who wants to use her DNA to create a new form of Xenomorph. But the aliens escape their cage using their acid blood (why they didn't put them in a special jail that wouldn't melt with acid is one of many plot holes) and take over the ship. Thus it's up to Ripley and a group of space bandits to defeat the Xenomorphs before they make it to earth. It's a bizarre story that is alright, but out of place for the tone of the franchise.The idea of space bandits is a good one (as evidenced by the fact Whedon used the same idea later to make the hit show Firefly). But unfortunately it is not executed particularly well here. Each character does have a memorable feature that will ensure you do remember the different characters, but it seems to lack the usual quick witted charm that makes most of Whedon's work so memorable. Whedon states the reason for this is a weak execution of the source material and some script changes after his draft. Possibly this comes from the fact that the director Jean Pierre Jeunet's style does not blend well with Whedon's with his melancholy, dramatic approach not being best suited for the script. Unfortunately just like Alien 3, Resurrection screws up the most important thing in the franchise. The Xenomorphs. Once again we see too much of them. What made them so iconic in the first two is that we hardly saw them. It was the fear of the unknown that made them so memorable. Here they appear a no better than some run of the mill monsters. They never feel as if they're too much of a threat and even their designs are different. On top of this they do some incredibly strange plot points with the Xenomorphs, the strangest coming within the final act. Out of nowhere a Xenomorph/human hybrid is born merging Ripleys DNA with the alien. That sentence alone felt strange to write They even attempt to add some drama in to it with the alien viewing Ripley as its mother, even trying to make us feel sorry for it. But when they constantly switch between sympathetic child and murdering monster the whole thing just loses its impact.Ultimately there's nothing in this film that is particularly memorable. There's little reason to watch the film since it doesn't add anything interesting to the franchise. But if you do watch it then don't enter with any expectations.",Alien - Resurrection

Budget $75M; box office $161MThank goodness this movie was better than the 3rd one (which was absolute GARBAGE and got a 1/10 from me).This 4th movie was definitely not as good as the first two (gave them both 10/10), but this 4th movie is refreshingly good. Sigourney Weaver - she brought her A-game, as usual, She always brings it.The third movie - killed the protagonist. Who does that? I guess they wanted to literally kill the possibility of a longer franchise? This movie seems to have tried to fix SOME of the things the 3rd one did wrong. It brought back the protagonist, took the setting to a ship designed similarly as in the first two movies (minus the dark visuals), and it even gave us 3 good supporting cast to become attached to, and a final battle.However, where this movie went wrong was with the fact that it had too much lighting and basically no darkness so it failed to create that famous dark visual appearance of the first two films. The aliens were shown with too much lighting and that was wrong since what makes the aliens so memorable is the fact that the aliens emerge from dark places and from shadows. The first scene when the aliens are introduced was perfect - it was very dark and the camera shots were very close to the aliens' faces and bodies; it was perfect. But the next scenes had too much lighting and that was the wrong thing to do; showing their whole bodies with a lot of light was wrong. The director and cinematographer failed here because it was their job to create a dark and creepy visual atmosphere, and to have the aliens emerge from dark places and shadows; but they failed to do this.Supporting Cast:
There is a 7-person squad of mercenaries but only three had good character development and the other four were forgettable.Winona Ryder (the short-haired girl) - she had the best character development in the supporting cast. Good acting too. Loved her performance.Dominique Pinon (wheelchair guy) - great casting choice. I had zero issues with his performance. I wish he had played a bigger role though. Would it not have been cool to see a badas* guy in a wheelchair shoot up some aliens?Ron Perlman (Hellboy) - he should have been the leader of the squad; why the **** was he not the leader? He had all the traits of a leader. Not making him the leader definitely cost this movie some points. It just did not feel right for Perlman to not be calling the shots. What a blunder in casting!!! He could have offered so much more to this movie; such a shame.The other cast members I was not impressed by at all. They had very minor roles and were easily forgettable.One thing that made the 2nd movie so good is that the supporting cast was properly chosen and the audience actually cared about their fate. So as expected, in this movie I only cared about those characters that were given at least some decent amount of character development (short-haired girl, wheelchair guy, and Hellboy). I actually really liked these three cast members and I am glad that they did not _____ at the end.The monster - it looked cool and terrifying, but it just was not what an Alien is supposed to look like or be. It did not even attack like an alien or move like one. It was a totally different species. However, I was very impressed at the fact that the hideous and despicable monster was able to evoke sympathy and pity from me. That was very impressive and the final scene was difficult to watch because I somehow cared for the monster? I am impressed the writers and everyone who made this scene were able to evoke these emotions from me.Plot - I did not really mind the creative route of this story. I thought it was fine.Conclusion: not as good as the first two, but astronomically better than the third one. This movie can hold its own. It gave us a protagonist and three supporting cast to cheer for and care about. This movie did many things right that were done in the first two movies. The plot is acceptable. The ending was strong and felt right. Any alien fan should definitely watch this one.8/10",Alien - Resurrection

It's a good bit of fun, if you can excuse the abysmal script and acting from the majority of the cast, particularly Razzie dodger Winona Ryder. Yet, in spite of her now ludicrous character, Sigourney Weaver still puts on a damn good show. Controversially, I actually think this film slightly surpasses Alien 3. Or it's at least as bad as it. Unlike the third film, at least you can have a bit of fun watching this one. Gore galore, sleek alien effects and a few moments of well-crafted tension make it okay to sit through.

209,BeanieCore,"The black sheep of the ""Alien"" franchise is good, gory fun.",7,22 November 2020,"Here we have the black sheep of the Alien franchise. After the disaster that was ""Alien 3"", it's obvious that producers were looking to go in the polar opposite direction of that film. So this is a bombastic, almost comic book-like horror/action film. It certainly contains more gore and dark humor than any other film in the series, but in my opinion, it's a welcome divergence. Perhaps it was a bit too much for audiences at the time, and it's far from a perfect film, but also far from bad or mediocre. It hits that sweet spot right between ""decent"" and ""good"", that's simply fun. Screenwriter Joss Whedon was brought on board, so it's no surprise that the film has the feel of a comic. The direction and artistry of Jean-Pierre Jeunet shines through as well. Jeunut was known for his colorful, artistic fantasy films such as ""The City Of Lost Children"" and ""Delicatessen"", and he brings his distinct visual flair to this film, making it easily the most visually stunning installment in the franchise. The effects work is also brilliant. The Xenomorphs are shown far more often in this film than any other, but somehow this works. The focus here isn't so much on suspense or tension, and rather gory, witty fun, so seeing the monsters more often is a given. I'm also of the opinion that the ""hybrid"" creature at the end of the film is terrifying, and one of the most fascinating monster designs in cinematic history.The cast helps keep things moving, with a colorful collection of characters. Sigourney Weaver obviously relishes exploring new aspects of Ripley's character, and spouting more sarcastic one-liners. Ron Perlman steals his scenes as, well, himself, and Dominique Pinon gives the most memorable turn as a wheelchair-bound badass with a heart of gold. And the film is at it's best when delivering crazy action scenes and inventive gore. It's not as strong on story, but the Alien franchise has never been about complex mythology, and this one honestly takes it's plot in some more daring, and interesting directions. It doesn't deserve the ridicule it gets, and I always have tons of fun re-watching it. A shame we never got a continuation of this style and story, because it could've taken the franchise to some creative new places.",Alien - Resurrection

It was unspeakably awful, culminating in Ripley's cuddling up to the Mummy and Daddy Aliens and shedding tears when they died.How is it possible that respected film-makers like Cameron, Fincher and Jeunet, with almost unlimited budgets, can make movies that turn out so awful? I speak here only of the three sequels, not of the original Ridley Scott ""Alien"" from 1979 which was wonderful at that time and is still.""Aliens"" was dreadful, ""Alien 3"" was almost exactly as dreadful and Resurrection was I think just the worst of them all.It is as I've anticipated for years and years after having seen bits and pieces from most of the sequels. The only one worth seeing was the original. Forget the rest. They really are crap, all of them.I bought the four movie Blu-Ray set from Amazon UK for about eight quid not long ago. That was just about the cost of the original alone on Blu-ray and I thought ""Hey, what have I got to lose?"" The answer is, as far as 2, 3 and 4 go, about six and a half hours of viewing total nonsense. Three movies that have no credibility, no script, no acting, nowhere near the original movie's excitement and genuine terror and no merit as cinema.I will continue, as I have for donkey's years, to watch ""Alien"" regularly but I shall studiously avoid all of the sequels.JMV",Alien - Resurrection

215,no-skyline,"Great director, wrong project",5,7 June 2006,"First off J P Jeunet is a great director you need only see Amelie to recognise that, but he is most to blame for this franchise killer of a movie. His style just doesn't suit this kind of action filled popcorn cinema and coupled with some bad casting choices and a mediocre storyline this really is poor.Watch Alien, Aliens or even Alien 3 and they are all far superior to this effort. It's all fairly poor stuff on show here with the exception of one great set piece the underwater alien chase scene is heart stopping. But unfortunately the memory of this is soon erased by the milk baby alien at the end (possibly the worst alien creation i any big budget sci fi movie).Disappointing 5/10",Alien - Resurrection
216,TheSeaLion,"Resurrection is the death of the ""Alien"" franchise",4,14 August 2013,"While I found ""Alien 3"" to not be that great and be extremely mediocre, ""Alien: Resurrection"" proves to be the worst of the ""Alien"" films in my opinion and does many things that I find infuriating in film. The third film had a great ending to it with the intense game of cat and mouse through the prison and Ripley's sacrifice so that the Weyland Corporation could not get its hands on the alien. Everything is tied up nicely and there are no lose ends.Then, along comes ""Alien: Resurrection"", which is the true road to ruin for the ""Alien"" movies. We open up at least a thousand years later after the events of ""Alien 3"". Ripley has been cloned and the Weyland Corporation is also trying to recreate the alien species, succeeding in making several clones using kidnapped humans collected by mercenaries as hosts. The aliens soon mature and escape, damaging the ship.The first things that really infuriated me with this movie was with Ripley being alive because she was cloned. I do not like characters who die to come back to life in movies unless they are like ghosts or the method for their resurrection is set up ahead of time. So, Ripley is alive because she was the star of the first three films so they need her to be in it or it will not be a true ""Alien"" film. That is what it felt like to me.My next biggest issue was with the new creature introduced in the movie. The three movies before it had clever ideas, even if they were mild. ""Alien"" introduced us to the species and the face-huggers, ""Aliens"" gave us the idea of a queen alien, and the third one had an alien but since it came out of a dog and not a human, it behaved a little like a dog would. What this film did was not even remotely clever. They had a half- human half-alien hybrid. This just screams to me that they wanted something new but could not think of something remotely clever so they did one of the most cliché things imaginable, mixing a human with the creature.Another problem I had was with the movie all together. It had nothing for the audience besides aliens hunting down and killing the humans. The characters were uninteresting--not that the characters from the first three films were works of art but they at least made you care--so we did not care if they succeeded or not as the only person we might be able to relate to is Ripley, but she's a clone and not the real Ripley so there is nothing from that. The film is played off more as aliens in ""Poseidon"" as the characters are escaping from a ship, going through different obstacles while aliens instead of rising water are following them. There is little tension as they could easily defeat the aliens. They have firepower and there is less than ten aliens. In ""Alien"" and ""Alien 3"", they had little to no weapons and in ""Aliens"" they had weapons but not enough to fight them all. There was tension with that. In this, the characters are all armed and there are few enough aliens that they could just fight them off, ergo, no tension. To try and compensate for this, they have one mercenary in a wheelchair and a guy with an embryo in him that is about to erupt from his chest, but both of these fail to bring tension to the audience.While I would watch ""Alien: Resurrection"" over other films I have seen, the film fails on multiple levels and takes the ""Alien"" franchise from having an ending that was pretty good to a lousy ending where we are left with our surviving characters sitting around with a ""what happens now?"" thought running through the audience's brains.",Alien - Resurrection

Otherwise, it is a dismal end to what began as innovative, captivating sci/fi horror. Everything about this film screams exploitation, and I am deeply amused at the recurring statement that Weaver only agreed to do the film because of the emotional medical unit scene; I kind of thought the $11 million persuaded her. Clearly, budget problems interfered, and it shows. There is a Disney-esque look to the aliens, especially in the underwater sequences. Worst of all, though, is the dreadful, knowing, irritating clone played by Ripley. I remember thinking that A3, while flawed, was at least a legitimate end to sequels. Too bad. 1 was inspired and stunning. 2 delivered, albeit in schlockmeister Cameron's hands. 3 had a morbidity that gave it integrity.

219,Newsense,Series Termination,1,12 May 2009,"Alien and Aliens were sci-fi classics that can still be enjoyed till this day. Alien 3 was very flawed but it still had its moments. Alien Resurrection is a joke and shouldn't even be mentioned as a part of the Alien trilogy.Plot: Mad scientists clone Ripley to get the alien that was inside of her from the previous episode on the maximum security prison. Later on Ripley stumbles upon a sick experiment to breed aliens with humans.Opinion: At least Alien 3 had a chance to be great. This movie was dead once the plot unfolded within the first ten minutes. Sigourney Weaver telegraphs her performance in, and the rest of the cast does the same. Wynonna Ryder unconvincingly plays an android that was sent on the ship to protect the gung-ho crew aboard and supposedly destroy Ripley. The special efforts are the only thing this movie has going for it. Whereas Alien and Aliens had more of a story plus great special effects and chills going for it. Alien Resurrection plays like one of those campy B-movies of the 80s. Mindless action sequences, asinine plots and plot holes, corny one-liners and leaps in logic. Why would anyone clone someone to get an alien? The last 20 minutes with the alien/human spawn with an attachment to Ripley comes off a pathetic attempt to tug at the heartstrings with all the subtleties of a sledgehammer.

221,Joejoesan,Could have been great,8,3 January 2010,"The problem with Alien Resurrection is that it could have been great instead of just fine. When I watched this movie back in 1997 in the theater I thought after the first hour: wow, this can't go wrong! The new born Ripley is an exciting character, because you don't know which side she is on. And Sigourney Weaver - 50 at that time - looked great in leather. Back was the hardware, the non-CGI aliens, the fresh ideas and the great action. The basketball scene and Ripley's confrontation with the previous clones were impressive. The look and feel were right on the spot and the story was exciting. The first part of the movie wasn't flawless I guess. But I could live with the things that annoyed me. The miscasting and overacting of Wynona Ryder for instance. The unnecessary swearing and harsh language by both Ryder and Weaver. The scene in which Ripley suddenly talked in full sentences after her awakening. I could live with that. But it all fell definitely apart when the new alien was shown to us at the end of the movie. Man, were they serious? Was this supposed to be the alien of all aliens? The motha of all mothas? Come on, don't make me laugh!The scene that spoiled it all for me had a great start, though. It began like the climax of Andrzej Zulawski's Possession (1981), a surrealistic European movie in which we saw the beautiful Isabelle Adjani making love to a monster. To me that was a shocking scene because it was very explicit. But here in Alien 4 it worked out very well... at first It looked like Ripley came to turns with her destiny. It started well until, of course, you see the final monster.Twelve years later I'm watching the Alien movies again with my 12 year old son. I was 12 myself when I saw the first Alien in the theater so I thought the time was right. We both pretty much enjoyed ourselves. On DVD the first Alien was a little bit slow but still great. Aliens remained an overwhelming sequel. The long cut of Alien 3 wasn't good but better than the first time around. And Alien Resurrection? Well, when you know what flaws to expect it's a good farewell to the Alien franchise. Good but not great. But if Ridley Scott or James Cameron wants to give it one more they both have my absolute blessing!8/10",Alien - Resurrection
222,boondocksaint20,"Not bad, but disappointing",6,2 December 2002,"I remember how excited I was to see this movie when it came out.  Aliens was at the time, my favorite movie ever, and I wanted to see a much better follow up to it and Alien than the mostly mediocre Alien 3.  The result? An okay film that could have been better (aren't most films like this nowadays?)***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***I won't reveal the plot, except that Ripley has been cloned by the evil 'Corporation', and yes, once again, the Corporations' own greed backfires on them.  We get some cool characters, nice sets and plenty of action...so what went wrong?First, before I go into that, I'll go into more detail with the good points. I loved the setup, like Alien, straight and to the point.  I thought the atmopshere at the beginning was very creepy and very claustrophobic, especially with the musical score.  The beginning (before everything gets FUBAR), is well done, well directed and most importantly, well lighted. The atmosphere is dark and creepy, just what we need to get into our fantasy/horror film mode.  The characters are cool, but not nearly as cool as the seasoned hombres we saw in Aliens.  Michael Wincott (The 'bad guy' actor with that incredibly cool voice from Robin Hood and The Counte of Monte Cristo), Ron Perlman and some others you know you've seen before on tv make up a pretty good supporting cast/alien fodder.  Sigourney Weaver, as usual, really shines as she resumes her role as Ellen Ripley, this time, as an Alien hybrid.  The movie sports some good action scenes, and a few scares, though mostly for shock value (loud sound effects mixed with buckets full of gore).  There are some creative scenes given the time period and the setting (a cube of whiskey being heated in a shot glass, the futuristic weapons, the alien labs...etc).  As for the special effects, not too shabby, especially the part where we see the camera go down inside a screaming man's throat to see an alien chest burster about to make it's appearance. Okay, now comes the part I'm sure will be ubiquitous for those who read other reviews on this one on this site...so far, I've given this one so pretty good reviews to be fair and give credit where credit is due, but like everyone else on this site, I just have to vent my frustrations now on the bad parts of Alien 4...First, did I like this one better than Alien 3?  That's a tough one since all four Alien films have different directors and look and feel differently from one another.  But did I like it over the often visually stunning, yet ultimately disapointing sequel directed by Fight Club director David Fincher?  Yes, but not by much (what can I say?  I'm a sucker for 'survival horror' with plenty of guns and ammo).  Alien 3 suffered from too many underdeveloped characters that we couldn't give a damn about (a la Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None"") and just one slaughter scene after another.  This one is a little different in that most of the characters are developed, at least minimally, yet, they are still picked off in pretty much the same way as Alien 3.  The thing that frustrated me the most was that Michael Wincott and Dan Hedaya's characters, both pretty well developed at the beginning, make you think that they will be really important to the storyline, but no, they are among the first to be killed off...though I was looking for another 'Hicks' in Wincott who is a great actor, I may have to give a few props to the writer in that noone truly expects both the leader of the mercenaries and the leader of the marines to die before the movie hits it's 3rd chapter.  Besides that, there are some stupid deaths (especially the last, and truly unnecessary death aboard the space ship...that one made me groan so much, it was so obvious that it was tacked on for no good reason), some stupid decision making and totally unrealistic scenes.  There are scenes that make you go, that makes no sense at all, just like when the mercs. kill off a squad of marines...were they asking for it? No, they were just doing their job, but what do we care?  The only reason I bring these frustrations up is not b\c I don't like violence (Evil Dead 2 and Dead Alive are amongst my favorite 'Over the top' films), I think it can be done well for camp or horror purposes, but b\c I can't stand when filmmakers put such stupidity on the screen (from characters, and the plot) and think that noone in the audience will think otherwise.  That really insults my intelligence, and I know others.  I have to agree, Alien 4 plays like a video game, which is mostly bad than good b\c we don't want to see this in an Alien movie.  The Alien movie (1-3) all based their horror elements on the human psyche...how given people would react to a given situation, and they all suceeded.  Alien 4 doesn't give a crap about the human psyche or that inner fear inside, instead, it relies on visuals (though, it does have some impressive ones at that) and a fast-paced (almost Jerry Bruckheimer-like) plot that goes from one scene of impending doom to the next.  I have to agree with many posters on this site...the aliens are just overexposed...the real fear in the others was the clandestine nature of the aliens; the sounds they made, the motion sensors used to track their movements, the looks of fear of the trapped victims' faces.  All of these made us jump out of our seats after the suspense had been built up for so long.  This one goes for a newer generation I guess, one that likes quick thrills and not much else.  I thought the alien hybrid at the end was so stupid, almost comical looking, though brutal (Brad Dorif's death was classic...if only he would have shut his stupid mouth...LOL...if you have seen it then you'll know what I mean).  Which goes to show you, just because a plot idea may be new, it is not necessarily a good idea.  In a weird way, I almost wish that the ending to Alien 3 was the grand finale (though from a rather weak film at that).All in all, not too bad.  It is entertaining at times, but it just doesn't give the true fans what we crave, true survival horror.  I don't think any sequel will top Alien or the much better in terms of horror and excitement, Aliens.  Aliens was such a good film, filled with action, suspense and characters you rooted for towards the end (and for the person on this site who called Aliens a ""Vietnam Revenge allegory"" that is ""a disgusting NRA wet-dream"", I have to say that you are totally wrong...just because a film has violence, or even in this case, marines who crack under the pressure and go nuts given the situation, does not make it symbolic of the vietnam war, nor does it excite those of us who happen to support the NRA and the right to bear arms.  Aliens is simply entertainment at its finest, and truly embraces the human condition as most characters reach an epiphany of courage at the end as they've had to change over the course of the movie.  It is not a generation flick for blood thirsty 'cowboys' who grew up watching Rambo and Arnie blow people away).  Aliens truly was a film that was almost flawless, in my opinion, in terms of what it was aiming to accomplish. What was Alien Resurrection trying to accomplish?  $$$$.  Plain and simple. Anyways, I would only recommend this one for die-hard fans, but even most of them will range from somewhat to incredibly disapointed by this one, but yet, not as disappointed as they were with Alien 3 (though I know that opinion will vary).  Yet, it is still entertaining, and a good way to kill a couple of hours.  Not the worst movie I have ever seen, but definitely not the best.  Overall, I did like it, and think it has more pluses for the sake of entertainment than negatives.  I add one more star to my rating just b\c of Sigourney Weaver doing a kick @ss job this time around, and of course, seeing the silver screen's best 'creatures from another planet' return once again.  Though this one was almost a 6, I give it my slightly above average rating of 7/10 stars.",Alien - Resurrection
223,Cephyran,No more character...,7,6 September 2003,"Of the four, this may be the poorest simply because of character. The body of the cast has very little development, but the big problem is Ripley. She's just not herself anymore - she doesn't have the same drive as she did in the first three. For Resurrection we return to the typical run for your life format. In This case, its the humans trying to get off the ship before they're all made into lunch or hosts. Aliens pop up all over the place, and we're granted some brief, bloody moments. My real appreciation lies in the CG aliens - this advantage, however briefly seen, allowed the aliens to be more insectoid, and saves a costume budget. Granted, there are bonuses to having a physical alien suit, but for sheer realism, an uncostumable physique works better for the aliens.",Alien - Resurrection

True, it's not great, the beauty of Jean-Pierre Jeunet and DP Darius Khondji's vision doesn't make up for the weak acting (what the hell is Winona Ryder doing here) or the laughable script, but Jeunet cannot make an uninteresting film. From Delicatessen (1991) right up to Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain (2001) he's proven that his beautifully surrealistic visual can create a perverse sense of wonder and terror, and with Alien Resurrection he's in full swing.
The film is a visual freak show in every sense of the word, full of bizarre mutations and characters, but the script just lets the film down. This seems to disregard the character of Ellen Ripley, I know she's a clone but they should of given her a little more emotion, think about what the poor woman went through. The scriptwriter Joss Whedon gives us no true hero; Ripley is a shell of her former self so we just don't care about her.

226,McBuff,Three´s enough...,5,4 July 2001,"You gotta give the studio and producers credit for their choice of director. A French art cinema visualist who doesn´t speak any English, instead of a no-nonsense action craftsman (like James Cameron). Perhaps they wanted the series to go in another direction, following the much debated, but criminally underrated #3. The end result is, while not an entire washout, also the most disappointing and uneven of the series. The cast is interesting enough, Jeunet reunites Pinon and Perlman from his previous film ""La citté des enfants perdus"". Weaver rises way above the material, and Ryder is OK. Michael Wincott is strangely subdued and Dan Hedaya´s hairy back is scarier than any alien you´ll ever see! There are a couple of genuinely startling and beautiful scenes that proves Jeunet to be an excellent visual talent. The shootout with Perlman dangling from a ladder is astonishing, and the crew being chased by two aliens underwater is intense and scary, especially with John Frizzell´s forceful score. Watch as a woman desperately tries to escape one of them... The film´s most memorable and poignant scene, however, is where the cloned Weaver meets her previously failed clones. A genuinely touching and sad scene, which is rather abruptly punctured by Perlman´s chauvinist joke.But they blew it with that ending...the alien is about as scary as any of the Teletubbies. **½ (of ****)",Alien - Resurrection
227,Colbridge,The filmmakers have managed to come up with some original ideas among the familiarity of grungy spaceships and HR Giger's alien creatures,6,24 September 2021,"I was ready to take a critical eye to Alien: Resurrection, especially at the sheer audacity of the filmmakers thinking they could get away with having Ripley come back after what had happened to her in Alien 3 (1992), however I was soon on board with the idea of cloning and ultimately enjoyed seeing Sigourney Weaver back in her iconic role once more, even though she's not quite the person you think she is.Writer Joss Weedon and French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet have managed to come up with some original ideas among the familiarity of grungy spaceships and HR Giger's alien creatures with some added humour, new alien designs and grotesque images which makes for a slightly more engaging film than the last one, albeit woefully thin on plot.Winona Ryder and Ron Perlman are welcome additions, along with a good ensemble cast, and with this one being in the digital age of CGI the filmmakers still opt for physical effects for the most part but there are some effective underwater aliens courtesy of the technology.The aliens continue to be fearsome, dangerous and unstoppable, and there's some good gross out effects, but how much longer can the studio think they can scare the audience with the threat of an alien appearing around the corner. Four films in and it does wear a bit thin but thankfully Jeunet's visual sense and Weedon's originality come to the rescue here and with tension from the original and action set pieces from the second it feels like a hybrid of all three movies that have gone before.Not a necessary sequel by any stretch of the imagination but an enjoyable one if you are a fan and want to see what a new writer and filmmaker can come up with.",Alien - Resurrection
228,nmholland,An Awful Film With Near Nothing Going For It,1,9 May 2016,"Alien Resurrection is directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and once again stars Sigourney Weaver, this time as a clone of Ellen Ripley. 200 years after the events of Alien 3 (1992), Ripley is resurrected, hence the title, so that scientists can extract the alien queen that was inside of her. However, this Ripley is a hybrid of Ripley and an alien queen, so she has a few extra perks, such as super strength and acid blood. When an alien breaks loose on the ship she's on, she must team up with space pirates to ultimately stop it from killing everyone on board.Simply put, this film was trash. I found nothing good about Alien: Resurrection; even Sigourney Weaver's acting was pretty bad.. Not a single thing in Alien: Resurrection was good, and I could barely force myself to keep watching it. The direction, the script, the characters, the acting, and even the special effects were bad. Everything about Alien: Resurrection was completely awful.The worst thing about Alien: Resurrection was the characters and the actors that portrayed them. Sigourney Weaver doesn't do bad, but she's far from good. All of the other actors are pretty bad, and were disappointing in every single way, especially that of Winona Ryder. Both her acting and character, Call, was horrible. Her character was annoying and got in the way of any productivity, and Ryder didn't even play the part well. All of her lines were delivered as if a 9 year old child was delivering them.The script and direction are both incredibly lazy. Not a single shot in the entire film stands out, and the lines written are either boring or bad. The few lines that aren't complete garbage are bland, and feel like a premature script writer with no experience had written them. The saddest thing is, Joss Whedon wrote the script. His abilities have obviously matured since that of Alien: Resurrection, but that doesn't excuse the bad writing. All of the direction was pretty boring and grim, and didn't provide the film with a decent atmosphere.The special effects, while not as bad as in Alien 3 (1992), still aren't that good. Most of the shots of an alien swimming, or climbing a ladder, or running on walls looked really fake and inexcusable. Most of the ""suspenseful"" moments with the protagonists running from the aliens were completely tensionless, mostly due to the audience not even caring about the characters. Even Ripley's character has no feel to her, because she's not even Ripley; she's a clone of the actual Ellen Ripley, who was killed 200 years prior to this film's setting. All dynamics were stripped from the characters by the poor script, and left the characters as nothing more than names and bad acting.The worst part of Alien: Resurrection is the main antagonist towards the end of the film. I don't want to go into details and end up spoiling it, but the alien that Ripley is forced to fight at the end of the film is just awful. Nothing about this villain was compelling, or even scary. Not only was the character in itself bad, it also looked terribly unpleasant. Although the aliens are regularly grotesque, this particular antagonist was just horrible in every single way.In conclusion, Alien: Resurrection never should've been made. Not only is the script lacking, the characters are appalling, and aren't portrayed well. Alien: Resurrection is a step down from all three of its prior films in every single way, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",Alien - Resurrection
229,Mister-Creeper,Better Than People Give It Credit For,7,16 August 2007,"I must say, the first time I watched this movie, I wasn't expecting anything great. But the simple fact that Sigourney Weaver was in it was enough for me to watch it. After viewing it, I was in disbelief for the reasons people used to degrade it. I found it highly entertaining and a movie that I could watch over and over again (and I have). The aliens, as always in this series, are some of the best looking aliens you'll ever see. I'm not much of a Sci-Fi/Alien movie fan, but I love all the ALIEN movies. The special effects are great! ALIEN RESURRECTION is another great entry to the ALIEN series. I recommend it and it's definitely worth viewing at least once.",Alien - Resurrection
230,FlorisV,Disappointing despite creative effort,7,5 July 2008,"The action scenes are well thought out and there's plenty of gore. But it lacks character and suspense, it gets kind of formulaic.Joss Whedon has written plenty of good scripts for both movies, TV shows as well as comics and this is definitely not his worst. It's a bit more creative than it's predecessor Alien 3, but the characters have less depth. The film is also more uneven, switching from action flick to surreal and gross splatter film, the wisecracks getting in the way of real suspense.Winona Ryder does her part but it's not as memorable as Lance Henriksen's. Her character as well as some others were more grotesque than engaging. Also I don't find this Sigourney Weaver's best performance, while it was refreshing for herself, playing an alien-human clone, she wasn't as likable because she seemed to care less about the fate of humankind. Like in Alien3, the problem was again that you can't really care much about any of the characters. And too many of them make it out alive this time.It was missing the human element as well and that was one thing Alien3 did better as well as the classic ones, Alien and Aliens.Still, plenty of entertainment and not boring for a moment. An OK 7 out of 10.",Alien - Resurrection
231,Manthorpe,"Weak, bloated and unnecessary",3,2 January 2004,"Once in a lifetime a movie series like Alien comes along with a great story, intense action, great acting etc. And also, someone always seems to get their filthy little, greedy paws on them after they are completed and have basked in their glory. This is one of those movies.Possible spoilers, but the movie will ruin itself...Alien: Regurgitation is a complete fraud of the Alien franchise. It doesn't fit with the rest of the films and puts a black mark on a wonderful series of movies. Even though Alien 3 was questionable and not nearly the same caliber as the first two, it completely blows away this turd. I think one of the many wonders of the world for me is why Weaver even read this script, much less decided to accept it. Shameful.I won't even give a plot summary for this crap. The plot is weak, and the action looks like John ""can't make a decent movie"" Woo directed it. Not only that, what the hell is up with the spooge alien with a sad/happy face?! I mean, what in the hell?! Not only that, they couldn't even come up with a better way to kill it off...they did they exact same thing as they did in the first two movies!!! Lame.Movies like this make me hate Hollywood and it's unquenchable thirst for money. For me, this movie does not exist in the Alien series and will be the reason why I will never buy the Quadrilogy....I'd be embarrassed to have this movie in my collection.Weak, bloated, unnecessary, and completely gay. 5/10. <----it would've been lower without the aliens in it. It also would've been lower had I written this before voting....blast!Do not expect anything of this movie except to see aliens.",Alien - Resurrection
232,DVR_Brale,This movie trades atmosphere for action thus ruining the experience,6,6 January 2019,"It really makes me sad and disappointed to see this movie having better metascore rating than Alien 3. Fans blasted previous movie with all sorts of arguments but seem to speak more positively about this one which is, in my opinion, several levels below it.First three Alien movie have very strong atmospheric elements; they really draw into the story. This one never succeeds in doing that. Character development and slowly building scenes are traded and sacrificed for action and gore. Besides, whole thing feels very sinister and occult. It's no secret that Alien movies have something to do with eugenics (in a particular sense of creating a perfect race) which is clearly visible in this movie and Alien Covenant. While I have no problem with that topic in Alien context, I think they went a little too far with it and with sexuality in Resurrection.Concerning character development, it's done poorly compared to previous Alien movies. First three films were somehow able to develop characters without using too much words instead concentrating on movements, face expressions and similar. Resurrection protagonist, whom I almost don't even remember, say stupid and unnecessary things. Everything feels non-authentic.In conclusion, this is by far the worst Alien movie but still enjoyable as an ordinary action/horror film.",Alien - Resurrection
233,Exiled_Universe,"Better than 1, 2, and 3 but still has very minor letdowns",7,2 June 2019,"This movie is hands down better than the first three. Like alien 3 the story and plot is fun and understandable. The characters i feel like are too bland and drawn out but all in all it was all great in the end. The whole clone thing was kind of weird i mean couldn't you have just found another protagonist, they milk Ripley for all shes got. The movie is slow paced with some boring parts but its nothing we haven't see before (1,2,3) and the CGI for the alien was way better at some parts when it was necessary. I think the scary action scenes were a fun ride but it all could have been slightly better but if i had to take it for what it is, i think it great. Despite all the hate, for me this is a major improvement for the alien franchise and from now on its Prometheus so the movies will start to get more mainstream so yay cant wait for that. Now some people think the whole Ripley killing her baby alien near the end was sad, i mean i though that it was but only slightly and i also thought that it looked cool. All in all nice film, and a one time watch for sure(not that i hate it) and yeah good movie. Yay newborn xenomorph.",Alien - Resurrection

How unfortunate is ripley. Coming across this thing 4 times in a row how shocking. And alien 3 was awful compared to the first two. They should have just left the series at three. She did die at the end of alien 3 so just keep it that way. But no Hollywood had to bring her back from the dead. And why?The series ended perfectly at alien 3. Now we have this disaster of another movie on our hands. The entire threat of the aliens has gone now there not scary anymore. pantomine villains. And the cult status of alien and aliens has gone down the pan. And why? because of weavers deteriorating acting and the deteriorating series after alien 3.So please Hollywood execs save us the torture of alien 5 (if your going to make it) unless you know it will be a success.,Alien - Resurrection
235,bullions27,A sorry ending,1,13 November 2000,"I never liked Joss Whedon and this movie is another example as to why. First off I can not treat this movie as it's own. The series brought us a powerful and memorable heroine and a frightening and memorable villain. You can't separate the films apart. They are forever linked with those characters and thus they are to be scrutinized in comparison between them. Saying that I am sorry Alien Ressurection was made. What made Ripley who she is in the Alien series? Obviously Whedon had no clue whatsoever and went ahead to change her character into this blasphemous Terminator-like hero. I for one didn't like this change. It's because she is human, succumbed to emotions, and most of all AFRAID of the unexpected and the horrific nightmares these creatures wrought upon her that made Ripley... Ripley. Turning her into an Alien is a novelty, and I suppose what they were trying to accomplish was an ironic and cruel twist of fate tossed to her. The thing that has haunted her for so long she becomes. Unfortunately, the performance wasn't convincing and we end up hating this new persona. Blame it on the script.Visually this fourth installment is pretty much what we have been experiencing over and over again with the series. Again, they try to reproduce that claustrophobic experience Aliens gave us with the tight corridors, the running out of time factor, etc. Some of the humor in the movie was unnecessary and bland. The General saluting after destroying an alien, then gets killed by one but not before going through a few gestures which screams comedy, was insulting to the series. I will never understand european humor.Anytime you're given a franchise, you'll love to excercise all possible storylines. Since it's already had it's success, you have a greater margin for error. What Whedon gave us is a plot thin as a wet tissue, and full of holes to see through. There was little explaining of anything, which could be a good thing. A script this messy how much more can it get if you let them explain it. What plot was there, was for the aliens to be shot at, destroyed, a character dies in between, and more aliens die. It's getting old, and so is this series. Thumbs down.",Alien - Resurrection
236,antonjsw1,Enjoyable and some morsels to chew on,8,2 January 2010,"I have just seen the Quadrilogy special edition, which has a different opening and ending, and some extra scenes that flesh out some of he characters. I enjoyed it much more coming back to it some 3 or 4 years from having last seen that theatrical cut on DVD. The film doesn't have the visceral impact of either Alien or Aliens. However, it acknowledges Alien 3 and the previous films, and is a film with a very original, weird and surreal style typical of director Jean Pierre Jeunet. Unfortunately the KEY characters are not fleshed out quiet as well as the previous instalments, and only Sigourney Weaver, and Leland Orser, who plays the small role of Purvis, shine. Signourney Weaver, as in the previous two movies, is a standout and brings a new dimension to the character as a resurrected clone. In this special edition an interesting subplot about Ripley's past relationships is touched upon, but unfortunately its never developed to its full and interesting potential. The best part of the film is an outstanding sequence where Ripley confronts the reality of her existence as clone number 8, by seeing first hand the prior research, and it is a sequence right up their with the best of anything else in any of the other films. Leland Orser makes the most of a small part, and actually injects his character with pathos, even if the character's climax is way over the top! The story is interesting, but the film's main weakness is that some of the themes set up are not full explored, hence you do not get the emotional payoff that you get in Alien and Aliens, when subplots are carried through e.g Ash's character in Alien, Bishop's character arc in Aliens. Most characters, Wren, Elgyn ,Perez and Gediman(who is an unnecessarily weird character)come across more as plot devices,so you don't really care for them. However, Winona Ryder's Call is quite sympathetic, and by towards end of the film the characters of Vriess (played by Dominque Pinon) and Johner(played by Ron Perlman) are characters you begin to root for, even if the Johner character starts off as being deliberately dislikable.The action sequences are well done, including a standout sequence underwater. The photography and design, like in all the alien films, are excellent. Visual effects are also excellent, bearing in mind this was the first Alien film to fully embrace CG, and is generally well integrated with the excellent live action animatronics. John Frizzell's music is entirely appropriate to the mood, and continues the tradition of excellent and fresh original scores across all four films.The gore is certainly more obvious than in the previous instalments, and those with sensitive stomachs need to be aware that this is the most gratuitous of the four films. This was another small disappointment, as the horror of the aliens is much more psychological rather than the physical and the film is strongest when the horror is geared towards the implied rather than in your face (which for one character is more than just a metaphor!).My final comment is about evolution. The research of the scientific characters in the story that leads to Ripley's Clone 8 raises some interesting thoughts on the ethics of genetic engineering, and links well into the Ripley Clone's issues about her identity. The idea could have been further explored but nevertheless its good to see these issues being layered into a Hollywood Sci- Fi movie. However, the impact of this research in the story of the evolution of the Alien species is controversial and while I really liked the idea, and of its linkage to Ripley, you'll need to make your mind up about the evolution's physical manifestation, which I was unsure about. This character was also on screen for too short a period, and it was a shame that more time wasn't devoted to this.Overall I was impressed - not a classic, but a very well made and thoughtful, if occasionally weird movie.",Alien - Resurrection
237,flickjunkie-3,"An Entertaining, Terrifying Sci-Fi.",7,23 November 2000,"I had only seen one of the Alien movies before I saw Alien: Resurrection, which happened to be Alien3 , but I had heard lots about the ass-kicking series. Alien: Resurrection is not liked very much by critics, but I thoroughly enjoyed this flick, I own the film and watch it when I seriously need some horrifying stuff.Two centuries on from Alien3, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Lieutenant First Class, number 36706 is still very dead but Clone 8 - grown aboard the Auriga by the evil greedies at United Systems Military - looks damn near perfect (even if the only hair she has is her eyebrows when first we see her). From inside her, USM cut an Alien queen, then against the advice of General Perez (hairy-shouldered Dan Hedaya), let Ripley #8 live. She meets the six-strong vagabond crew of the Betty then USM's captive Aliens get smart and get free, chasing the crews through corridors (and flooded kitchens) until they die - or escape.Although the plot sounds fairly thin and silly, it is a strong story with a scary twist. The actors are all really good, Weaver puts in yet another excellent performance as Ripley, while newcomers to the series, Winona Ryder and Dan Hedaya, are both just as watchable. The screenplay is played out to ridiculous ends, which, in Alien: Resurrection's case, isn't actually a bad thing.If you like the Alien series and you're a big fan of sci-fi horror films, I highly recommend Alien: Resurrection.I rate Alien: Resurrection 7 out of 10.",Alien - Resurrection
238,MadReviewer,My Eyes Still Burn From The Pain -- What A Horrible Film,3,19 April 2001,"Oh, what a rancid waste of film.  Alien: Resurrection is pure garbage, plain and simple.  The dialogue is awful, the acting is awful, the plot . . . well, if there actually was a plot, it would've been awful, but since one never existed, it's a moot point.  Yet again, humanity is being threatened by the Alien menace, and since humanity has apparently spent the 500 years between Alien3 and Alien: Resurrection doing nothing but picking the collective lint out of its navel, scientists decide to clone the charred remnants of Ripley into an ultimate Alien killing machine.  Of course, these same geniuses somehow don't notice that they've alos included some Alien DNA in their new Ripley clone, making her equally dangerous to both humanity and Aliens alike.  Gratuitous, badly directed combat scenes ensue.
Sigourney Weaver gets to chew some scenery by playing the Ripley clone, who's far more aggressive and violent that the Ripley of past Alien films. At least she was fun to watch, even if the character made absolutely no logical sense.  And then there's the latest android/human fascimile of the series . . . Winona Ryder, as Annalee.  Hee, hee; she's unwatchably bad. She pouts and whines her way through the film, trying to act tough but ultimately looking nothing short of pathetic.  Bring back Lance Henrickson as Bishop.  Hey, bring back Ian Holm as the homicidal Ash, at least he'd be better than Ryder.  How Winona Ryder got into this film will probably go down as the greatest mystery of the Twentieth century; she's THAT bad.About the only saving grace of the film are the sets, which faithfully recreate the moods and claustrophic creepiness of ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" . . . unfortunately, by reminding you of those films, you're also constantly reminded of how bad ""Alien: Resurrection"" really is.  This film stinks, avoid it like the plague.  Grade: D-",Alien - Resurrection
239,ryanskywalker-87402,The apple has fallen far from the tree,2,20 May 2017,"A completely unnecessary sequel that proudly takes over the label of Alien franchise's weakest chapter & also features an odd bit of interspecies erotica, Alien: Resurrection was seen by many as an improvement over Alien³ when it released but that's only because this film didn't have to deal with the reputation of two genre- defining chapters of the franchise & unlike its preceding installment, it only gets worse on multiple viewings.Set 200 years after the events of Alien³, Alien: Resurrection finds Ellen Ripley resurrected back to life through successful cloning & has the alien queen surgically removed from her body. In the hope of breeding this magnificent life form & study its biology, human hosts are used which are delivered by mercenaries but when the aliens escape their enclosures, Ripley & the rest of the survivors attempt to escape & destroy the spaceship before it reaches Earth.Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the film tries to make a tonal shift from a sci-fi horror to a dark comedy but eventually fails at achieving any of its goals as it pretty much sucks as a horror film, doesn't carry enough meat for an action or sci-fi feature and the black comedy elements only come off as far too stupid. Joss Whedon's script is another culprit here even if it contains some interesting ideas & is completely inept when it comes to characterization or action or suspense.Cinematography adds more tinge to the picture & also includes close-ups of characters when they're busy making stupid faces. Set design is passable & although the alien creatures aren't poorly rendered like it was in the last film, it still doesn't come close to their seamless depiction in the first two films. Visual effects ain't up to the mark either despite its high-budget, music doesn't even feel like a part of the film & the very final creature is so grotesquely designed that it's just too absurd & laughable.Coming to the performances, Alien: Resurrection manages to even surpass the last chapter when it comes to overacting. Other than Sigourney Weaver & Winona Ryder to some extent, the entire cast looks horrible with their exaggerated expressions, sounds horrible with their overly cheesy dialogues & plays horrible by delivering terrible performances from start to finish. Weaver's performance ain't that great either, however, she does enough to avoid any major complaint on her part.On an overall scale, Alien: Resurrection is the most light-hearted & cheesiest chapter of the Alien franchise which fails at everything it was trying to do. Adding nothing new to the franchise that we haven't seen before, featuring a set of uninteresting characters most of whom served their purpose as just death fodders & providing no excitement or thrill in any of its action sequences, Alien: Resurrection succeeds in ruining the very franchise that redefined horror, sci-fi & action with its first two chapters and suffered a heavy dent with the third.",Alien - Resurrection

241,influxtwo,Love this movie!,7,20 September 2021,This sequel is pure fun and I watch it all the time. This is before CGI went 100% and still features great animatronic alien creatures. The plot is exhilarating and the cast all mostly nail their roles. The plot progression is a fun creative 'what if' kind of plot that takes an Outer Limits abomination alternative approach that is monstrous enough to work for a one-off. Sigourney Weaver is at the top of her game here as usual and Winona Ryder offers a great iconic 1997 classic appearance here as the loveable Annalee Call. This film was good enough that it should have jumpstarted the material. I only hope a future sequel takes advantage of a menacing and dreamy approach like this film. This one features an amazing look at animatronics and an unforgettable iconic ensemble. I dont subscribe to the hate. Love this whole series.,Alien - Resurrection
242,DorianWynHowells,"By far the weakest of the series, it shouldn't have been made.",3,22 January 2002,"After everyone dissaproved of the 3rd installment of Alien, people were a little apprehensive about this one, and quite rightly so. This is by far the weakest of the four, and in my opinion, it shouldn't have even been green-lit to go into production!The structure of this movie (if you look at my Alien 3 review) is more or less trying to return to the winning formula of the 2nd film, but it fails. And it fails with flying colours!Loads of guns. Loads of Aliens. Loads of cast.Credit due to the writers to be able to fluke a fourth film!! You see, after Ripley killed herself in the 3rd film, the government brought her back using her DNA!! after about 9 attempts, they finally get it right and she is 'resurrected'. Of course, the only real thing the scientists care about is the Queen!! and they STILL think they can control the bloody Aliens??!!!! Let it go please!!!!So, eventually, and predictably, carnage ensues. People die. People I must add, who we don't care about, so what's the point? The only real person we care about is Ripley, and she's half human/half Alien now anyway, but she's still sexy!!! A close 2nd as to who we care about is Winona Ryder's Call.Sorry, but this is one of the worst sci-fi films I have seen, and the 'creature' thing at the end?? perlease - don't insult me!!!!God help us if there's a 5th.

243,roystephen-81252,A beautiful nightmare,9,9 February 2016,"Alien: Resurrection starts with beautifully disgusting pictures and John Frizzell's mesmerising music during the opening credits. These alone made me realise instantly that it was going be a unique experience.It's nothing like the previous Alien movies. Jean-Pierre Jeunet made it totally his own and stamped his dreamlike style all over it. Even the mostly American cast seems French. (In fact, a lot of people thought at the time that they were indeed French.) That could have put me off, but Joss Whedon's great story (the best since the first Alien film), the visual orgy of colours and blood and mucus and slime, Winona Ryder's charmingly insecure and vulnerable robot character, the imaginative action sequences (especially the underwater alien attack) and the surprising twist on Ripley's character ensured a solid entertainment, unlike the very disappointing Alien3.The new hybrid alien, the Newborn, is genuinely scary and repulsive - and yet, that look in her eyes, when she realises her mother wants her dead... it's truly heartbreaking. How can you pity such a horrid creature? Pure Jeunet brilliance.",Alien - Resurrection
244,DJ_Shilo,Don't Witness the Resurrection,2,2 May 2020,"""Alien"" was a science fiction masterpiece. ""Aliens"" was an action movie that had its scary moments. ""Alien 3"" was not great, but I don't think it got fair treatment. There was a lot that went on behind the scenes. Now, Ellen Ripley is brought back in ""Alien Resurrection,"" the fourth installment. Forgotten is what made the original film scary and what made it work. This sequel is extremely violent to the point of shock and disgust held together by a flimsy plot. The inspiration has come and gone, and we got a film that we didn't ask for in the first place. I question how this film has an R rating being as violent as it.It's about a government operation led by General Perez (Dan Heyda), who is overseeing the resurrection of Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) whose brought back to life and scientists harvest an Alien queen from her that breeds. It's not long before the Aliens break out of confinement and wreck all kinds of hell all over the ship. It comes down to a small crew of armed mercenaries who try to make it to the Betty before it's too late.There is a statement in the movie that echos perfectly. ""Ellen Ripley died trying to wipe this species out. For all intents and purposes, she succeeded. I'm not anxious to see her taking up her old hobbies."" This line comes from the General Perez character. He says he doesn't want Ripley to fight the aliens again, but what does he expect after bringing her back to life? Ripley's back as a clone because the scientists somehow retrieved blood samples on ice from the prison planet where she died in ""Alien 3,"" and she has become an alien hybrid of some sort. The scientists want to breed the aliens for biological weapons; I suspect because that is the plotline of the previous films, and that's the reason for Ripley's return.It opens with Ripley standing in a tube, and her voiceover says, ""My mommy always said there were no monsters. No real ones. But there are"" before surgeons remove the baby Alien Queen from her womb. She is aboard the USM Auriga, a military government ship, which appears to operate outside of regulated space, which means illegal experiments, and it functions as a medical research facility. I was being coy about the scientists breeding the aliens for bioweapons, and yes, that is what they are trying to do. Ripley somehow retains all her memories after 200 years have passed, and she awakens on the ship knowing the aliens are going to escape, but nobody listens to her. ""She will breed. You will die."" She says.
When you see the Aliens for the first time, held in glass cages, it takes the fear out of what this organism used to be, and it's one of the many bad decisions the film makes. The Aliens look restless until one of the scientists decides to play with one of them through the glass before he pisses it off, and it snarls at him. I will say, the look of the aliens is superior. They look, pitch black, is slimy and shown to be smart, and they escape in a very clever way involving their blood. A freighter called The Betty arrives at the facility with the vagabond crew led by Elgyn (Michael Wincott). Johner (Ron Perlman) is the unstable and dangerous one. There is also Christie (Gary Dourdan), Vriess (Dominique Pinon), who is in a wheelchair, Hillard (Kim Flowers) and Call (Winona Ryder), who holds a few surprises of her own. The Vriess character has his wheelchair full of shotgun pieces, and he seems to love raiding the ship's armoury when nobody is around. When they all arrive, shortly after is when the aliens break out.Ripley doesn't know what she is doing, and it never really says whose side she is on. Weaver is over-sexualized in the role that made her famous for the fourth time, but we can only assume that the screenwriter, Joss Whedon, didn't know what to do with her. She knows when the Aliens are near, and they know where she is it seems, but it's never developed, After everyone on the ship is killed in very violent ways, the aliens only attack the crew once I think which is odd seeing as how they were relentless in ""Aliens."" Speaking of attack, okay, so as I have said, the movie is violent, let's see. When the Aliens escape, someone, walks into one of the cells and is frozen to death as his body snaps apart. One guy pulls a piece of his brain out of the back of his head and stares at it. A crew attempting to escape in a shuttle gets shredded to bits, and we see blood and guts flung on a window, and that's only some of the carnage.Into the second act, they are moving through water pouring down from the cooling tanks, and it's a thought-provoking set up before the execution throws it all away. They end up swimming for a lot longer than one can hold there breathing, and it gets quite hooky. They must all be expert swimmers. I liked this sequence because two aliens chase them underwater. Well, one does, the other gets blown up at first sight. It was entertaining until someone I was starting to like is killed, and I just gave up-none one these characters find development, so all that's left is carnage.If they made ""Alien V"" I would watch it so long as I don't have to see this one again. Most of the movie is elaborate special effects, including an unwanted surprise at the end that looks horrible. It's called the Newborn, and I have no idea what they were thinking with this thing. It suffers a violent death, which is just over the top and disturbing to watch before Ripley seems to be attracted to this thing. I don't know. My significant confusion is why the aliens are setting up traps, I guess, early on in the movie. One of the characters falls for a setup involving a slimy gun, and I didn't buy it. The director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, does not want to be there, and it shows. Every decision was wrong, and there is nothing on offer here expect violent carnage, an out of place actress (Ryder) and for some reason, Weaver agreed to do the movie.",Alien - Resurrection
245,johanleupen,Effective. Not nearly as terrible as Alien3.,7,4 August 2000,"When David Fincher came along with Alien3 he nearly killed off the entire legacy when he failed to live up to the expectations and plunged Ripley into her death. Fortunately the wonders of Hollywood found a way around this to make yet another installment simply by cloning Ripley, hence Resurrection. It's all a bit too easy for me, but Resurrection does improve upon the last movie. The sets are fantastic, Weaver is still good, and the action is high-paced and exhillarating. Winona Ryder however doesn't belong in an Alien-film or any sci-fi movie for that matter. The story starts off in the right direction but it takes are wrong turn in the end (the newborn-sequence is terribly awkward). As you can see it kind of a mixed bag, although it's ultimately satisfying and it does make you forget about Fincher's screw up with Alien3.",Alien - Resurrection
246,james_corck3,Recommended for Alien fans sickos,9,12 February 2006,"Alien Resurrection is like a too much European movie. The director is french, Jean-Pierre Jeneut, what a master, what a maestro of the camera angles and the atmospheres. This man who lives in his own world of imagination enjoys showing his madness to the world and he gets paid for it. That can't be legal.The last Alien-Ripley movie is not: A suspenseful movie (despite some quite scenes), an action movie (despite so many weaponry), or a tragedy (despite the creepy and magnify clone room scene).Alien Resurrection is: A comedy (very black but still the funniest Alien movie, you can have a really fun time watching it), a gore movie (blood, guts, exploded heads, freeze people, more brains and guts, etc...), a nightmare (is a nightmare, no more twists, is like a french nightmare, very Gothic, not very intelligent).For the performances, let's forget about sexually behaved Ripley (that mixture of Alien and human really affected her). Ron Perlman, Gary Dourdan, Dominique Pinon and even Winona Rider give perfect performances that will never be forgotten into the Alien universe.In general is another Alien movie, better than Alien 3 of course, but that is far away from Alien and zillions of Light years away from Aliens. But for the ones who are French or Spanish (in Spain the movie was a good success of critics) it still a fantastic horror-fantasy movie.",Alien - Resurrection

This kind of films are not always bad I thought ""Deep Blue Sea"" was a good film and only 2 of the main characters came out alive. But still this is rather bad anyways.(SPOILERS END)The Good:The wisecracks are funny and there are some cool & suspenseful moments in here. The performances & SFX are decent but nothing for helping this film.The bad:Gore,gore & more gore. If that sounds good for you be my guest. Although this is the first Alien movie I have seen I hope the others are better. So I guess I can recommend this film to alien fans & certain others. Overall this film tries to be good but it isn't all that successful. I agree with Roger Ebert & his rating (which is a 1.5 out of 4 which is what I would've done if I went by that system). Heck the last alien killing makes me almost wonder if I am being too nice on this film. At least this is not as bad as the first Halloween film that I have seen which is the 6th one.

248,GluStick,The second best in the series.,9,9 October 1999,This movie was really cool. I saw it at the theaters when it came out on Thanksgiving. I didn't really like it that much. I thought it was ok but not as good as Alien3. I rented it when it came out on video. I was blown away. I really liked it and I didn't know why I didn't like it at the theater. The f/x were really good. The ships and explosions looked cool. The plot was good. It had to deal with Ripley being cloned to get the alien out of her that was in her in the third movie. The action sequences were really good. The part where they are in the water trying to swim to a room had me on the edge all the way through. The aliens looked really cool this time. The newborn looked really scary. It was a great movie and Sigourney Weaver did a great job. Almost better than Aliens. A great movie none the less. Alien: Resurrection: B+,Alien - Resurrection
249,MinorityReporter,Insulting!,4,15 September 2005,"I really cannot begin to express how much I hate this film. Even though it is not the worst film with aliens in it (that title belongs to AVP: Alien Vs. Predator) it sure is close. The first thing I'm going to do is make a pros and cons list so people will get a general idea of how I perceive this filmPros: The effects. Cons: Everything else.First the pros. This film has the best effects of all the series but that really isn't very surprising. The first two films were beautiful in their own ways and I thought the the third film was very atmospheric as well but they were all before the era of computer graphics and as Alien Resurrection is from 1997 (ergo after Jurassic Park which was the first film to really use the potential of computer graphics) it must be fairly straightforward to assume that the effects will be better. They are. The effects are stunning and even today (2005) they are believable. The director, Jean Pierre Jeunet, has a very distinct visual style and it works beautifully. From the space shots to the design of the aliens themselves. It all works. We finally get to see the aliens walk around and seem a 100 percent believable. We also get to see them swim which is nice little addition to their range of abilities. The gore in the film is very graphic and this too works fine but aside from the effects the film is pretty awful.The acting doesn't exactly suck but its not very good either. Sigourney Weaver does her best but her new abilities and the fact that she is not the same character as in the previous films does that we don't really feel with her in the same way any longer. Her performance is passable though and I have nothing against her. I don't know what Winona Ryder is doing in this film and her talent does seem to be completely wasted. Ryder's emotional range as an actress is very high but we don't really get to see it in this movie (for obvious reasons) and that is a darn shame. She is degraded to being eye-candy. Dominique Pinon, Jeunet's favorite actor doesn't really do that much in the film and quite frankly isn't all that good even though I am impressed with his English. Most French actors have a very thick accent but Pinon doesn't. Ron Perlman who has since become quite a big star has nothing to work with in this film and thus his performance is not really worth noting. The rest of the cast is a mixed bag. Some do decent jobs (for example Brad Dourif) and some do not.The story is what is really disappointing and (I feel) insultingly bad. The two first films had brilliant stories and even the third had a passable story (considering it never had an entirely finished script) but the story in the fourth one is just hauntingly bad. I won't go into the details as I might accidentally spoil the plot but needless to say it is really, really bad. Especially the ending is very anti-climactic. As for it being a horror film. Come on there isn't anything remotely scary about the film and the action is average at best.All in all a film that should be avoided almost at all costs. The only saving factor is the effects but effects don't make a movie.4/10",Alien - Resurrection

251,pwoods1,Is a clone still the original? Does it/her/him share a common humanity?,7,25 October 2005,"In some ways, ""Resurrection"" is a logical fourth episode in the sequence: the trilogy has become a tetralogy. What SHOULD be considered (apart from the obvious need by the franchise to make more money) is that the Ripley character IS NOT THE SAME Ripley we saw in the first three.Ripley has been a constantly changing/evolving character. Within the 'original' trilogy, she has developed from the competent officer on a company ship, via a protective mother-figure, into a militant protector of humanity and, perhaps, beyond. Resurrection puts this much-loved, fiercely-protective character, into a situation where SHE is the controller. But who are we talking about? It/she is the end result of generations of experimentation: of an attempt to create a hybrid alien/human.Perhaps, the underlying message is that scientists cannot cage their creations, indeed, cannot control and/or understand them.The introduction of the 'mercenary crew' underlines this notion. Ripley has become an 'alien' complete with the 'attitude' the entity 'Ripley' has apparently always had.When, accompanied by the 'new' humans, she discovers her lab-bound predecessors, (complete with 'kill me' dialogue), the realisation that we are only shown a small percentage of the 'failures' is, perhaps, accompanied by the notion that she has every reason to kill ALL the research scientists.As a mother-figure to the aliens, who have, possibly, become more HUMAN, the hybrid clone (Ripley) still can't overcome her loathing of this invasive, destructive life-form.Whilst not the insect-based supermom, the Ripley hybrid surely offers us the luxury of feeling empathy for ALL mothers, regardless of species.There are subtexts within subtexts. Still, I could be overreacting. Damnit - it deserves better than some of the featured critiques.Watch Alien: Resurrection and make up your own mind. I did.",Alien - Resurrection

Some people thought that after the disappointing, studio-scuttled misfire of Alien 3, a fourth film might not be a great idea anyway.It's a good job they stopped at three films, then.

Even the third movie had enough style and suspense to at least leave you able to take it somewhat seriously as a film.  Instead, ""Alien Resurrection"" looks for new ways to disgust you, and it's pretty good at it.  A baby alien bursting through a man's head, heads squished and bitten off, and Ripley watching helplessly while her half-alien child is sucked into space backwards through a tiny hole, squealing with pain, fear, and agony while she mouths ""I'm sorry"" comes to mind.  It's also good at being funny, which I'm not sure was intentional.  The human/alien hybrid is extremely stupid looking and disappointing for what could have been an interesting idea (just like how I feel about this film as a whole).

254,Hellrazr360,"Resurrection ""Borrows"" Other Alien Attributes For Its Entertainment Purposes",1,19 February 2006,"Most could say that the Alien series was better off with the end of Alien 3. But this is Hollywood we're talking about, so they'll be wanting to toss out another Alien movie just for the heck of it. While Resurrection shouldn't have been made to start with, it actually does a good job at being a decent movie entertainment-wise.Sigourney Weaver is back as Ripley, who's somehow resurrected after over two-hundred years. How this was possible after Ripley pretty much burnt to death in Alien 3 I don't know, but the movie doesn't explain this much or at all. This actually works to Resurrection's strength since it doesn't try to be a smart movie anyway.Since critics and other audiences didn't like the direction David Fincher did of making Alien 3 a suspenseful more than action flick Resurrection has been give the ""Aliens treatment"". So don't expect much more than a movie that has military action scenes with aliens involved. While this doesn't make Resurrection much more than an action movie with the name Alien slapped on the aliens look as cool as ever and the action is satisfying.The acting in Resurrection is below-average, but that's expected as this is the fourth installment in the Alien series. There isn't much logic in Resurrection but it doesn't try to create much logic. Instead, the movie just focuses on two things, action and humor. Not a smart move in part of the Alien movies but I like how the direction was executed.Alien fans shouldn't be too disappointed by Resurrection, it's got some fun action scenes. And since the over delivery of the movie is better than your typical fourth installment in a movie franchise it should give them even more reason to say that Resurrection wasn't half bad.",Alien - Resurrection
255,ZCDomingos,It was a great step up from the previous film,7,18 May 2021,"I'll say it. I wasn't expecting to like this one, but it was a great improvement from the last film.I believe that it was mainly because it was written by Joss Whedon, whose work I've been a fan of, so that might have helped.That said, it still wasn't, to me, at the level of the first two movies. But that doesn't make it a bad film.Alien: Resurrection managed to capture the atmosphere of the first two movies very well, something that was missing in the previous outing. Some scenes were really perfect in that sense.Finally, the effects were better. At the level of the first two movies. The Xenomorphs got the justice they deserved after the mess of the third movie. And we get to see the Queen once again, which is always a pleasure.The only aspects I mainly didn't like were how they cloned Ripley. I think it's a plot difficult to execute and ripped the emotion of Ripley's death in the previous movie (even though it had little to no emotion to me). But it stopped bothering me after the amazing performance of Sigourney Weaver. Seeing her in such a OP version was really amazing to witness. Never thought I would like it so much.The other aspect was the appearance of the last creature. The son of the Queen, if I can call it that. I understand that they were trying a new look, since it was born in a different way, because Ripley's DNA allowed the Queen to develop an uterus and give birth as female humans. But the creature appearance wasn't executed well enough for me, it broke the movie a little.That said, Alien Resurrection was a pleasant surprise in comparison with the third one. It was a good step up from the previous film and it managed to breathe a new life in Sigourney Weaver's performance.",Alien - Resurrection
256,Scott-8,"Awful Movie, waste of time",1,8 December 1998,"I had high hopes for ""Alien Resurrection"" when I saw it last summer, since I think nearly everyone feels the third movie was a weak entry.  I was both revulsed and turned off by AR, and when I saw it again on cable recently my feelings were only confirmed.The original Alien was one of the first movies that used the ""doom and gloom"" view of the future to good effect.  Everything's dark and murky, spaceships look more like industrial waste yards, and the view of people and society is cynical.  The first few times you see it that approach is different or interesting, but now it seems every aspiring sci-fi movie uses it.  Will somebody please turn on the lights?The makes of AR forgot one key element of making this approach work is giving someone for the audience to care about.  Ripley's dead, now we have a cloned half human hybrid who spouts wonderful lines like ""Who do I have to f$%! to get off this ship?"", a gang of smugglers who kidnapped colonists to use as hosts for the aliens, and a bunch of soldiers and scientists on ""the other"" side.  The only person in the entire movie who I cared lived or died was the poor infested colonist who ended up getting blown away as the alien was about to burst out of his chest.Sigourney Weaver overdoes her creepy hybrid human but, let's just say you can tell she was the executive producer. Dan Hedaya I honestly thought was playing his part for laughs, which jarred in an otherwise gloomy movie.Lots of running around and shooting, with the heroes using weapons that looked like they were cobbled together from spare plumber's pipe. It got to the point I wondered what color blood/entrails would be splashed across the screen next as people and aliens died in various creative ways.The ""final showdown"" with the newborn alien, who is supposed to be a hybrid that's more alien, was ridiculous and incredibly revolting.  Did we really have to see every detail of it being sucked out a hole into space?I've heard they're committed to making a fifth movie, after this entry I certainly hope not.  They can keep cranking out Star Trek movies until the end of time, but I think this series is dead",Alien - Resurrection
257,plpregent,Flawed yet underrated fourth installment in one of sci-fi's most notorious franchises,6,18 April 2016,"Alien:Resurrection divided audiences from the day it got released in theatres. To this day, even many studio execs and producers of the earlier films don't even dare watch this film or even consider it as part of the Alien franchise (so glad the Alien anthology Blu-Ray Boxset includes making-of featurettes for each of the four films - pretty awesome stuff). Among the franchise's fanbase, it's not unanimously appreciated either. I can understand why. Nonetheless, I still think it deserves to be watched, as despite its weaknesses, Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film offers its share of interesting moments, all wrapped up in a technically-sound package.Now, for anyone who has seen all four films, it's pretty obvious that each one of them has its own respective flavour, so to speak. Each film comes from a different director (and all four directors are extremely talented guys), and the difference in tone is quite noticeable, as the first film is a true, nightmarish, slow-paced sci-fi horror film ; Aliens is more action-oriented ; Alien 3 is a blend of thriller and horror film. Alien:Resurrection is no rupture to this thread of changing tones, as it has its share of dark humor, it's far more gory and graphic than all the previous installments, and it picks up (only) 200 years after Alien 3, in a spaceship, with our favourite monster-slaying female protagonist, none other than Ellen Ripley. Yes, she died in the third film, but writers have found an unoriginal and somewhat far-fetched way of bringing her back, which surprisingly ends up being perhaps one of the most interesting subplots in the whole movie (and one of the only ones too), as it leads to one pretty haunting scene later at the mid- point of the feature.The script certainly isn't the film's strongest asset, as it serves no purpose other than getting the spaceship crew to confront the notorious alien creatures through all areas of the spaceship, with plenty of bloody and gooey fun throughout. My synopsis might not do the script justice, as there are a few subplots that I will not spoil, some interesting, some just plain silly. It does borrow elements from the previous films: Ripley develops a relationship with one of the characters that's a bit reminiscent of that she had with Newt in Aliens; there is a lot of action and gun play, just like there was in Aliens; it follows the tradition of featuring a robot character; the crew of the spaceship is composed of a few macho characters that might remind you of those in Alien 3, etc. All these elements are nice inclusions, but have a tribute feel to them more than anything else. Anyhow, we do get good performances from the likes of Ron Pearlman, Brad Dourif, Wynona Ryder, Dominique Pinon and, of course, Sigourney Weaver. Directing and cinematography rank among the highlights, along with the tremendous makeup and practical effects. Jean-Pierre Jeunet definitely brings a humorous touch here and there, but it never amounts to any overly distracting silliness. The aesthetics are true to the genre and look better in this film than in any of the previous ones, especially the creatures. They're more fluid in movement, the costumes are very detailed and gorgeously textured, and some of the set-pieces bring the gooey madness to a whole new level. Cinematography has a distinct feel to it, and the work on lighting is somewhat reminiscent of that in La cité des enfants perdus and Delicatessen, two of Jeunet's previous films.The soundtrack by John Frizzell also works very well, and adds a nightmarishly majestic tone to the film, especially in those moments featuring plenty of organic imagery. Overall, Alien:Resurrection, despite its fundamental flaw of suffering from a linear and quite predictable script that might borrow too much from the previous outings, is still a welcome (yet maybe unnecessary) addition to the franchise, and a technically competent film which profits greatly from Jean-Pierre Jeunet's approach in visual storytelling. While it is not nearly as good as either one of the first two films, it's still a worthwhile 100 minutes in the Alien universe.",Alien - Resurrection

259,Servo-11,Worse than I expected,4,17 January 2003,"I'd heard this was a great movie but I still rented it with reservation. The plot lost me, not being a cloning geek, and seemed to drift around aimlessly.  The movie appeared to hang more on the spooky behavior of Sigourney Weaver Dr. Doolittling with the aliens.  Winona Ryder was out of place, Brad Dourif was his usual creepy self (not a bad thing, but he still couldn't salvage it), and I don't know what was going on with Ron Perlman and his ""extreme"" moments of yelling.  It was pretty shoddy all around.  The only standouts for me were the scene with Ripley and the basketball and Michael Wincott's all-too-brief role.  He of the magnificent voice should have been given more to do.  It seemed a lot longer than the 108 minutes listed on the box.  Aliens seems shorter than that.  I'm not a shoot-em-up type of movie watcher, but I do like the stories to have a point and engaging characters.  The Marines of Aliens are pretty eye-grabbing whereas the space trash in Alien 4 had no charisma (except Michael ""The Voice"" Wincott of course).4/10",Alien - Resurrection

261,stewiefan201,"Alien Resurrection is completely different from the first three movies, and I mean that in a bad way.",3,3 May 2008,"200 years after Ripley's suicidal death in Alien 3, she is back in Alien Resurrection. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has successfully been cloned, after 7 clones gone wrong, with the alien queen inside her by scientists (Brad Dourif, J.E. Freeman) on the ship Auriga. Ripley has alien DNA in her blood and seems to take on a few alien characteristics. The ship researches the queen and uses her eggs to facehug kidnapped people, for the purpose of studying the aliens that pop out of them. Soon a group of smugglers led by the tough Elgin (Michael Wincott), Johner (Ron Perlman), Call (Winona Ryder), and two or three others, board the Auriga to collect owed money. However the aliens soon escape and run rampant all over the ship, just as the smugglers begin pulling guns on the crew. Almost everyone on the ship has been killed by the aliens. And when the smugglers find out the ship is automatically headed back to Earth, they band together with Ripley, a scientist, soldier, and a man who has an alien in his chest. They have to find a way to stop the ship before it lands on Earth, and the aliens infest home planet.Alien and Aliens are sci-fi horror classics. Alien 3 is much less favored, but it's still one of my favorites. However I can't deny that Alien 3 is way better than the awful 4th Alien Resurrection. Even the new Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem is better than this movie. Alien Resurrection contains dangerously low character development, mostly bad acting, a terrible script, and a completely different style from the first three films. The first three Aliens were very dimly lit to the point where it was hard to see the whole creature. That effect really added to their mystique. However Alien Resurrection leaves leaves nothing to be wondered about, since it is disappointingly brightly lit up. The bright atmosphere felt all wrong because the aliens don't really belong in the light, they belong in the dark. We can see the whole entire alien in their slimy brilliance, and there are actually a few good scenes with them. The scene where they escape from their containment by killing one of their own, and letting his blood burn through the floor creating an exit. This is one hell of a scene and most definitely the best part of the whole movie. It shows that the aliens may seem like mindless killers, but they are actually kind of intelligent. Other than the terrible CGI action scenes (where the aliens seem out of place), the aliens actually look great. In fact the close-up shots of them are fantastic, and really make them look hugely threatening and creepy. But then we get extremely Hollywood-style action scenes such as when the aliens attack underwater. It's scenes like this one that even further ruined the movie and the creatures.Once you get past the great looking aliens, you realize how stupid and shallow the whole movie really is. The band of smugglers are basically one-dimensional (save for Winona Ryder), as are the scientists, soldiers, and pretty much everyone else who shows up on screen. The acting is poor but what can you expect, the actors were given terrible material to work with. Upsettingly Sigourney Weaver is not good in this movie either, but then again she is just like the rest of the actors, her dialogue and character are awful. I think it was really stupid to bring her back into the series. She killed herself...that should have been final enough! They could have done an Alien movie without Ripley, but I guess since Weaver decided to come back the filmmakers just said ""Let's find the most preposterous way to bring back Ripley from her suicidal grave. I got an idea, she can be an alien/human clone with no personality. Alright high fives all around!"" These terrible human characters are housed by an absurd, shoddy plot that makes absolutely no sense. Ripley apparently has alien features within her, but this is barely mentioned or played on till the end. There is also a side-plot that the scientists are breeding aliens through kidnapped civilians, but it's really only mentioned once or twice. These extra little side-plots don't really matter to the story once the crappy action cranks up. It doesn't even make sense how all the aliens got loose. We only see two aliens escape their cell, but how do ten more get out? This is an enormous plot hole that made me laugh at how stupid the writers must be. There is another scene that also makes zero sense, and that is when the characters swim away from an alien underwater. They break through a cocoon covering an opening to the surface, and when they get through they realize they are surrounded by eggs hatching facehuggers. One of them yells ""They set a trap! It's an ambush!"". We find out at the end that the queen never moved from her cell, and if that's so then how the hell did all those hundreds of eggs get there for this ""ambush"". And even if this was plausible, which it's not, why would the aliens need to put all those eggs there? They already wiped out pretty much the whole ship's crew.Alien Resurrection is a pretty awful film. Its story, characters, and even its action are all extremely shallow. Just about every single element in this third sequel barely makes any comprehensible sense. The only good thing were the close-ups of the aliens, they looked very good here. But everything else about them felt misplaced in this action flick. And don't even get me started on the whole newborn plot at the end. That was just painful to look at and think of. I give Alien Resurrection a 1 out of 4, just ignore it and go watch the first three.",Alien - Resurrection

Lieutenant Ripley Ellen is long dead but the scientists found the secret to bring her back along with the alien queen embryo that she carried inside her . The greedy corporation Ripley worked for doesn't exist , but as long there is money and power hungry governments , somewhere , somehow , there will be someone who will fund an illegal program of bio-engineering in order to find the secret of the alien power . In this case the United Military Organization is behind this project although it is obvious that they are not even authorized by the Congress . They want to breed a new alien species to study them for purposes such as vaccines or alloys (but who are they kidding ? Inevitably the aliens will be exploited as a new super weapon) . The space base Auriga where the experiment is being conducted , is in orbit behind Pluto (naturally every illegal program takes place beyond the borders of the solar system) . The leader of Auriga is General Perez (Dan Hedaya) a rather mild mannered military officer who wants the project not to take a single risk . The scientists are led by Dr Wren (J.E. Freeman) and Dr Gediman (Brad Dourif) who are very enthusiastic about the potential of their task . They use frozen samples of Ripley 's blood in order to get the mixed human/alien D.N.A. and eventually clone Lt. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) , resurrecting her and the alien fetus . The clone has not only the looks and physical shape of the deceased Ripley but unpredictably it has inherited all her memories and her psychological characteristics . There are also other side effects due to the genetic crossover and the clone shows some special features . The scientists isolate Ripley to study her later and focus on the Alien Queen which grows rapidly and incubates . In order to find some hosts for the face-huggers and the alien larvae , General Perez allies with a team of space smugglers led by Captain Elgyn (Michael Wincott) . They are black market merchandisers and in this case they supply Auriga with people they hijacked from other spaceships while they were on suspended animation . The unfortunate victims against their will are destined to be the first alien fodder . If you think the colonels are scumbags wait to hear where they get their financial sources : they cultivate vast quantities of cannabis ! This was an abandoned scene from the initial script and I thought it was best for you to know . Anyway , within a few days a bunch of aliens blossoms and everyone seems to be happy , but not for long .Captain Elgyn lands on Auriga with his spaceship called `Betty' and they stay for a couple of days for refueling . Elgyn definitely is not aware of the classified project and just wants his fee . The rest of the Betty 's crew are Johner (Ron Perlman) a tough , foul mouthed and ugly sexist goon , Vriess (Dominique Pinon) a handicapped short man who is stuck in a wheel chair and is a mechanic with quite `long hands' , Hillard (Kim Flowers) an attractive woman who is Elgyn 's girlfriend and Christie (Gary Dourdan) a skilled and methodical shooter with rasta hair who is calm and seems to be the second in command . The recently added member is a short young girl named Call (Winona Ryder) who is a talented engineer and is the misfit of the group . Call has read the banned books written centuries ago by the convict Morse (another abandoned line) and is the only one who knows the legends about Ellen Ripley and the aliens . Ripley on the other hand is kind of a savage and autistic child in an uncomfortable environment . She hates the scientists for bringing her back to revive her worst nightmare . The inevitable occurs very soon as the aliens break loose and all hell with them too . The gory killings of the Auriga staff set everyone on alert . General Perez and the vessel 's central computer Father (he he) command the immediate evacuation of Auriga . Very soon all the remaining military members have left via the emergency exit vehicles , while the aliens have already formed a cocooned nest for their queen so she may reproduce more eggs . The space smugglers finally listen to Call 's warnings and head to the Betty . Unfortunately their spaceship is on the other side of Auriga . They form an uneasy alliance with Dr Wren and a soldier called Distephano (Raymond Cruz) who know the ship's design in order to get to the Betty fast and safely . They also take the cloned Ripley with them since her advanced knowledge on the species may be useful . The space shuttle is wrecked and under inner siege . Will their weapons help them survive ? See the movie and judge for yourselves .Jean-Pierre Jeunet gives great imagery to the 4th and last chapter of this immortal sci-fi / horror series . Art direction and the magnificent photography deliver one of the most imaginative science fiction films of the decade despite the overused concept . The plot is rather predictable as we all have seen everything recycled in previous films (like the ending) . The visionary director provides us a beautiful film and the script gives us one of the most successful aspects of cloning in cinema generally . Jeunet and Joss Whedon who wrote the script gave their own approach on the series . The movie relies heavily on blood , gore and violence although it is sometimes depicted in a twisted , black humored , cartoonish manner . This the `funniest' in a dark way chapter of the saga and there are a few moments which tend to self-parody . It doesn't matter at all . The message of the script is the obvious catastrophic impact of the cloning experiments that are bound to happen in the next years . The aliens are now visible more than ever in the screen and they spend a lot of time gutting soldiers in the most vicious way (splatter fans will find their favorite element and glee) . We have seen the stereotypes `Man cannot tame nature' and `Greed is always punished' in numerous films but Alien Resurrection pulls it off with utter success . The sanguinary beasts dispatch the naive humans who foolishly thought they could control them , in the most revengeful way . Yes there are numerous films which have dealt with cloning but never this successfully . From the 7 mistakes preceding Ripley to the final `rebirth' the side effects are clear as crystal : messing with the genes can only generate trouble and atrocious monstrosities . The former scene is the most tragic one of the movie and will truly be the one Alien Resurrection will be remembered for . It sums up the poetic vision that Jeunet tried to give us and it is a chilling dramatic scene about what we might all experience in the (not so) distant future . Weaver 's character includes some surprises and twists and this really helps because a series needs evolution in order to survive . This is the most intriguing aspect of the Alien quartet . Each part was directed , written , photographed etc. by different people and each one gave his addition in the mythology like for example the biology of the creatures.
Alien Resurrection suffers from a great deal of problems which made the fans turn their back and despise it . Many of them thought that the film was way over the top and not terrorizing enough and lambasted Jeunet as improper for the job . As I already mentioned Alien Resurrection combines perfectly the dark shadows of a possible future with spoofing sequences and at the same moment grotesque images : the evacuation scene seems to be inspired by the respective one in Spaceballs ! Indeed some of the one - liners suck BADLY and almost turn the film to a typical Hollywood urban chauvinistic action flick  `Who do I have to f*** to get off this spaceship ?' . Others are smashing and pull your leg nicely `Hey , Ripley , I heard you like , run into these things before' `Yeah !' `Wow man : so , what did you do ? `  ` I died !!' . The profanity here has hit the ceiling but I think that there is some background to it and let us not forget that the leads are criminals or rough military members . The greatest problem is the newly introduced characters . Ripley 's transformation and the ethical dilemmas she faces are nicely executed . Weaver gives a standout performance and she may be a bit more cynical but after the odyssey she has endured it is quite logical . After all , her new capabilities and enhanced power breath a touch of fresh air . It would be dull and repetitive if she was the same character . Winona Ryder is also very good as the mysterious Call . The two of them share good chemistry and accomplish the best acting of the film. J.E. Freeman is solid as Dr Wren too . Unfortunately the rest of the leads stink badly . I don 't care if it was intentional but Ron Perlman's character is thoroughly dislikeable and unbearable . Dominique Pinon is not especially amiable either . It also puzzles me why did they bother casting Dan Hedaya and Brad Dourif in virtually non existing roles . Just for the billing I guess . Both of them are literally wasted here and I am talking about less-than-cameo status . I have never heard of Michael Wincott and can 't see why he is so popular . His coarse voice makes him another repulsive character (probably he is the most chain-smoking person on earth) and he is also wasted . Characters worth caring for are Christie and Hillard . Kim Flowers is the only one who managed to insert humanity into her character , save Ms Ryder . Gary Dourdan has an underwritten role and too bad because he could have done much much more .  Raymond Cruz is the extra / lead (thought it could never happen in a movie ?) playing the soldier who serves as the guider of the gang and I won 't omit Leland Orser as Purvis , one of the abducted by the smugglers hostages for the aliens harvesting . All the aforementioned characters had great potential but their screen time is little and are never fully developed .Too bad that the main characters are a**holes like Johner or Vriess whom you don 't give a damn for . The worst aspect of the movie is the ending . The baby alien is stupid but what comes as a great disappointment is his showdown with Ripley . OK the scene can be interpreted as hilarious or tragic at the same time but what happens is totally unrealistic (I am talking about laws of physics). The finale is totally rushed and feels a bad cop out . Rumors claim that it was reshot at the last minute (originally the movie ended on Earth) and it shows. Apparently they didn 't have the time to support it with some decent SFX . Another little nitpicking I would like to add is that the music score could have been better and at many parts it feels out of place .
Nevertheless I enjoy the film for many other reasons . The opening line is brilliant and it is quite obvious who Ripley refers to . Secondly , aside from Jeunet's inventive direction and the horrifying messages about cloning , the script finally answers a much debated subject . It is clear now that the aliens ARE intelligent creatures who know where to strike and can even outsmart humans . Another aborted line from the script stated that the aliens communicate with supersounds `just like bats' . The evacuation scene is also the most realistic one I have ever seen in a science fiction film , instead of waiting for the cast to be decimated and finally the 2 - 3 surviving leads go to the EEV , something they could have done right away . Here , when Father sets the distress mode , the soldiers INSTANTLY and without the slightest time waste abandon the vessel . The movie is actually plotless : the first hour is the introducing of the characters (although it is bare) and after the release of the aliens and the mass departure , the second hour is quite simply  and frankly , the course of the leads to the Betty . No intermediate battle scenes just for dwindling of the cast . The SFX are for the most part believable , like the acidic blood , the alien agile moves or the super weapons that the smugglers have . Ripley's bilateral nature makes her and the movie far more interesting than a typical sequel . The acclaimed European director uses astonishing cinematography and brilliant sets to join forces with a genuinely American genre such as science fiction . The combination of Jeunet's psychedelic imagery and ordinary futuristic themes (a la Star Wars , Star Trek etc) is achieved quite balanced and we have an artistic approach to the series.
Alien Resurrection is certainly nowhere near as good as Aliens . It is quite good on its own merit and a decent 4th installment in the Alien universe . It is one of the best samples of sci-fi from the 90's and is bound to earn more recognition in the future . It was actually one of the most anticipated movies in history . Although some were disappointed , it is worth noting that everyone's favorite heroine lived again simply because an Alien film without Sigourney would have been a plain cash-in . The opening scenes with the cloning experiment is what everyone was eager for . This vertical glass tube with the reformed naked Ripley is already a distinct landmark . These sterilized labs with the subtle greenish lighting are uniquely conceived and the depiction is P-E-R-F-E-C-T . The entire film seems a nightmare transferred to the screen . Gross in some points with a wicked sense of irony and some parts that ignore common logic (like the cartoonish ricocheting of the bullets) . This is what Jeunet wanted and the execs did well hiring him . Alien Resurrection stands alone as a lyric vision of the fantastic intergalactic society that cinema tries to predict or warn us . It is not only for strict Alien fans but any casually interested movie fan should check this out . To put it in one word part 4 is one beautiful film . Witness the resurrection !ALIEN RESURRECTION    8 / 10",Alien - Resurrection
264,vincent-27,big disapointment,2,23 July 2002,"I remember seeing this movie in the theatre and was so p***ed off I wanted to find the writers (Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett) and set their hair on fire. This movie left me with the same feelings as Attack of the Clones, a really great series shot to hell.I agree with some other posters, that we feel no compassion for Ripley any more and she just becomes this stupid cyborg type creature. Also, Wynonna Rider is awfull as the android, who was the casting genius who came up with this? Ron Perlman's character is stupid, boring and a ripoff of every ""hard-ass"" wise cracking tough guy in every movie ever, only done really poorly.Also, the ending is very stupid, somehow I doubt that a huge creature of flesh and bone with be sucked out through a tiny hole in the hull. I know the vacuum suction in space is strong, but is it that strong? Somehow I doubt it.Of course, the absolute worst thing about this movie, the scene that made me so mad I wanted to pull out my own teeth, was the scene where Ripley finds all the ""mistakes"" of her cloning. This was actually a very powerfull scene, extremely disturbing and an effective comment on genetic cloning. Yet after we see all this awfull, frightening footage, Ron Perlman's character comes in with his ""Must be a chick thing"" line that made me so frickin angry! What an awfull way to ruin the only effective thing about the movie with some stupid, low-grade, crass humour. Uggghhh!!!!",Alien - Resurrection
265,vocklabruck,Fart shameful comedy,2,5 January 2007,"I cannot believe this movie belongs to the Alien saga! This movie generates the same feeling that comes to you when you watch Terminator 3 or Matrix Reloaded: SHAME.I do not know how to start. OK. To make a perfect Ripley's clone containing the alien queen in her chest 200 years after Ripley's death, and only having her DNA is just plain implausible from the start, even knowing this is sci-fi.200 years after... and ships, weapons, clothes, everything look the same as before! No, wait, there are synthetic whiskey and breath identification! Laughable! But it seems they made a comedy on purpose! There are cartoon/comic elements everywhere: These ricochet bullets guns attached to the arms, a guy in wheelchair singing ""Popeye"" song, the crazy scientist playing stupidly with the alien thru a glass, a guy taking off a part of his head and watching it after the alien attacked him, etc. I thought I was watching a ""Roadrunner"" episode.What director and writers were thinking when they made this garbage? ALIEN IS NOT A COMEDY FOR HEAVEN SAKE! What the other 3 directors built in years fell down in a second with this Alien Resurrection.More! Ripley is not the Ripley you used to love, she is a clone and also part alien, OK, but she is rude, violent and cold, and smiles stupidly. Who can feel empathy for a character like this? In fact, you cannot feel anything for ANY character in this film. The only good character is the pirate captain but he disappeared too soon.These aliens are not menacing like in the previous films. You can see too much of them, that makes the horror disappear. And there are also many plot holes. To make matters worse there is a new queen, with a womb... They say Ripley gave her a human reproductive system. Didn't you know a human reproductive system is more than a womb? And the queen is giving birth, but if it is a human reproductive system where is the father? Also the newborn is laughable and disgusting, far far far away from the Giger concept. And this newborn kills the queen just with a blow? What kind of queen is that?Winona Ryder deserves a special paragraph. How did they cast her in this movie? This midget cannot appear in a sci-fi movie! Probably it was to add more comedy like giant & midget from a circus, just see how stupid she looks when she appears close to the tall Ripley.This movie gives Alien saga a bad name.",Alien - Resurrection
266,martijn-56,Very artistic and almost brilliant gore...Far too underrated!,9,28 October 2011,"As one reviewer put it: Alien was about suspense, Aliens was an action movie, the third was a tragedy and this final one is gore. But just like Alien 3, for which Sigourney Weaver should have won the Oscar, also this fourth installment is underrated – even by James Cameron, who ranked Alien Vs. Predator as the number three in the franchise. I think the same happened to the Matrix sequels; the second and third were incredible movies with lots of new stuff, but nobody particularly liked them. Why? The Matrix, as Alien, and Aliens were just some of the best movies ever made and probably Aliens is, with The Godfather 2, the only sequel I know that is equally good as the first (or better). The reason that sequels are still made is therefore commercial, not a director's ambition to leave his artistic mark. Still, Aliens, the first sequel in the series became a classic, why? The success of Aliens was due to the fact that James Cameron realized that for now only an action movie would do, making a totally different genre of his sequel. So how about Resurrection? If you ask me, I think this is a good sequel since it flowed naturally from the first three movies: we have the Ripley character and a bunch of people being hunted by the Aliens trying to make their way out into space. That part is familiar (= what we go to see an Alien movie for); the rest is new to make it a movie strong enough to stand on its own (that is why we still go to see a sequel). Resurrection had a comic book style script with humor, and beautiful decadent sets, almost futuristic Art Deco. Ripley herself was the perfect mix: she had something familiar, and lots of new stuff, since she was Ripley and yet, being cloned 200 years later with an Alien inside her, she wasn't Ripley anymore. Ripley being different was probably the thing many fans had problems with, but had she stayed the same helpful brave woman, the same fans would have complained it was all too repetitive. I think the fact she was and wasn't the same helped me to adjust to a new formula, which after three movies was inevitable. I thought this new Ripley and Alien-queen-in-one was a great find (albeit with disgusting consequences, making a smart anti clone statement at the same time); she was almost like a predator herself, with a humoristic and unpredictable tweak, still keeping her strong character alive that made her an extremely credible protagonist in the first three movies. Still, this movie got less than a 7 score. For me this is the paradox of sequels: when we get the new stuff we have not seen before we think the movie deviates too much from the original, and yet, too many familiar things make any sequel too repetitive. But to be fair: I have never seen a more disgusting movie, and I had problems with that. That is the reason I could never give it a 10 like the first two. But visually it was a pleasure to watch, making this director just as much an artist as Cameron or Scott were. Let's just say Alien and Aliens were classics and I am happy we got Alien 3 & 4, since I enjoyed them more than I was disappointed that they were not as good as the first two (impossible anyway). Resurrection had lots of new stuff, beautiful sets, and effects, and the acting acting, especially of Sigourney, was great: definitely 9 out of 10!",Alien - Resurrection
267,yasenkiranov,In space no one can hear you suck,1,6 January 2013,"When I saw the first 10 minutes of this movie,my first reaction was ""Is this some kind of joke???"".Well if it was a joke,it would have been in very poor taste,unfortunately it's not.I would like to point out,I was completely alright with how ""Alien 3"" ended and I liked the movie itself,sure it wasn't as good as the original and ""Aliens"",but for me it was a satisfying way to end the series.""Alien:Resurrection"" was completely unnecessary and the film itself seems more like a spoof than a sequel.First of all-the characters are flat.They are also inconsistent-One minuter Winona Ryder's character tries to give Ripley support and the next she literally says ""F**k you"" to Ripley.The black guy can do his fancy ricocheting bullets thingy,but he can't shoot a giant alien right in front of him.It seems the writers forgot what character development was until half-way into the film,where there is actually an attempt of giving the characters some depth,but then the writers said ""F**k it,let's throw in some more aliens!Better yet,let's throw in a last minute explanation to create a new alien.Oh this is a good one,let's make the viewers sympathise for the damn thing,although they've seen it for less then 10 minutes.""What were they thinking???Another huge problem is the CGI-it sucks,but the director doesn't seem to agree,because there are so many pointless CGI scenes,but the movie was made in a period when Hollywood thought CGI was incredibly realistic and awesome.Some of the death scenes are creative,but really over-the- top and ridiculous.The suspense from the previous films is also missing.""Alien:Resurrection"" is one of the worst sequels I have ever seen.Stay the hell away from it.",Alien - Resurrection

The only thing that did not sit well was the human/alien born at the end of the movie, it looked like a albino snail and looked so fake because of how waxy it looked that you wanted to laugh at it, it was not in any was scary, and if that had been done better then I could have given this a 10/10 but alas a 9/10 is all I can give, the wax work just was to bad to ignore",Alien - Resurrection

273,Kimal9000,A more than worthy sequel,8,25 January 2019,"Despite being the fourth installment to the series, and thus being up against some pretty stiff competition, AND basically repeating a sequence of events we've already seen three times now, this movie succeed by having great storytelling and action, a believeable character gallery, superb acting from everyone involved, and adding just enough new twists.
Sure, getting it as perfect as the two first Alien movies is impossible for many reasons. First, if you're not Ridley Scott or James Cameron, then you're not Ridley Scott or James Cameron. Second, it has all been done before, and there is a limit to how many times Ripley can believably fight off these things. That's why it is very important to devote some time and effort into creating a believeable backdrop and motivation for her. Which I think all the sequels have done exceptionally well. Every time she is placed in the middle of the action against her will, this time actually being alive against her will.
If this happened to be the first Alien movie, many more would not think twice about giving it 10 stars.",Alien - Resurrection
274,Progressive-Element,Alien goes Heavy Metal,8,24 May 2013,"In an interview Ridley Scott cited the old Heavy Metal/Metal Hurlant comics as one of many inspirations for Alien. Of all the films, the one that most resembles Heavy Metal is Jean-Pierre Jeunet's demented, over-the-top, but not unentertaining fourth entry.This is another entry that uh...alienated fans, and it certainly doesn't have any of the atmosphere or suspense of even Alien 3. Visually, it's quite uneven. Production design is impressive, effects not always so - even in 1997. Gore is ramped up to 11. Indeed we see far more blood and guts in this one than all the others put together. A number of critics had issues with the humour on display, but I personally found this refreshing. It was interesting to see a more lighthearted display in an Alien segment after the deadly seriousness of the first three.Where it most delivers is in Sigourney, excellent again, this time as a superhuman part-alien clone of Ripley, and in the frantic moments when the characters are facing off against the aliens. The monsters are menacing as always, and this time they're not above sacrificing one of their own for their own benefit. A brand new member to the Alien family, while perhaps not as scary as intended, provides some good moments at the climax.While suffering in comparison to it's predecessors, on it's own terms it makes for good, gruesome, comic-book-style mayhem.",Alien - Resurrection
275,pantagruella,Crew,9,15 August 2010,"I've just read a fanzine review of this film which was quite swingeing. Someone else's comment was that the film was worthless.This annoyed me though I don't know why I haven't learned by now.One way to see the four films of the Alien series is that the Aliens are presented with different kinds of human opposition.In Alien we have a competent but unprepared crew of a merchant ship. In Aliens we have space marines who are built up as ultimate hard men equipped with state-of-the-art fire power. In the unloved but worthy Alien 3 we have the opposite of the space marines, unarmed convicts. Most of them turn out to be British character actors. It is fun to slowly sort them out, identify them and see them throw harsh language at the beastie. In Resurrection, the main opposition for the Aliens is not the soldiers, but a motley group of pirates. The soldiers run away, but the pirates die hard.The review that angered me said that this pirate crew did nothing. I think the contrary. If you know your film and your TV series, you will recognise all these guys, you will positively enjoy seeing them get as far as they get. I am not a complete enthusiast for the film as whole, though it deserves plenty of credit. But I think this is one of the best crews in film. Most films haven't a clue how to present any kind of team so that each makes his mark. This crew is up there with the guys in Deep Rising, the gang in Game of Death, the team in Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead.",Alien - Resurrection
276,JohnBoyRoy,Better left forgotten,5,19 May 2004,"This is an un-necessary sequel to a trilogy that was better left alone after part three. THe whole thing is done in a comic book style and so stands out from the naturalistic attitudes of the other films.One reason to watch would be to witness the ALiens as fully realised CGI creatures - they are very impressive on land but weaker in the water scenes, looking a tad fake.The series has become a bit tired by this point (Alien-human hybrids - no thanks, that is, unfortunately, sh*t and not scary) and Weaver looks bored in the role.Ron 'Naughty Nick Nolte' Perlman is Great in it though! Overall a waste of time and money that should have been put towards a decent 'Predator' sequel methinks.Tosh but semi-entertaining: 5/10.",Alien - Resurrection
277,SlimeyPete,A hell of a lot better than Alien 3 but worse than Aliens...,7,11 April 1999,"I actually really liked this film. OK, so Ripley's characterisation was a bit off and the first half an hour was boring, but once it got going the action was fast and intense and the script was pretty good. It also has the most original plot of the series (apart from 1, of course.) The ending could have been better - although it was quite exciting, I'm getting bored of seeing Aliens being sucked out into space. Still, overall it was a very good film and I'd recommend that you at least rent it, if not buy it.",Alien - Resurrection
278,Jeremy-93,Frankenstein Created Aliens - and almost got away with it,7,8 August 2001,"Joss Whedon, who has sole writer's credit for Alien: Resurrection, is famously unhappy with the end result (""a crappy-ass movie"") and it's certainly a bit of a mess in narrative terms: after a thoroughly effective first half hour, the film doesn't manage to graft on to its very basic escape-from-alien-infested-ship storyline the more meditative and fantastical elements that are its real raison d'être. Pacing goes haywire, and some sequences so strain credibility as to turn the film towards campy self-parody.  When you look both at Whedon's best writing (for Buffy on TV) and director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's earlier French fantasy films, control of plotting isn't really either's strong suit, and there's a nagging feeling of imperfect coherence here, a film that never quite came together. All the same, the actual ingredients are astonishingly inventive (perhaps unprecedentedly so for a third sequel to what was a very straightforward, if brilliantly executed, original).The story follows on from Alien 3, but its themes dovetail mainly with Cameron's first sequel, Aliens, especially the obsession with motherhood and family. Cameron's script for Aliens centered on the bizarre pairing of Ripley and the Alien queen as maternal figures, and that idea becomes the theme for a set of grand guignol variations here, as Whedon, Jeunet and the effects designers probe at the definition of what makes one human, what makes one a monster, and the strange fluidity between those categories. In many ways the end product less resembles the earlier Alien films than it does a classic Universal horror film, which (like all good monster movies) gives most of its sympathy to the monsters.I hardly need to add that Sigourney Weaver's dazzling and unsettling reinvention of Ripley as something that both is and is not human is what holds everything together - if only barely (some of the supporting players are less well cast, notably Dominique Pinon who's so great in Jeunet's earlier films, though I confess I do like Winona Ryder in a role that's awkwardly written at times). This is one of those films that gets more interesting and more annoying on repeated viewing - its weaknesses become ever more glaring, its complexities and innovations ever more intriguing.",Alien - Resurrection
279,eflemieux,"Painful, pseudo-Gothic, artsy-far*sy direction",1,19 August 2001,"Once again, set and costume design take precedence over common sense... I have been a fan of the Alien saga since the very beginning. I liked the first one, i adored the second one, i suffered through the third one and i was scared s***less that the fourth installment would be crappy. I have waited until i watched this movie five times before risking a review, hoping i'd find it some redeeming value. I failed...First, the evidence, this movie is science-fiction! It doesn't mean it doesn't have to make sense... The sets make no sense at all. No matter how advanced a future society may be, it makes no sense to use a spaceship the size of Rhode Island to house a hundred people. There is the slight matter of using materials and energy to build something that big. Second, i understand that some directors want to create a creepy atmosphere, but please... Water dripping from the ceiling in a spaceship? come on... Not to mention the looks of the characters... They look like some escapees from an euro-trash trendy disco. Now acting... Ron Perlman is brilliant, as usual. Sigourney Weaver has reached a new level in self-absorption... Her pseudo-feral Ripley has the believability of casting Barney the Dinosaur as Freddy Krueger. And look at the costume! Gee, now Christian Gauthier designs clothes for prisoners? The special effects execution was good, but the designing was hilarious. The final creature is a mess - people, look at Giger's work if you want to make something Giger-like. The first time I saw the movie, i choked on my popcorn so much i laughed. Spoiter: The scene where the creature gives birth made it to my scrapbook, between the Marx Brothers and the Three Stooges. In summary, the scenario made sense, but the whole execution was ridiculously bad.There is a lesson in this for the producers... Please, when you choose a director, look at what he made before... ""Delicatessen""-goes-to-space was to be expected...",Alien - Resurrection
280,pulikd,4LIEN. Classified,7,16 June 2021,"The first installment in this franchise was a slow, hypnotically powerful horror movie with a twist. The second one relied way heavier on spectacular fighting and shooting. Neither was a disappointment, of course. But then a third one was made. It was no rival to the two before it, especially, upon release. And the production process was quite a story on its own. Later, things were either replaced in the movie or added to it. And ""Alien 3"" got significantly stronger. A similar fate would way later befall ""Prometheus"", by the way. Thankfully, the way the third film was received did not prevent a fourth one from creation.Probably the least pretentious of all the four to date, this is a highly satisfying monster movie. All it wants is a group of people trapped aboard a big spaceship with a breed of the legendary monsters on the loose. What's important here is how the movie handles the creatures themselves. No movie prior to this would give them so much screen time. No movie prior to this one would treat them with such reverence. Make no mistake, they are big, they are scary, they are strong and violent. Also, they are smart. You don't deal with them easily, no matter what training or experience you may have. The monster effects, visually, are easily superior to the previous film. And that roar they make was phenomenal.Ripley is back. There is a number tattooed on her skin. And there are experiments going on. The bad guys are, obviously, the creatures, but the movie does not regard them as the source of evil. In fact, they are living things. Highly dangerous, better kept as far as possible from us, sure. But that does not mean they cannot be hurt and suffer. And not every human being is a righteous person here, to put it mildly. Science going too far, that's what we're dealing with here. The finale of the film is easily the most disturbing yet.The cast, the performances, the plot in general, they were all good. And no character annoyed me in the film. Drama, peril, levity, they are all where they are ought to be. All well placed and paced. Some of the futuristic technology was quite inventive and a nice touch. However, this brings me to the only thing I would really label as problematic, the visual effects. The creature effects may be strong, but the outer space scenes could have been better. As for the characters, Ripley, Call, Johner, Christie and so on, they may not be rivals to the crew of the ""Sulaco"", you know, but memorable. And the soundtrack was very good, surprisingly powerful.Not as hypnotically beautiful as the first one, of course. And not as big as the second one, but not as pretentious and production unlucky as the third installment in the franchise, ""Alien 4: Resurrection"" features a solid cast in a simple yet very competent ""sci fi"" action horror with sights for the eyes to behold and threads for the brains to investigate.",Alien - Resurrection

The first two are pure masterpieces from the acting to the characters to the story, screenplay and art direction. Beautiful. Then, i watched number 3 and this one, and i almost cried because of what these two directors did to the saga, they destroyed it top to bottom. I absolutely dread ever watching these and feel the utmost sorrow for those - other than me - who did as well. I strictly believe fincher and jeunet should make a public apology for making these. I LOVE Ridley Scott films, every time i watch one i'm literally left speechless. One of my favorites is Legend - awesome.

I don't even care about opinions anymore concerning this film, no offense, i just hope you'll watch the first two before watching this. I'll give a reason: if you watch this you'll get used to the 'ol ""we're getting chased through science fiction garbage by a killer alien and it is extremely action-packed and scary...bla, bla, bla.""

282,mhajs,The weakest chapter of the saga.,3,14 August 2005,"Alien : Ressurrection (1997) by Alan Sampaio* out of ****This movie is deadly awful. First, the worst thing they could have ever done: to resurrect Ripley. Ripley's dead, man! Why resurrect her only to make another movie? Money, anyone? Great possibility. At least, they could have cloned her, but stay with her personality of the past, the great, powerful, kick-ass Lt. Ellen Ripley. But they changed the character completely! Now Ripley's more humorous, smiling all the time, giving us an idea that she's enjoying what's happening around her. And to kill an alien is as funny as it is to kill a monster in a video game for her. Bad consequences? The movie lost all the true alien elements from the previous movies: horror, suspense, fear emanating from the characters, all the essence of the alien movies has gone. And even Alien³ was too, an awful chapter in the quadrilogy, at least, Ripley still has Sigourney Weaver's great performance on her side. Weaver really did a horrible job, playing Ripley in Alien : Ressurrection, and that's a shame and at the same time, funny, since she was nominated for best actress in a leading role for Aliens (1986). And there's still people who think that this movie is ""not great as the others, but still good"". I don't believe it. This movie sucks in every way.I haven't watched other Jean-Pierre Jeunet movies yet. But if you consider this one, the others must be a disaster. (Or maybe not, because in every artist, there are high and low points). But to insert humor elements in a horror/science fiction saga must have been the idea of a god! Ron Pearlman plays Johner, one of the few great characters in the movie. His presence on screen would be much better, had the movie sustained horror and dark elements from the previous movies. His performance is great, but why kill a spider with a gun and kiss Vriess in the mouth? Must be that god-idea thing. The rest of the cast includes Winona Ryder, Michael Wincott, Gary Dourdan, Brad Dourif and some others. They make a very good list of great actors, but some roles in this movie are pathetic! The action of the movie is quite good, but with no horror elements, like the ones we see in Aliens. When the creatures sneak in the complex right at the end of the movie, when all lights go out and all we see is a red light, we notice how the characters are frightened. They shoot, while at the same time shouting like they'd really die right there. But in A:R, it seems fun to kill aliens. I wonder why they didn't do that Luke Skywalker thing in Episode IV, when Luke and Han are escaping from the death star and fighting some ships in outer space: ""Ha ha! I got them!""The story might be good, but is completely unnecessary and added nothing to the saga. Breed more aliens using human victims. Then they escape, and... let's hunt some buggies! And, also, the special edition DVD added nothing interesting and I even dare say that it's become even worse than the original version. That beginning credits where the title appears? What the hell was that bug, being squashed by that guy? And the ending was much worse than the original. The dialog's is almost the same, but this time, Ripley and Call actually land on earth. I preferred much more the original where we only see the skies from a high height.I really do hope they don't make another alien movie. Because the truly good ones were only the first two.",Alien - Resurrection
283,NEFARlOUS,Better than expected: As good as hoped?,10,30 September 1998,"Perhaps it had something to do with Alien3 - a badly shot, confused film set in what looked like a large Victorian Toilet. But I went to see the (apparently) last installment of the Alien series with no expectations whatsoever.Better than expected:The Ripley of Resurrection is - in a word - dangerous. Her character changes quite a few times dring the film, from brooding to laconic to furious to distraught to plain nasty: all with an undercurrent of something menacing beneath the surface, like a dorsal fin on a heavy sea. This is the best performance that Sigourney has ever done in the entire series. Her support is also quite good - from the Gucci-ceries carrying a hijacked crew in suspended animation to use as carriers for the Alien young to the Conscienceless Scientists and Military aboard the Warship. And now to the important part - The Aliens themselves. After the god-awful obviously computer animated alien of the last film, we are finally back into Geiger-esque territory - and none too soon. The Alien warriors have undergone yet more modifications. They are more streamlined and inhuman looking. More importantly they move in a realistic fashion which does'nt look as if the camera was merely overcranked. (They're a bit more intelligent also!) The genetic prequels to a successful Ripley were Truly horrific and the discovery of the same was one of the few moments in film that have honestly put a shiver down my back. The storyline was a tad simplistic but perhaps that was for the best, with fewer gaps showing and allowing the film to progress at a fluid pace.As good as hoped?No. But considering the impact and flavour of the original film, (which despite the effects looking dated today, it is still the most powerful and believable film of the four) I certainly was not disappointed - In fact I think I'll see it again - Soon.Dan",Alien - Resurrection
284,NEFARlOUS,"Aliens2:The revenge - well, no - sorry....",10,18 April 2001,"Aliens2 this ain't - and that seems to be the reason for the overwhelming amount of bile that has been heaped upon this film, mostly by American reviewers. You see, this does'nt try to play by the numbers - don't get me wrong, this is not war and peace, but it's not studio kowtowing either. Resurrection manages to take the unintentionally amusing and laughably patchy Alien3 and come up with a plausible way to bring back Ripley from the dead.Now all those expecting Ripley to bond with a cutesy little girl, strap together two guns or get down with her bad self inside a power suit will no doubt feel let down by the new ""alienated"" Ripley that manages to be far more menacing and infinitely more interesting than the old one.All those expecting the Marines to kick Alien butt will also be disappointed - in this film they actually manage to do the more believable thing and vacate as soon as possible rather than provide the Aliens with HostsRus. This Ellen Ripley is unsure who she likes less, the humans or the Aliens - she's unsure of what she is or whether living is worth doing. Ironically enough, it's left to a ""Artificial person"" to sway her.The scene where she discovers the earlier failed experiments is possibly the best in the entire film, let down only by Pearlman's subsequent one-liner. How many of us doubt that if the science was available, that some government or organisation would do this? I don't.The supporting cast works well, whether it's Wincott's sudden death, Hillard sobbing before being the last to go underwater or Wren's complete immorality.The whole idea of the Queen inheriting from Ripley as much as Ripley inherits from her is very intriguing and original. The newborn, whilst not geiger-esqe enough for me, somehow portrays a sense of innocence whether looking for guidance from Ripley or biting Christian's face in half. I found its end disturbing and unconciously put my hand over my mouth. I don't know whether this was well done, needlessly graphic or just plain revolting. Perhaps a mixture of the three.The ending left me a little cold, but as a whole there was the sort of attempt to get inside the Alien (as opposed to the reverse) that the series really needs.Alien remains - by far - the best installment of the series with characterisations that seem very real, claustrophobia and hidden deaths that work better than any amount of snot-splattering explosive effects and a COMPLETE lack of corny one-liners or machoistic attitudes. What it will never be, is the favourite for those that prefer large firearms, big explosions, flashy CGI and largely two-dimensional characters.

286,vkn,The Aliens vs. their worst enemy; commercionalism,7,11 October 2000,"Although there are some pretty poignant scenes in here, and this is overall quite enjoyable to watch, it suffers from quite a few flaws of a typical Hollywood (i.e stupid) big-budget late 90's action thriller flick; rather corny dialogue that fails to be properly witty and over-uses a rude word that rhymes with ""duck"" every two minutes, an overall plot that often seems too far-fetched and flimsy to take seriously (although everyone on-screen pretends they do), a general balance of brawn over brains in the form of tacky computer-made special effects, and over-milkage of one annoying little movie star (Winona Ryder in this case, who manages to be genuinely irritating. Her character Call is a screen-hogging nuisance as well).
Nevertheless, this is entertaining enough to watch, with lots of shooting, some pretty strong horror moments directed with decent flair and of course, the Alien monicker to back it up. The big problem is that many will feel that the Alien franchise deserves much better than this, which feels way too teenager-oriented.

With the same idea of exploiting the aliens for unknown reasons (hundreds of years later and by another company other than Weyland, for some reason), it is not clear at any time what the real intent with this forth entry in the franchise was.Not even Weaver is able to hook us, as she is present throughout the movie with no explication, only to drive the plot as needed. Why would they stick with the one character that might attract the enemy? If in the beginning, the movie seems to play around with the idea of the unreliable nature of this Ripley, as her literal alien insticts might make her the real enemy among the group, it is soon forgotten in favour of her traditional persona we know and love from the prior films.Also, although knowing before hand about the android character, by now is already a given that every Alien movie will have a surprise robot to turn the tide in some way, and so the supposed twist comes out completely ineffective.
The only difference is that this one is programmed to be good, instead of the expected corporate loyal ones we've been accustomed. ""I should have known. No human being is that humane"".

And they aren't, the antagonist human characters in each Alien-film are just as big of a monster as the aliens.In this 4th entry, we see how far such human antagonists go to get their hands on the xenomorph species yet again. 200 years after Ripley's death, she is revived through a cloning process. In a pivotal scene, it is also revealed Ripley wasn't the first clone. Sigourney Weaver's acting in this scene is nothing short of amazing, as she witnesses the horrors that came out of the many attempts to bring her back. It is definitely the movie's highlight...The film is also more gory then the previous installments which, along with the fact there are a little too much and underdeveloped characters, makes it come off like a typical horror/adventure movie and as a result fails to fully satisfy.

I was in the minority of people that enjoyed Alien 3, yes it was flawed but it tried something different & in the final scene the Alien saga was brought to a fitting conclusion. It also didn't resort to ripping off the death-by-airlock idea from the original which was stolen for the sequel. The fourth instalment again has a variation on the originals ending but this is not the greatest of its crimes. It is set for some unknown reason 200 years after Alien 3. I say unknown as neither the sets or the hardware reflect any significant advancement from the other films in the franchise. Yet again we have blokes with guns running through industrial pipe n smoke filled corridors but these individuals we neither care for or understand. They are sketchy characters at best, cliched bad guys with ricocheting bullets & other comic book tricks. This whole film is like a cartoon version of Alien aimed at the MTV generation. This is not surprising considering it was scripted by Joss Whedon. If you wade through the dross there is the hint of a good film in here. Bringing Ripley back was really the only thing they could do as an Alien film without her would be even worse (is that possible). The Ripley clone with Alien characteristic is an enticing idea but one that is wasted here. Maybe she should have been the bad guy, the Alien species absent? The scene in which she destroys here clone 'sister' was what I thought would be a turning point for the movie but alas this was not to be. Now we come to this films crowning glory the woeful, laughable alien/human hybrid. What on earth was that THING? Were the designers actually proud of creating this?

I almost forgot how scared I could get from watching a film, but re-watching Alien reminded me how un-scary most recent 'horror' films are.Aliens also has horror, but focuses on action. It also ramps up this action steadily in such a brilliant way that every second of the film is thrilling. Watching Aliens again was just as thrilling as the first time. Films that can do that are rare, and certainly worth a score of 10.Alien³ is a mess. It's way too obvious that there have been problems with the script and the directors, and the fact that they obviously got rid of most of the characters that survived from Aliens is jarring, but in the end Alien³ is not awful. It has a unique atmosphere and some memorable scenes. One of the biggest problems is that it has almost no characters to care about except Ripley. The only other interesting character is abruptly killed half-way the film.Alien: Resurrection is also a mess but in a different way. Of course, the whole 'resurrection' concept is ridiculous but I could forgive the writers because there was no other way to continue the saga with Ripley included. What struck me the most is how little I remembered from A:R, even though my previous viewing was more recent than the other films. In fact, it has about three or maybe four memorable scenes and about two memorable characters. The rest is forgettable, albeit still entertaining.While Alien³ still had some thrilling scenes, A:R relies mostly on gore in an attempt to be scary. Because all 'horror' films from the last decade followed this trend, I got used to seeing CGI monsters, horribly deformed mutants and people being ripped to shreds in all details. The original Alien is still scary because so little is shown and so much is implied. Seeing a dark corridor and knowing there's something horrible in there without actually seeing it, never gets old. Seeing a monster again and again, no matter how meticulously crafted it is to look hideous, does get old.Overall, the last two films are OK and good enough to keep the Alien fan in me entertained, but you won't hear me protest at all if a director steps up and makes a *real* sequel to Aliens without even acknowledging the existence of A³ or A:R.",Alien - Resurrection

If you look closely at the film, the people die in very gruesome ways that it would make the Jigsaw Killer from Saw cringe. The characters are so stupid in this film that you have the feeling like your just watching a documentary on how stupid people can be. There is one scene where the captain of the crew ship that boarded the main ship heres a noise in the distance in a separate hallway. Instead of running, he investigate and I'm pretty sure I don't have to tell you what happens next. Now I like how director Jean-Pierre Jeunet puts a twist to this film but the screenwriter should have studied the first two Alien films (at least the first one) and see how they killed people instead of putting close up shots in and depict the grossest way a person can die.

I have no idea if Joss Whedon, who can write decent scripts when he wants to, is responsible for the incomprehensible story that is this film's main handicap, or if Jeunet rejigged it to suit his more baroque style, but in either case an acknowledged talent screwed up somewhere.",Alien - Resurrection
300,Eightiesjunkie,Alien Regurgitation,1,29 November 2014,"As much as I'd love to do two in-depth reviews of Alien 3 and Resurrection, I'm afraid I just don't have the time and patience for that. However, since I detest both films with the fury of an F5 Tornado, I decided it would be therapeutic to vent my anger in a scathing, uninhibited, unfriendly, rage filled review of both films. Not to mention, rant on how each sequel, crossover, or prequel released after James Cameron's Aliens, has severely tarnished the legacy of the first two magnificent films. Let's begin with Alien 3. After the box office smash that was ""Aliens"" 20th century fox immediately rushed a second sequel into production. Screenplays were written and thrown out, directors were hired and fired, simply put: The production was troubled from the very beginning. No one knew what to do, or where they wanted to take this film. So after languishing in development hell for a while, The Head Mother f*cker(s) in charge at Fox decided to take two plot lines from two discarded screenplays and mush them together. Director David Fincher was hired and was basically told to make something out of those two plot lines. So here we have of Alien 3, and everything is just plain poor. However, it's not just simply the fact that the film is poor, it's also that the film is such a depressing experience! We learn that somehow, two alien eggs got aboard the Sulaco, the characters that we loved and cheered for: Hicks and Newt have died, and that Ripley is not only the sole survivor of the crash, but also is the only woman on a prison planet consisting of murderers and rapists! Who in their right mind thought that this was a good idea? Who thought that a bunch of murderers and rapists would make for good protagonists?! So to make a long story short, Ripley has discovered an alien inside of her, the prisoners kill the other alien that's been killing them, the company wants the alien that's inside of her, Ripley won't have it, and so she kills herself. So fast forward a few years later, and another alien film is announced. All of us alien fans collectively breathe a sigh of relief, and we think to ourselves: ""Okay great, they know that the last film was awful, and now they're going to make up for it."" Unfortunately, with the next film, we're all let down even more. But what baffles me, is that people all over defend the fourth film by saying: ""Well yeah, the fourth film was bad, but everyone knew that it was just a cheap cash grab anyway, so they just walked through it and didn't even try."" But isn't the whole point of film making to try to make a great film for people and fans to enjoy? I'm insulted by the philosophy that ""Resurrection was better than 3, because they weren't even trying anyway."" Yes, Alien 3 was, and still is a horrible film, but at least the people involved actually tried to make something good out of what they had to work with. With Resurrection, the people involved had a golden opportunity to make a great film, and to please the fans, and rectify their mistake. Instead, this film is nothing more than an excuse to make money. Everyone involved was just looking for a quick paycheck! No care or thought was given to the fans of the franchise, and that's heartbreaking. Sadly, it only got worse after that. Clearly no one cared with AVP, AVP:R, or Prometheus either. Still, we have these excellent, ground-breaking films in ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" and no matter what they do with the franchise from now on, Nothing can, or will ever take anything away from their individual greatness!",Alien - Resurrection
301,Old70115,THEY BLEW IT AGAIN,7,25 June 2004,"Fox went ahead and did this Alien  sequel even after the last movie not much better than ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"".  Don't get me wrong bringing back ""Ripley"" from the dead via D.N.A. was a smart idea however they should of had her wake up from a nightmare and then we see that ""alien 3"" was her nightmare (as well as the studios nightmare).  If they went ahead with that they could of brought back ""Hicks"" ""Newt"" and the robot from ""Aliens"".  This movie is a little better than ""Alien 3"" but so is  going to the dentist.  As far as future goes for more sequels lets hope they bring in someone that can fix this mess!  At one time Danny Boyle was to direct Alien Resurrection I hope if there is another ""Alien"" movie they get him ( he did 28 Days Later) or John Carpenter of ""Halloween"" and ""The Thing"".",Alien - Resurrection

303,DomiMMHS,Failure!,3,4 June 1999,"""Alien"" was an original: suspenseful, haunting, claustrophobic. ""Aliens"" was the most popular part, but the one I didn't like because I just experienced it as very boring all in all. ""Alien³"" was very dark, but in its darkness it really had power. ""Resurrection"" is indeed much more suspenseful than ""Aliens"", but it's just too obviously just stupid.It doesn't really seem to be a bad movie, because it is very entertaining. It's gloomy, creepy, suspenseful and very much action. But it's only visual, if you look at it as a puzzle, no piece fits the other. When it comes to a quiet scene and some dialogue, you get like paralyzed and ""Huh?"", ""Explain?"", ""Come again?""... When you read a synopsis it sounds like it made sense, but... I don't know: We get too much and no time to make something of it.The movie seems like very very much was just cut out and thrown away. There are many scenes that seem to indicate what kind of story should have been told. Like the one where the big alien creature seems to like Ripley because she's one of her kind. The whole Ripley with alien DNA idea was interesting, has always been announced and praised, but it's not worked out. Most of the time is running, facing the aliens, trying to figure out who is who and who is dead and who not, who is up to what. It seems like Jeunet wanted to tell a story, failed and did something different.As in all Alien features, the cast consists of (up to date) rather unknown actors. But in ""Alien"", everyone was talented and everyone was to become a well-known actor. I hardly think anyone will speak of Gary Dourdan again, for example. The cast consists of Sigourney, Winona Ryder, Dan Hedaya, Brad Dourif, Michael Wincott (who looks a bit like Gary Oldman), many many un-known people and in one of the biggest parts one of the most unsympathetic and un-shining men in movie history, Ron Perlman. No good at all. Even Winona Ryder is just silly in this one.It's visually stunning, atmospheric but: don't think, just watch! Maybe you shouldn't even listen.Oh, and I read that there was some irony in the movie, and I have to agree, there is. But there's also a lot of dullness therefore. So if one would take it all *personally*, he or she would maybe both enjoy and suffer. Rating: 4 out of 10",Alien - Resurrection
304,Erichnathanbennett,"Weird, stupid, gruesome, waste of time and money",5,19 July 2010,"This movie was horrible. I can't believe that they did this. We all saw Ripley not only die but practically melted and disinigrated. And they brought her back to life. That was probably the biggest mistake. When I saw the third alien movie, I thought it was pretty good but it was no where near as good as the first two alien movies. This movie was just a disgrace.And this movie was scary no doubt, but it was really weird scary. And when I say weird scary I mean like imagine yourself at the most emo, goth, extreme heavy metal concert and you're in the middle of that giant crowd. Now imagine what they're doing, their faces, and they're behavior. Maybe I'm exaggerating a little but you get the idea.And in all of the alien movies there was some kind of final fight or battle at or near the end. First alien movie was the alien getting thrown in space. Second movie was Ripley vs. the alien queen. Third movie was getting the alien into the led pit. In this one, there really wasn't one. The closest I can say it can get to that is when that weird human/alien hybrid (I have no idea what it was I'm just taking a guess) got sucked out that little hole in the window.First of all that alien hybrid was just a screwed up idea. Second of all how do you make a circular hole in a window without a gun and without shattering it when you're travelling at 900 mph through space, and third that was just really weird/strange scary when the alien got sucked inside out through space.Another thing, critics gave this movie two and half out of four stars. what is wrong with them.This is just another example of why they should not make a fourth sequel or more to anything. They should just end it in the third movie. And not a never to be revealed cliffhanger at the end, I mean an ending where there aren't any holes in it. Do you know why there's trilogies and no such thing and if there is no one uses the word, as quadrilogy? B/c things come in three's. Just look at Blade or terminator or tremors, and many others and this. The fourth sequel of any movie series sucks (usually). And anyway three is enough.So for all you actors out there who is ready to star in the fourth sequel, think about what you're doing. Consider that three is enough. The fourth of any movie sucks. And alien resurrection is the worst of them all.",Alien - Resurrection
305,siit,Oh dear... what a mess !!!,6,21 January 2006,"Budget constraints were a major issue at the beginning, throughout and in post-production- and it shows. As an avid admirer of the Alien saga, I am thoroughly disappointed with Alien4. And there are two major reasons; one they did a very poor effort in explaining Ripley's presence and Sigourney Weaver struggled to promote credibility to the resurrection. And two, and most importantly, the image, the sound and presence of the 'alien' was so removed from the past three movies it was atrocious.The general idea of how hosts for the queen were obtained were interesting as was the 'biological weapon' angle. Apart from that I could almost weep when comparing this trash to the first three. 6/10 in hindsight is extremely generous and is more to do with the love of the franchise than any true indication of this movie's worth.The last half of this movie is so bad I am embarrassed for the producers. The new alien is terrible and diminishes the power and chill of the alien. The supposed claustrophobic feel they were looking for was not realised, the aliens seemed pathetic in their tenacity to destroy human life and was opposite to what was established.The producers tried to be too clever and ended up not being clever enough.",Alien - Resurrection

After the Alien is surgically removed the Ripley left is one of mixed species' strengths and seemingly divided species loyalty. When the Alien breeds and decimates the military space station, it is left to Ripley and a group of ""where the 'bleep' are the army guys?!"" mercenary smugglers stuck on the outpost to stop the Aliens from reaching Earth.The standard Alien and space special effects are in play here (with one special ""birth"" near the end). The music has a tendency to get in the way of scenes instead of enhancing them. There's a nice mixed group of engaging characters in the smugglers (the lovers: Michael Wincott, Kim Flowers, the horny foul mouthed tough guy: Ron Perlman, the brainy soft hearted wheelchair bound guy: Dominique Pinon, the calm leader: Gary Dourdan, the one with a secret: Winona Ryder) and the obsessed to the point of arrogant blindness doctors (Brad Dourif, J.E. Freeman). Over all, the idea of a hybrid Ripley/Alien is an interesting one and makes for a decent center to a good fun action film.Did the director love Ron Perlman or what?! Gave his rough mercenary smuggler character Johnner all the best lines in the movie (""If you don't want to play basketball I know some other indoor sports,"" ""I can get you off...maybe not the boat..."" ""Waste of 'bleep' ammo...must be a chick thing,"" ""I'm not the mechanic here Ironsides, I just mostly hurt people!"") and Ron Perlman makes the most of it, turning in the performance most likely to be the first thing remembered about the film.Favorite line: ""Earth?

309,BruddanChrist,The bastard Alien,5,7 March 2008,"The death of Ripley in Alien 3 should have put a cap on the Alien series. But 20th Century Fox, in its infinite wisdom, wasn't quite ready to plug a money hose like the Alien franchise. So, it was resurrected (pardon the pun).I like the idea of cloning Ripley. It makes sense to me, given the Company's background, that they would go to such great lengths to obtain the alien. I also like that the clone Ripley is a little ""off"" (for lack of a better term); it makes her a little unpredictable. But the ragtag team of mercenaries facing off against the aliens doesn't work. They're too nihilistic to care about getting scared, so there's no tension. The real trouble starts about halfway through the film, though. The aliens take the backseat, so the characters are left to push the plot. They squabble, exchange colorful language, and push each other around. Then things get rather surreal. Ripley finds the Queen, which gives birth (like a human) to a alien-human hybrid. The alien-human hybrid kills some people, then dies, serving no purpose other than to repulse the audience.The special effects is a coin toss. Some of them are utilized pretty well, while others are poor enough to laugh at. The amount of slime is ridiculous, as well. Yes, the aliens drool, but there's way too much here. It gets rather grotesque, actually.Sigourney Weaver is good, as usual. Her performance is a little odd, but that's due to the character change. Ron Perlman is good no matter what he's in, so I have no complaint with his performance. Winona Ryder is my biggest bone to pick with the acting. It's not necessarily that she's bad, just that she doesn't fit with the rest of the cast. She doesn't make a good tough chick. The other performances are OK, a little overdone at times, but nothing Razzie-worthy.Jean-Pierre Jeunet really screwed up on Alien: Resurrection. But, in his defense, 20th Century Fox screwed up even more by attempting to keep the Alien franchise alive. After Alien 3, there was nowhere to go.

311,Dr_Kruger,What is it that makes it the worst of the series?,5,3 November 2008,"What is it about this film that makes it the weakest of the four Alien films? Visually it's terrific in places. Where Brad Dourif faces off the Alien through the glass in the lab, the set design, lighting is excellent. The music is nice and dramatic and the cast and performances from Weaver, Perlman, Wincott, Dourif, and others are really good too. Some moments of dialogue also put a smile on the face. I quite enjoyed Ripley 8 telling Leland Orser he was going to die and she was the mother for one.So what we have is the basis for a great sequel. Where does it all go wrong? Well the whole concept is just completely ridiculous isn't it. I mean almost every trick that made the first films work (and most other effective action/horror work) is hammered, the main thing being that limited exposure of the actual Alien to keep you on the edge of your seat is gone and here it's practically in every second scene. This nullifies any potential for it to be scary. The final 30 minutes is cringe making at best and since and they didn't even get the science right. I mean, since when does Sulfuric acid dissolve glass? It's a damn shame, because with all the ingredients in the first paragraph in place it had the potential to be better than Alien3 if not as good as the first two.

By the time this movie premiered, many people had a preconceived notion about what an Alien movie ought to be. Jeunet didn't give a s*it about that. I kinda respect that.Of course, there's moments that are plain stupid and overacted as all hell. But try watching this movie from a trash angle; maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised.

Here we see plenty for our ""alternative"" Alien fans - lots of smouldering looks from the new improved Ripley towards Wynona, I thought (could have been maternal - I just don't know). Plenty for our feminist Alien friends - the men were as usual completely useless when they weren't being downright devious. And plenty for our Alien etymology freaks - we can probably build one in our backyard we've seen so much of their insides and outsides.

The fourth time around what we get is a sci fi actioner, a fun ride through space with aliens as a mere gimmick. Die hard alien heads might be unforgiving - and with good reason. If you don't care for the franchise but love yourself a gory laugh, you're in for a face hugging, chest bursting treat.The atmosphere has changed and here is why: The Ripley of A4 is not the Ripley we once knew - for the simple fact that she's dead. Weaver is actually playing Ripley's clone number 8, a clone with a xenomorphic vengeance. Her blood is acid, her powers are strong. Aliens won't touch her as they consider Ripley as one of them. So... where's the suspense when we needn't worry about the heroine? Clone number 8 doesn't worry about itself very much either. Instead of a deadly serious, protective female what we get is a cynical, indifferent thing with super powers. That's fun to watch, but is it frighting? Is it breath taking? Is it menacing? Nah...And then there's Dan Hedaya playing the boss of the space ship and the comic relief. But what it is he comically relieves us from is beyond me. His overacting is totally out of line and makes no sense, not even in Whedon's Alien universe. Good thing he's killed of quite soon.Then we're manipulated in falling for Winona's character. Don't.

320,Alan One,"Great concepts, weak story",5,12 November 1999,"Alien Resurrection supplies us with the logical extension of the conceptual issues raised in the previous three films; unfortunately, the story doesn't take us through them in a satisfactory way.Ripley's identity becomes more and more entwined with that of the alien throughout the series.  In Alien, it is little more than a lethal opponent; Aliens created a set of parallels between the two, primarily motherhood; In Alien3 the parallels become intersections, portraying Ripley ""pregnant"" with an alien.  Now, Ripley and alien are reborn through cloning, a process that intermingles their genes, and conflates their identities even more. Ripley's blood is acidic, her physical traits are enhanced, and she communicates intuitively with the aliens.  The queen alien, for its part, gives birth to a human/alien hybrid, which identifies Ripley as its mother. These are all pleasing developments.  Also, Juenet's visuals are at least as striking as those of the previous films, crisp and stylish.  Both Brad Dourif and Dan Hedaya provide solidly enjoyable performances, in addition to Sigourney Weaver's serene Ripley.Instead of unfolding carefully and thoughtfully, however, the movie rockets into confusion in the first 20 minutes, and the rest of the film is a flacid series of chase scenes.  It chooses not to focus on the most interesting of the new characters (Dourif's alien-loving scientist, and Hedaya's General Perez), who are dispatched as soon as the aliens get loose.  Instead, we get to muck along with the foul-mouthed crew of smugglers as they work their way through the alien-infested ship, which, minus the shocks, is nothing less than boring.Alien Resurrection also reverses much of the work of Alien3, which attempted to return the alien to its status as a sort of supernatural death-figure. The components of the alien (which were so utterly horrific in the first film) are now gimmicks; one alien presses a button with its extendable jaws; in another scene, a ""chestburster"" is used to kill one of the bad guys by placing his head right over the point of exit.  (This last scene is one of several that are sure to make this film remembered as the most gratuitously gory in the series.)There are several other moments worth mentioning (such as when Ripley discovers a lab that displays the results of failed attempts to clone her), but they are usually deflated by the lack of dramatic tact (in this case, one of the smugglers says snidely, ""Must be a chick thing,"" after she destroys the lab in rage).

323,LordBlacklist,The Fatal Mistake.,6,9 February 2006,"Review 4 of 4With Alien 3 closing the story arc of the Alien trilogy, this film begins with a fresh slate. The Alien films have always been a director's series but in this film it was the writing that ultimately killed it. Resurrection tries to be too many things at once. It has a very artistic and dynamic visual style, but cardboard characters. It has a very overt sense of humor, but it is all done in a very juvenile manner. Much of the maturity and restraint of the previous three films is thrown out in favor of a more comic book style. The cinematography and set design is gorgeous to the point of decadence. Sigourney Weaver has been given an interesting character to play and does it with a strange sense of detachment that lends more depth to the proceedings than the script ever could. Thinking back, the first three films all had very solid overall stories and well developed characters while Resurrection has a very solid concept but can't seem to build a coherent movie around it. If you follow the overall themes of the series with the first, second and third being birth, life, and death respectively that leaves Resurrection on shaky thematic ground. Since this is Alien: RESURRECTION obviously the filmmakers wished for rebirth to be the theme, but somehow it never quite works. The characters are basically action movie clichés, and the action sequences of the movie are hopelessly contrived. Why does the Alien always stop to snarl before it attacks giving people just enough time to shoot it? Alien 3 did not have this problem and it reinforced how dangerous the creature really was. Resurrection turns the Aliens into monsters from a B-movie. Very few scenes in the film are particularly memorable. Sure, the underwater chase is a nice bit of action derring-do, but there's no real sense of danger...except for the supporting characters you barely know who get killed in the reverse order they appear in the credits. Two fantastic scenes that I wish there were more of in the film are the doctor's examination of the Aliens where he ""plays"" with them. Now that was a scene of inspired genius. The other scene was when Ripley wakes up in her circular chamber. It is interesting to note that neither of these scenes have any dialogue, because the dialogue is pretty atrocious. Ron Pearlman is always fun to watch and makes a good comic duo with Dominique Pinon, but Winona Ryder absolutely kills this movie with her nonperformance. The effects look less realistic this time out and the score at times seems to try too hard to emulate the second and third films with Goldsmith's original Alien theme being used on several occasions. The film is a brilliant exercise in dynamic visuals but the story really does not go anywhere. Unlike the first three films this one does not take itself seriously at all so the danger level becomes nonexistent. I believe Jean-Pierre Jeunet was an excellent choice for a director but the script served him very badly. This is an interesting film to watch for an interesting scene here and there but not in the same league as the previous films.",Alien - Resurrection
324,laika-lives,Some perspectives on Alien: Resurrection,6,10 August 2007,"The Auteurist Perspective - The most unorthodox way of viewing this picture is as a kind of formalist exercise. Jean-Pierre Jeunet has talked about his desire to make a film tailored exactly to the format of a Hollywood action movie, even going so far as to count the number of cuts and camera set-ups in the blockbusters he watched for research. Everything in the movie may be taking place within quotation marks, as in the melodramas of Douglas Sirk or, more obliquely, Gus van Sant's 'Psycho'. The film wants to be both an archetypal big sci-fi action movie whilst simultaneously a pastiche of the form. The gorgeously overblown shot of Ripley and Call standing amid the clouds at the film's close certainly suggests a playful tweaking of blockbuster bombast. However, the 'Alien' series may not be the most appropriate place for this experiment; the series is far more defined by spaces and silences than by frenetic action of the Bruckheimer variety. Even James Cameron's 'Aliens' is surprisingly slow in its build-up; by contrast, Resurrection's relentless pace becomes oddly monotonous and the film loses the distinctive texture Jeunet brings to it.The Whedonite Perspective - The problems with the script are mostly additions or changes to Joss Whedon's original (which is available online). Whedon rightly made Ripley's resurrection the backbone for the story, finding new things to do with a character many believed had reached the end of her life, both literally and creatively. He also carefully fleshed out the supporting characters just enough to keep them interesting. There are small problems even in his original script - Purviss is sidelined when his predicament demands imaginative exploration, and the narrative is more linear than you'd expect from this writer. But it's the feeble alterations that damage the film - reducing characters like Hillard (in particular) to cyphers, changing the ending so the audience never gets to see earth (the only place, as Whedon instinctively understood, that the climax could possibly take place), and removing a lot of the texture of the setting, like the marijuana fields. 'I'm a stranger here myself' should have been one of the great closing lines in movie history, up there with 'Tomorrow is another day' and 'Shut up and deal', but the dialogue (Whedon's great strength) is mangled by a director working in his second language, and who seems to be paying more attention to the lighting anyway.The Cynical Perspective - The 'Alien' series is, by this point, a cash cow that everyone involved wants to milk until it bleeds. 'Alien3' ended Ripley's story with an unflinching finality that 'Resurrection' can only cheapen, no matter how good it is. The hiring of a cult french director is a sop to the critics who lionise Scott and Fincher's contributions - and whilst prior instalments were filmed in England, this production was mounted in LA, for the convenience of everyone involved. It wouldn't do to make too much of an effort on what is, after all, the latest sausage on the string. The suits' only concern is the opening weekend; hence Winona, shoehorned in just in case Sigourney's box office draw is waning.The Aesthetic Perspective - John Frizzell's score is the fourth classic in a row for the series; both lushly romantic and queasily menacing, it gives the film its own distinctive flavour. The production design is bold and distinctive, with perhaps a hint of playful parody (the sickly green light, the mad scientist outfits, the giant glass jars in the lab); the film looks like a comic strip version of its predecessors. Some of the direction is highly effective - the underwater sequence is devastatingly beautiful. The problem is the slightly over-ripe grotesquerie Jeunet brings out in the material, particularly in the way the cast is shot (Dominique Pinon looks like a malevolent garden gnome, Dan Hedaya resembles a sweaty gendarme). It sits uneasily with the straightforward disaster movie plot. The biggest miscalculation on the production front, however, is the Newborn. The thinking behind it - to give it an expressive face and thus complicate Ripley's (and our) emotional response to it - is sound enough, but it doesn't really come off in the finished creature, which looks like moldy old tissues clinging to a pipe-cleaner frame. Whedon's original conception of a white, red-veined alien of the traditional design might have worked more effectively, although even that might not have survived the aesthetic indignity of its impossible demise, getting sucked into space as a string of alien linguine.",Alien - Resurrection

First movie: Bad alien comes out of nowhere and blows everybody up. Second movie:  Nobody believes in the bad alien until in comes out of nowhere and blows everybody up.  Third movie:  Nobody believes in Ripley, who kills herself to make sure it doesn't happen again (should have ended there).  Fourth movie:  Everybody believes everything and everybody dies because... why?  Because they were stupid, just like the movie.  The whole point of the series is to keep advancing the aliens while the humans try and fight ever growing bigger and better bad aliens.  This movie, they weakened the alien by making it a hybrid, and giving it the instinct for self-sacrifice, things that should never be given to an alien that is described as utterly merciless and virtually indestructible.

The art design and cinematography were great, and the idea of pitting a rag-tag crew of space-pirates against the Aliens has a comic-booky appeal. However, either this crazy French director or the revising screenwriters got WAY too obsessed with the bizarre and the disgusting. The botched-clone room was TOTALLY unnecessary and the ending was down-right awful. They also killed off one of my favorite unknown actors way too early. They had a good thing going, but they screwed it up along the way.",Alien - Resurrection

It is darker and far much more despairing, hurtful and depressing that the previous movie in the Alien-saga. I saw it just once and have successfully completely forgotten everything about it!Weaver and Rider may (or may not) have given solid performances, I don't know, and I really do not wish to know. For me, the Alien-saga begins with Aliens (the second movie) and ends at Aliens. Period. And there can be no stopping that.If you're looking for weak, or next to NO humor, a depressing story, repulsive and disgusting special effects and absolutely NOTHING to feel good about in the end, and an overall major disappointment, I would recommend this..this..thing.Oomph!-meter (from 5): *zilch*",Alien - Resurrection
328,robojames,French Cheese,5,13 March 2021,"After the ending of Alien 3 there seemed no way to continue this franchise. That film wasn't the best way to finish it, but at least we had a sense of closure and a pretty decent trilogy, all told. But films execs needed more money so here we are.In 1997 I went to the cinema to see this and even though my teenaged brain was thrilled to see the slimy black aliens again even I sensed that something was off. This wasn't an Alien film... not really. They brought in a fancy French director to make it look like they were taking things seriously but this was a cash grab, pure and simple.The idea of cloning Ripley from some of her blood and now she's half alien because some of the alien DNA got in her DNA and something something something is just titanically lame. If there was a glue factory for screenplays Alien Resurrection should've been taken there and euthanised before production. This lameness isn't really writer Joss Whedon's fault, to be fair, because there weren't many ways of shoehorning Ripley/Signourney Weaver into this film and apparently they mangled his vision a fair bit when they made this, but anyway... the story is stupid and the movie full of clumsy humour that achieves nothing except for making you wish Hudson was back. They should've cloned him too.There ARE positives, however. The underwater scene is beautiful and the Ripley 2.0 alien can be intriguing at times. The direction is energetic and the movie bounces along in a way that precludes boredom at the expense of being occasionally ridiculous and that is kind of a plus. I'm struggling to think of why I'm giving this 5 when it feels like a 4 but it does possess a certain charm that's difficult to dismiss.At the end of the day, though, this is one of those films where the rating doesn't matter much. Most film fans will watch the Alien series and that means seeing this, eventually, for the sake of completion. It could've been two hours of an alien cleaning the bathtub and playing the spoons on its arse and millions would've watched it. It wasn't going to lose money no matter what so I guess we should be grateful they made the effort they did. Thanks for the scraps of enjoyment, 20th Century Fox!",Alien - Resurrection
329,behamut,"Definitely different than the other Alien films, but unfortunately, this is not a plus.",4,27 September 1999,"Alien: Ressurrection was definitely a good attempt at a sequel but definitely fell short by a long, long way.  The other three Alien films were solid. Their plots were strong and held their own.  If the Alien species were to be real, these films would describe them perfectly, in mannerism and in habits, reproduction, and thinking patterns.  In Alien 4, much of this structure and solid foundation were thrown away.  It is easily proven impossible and contradictory in many ways.  Even the slime and gunk the aliens put off to build their homes was altered and very different. Alien: Ressurection was an addition that was best to do without.  The characters were somewhat weak except for Ripley's.  The only character that truly fit the alien movie specifications was the leader of the Betty crew and he was killed right away.  Too many times in the film did a door open and those who were still alive thought it to be an alien whereas it was someone they thought to have died earlier on.  It might have been ok if it was done once, but three times?  Two of them within 5 minutes of each other. Talk about lacking ideas for suspense. Speaking of suspense, the film wasn't even suspenseful, nor was it thrilling, and the action was weak and almost non-existent.  The film was so full of plot holes and unrealistic ideas and concepts that it was almost funny. And the ""Newborn""?  It was rather a stupid idea to begin with. Now I'm not saying that Alien: Ressurrection was a bad movie, there were some very strong points to it, such as how the newborn was torn between it's thinking of an alien and as a human was very realistic (even though the overall idea was dumb).  The film definetly would have done much better as an independent idea and film but completely lacked everything as an alien sequel.  It truly did not live up to it.  What a disappointment.",Alien - Resurrection
330,behamut,"Good, but could have been done without",4,1 December 1998,"Alien: Ressurrection was definitely a good movie, but lacked much of the strength and purity of the other three.  As in Aliens, the plot was perfect, there were no holes, no corny lines, no cheesy plot.  Alien: Ressurrection had its share of these.  Put it this way, three times in the movie, twice in almost a ten minute span did someone come out from behind a door, just happening to come upon the main group, and just so happening to be (every time) a crew member they thought had died earlier.  Only like 3 or 4 main people died so the aliens weren't that much of a threat.  And you didn't get to see the aliens much, they were just kinda there, as if they were almost minor. It touched all areas of a good movie but lacked in every one of them.  It may be possible to reclone Ripley, but ones genetic code wouldn't include the alien.  This makes for a weak (but pretty cool) main idea.  The baby alien was evil, but dumb.  It was gross and irritating.  Everything that makes the Aliens series so good was altered and tampered with in Ressurection and just made for a poor addition to the Alien series.",Alien - Resurrection

I'll WATCH Alien 3, I might even like it, but this movie is a total piece of trash. Alien 3 had a point, it was meant to be a dark, moody version of the Alien world and it succeeded.  There was a story behind Alien 3.  It might not have been the most exciting, but there was evidence that someone who cared had worked on it. Alien: Resurrection is an example of Hollywood making a little more money off of a franchise.  There's barely any story, just a bunch of people trying to get off of a space ship, most of which characters we WANT to die.  Just a dumb movie all around. In comparison to Alien 3, Alien 3 is definitely the superior film so I don't understand how Alien: Resurrection was rated higher.",Alien - Resurrection

I would say that it's a three way tie between Alien, Aliens, and Alien Resurrection.I'm not going to give any spoilers, or cover the other Alien movies in this note, other than to give vague references for comparison purposes.This movie, in my opinion, was awesome for the following reasons: A female hero along with a female hero sidekick (probably not the best word, but it works for me), which is rare in action oriented movies. It's refreshing to have a female character in the main role in an action movie and I wish that they would do this more often.A great mixture of horror (not as much as the first movie), action (probably not as much as the second movie), and overall dark themes (well, outside of horror) that are in the other movies, but really pushed in this one.The acting, especially considering that this is a sci-fi action flick, is amazing.

I think Alien 4 could have also but like the French director said I think he already put out the best he could with what he had. I liked it a little more. The BLUE RAY pictures are great; not like Prometheus, but worth the time to pickup from your local library, pop it in, crank the sound and watch on a 60inch LCD.

335,saraarts,Surprising and brilliant,10,9 July 1999,"I watched this film with three other people, all of whom, unlike me, had seen all the other films in this series.  Besides this one, I have only seen Alien, the first in the series.  While all of us agreed that Alien was a really good, definitely scary movie -- a real undie-stainer if you're not used to horror -- none of the people with whom I watched Alien Resurrection could remember much about the two other installments of the saga.  I think we will all remember this installment, though.I expected Alien Resurrection to scare me almost but not quite as much as Alien, or to completely bore me like the fourth-generation sequel it is. I was completely surprised.  Yes, it scared me when it was supposed to, and yes, it grossed me out when it was supposed to.  But this is like saying the hollandaise sauce on a dish of eggs Benedict is creamy; true to its arena, this is just what it's supposed to be.  What I did not expect Alien Resurrection to do, and what it truly succeeded at, was to move me and to make me think.  I also did not expect this fourth-generation sequel to be able to stand alone as a work of art which can be understood and appreciated completely separately from the previous generations.In terms of art, the costumes and sets are perfect.  The acting is incredible; there's a whole lot of subtext going on.  The writing is spare; unlike, say, Air Force One, a different breed of action thriller, there is no excess dialog giving rise to ridiculous overacting.  A substantial portion of this film's message -- which is mostly a series of questions -- is delivered by Sigourney Weaver's face.One of the people with whom I watched this film asserts that it is the finest science/speculative fiction movie ever made, the quintessential expression of the genre.  This is because of those questions, the message of the film and the issues addressed.  Speculative fiction at its best explores constants in human experience by removing them from temporal quotidian settings and placing them, at least in concrete terms, ""where no one has gone before.""All the great constants are here.  The very human issues addressed in this film include arrogance, bureaucracy, love, strength on all levels, the meaning of humanity, the meaning of tribe, motherhood, and finally, home and the implications of survivorhood.  Some classic questions include:  What exactly is humanity?  Human or not, what is the real definition of courage? Is there such a thing as ""natural"" selection, and how does free will enter into that equation?  What is a woman?  What are the duties of a mother, and how do we define that bond?  And, in a black-humor kind of way, when is it appropriate to apply tough love?This film is certainly not for everyone.  It's absolutely not for children. It's also not a good choice for either the squeamish or the jaded viewer, or for a viewer looking for an easy thrill or a formula horror flick.  It is a brilliant, ambitious work and one that might keep you up thinking past your bedtime.",Alien - Resurrection
336,jimbofletch,"Oh Ridley, where art thou? (or even David Fincher?)",1,14 July 2001,"Why? I'll ask that question again. WHY? Why was this film ever made? The original Alien is a masterpiece. No doubt. Aliens is the perfect sequel. Alien 3 is flawed, but visually inventive and it makes some interesting developments from the first two films in terms of drama and character. Alien Resurrection is a cash-in. Of course, most sequels are, but this one doesn't even attempt to hide the fact that it is one. It feels, lazy, hackneyed, tired and lethargic. There is no tension, not even in the underwater sequence that everyone raved about (simply because it was too difficult for the fans to believe that an Alien film could be utterly devoid of merit, suspense or interest). The Ripley character looks bored, and is now so outrageously arrogant as to become a cheap parody of her strong female status. Now she is so overwhelmingly macho it just looks stupid. The other characters are pitifully written. The first two Alien films had characters you cared about, and even the third film managed to make some of the victims (tough job considering they were all murderers) sympathetic. But here, all they do is make bad jokes and totally dispel any possible tension by spouting ridiculous dialogue. And for a film in which all the characters do is run away, there is no atmosphere of tension or sense of danger. This isdue to a lame script and uninvolved direction. The special effects are mostly poor, especially in the end, and is a further testament to the overall badness of CGI.There is only one mildly diverting sequence, when Ripley sees all of her clones in the laboratory and burns them down in a moment of grief. Some attempts of character development, but in retrospect, the sequence just feels throwaway, just a bit of filler in between the next inevitable death. It is also doesn't help that the emotion of the scene is ruined by the line ""Women..."" by the stereotypically mysognist bonehead played by that moron out of Beauty and the Beast.Finally. Winona Ryder. She is terrible in this! Of course (SPOILER), she's a robot, but that's just something defenders of her unexplainable star status say to avoid admitting the fact that she is bad in this. Very bad.If Alien 3 was a pale imitation of Alien (albeit not a bad one), then this is a TV movie copy of Aliens. It looks rubbish, has no reason to exist, and completely destroys the credibility of one of the most interesting SF film series ever.

337,maryolalov,The worst Alien movie ever made,5,8 January 2019,"First of all I want to state that I don't think that this movie is as bad as everyone is saying. It is a decent 90's sci-fi action movie. Of course, if you compare it to the previous Alien movies it really seems like a bad movie. Alien was a masterpiece that defined a whole genre, Aliens was a great action, Alien 3 was also a quite good horror (not a popular opinion) and then there's Alien: Resurrection. It is neither a horror, nor an action movie, it's some sort of a mix between this two genres and that just doesn't seem to work right for an Alien movie.Even though Alien: Resurrection is a bad Alien movie it is, as I already stated, a decent action movie. A simple plot and script, filled with puns and medicore jokes, which is typical for most action flicks from the 90's. So, if you ignore the previous movies and watch it as an independent film it won't seem that bad. But there are still a few things that completely destroyed the Alien franchise and made me not enjoy this movie.First, the Alien-human hybrid. I don't know who came up with this idea but it was awful. They tried to make something original and they failed miserably.The second thing that destroyed this movie for me is the whole idea for Ripley being cloned. It just shows that the only purpose of Alien:Resurrection is to continue milking the franchise, even though it died with Alien 3.I can go on and point more reasons why this movie ruined the Alien anthology. But I'll stop here and just say that Alien: Resurrection is another example of how too much sequels can destroy even the best franchise.",Alien - Resurrection

This movie had it all:GREAT F/X - Believable characters - A pretty good premise to continue - Lots of tension and edge-of-your-seat moments - Did I mention the awesome F/X?I'm trying to avoid a spoiler review this time, so I'll keep it simple with my only (very small) complaints with the movie:Why 200 years in the future? We saw vividly in the other movies how ambitious the Company was, why would they wait so long? My guesses to explain are that perhaps they had to wait for technology to catch up to what they wanted to do, or perhaps the previous endeavors had left them financially strapped, perhaps.There was one character death that didn't make a lot of sense. If you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about.As a matter of fact, at the end of the movie, I was left asking only one question - when's Aliens 5 coming out?

339,rocky_lifter69,Decent Idea Killed By Horrible Execution,3,18 December 2008,"If ever a franchise needed a new direction, it was the Alien series. With Ellen Ripley gone, there was an opportunity to do something totally new and original. Instead, the studio insisted that Ripley return and thanks to the cloning of the deceased character (cardinal sin #1 when making a movie), she did, with the alien queen in tow. But that was forgivable because of the idea that came with Ripley (ie the failed clones). Then the director decided to crap all over it and make another bad horror/sci-fi movie with bad cgi.The story is fairly basic. Ripley is somehow cloned 200 years after her death, with the alien queen somehow still in her. The doctors cut it out of her and keep her alive for some reason. Some space pirate types bring the scientists some hyper-sleeping miners and shortly thereafter, we have a bunch of aliens in cages. But these aliens (and Ripley) had some genetic crossover due to the cloning and are much smarter, leading to a fast escape. The rest of the movie is spent with Ripley and the pirates trying to escape the ship, all leading up to a ""shocking"" revelation after Ripley is taken into the alien nest: the alien queen now has a humanlike reproductive system from the genetic crossover. She then gives birth to a nasty looking hybrid, which quickly kills her and sees Ripley as it's mother. Ripley eventually escapes to the pirate's ship and kills the hybrid by letting it get vacuumed out a broken window.A lot of the concepts in the movie could have worked very well. The scene with Ripley finding her failed clones is the best scene in the film. The rest is... well, questionable. Most of the cast (save for the pirates) is just poor, reading their lines more like a dark comedy (although that is mainly the fault of the writer). Save for the clone scene, Sigourney Weaver is borderline terrible and the fact that she got paid more for this movie than the entire budget of the original Alien is horrendous. The aliens themselves look like crap, both in color and how they are portrayed. The little bit of cgi used for the aliens is appalling, even by late 90s standards. And the hybrid alien is a f***ing travesty. It's not scary or interesting, just plain ugly. And the fact that it was designed with genitals (which were removed post-production) pretty much says it all.This movie could have been the start of a new, unique trilogy. Instead, it effectively killed the original Alien franchise and led to us having to endure those horrible alien/predator crossovers. For that reason alone, this movie loses a few points. All in all, this whole story should have never been adapted into a movie.",Alien - Resurrection
340,wtbe7560,It took 200 years to make a clone??,6,11 September 2005,"200 years after Ellen Ripley dived into a pool of molten lead clutching an Alien queen, she's back. Apparently, scientists of the distant future (while, of course, attempting to acquire the Aliens as a bioweapon) have managed to finally separate Ripley's DNA from the Alien queen. They soon discover that not only does Ripley have all of her old skills and memories, she also has a few new abilities. Her blood is now made of acid like the Aliens, she has heightened senses and reflexes, and she can understand the Aliens.Enter the usual Aliens scenario - a bunch of unsuspecting people (this time, a kidnapped spacecraft crew) get violated by facehuggers and the party begins. Of course, even though they've had 200+ years to get this right, they still can't contain the Aliens and all h-e-double-hockeysticks breaks loose.This movie, while keeping with Alien tradition, breaks no new ground. OK, so Ripley has acid blood. Woo hoo. The new hybrid Alien born at the end is positively creepy, but otherwise anyone who has seen Alien 1 to 3 already knows what's gonna happen.

Get a grip on reality people.  The acting is beyond terrible, and the script is even worse.  People who loved Thin Red Line probably think this movie is also quality.  What a shame that we have so many idiots in society today.  Whedon did nothing but take the cool ""one-liners"" in Aliens and decided that was what made the movie work, so the fourth installment is nothing but the lamest one-liner jokes ever.  One scene had potential, where Ripley discovers her cloning mistakes.  But one tiny scene does not a movie make.  Sorry folks, anyone who thought this movie was as good as Aliens, or as good as Plan 9 From Outer Space, is a total fool.  Alien^3 was a huge disappointment, but after Resurrection I have come to respect it more.  I didn't think a movie could get worse. Jeunet and Whedon proved me wrong.  BRAVO GUYS!",Alien - Resurrection
342,Warren-Watched-A-Movie,Declawed Alien Menace,8,23 September 2020,"I think they should have left Ripley dead. I am not sure with who or how they would have replaced her but once a character falls into a vat of molten metal it is time to call it a day. You destroyed the body and it is obvious the actor had no interest in returning at that point. But we get Ripley back in the form of a clone. It is not a bad idea as resurrections go but the problem is Ripley more or less remembers everything that happened before because of genetic memory because her DNA is merged with the alien DNA. That whole bit struck me as lazy writing in an illogical expansion of the mythology that allowed for a fully functional adult character. The xenomorph having genetic memory makes sense (these are an organism we know nothing about) but getting bits of human memory encoded there too seems a bit nonsensical. I get the Alien taking on certain characteristics of the gestational host, but this seems like a bit much.Having said that Alien Resurrection is not a bad monster killing movie. Once again the horror elements are missing. I gave up hope of ever seeing another horror-oriented Alien movie by this point and I still have given that up. Disney has never produced anything frightening and though future films would not be produced directly under House of Mouse, I do not see them doing anything like the '79 film.Alien Resurrection is also not as polished as any of its predecessors. The 90s were a low point in the visuals of science fiction film. This was just before the Star Wars prequels breathed new life into special effects. The original Star Wars films were game changers for science fiction. After they came out companies were willing to invest more money in the genre but more importantly they were wanting to do genre movies that looked better than they had before. There were one or two that came before it that were good looking, but they never sparked interest in studios to do anything that good looking on a regular basis. But as studios turned out more science-fiction films that never caught fire they started to pull back and at this point studios were not putting effort into effects. Just my theory.But it is not a bad movie. In style it is a bit closer to a direct to video release of the era than it is a feature film, but it is still entertaining as a monster hunting actioner. The Aliens are a bit more creative than they were before and appear to be a bit more adaptive. The underwater alien is pretty cool and helps produce intense moments.My long-term celebrity crush Winona Ryder shows up here as Call. Reportedly she took the role to not do another movie in a corset. She is probably the most talented of the bunch right behind Weaver. I enjoyed her performance here though I think the exposition when the truth about her character was revealed felt a little clunky and perhaps a bit lengthy.We have Dan Hedaya as General Martin Perez an incompetent general conducting what are implied to be illegal experiments. I am not sure you can really go wrong with Dan Hedaya. He is just one of those consistently entertaining types. He even helps improve stuff he appears in. I think he was one of the more important reasons besides Schwarzenegger that the movie Commando worked but I am getting off track here.Ripley is brought back as stated before through cloning. She is some kind of hybrid with traces of xenomorph DNA in her. She has acidic blood and black fingernails and is much colder with only fragmented memories. I think she should have just stepped away and the producers should have gone with a new character. One of the pluses with Ellen Ripley was that she was a working stiff going up against a system that cared nothing for her survival. More importantly she was merely human. Here she became superpowered. I think that changed lowered the stakes of the scenario. She was now on a better footing than she was before with her nemesis.In my opinion this movie is notable for being one of the few Alien films where a significant chunk of the cast survives. How often does anybody survive these movies beyond three people. If you are lucky you might get an android to go with them. The xenomorphs were hyper efficient killing machines that required everything the characters had in order to be stopped. Sure they took out the nameless staff of the USM Auriga but beyond that the main cast was largely untouched in comparison to the three previous films. This made them less threatening as people should have been dropping left and right. Basically the idea is throwing a steak at a pursuing dog with the steaks being characters not intended to survive. These dogs really did not need steaks. They were easier to beat as indicated by a lower body count. Joss Whedon significantly declawed them in his script.The story in Alien Resurrection is definitely more action oriented with the horror elements all but forgotten. Frights have been replaced with gore and bullets. If anything, there is more weird than there is fright. From Dan Hedaya's death to the birth of the new type of Alien to that moment where the Ripley clone is getting tender with the hybrid there is plenty of weird. And who can forget when they walk into the room filled with failed Ripley clones. That was a WTF moment if there ever was one.The story is not bad. They manage to generate some tension and a nice level of excitement and it is an engaging addition to the Alien franchise even if they make the threat less deadly. Alien Resurrection is a good film but unfortunately it was the end of the original iteration of Alien. Rather than continue the story, 20th Century Fox decided to create the mediocre Alien versus Predator followed by the abysmal Alien versus Predator Requiem. At some point I will get into those.Alien Resurrection is an enjoyable science-fiction action romp. It is nothing too deep and can be a little pretentious at times when the characters expound but it is entertaining. While you do not necessarily have to watch it, it's worth watching. You will enjoy it.",Alien - Resurrection
343,MadiZone,A refreshing rejuvenation,9,16 December 2005,"The first, second and third installment seems quite similar in storyline. Ripley joins with a team, something goes wrong, corporation is evil, aliens kill most teammates and in the end only Ripley remains. Instead of re-shooting the same story like the second and thirst installment did, this one actually takes a new approach and offers a new story.Using modified DNA, scientists attempts to create a whole new Ellen Ripley with Alien strength. However, as usual, something goes terribly wrong and the engineered Alien Ripley sees herself caught in the middle between the aliens and the humans - each with their moral and natural shortcomings. As the hybrid creation she is, she belongs in both races. Eventually, she'll have to make a choice - because neither side is willing to settle for peace.The movie has more philosophical and moral elements than the former movies in the series. The plot is less predictable, less cliché and more engaging. The outcome is surprising. The dialog is witty. The special effects are spot on. Please, don't listen to the critics.

346,johnnycage10,Excellent movie,10,30 August 2005,"I'm always surprised at the critics to this great film who claim that it's as bad as the theatrical version of Alien 3 or worse than Alien. Truth is that AR is one of the best films ever made, second only to the nearly perfect Aliens and much better than the decent Alien. It's just too bad that the mass audiences did not agree, letting this $70 million gem make $140 million worldwide, and thus securing that the AR genre would not continue. *****SPOILERS****** First, for the positives. That starts with Jeanet's direction, which is artistically and visually beautiful. Then there's the writer, in Joss Whedon (back when he used to be good and before he sold out to maximize his profits). That's proved in the fact that no one could've ever predicted how the aliens initially broke out of their containment. Add to that surprises aplenty (underwater scene was gorgeous) such as Winona Ryder's initial ""death"", the infected miner getting his revenge against the evil doctor, the overall dialogue, and this is one of best-written films anywhere. Add to that the acting, which is excellent on Sigourney Weaver's part, and pretty good on the part of everyone else, with special mention to Ron Pearlman and Michael Wincott's unfortunately-limited presence. And last, the special effects, which are awesome. Granted the CGI doesn't look as good in some places, but truth is that one could not tell this story by using people in suits (such as the ultra-cool scene where the alien jumps out of the water and latches on to the ladder above). But there is one negative, and that's the Newborn. Not that I disliked this monster. In fact, it was impressive indeed, and its death scene was another shocking scene to watch open-mouthed. But the Newborn was unnecessary. We still had plenty of story that could've revolved around the facehuggers, xenomorphs and the Queen, that could've been developed without bringing a new monster into the genre. Personally, I would've had the Queen have a child-like attachment to Ripley, and have the Newborn's death be the Queen's death, which would've made this movie perfect. Overall, it's such a shame that this film wasn't accepted by the masses, and it's also a shame that Winona Ryder made a stupid decision by shoplifting a few years later. I heard rumors that her off-screen behavior is partly what convinced Fox to do the horrible AvP and not do a fifth Alien movie with her character as the lead. Instead, we got Paul Anderson's garbage. What a waste.",Alien - Resurrection
347,emms75,don't bother!,2,11 January 2006,"I watched this film simply out of interest because I am the biggest fan of the Alien trilogy (and yes, to me it remains a trilogy!). I was reluctant, however, as Ripley had died at the end of the third film, and the only reason I could see for making a fourth where she is 'resurrected' was purely to cash in at the box office. That's fine I suppose since, let's face it, that's what Hollywood is all about. However, I really feel that this film was a plain insult to the classic 'Alien', and it's wonderful sequel 'Aliens'. Although 'Alien 3' wasn't quite as brilliant, it was still a very good film which followed in the footsteps of the former two by using tension building and atmosphere as a way of creating fear. 'Alien: Resurrection' fails to do this, and instead relies upon gore. The thing that makes 1-3 of the series so great is that it is kept so simple, despite its setting it is believable, and the characters can be related to in some way so the audience can identify with them and understand their fear. The fourth in the epic has failed to do this as it has gone too far and become 'silly'. I still consider the 'Alien' series to be a trilogy, which I continue to watch and admire. I won't be watching Resurrection again!!",Alien - Resurrection
348,*(CableGuy)*,Halfway towards a good movie,5,2 February 2003,"I remember the trailer for this movie premiering on the internet back in '97 when such things were novel.  The 3""-wide trailer seemed to promise something on part with Aliens.Of course it did.  It was a trailer.Unfortunately, what turned out what a misguided effort.  Joss Whedon, the writer, obviously was not the last word on the script, despite the credits. He knows how to write a pretty complete story, and he never fails with characterization.  Ripley's the only one who has any sort of Whedon touch, and she spends much of the time near-catatonic.  The idea of making her a xenomorph hybrid was brilliant, and gave her a new dimension besides alternating between petrified and vengeful.  However, the logic behind her revival just sucks.  I have no doubt that the trench-coated, icy scientists of 400-odd years from now could clone you from blood samples.  However, that's not bringing what's in your chest back.  If I eat a ham sandwich and die afterwards, they can clone me a thousand times in the year 2453, and they'll never bring back that ham sandwich.  And I won't come back as some human/ham sandwich mix.  As cool as that would be.I thought the film had great atmosphere until I saw ""City of Lost Children"" and realized the director basically copied himself.  Jeunet's happily redeemed himself with Amelie, but that doesn't help this film.  The action tends towards the close-up, blurry variety, except for a couple of set pieces involving improbable bounced gunshots.  I found it stupid that six or seven well-armed people couldn't face a few Aliens.  Especially considering the well-lit hallways they faced them in.  The Marines in ""Aliens"" had no idea what they were facing, and they were in the dark.  No such luck here. In the ladder sequence, three armed characters just stop and stare while a crippled man fights for his life for about twenty minutes.  And I just don't think it'd be that hard to shoot something two feet below you on a ladder.I will give props to the clone and basketball scenes.  I just wish that they, and uber-Ripley, could have been in a different film.So the point of my whole review is, just make Aliens vs. Predator already. Just make it an hour-and-a-half of action.  Heck, leave out people.  It's what the fans have been clamoring for for more than a decade, let Ripley rest.",Alien - Resurrection
349,KWiNK,"If you want something new in your franchise, this is NOT the way to do it!",2,1 April 2003,"Well, yes! After all these bad reviews for this movie, we can do little more than place the blame and I think, the blame is with the producers, who wanted to bring something new to the franchise in terms of genre.This worked extremely well with the first two movies. After ""Alien"" was tense thriller, ""Aliens"" added a big-boom-action element, for which there couldn't have been anyone better than James Cameron. ""Alien 3"" tried to mix the elements of thriller and action a bit more than the second movie had done and, while being too cartoonish as a whole, succeeded in that and - to this reviewer - it was a step down but still OK.Then there's this! I don't even mind the guy who said ""Hey! Let's make the fourth movie a sick comedy with camp-scale 10 acting and sick jokes and let's have a man pulling a bit of his own brain out!"" No, I'll forgive this person, whoever he was. But who were the geniuses that said: ""Wow! What a great idea! Let's do that!""???They put a lot of money into this and got a few great set-pieces and a brilliantly made underwater scene. So, why did they go and waste it on this? There were some obviously super ideas, like Ripley returning as a part-alien and the lost crew of survivors trying to make their way out more or less adopting a man, who they know will soon die giving birth to one of the carnivorous extra terrestrials. But too many characters spend too much time, just trying to over-cool everybody else with brain-dead one-liners and their very special abilities (""Look at me! I've actually got two fire-arms integrated into my, er, other arms!"") or dying in an unusual way, which is obviously supposed to make us laugh.Let's all just hope, the executives at Fox learned something from this and if a part 5 comes along they a) do it with some dignity and darkness and b) let Ripley die for good. Not because I don't like her, but they have wasted a great chance to turn the character into something completely new and now it's going nowhere. If you need a part 6, let Ron Perlman take the lead, because he's the one slightly appealing character in this. (Sorry, Noni! I've seen you do better.) Or he's just used to working with Jeunet and therefore gives a more accustomed performance. Anyway, don't let him be too cool and give him a few problems to chew on and we'll be fine with him as our new Ripley.",Alien - Resurrection
350,Dierk,Underappreciated,8,28 May 2000,"This movie may not be what hard core SF fans or critics wanted to see in the Alien series. But nevertheless it is a very good film.Jeunet -- and the producers in choosing him as a director -- found the funny elements in the Alien saga and made a mostly bizarre sci-fi comedy. Well, it is not the kind of comedy Chevy Chase may stand for. It is a distinctly European kind of humour in the mold of Monty Python.It would be a mistake to give anything away concerning scenes but be aware of some really, really good laughs that will stuck in your throat. Jeunets satire reminds one of the pictures of Hieronymus Bosch, either you like it or not. Oh, and be aware that Jeunet does not need as much ""shock"" scenes like previous directors but uses much more graphic violence and splatter effects.Another thing: With all its gross humour the film delivers some of the most endearing and emotional scenes ever in a sci-fi flic.",Alien - Resurrection

One of the stupidest moments was when the doctor puckered up his lips and presses them to the glass that separates him from the alien that is trying to figure out how to eat him. That kiss was just weird (I can't help but think this has something to do with the French Director: but then again I always suspect the French when I see weird things) And what, after 200 damn years they didn't know they had acid for blood?

353,eskovan1,One of the worst films I've ever seen,1,31 January 2005,"Alien Resurrection is more than just a bad installment to the Alien franchise. It is a horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE film from top to bottom. The script, the effects, the cast, and especially the acting are all unbelievably bad.The script: The whole concept is contrived, disjointed, and completely 'deux ex machina'. Bringing Ripley back from the dead via cloning, even 350 years in the future, is ridiculous. She wouldn't retain any memories of her past life, and the alien parasite inside her at the time of her death could not have 'inserted' itself into her DNA allowing it to be cloned with her. Bringing her back any of the other ways, making it her grand daughter, making her an android, even making all of Alien3 having been a hypersleep hallucination, any of those would have been better.The effects: Not only were they not used to the advantage of the story in any way, in some ways, they were downright bad. Everyone always goes on about how 'cool' the swimming aliens were. Number one, it was little more than a neat little gimmick. And two, it was poorly executed. The CGI aliens looked, well, like CGI aliens. In other words, they looked fake. They weren't quite photo-realistic in their appearance & movements. And they were on screen for all of about 3 seconds. Also the final scene reentering Earth's atmosphere was awful. It looked like they ran out of money and hoped no one would notice. And most of all the, ahem, newborn. The achieved something here alright. They found a way to make H.R.Giger's alien, the scariest movie monster ever, look like something out of a Lucy skit. When that thing appeared I sunk in my seat in embarrassment.The cast: I really like Winona Ryder, but she never was & never will be an action heroine. It should have been obvious from the start that she was a completely wrong choice. And Sigourney, well, she got her 10 million dollar check and sleepwalked thru the role, if not deliberately sabotaging the film because she's sick of her association with them. As far as the rest of the cast, they were all completely forgettable. So I've completely forgotten them. Other than Dan Hedaya and Ron Perlman, who serve as nothing more than comedy relief.The performances: I can sum them up thusly- The director didn't speak or understand English. And it shows. Didn't it occur to anyone that that might be a bad idea?! In all seriousness, I've watched lots of MST3K and Roger Coreman has made better movies than this.Alien Vs. Predator, a seemingly more derided film, just came out on DVD and while not up to the standard of either Alien or Aliens it was about a million times better than this one.",Alien - Resurrection
354,sati_84,It's been 10 years...,5,17 December 2007,"... since I first heard about this movie being made, and when the trailers hit the small screen, I was really excited, even though I didn't find Alien 3 a good sequel to the brilliant first two films of the saga. Alien 3 had underdeveloped storyline. It had a few great elements (especially towards the end), but that's it. I never really got into that movie.The premise of this movie seemed intriguing: scientists capture a bunch of aliens, doing various kinds of experiments on them. Wow! This will be a great movie - I thought.But I was wrong. A:R failed to deliver on almost all levels of entertainment.Story-wise it was okay at best. Scientists, yes, but they don't show you too much experiments. Just one scene made it into the final cut, when the main bad guy, the evil scientist tortures an alien then it learns which switch does that and becomes afraid of it. Big deal! We already knew aliens are smarter than a dog, so even if it's memorable, it has no impact whatsoever.Effects-wise it has nice details and an unique feel for it, but again, nothing special. Aliens look slimier than ever and I didn't like that. Look at the original alien in the 1979 movie: it was smooth and clean, huge and sinister. These new ones are smaller, slimier and don't look that frightening. Sure they're faster, but that's not the aliens' main strength. It is the fear they generate that matters, and it's minimal in this movie. ""Aliens"" on the other hand also featured smaller, faster and slimier aliens than the original one, but it had great story, great cast and brilliantly directed scenes. Although their charisma was downgraded a bit, the movie was equally good. Cameron created memorable scenes using the aliens, while Jeunet failed to come up anything that catches you off-guard. Even the swimming aliens were somewhat dull. You could see that from a mile and a half away...And we've now come to the most important aspect of this movie, which could've saved it completely. Characters. Having great characters in a movie is essential to the storytelling. It was Hudson, Hicks, Vasquez, Ripley, Burke, Ash, Lambert, Parker and the others who made the first two movie. In the third movie it was hard to find anyone who matched Ripley, but Clemens came close. Anyhow, that movie at least had decent ones. A:R only has Ron Perlman as Johner, and that's it. And he isn't even playing a character, it's just that he has a certain screen presence which I happen to like. But I couldn't give the slightest damn about anyone in this movie. Not even Ripley.Well, that's a bit confusing. Ripley is dead, isn't she? Yep. She is. This ""Ripley"" we see in this movie is completely changed. She's an alien. Thus the Alien series lost their most important character, and it's a disaster when you cannot even like the main protagonist in a movie. Her mood, her tone of voice, her remarks, her view... all has changed to... well, alien. She even has acid blood for crying out loud! And no, the problem is not that she was cloned. The problem is that you can't root for a person like this. And in the end, there's no one else left. You don't care about the characters, the story or about the newborn alien, whose design is beyond ridiculous. Come on! Giger is spinning in his grave! Overall, it turns out to be a movie that you don't care about. It's not good, it's not bad, it's completely neutral. So it's right in the centre of your rating system. One viewing is enough, because you can think about what went wrong, and how it could've been better, but that's it. End of story.5/10",Alien - Resurrection

I hope time is the great equalizer for films like AR..many appalling films get lauded and do very well commercially whilst often audiences and critics don't understand or appreciate certain others because they do not suit the times or fashion..Alien Resurrection is one of those breaths of fresh air that operates on a level above what many so obsessed with the genre are able to appreciate.When you consider how truly awful the AvP films have been this is easily a masterpiece by comparison!",Alien - Resurrection

Maybe most importantly it examines the relationship between mother and offspring in a world of warped genetic engineering.The complexity of the plot might at first seem a weakness, but our previous knowledge of the concepts from the other three films allows the film to encompass many ideas that might otherwise be too confusing.How does it compare with the previous films?Alien was outstanding for the concept. Aliens was exciting, introducing the Space Marines. Alien 3, with perhaps the lowest budget and plot lines, still worked because of the ending. Alien Resurrection is by far the most disturbing.

First of all, cloning Ripley back into the series may come off as real desperate, but what can you do when the damage of Alien 3 is already done? I don't buy the idea that Resurrection stands out negatively as a pointless follow-up to the trilogy. If anything, it actually saves the series from ending in horrible fashion, both considering the plot and production.Resurrection starts off brilliantly - the cast is great (apart from the misplaced Winona Ryder) and the Aliens look better than they ever did; the 1st Alien was more magic for obvious reasons but there were technical limitations, whereas Cameron's Aliens were lost in the action-packed style of the film. Fincher's Alien was too obvious in its CGI-ness.However, the whole thing pretty much starts lacking when the action starts. It just doesn't really live up to the initial build-up (which I agree, may not have been that original as such). I will also agree on comments above that Ripley is not the same Ripley that we got to know from the first Alien movies, but again, she was already damaged by Fincher. Also, yes, the villain in this movie is a questionable one, for reasons that the viewer will see as the movie rolls on.I read some comments about how this one isn't scary enough compared to the other Alien films.

I've seen A:R twice, and really wasn't able to get into it much either time.One of the biggest weaknesses in my opinion is that I never had much sympathy for the group of 'protagonists'.  Unlike the crew of the Nostromo in A1 who were basically a bunch of innocents considered 'expendable' by the greedy Company; unlike the confident Marines in A2 who find themselves in over their heads and looking to Ripley for help; unlike the inmates in A3 who've found God and, for all their flaws and foul language, see a spiritual side to the battle...this new group is basically a bunch of scumbag mercenaries.  Charles Dutton's character in A3 frankly admitted his crimes, but at least he had scruples.  This group seemingly has none.  They're just unpleasant.Another problem is a lack of suspense.  Maybe it's the effect of three movies, but the 'in-between' sequences - when the aliens are off-screen - seem too empty to build much suspense.  I watched ""Aliens"" on cable the other day, and even having seen it probably more than any other film in the series, I still got a feeling of dread when they showed the exoskeleton-looking stuff when the Marines were looking for the colonists. With A:R, I simply got *impatient* waiting for the alien to jump out from somewhere.  And what is with that funky-looking hybrid alien at the end? It looked like Odo (from Star Trek: Deep Space 9) after getting splashed with acid.  It didn't look menacing...just ugly.Good points:  Sigourney Weaver is excellent as usual, and she saves A:R from being a complete waste.

Couldn't the company have gotten an alien some other way? How does Ripley have the alien inside her still? How could it take 200 years to clone her? And I thought that the aliens didn't kill one another. What gives? Trust me, there's a lot more where this came from. -Characters keep falling victim to horror film clichés, even after ""Scream"" came out a year before this. How could a scientist smart enough to clone Ripley be stupid enough to look down the hole where the alien just went? -Random, stupid things happen in this movie. So that guy is a traitor? So Winona Ryder is dead now? So after a fight with the aliens, Winona Ryder is suddenly outside that door? So Winona Ryder is actually a robot?

370,AMIO-PatricioMunoz,It might disappoint you and here's why...,6,29 September 2005,"The first three Alien films have a unique kind of ""magic"" about them that I think make up the ideal Alien experience.It is the ""ALIEN"" atmosphere: The first three films depict a very real world around a mysterious and terrifying ALIEN creature that you feared along with the well developed characters.Alien Resurrection has a very different flavor. Although it has some serious moments, there are several areas of this film that are out-of-place in both the film and the saga: Alien Resurrection has a number of humorous scenes which I feel take away from the above described overall ALIEN experience. The director goes straight into the action very quickly in this film so the only well developed character is Ripley. I think that the Alien creature loses a lot of its majesty in this film mostly because of these two critical factors.It is still a must-see film for any Alien fan. It is full of strong cinematic sequences that resonate in your head long after the film is over. But go in expecting something different.Enjoy!",Alien - Resurrection
371,Dutch90,Attack of the Clones,7,2 April 2018,"Alien 3 seemed like and should have been the natural closure of Ripley's arc, and the series as a whole. Ripley sacrificed herself to defeat her extraterrestrial nemesis, and finally found peace after being torn from her home, loved ones and even her own timeline. Alien: Resurrection resets all that by turning to the age-old sci-fi trope of cloning, allowing the deceased character to simply come back. To its credit, the film does try to add something new by returning Ripley as an alien/human hybrid. It is perverse irony that Ripley would end up, albeit partially, becoming the very thing that she fought for so long. Sigourney Weaver, while realizing the material isn't up to par with previous entries in the series (supposedly, she only signed up to stop Fox from making the long-teased Alien/Predator crossover, which they did anyway seven years later), does her best to make this new Ripley interesting by upping the ambiguity of the character - being part Alien, do we even know what side she is on? Still, it's easy to see why this self-aware, sarcastic and superhuman Ripley doesn't appear to core Alien fans - Ripley's appeal wasn't being badass, it was her everyman nature and her brave moral stance against corporate greed, to the point where she gave her own life in order to save humanity from the Company's ill-advised exploitation of a dangerous alien organism. This new Ripley doesn't really seem to care, and condescendingly recounts how she tried to save 'people' once. The film does seem aware of this to some degree, and deliberately casts Winona Ryder's Call in Ripley's old role as the determined anti-Alien crusader who tries to remind Ripley of what she once stood for (and initially distrusting her for being not human, which is somewhat ironic since she herself is revealed to be an android in a potentially interesting moral sub-plot that should have gotten more attention). The rest of the supporting cast do their best, but the script relegates them to stock characters - the evil scientist (Wren), the cool black dude who sacrifices himself (Christy), the amoral seen-it-all smuggler (Elgyn) and the unhinged brawler who just wants to shoot everything (Johner). Leland Orser's Purvis deserves mention for spending the entire film knowing he's going to die a horrible death, and ultimately redeeming his apparent expendability in a final sacrifice (that is, unfortunately, unintentionally funny in execution). The Aliens themselves have become your average slimy, roaring sci-fi monster, clumsily rendered through 90s era CGI for the first time, although the animatronics look better than ever save for an unneccessary color shift from blue to brown (thankfully corrected in Alien vs Predator) as well as excessive slime. Despite some changes, H.R. Giger's briljant design manages to keep them interesting. It's a shame, then, that the film decides to throw another human-Alien crossbreed into the mix in the form of the Newborn. Arguably one of the most hated elements of the film, the Newborn's main purpose seems to be present a new chief antagonist in the vein of Aliens' introduction of the Queen, and to serve as the punchline to the film's obsession with mingling human and Alien together, as if to say we're not so different from these terrifying monsters as we like to think we are. Given its quasi-innocent nature (it bonds with Ripley as its mother), its death scene seems unnecessarily cruel. But ultimately, the Newborn doesn't belong in the franchise - the Aliens are supposed to be a lethal force of nature, not something we can relate to. That is the human characters' job. Alien: Resurrection is by no means a terrible film - it's a fun, gory monster ride. It's just that it doesn't entirely seem to understand what it means to be an Alien movie, and would have worked better as a non-Alien film taking cues from the series than an installment of it. It's also sad that the series has opted for Predator crossovers and prequels/reboots rather than continuing the story, as Alien: Resurrection leaves us in a very interesting place: Earth. The series has never set foot on Earth before, and this leaves the story wide open for any direction. Will the Aliens finally reach Earth? Will Ripley 8 come to terms with her Alien DNA? What about Call's struggle with her non-humanity, analogous to Ripley 8? Sadly, we will never know. There were and still are plenty of opportunities for jumpstarting the series from this point, even fixing many of the mistakes that Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Joss Whedon made with Alien: Resurrection.",Alien - Resurrection
372,DeepJedi,It stank!,1,5 September 2000,"I was so excited about the prospect of an alien film that was a return to quality following the awful Alien 3; all the reviews I had read indicated that it was the best of all the films and that another film was already in the pipeline as a result.  Utter rubbish!  This was the worst 'event picture' I have ever been duped into paying to see in a theatre.  I had to struggle to stop myself standing up and shouting out 'B*****ks!'  One patron was less restrained and shouted some abuse at the screen before his date gagged him in embarrassment.  I feel genuinely sorry for many of those who worked on this film; they must have been so excited to be working on the new Alien film and yet their best efforts were simply not up to scratch.  I could go on for pages citing the reasons why this film was so bad, but frankly, it's not worth even that effort.  Suffice to mention the awful telegraphing of Ripley finding her mutant clones, and of course, *that* monster.  I am reminded of the saying 'a camel is a horse designed by committee', but in the case of Alien:Resurrection, every sequence is a frenzied stampede of triple-humped mokes!",Alien - Resurrection
373,rexdaugherty,I love this one,10,19 February 2011,Like I said I loved this entry in the Alien series its an improvement from part 3. one of my favorite scenes is where the alien jumps out of the water and up to the ladder. One thing I love about this is how some moments it has a slow tension build up not quiet up to the level of alien but they tried and also at other times it action and lots of it like the aliens (1986) other things I like about this movie is the look of it the visuals are amazing but thats one all the alien films have in common is unique visuals and this has very unique one other favorite scene is when Call hooks up to the ship and you hear her voice all over the ship I found that pretty cool well I'm out of stuff to say maybe I'll review part 3 one day,Alien - Resurrection

This rating is simple due to the ever-changing story and action packed events that keep you on the edge of your seats. Ellen Ripley does a great job using her new alien blood to her advantage in her efforts to exterminate the extraterrestrial species.Although the film is by far one of the best in the franchise, keeping track of how the cloning and cross-breeding can be quite difficult. This film is just one of those that will take a few watches to fully understand and articulate what it going on.

375,kz7,How come they make more sequels when each is worse than before?,4,14 August 2003,"I can't describe how disappointed I was after seeing the fourth part in the famous Alien-saga, Alien: Resurrection. The first movie (Alien) was an excellent horror-movie by Ridley Scott. The second movie (Aliens) by James Cameron was decent action-style horror movie. The third one (Alien 3) had some idea but in part it lacked something as well. So I rented the fourth part and bad premonitions turned out to be even worse reality. I can't understand how they can make so CRAPPY sequel to a fine saga - acting is bad, the plot sucks and the script is something unimaginably awful. Please, bury this deep and forget it.",Alien - Resurrection
376,TrentReznorandAtticusRoss,Sorry- was that the sound of Ridley Scott's legacy dying in the background?,5,13 June 2012,"It's interesting when you think about how far movies take their heroine's through sequels. A prime example being, Ellen Ripley, the female protagonist of all the Alien movies, and masturbatory dreams of sit-at-home nerds. In this fourth installment, her journey continues. Sadly. Instead of finding a new face and a new series of what could be a fantastic (or at least interesting) franchise, we have to stick to the same old' same old' Ripley. Trust us, she's not all bad, she's still as kick ass as we've seen her in previous movies, but now it's not the same Ripley. There's no real reason to bring back / or revive - a lead character that so heroically died in the previous installment. Although, there are some highlights. There's a bit more exploration of the human mind, a good example being Ripley and Call, who happens to be a droid, the first female one we've seen - but not enough to suffice for a decent addition - having dreams. It also explores the human nature of curiosity - there's a scene where Brad Dourif gets a little too... Comfortabe with being up close to an alien. Then there's the human side of the slime-stick monster. Brillianty (but unnecessarily) shown through the 'intimate' moment with the Alien. There's also another great human/Alien scene where the Alien's 'argue' over who's gonna die for their escape. Ripley is now also in touch with her Alien side. She's also been stripped down to wearing leather pants and a leather waistcoat. An elegant solution to restraining a very dangerous 'thing'. There needs more talking scenes, instead of more gore and profanity. The other female protagonist, Call, played by Winona Ryder, probably has the most attention here. John Frizzel's score is also a down-point. James Horner's score for Aliens was about as epic as you could get. And who could forget Jerry Goldsmith's score for he film that started it all? Elliot Goldenthal's score for Alien 3 screamed pop culture (then again, don't all of David Fincher's movies do?) and was very junk-yard. It was quite hard to digest, but Goldenthal's later scores were pretty amazing. But Frizzel's score for the film is also by far the worst. He tries to d beautifully disturbing, with a hint of epicness- that's just a very bad combination. His score was too soft, and far too loud. Jean's direction was pretty O.K. Although, this is more like starship troopers - a B-movie with a big budget. I wasn't a fan of in in-your-face camera close ups. The film suffered from pacing problems also. The speed of the film is sped up to a depressingly short telemovie.",Alien - Resurrection
377,The One,"Outstanding Directing, crummy dialogue",9,27 November 1998,"I loved this movie. It had a great plot, great cast, and great visuals. Being a big fan of Jeunet's directing ( His amazing work, similar to A:R, in The City of Lost Children ) I found myself immersed in the atmosphere from scene 1.  The amazing cast - Sigourney Weaver as the cold, angry Ripley; Winona Ryder as the not-so-innocent Annalee; Dominique Pinon as the sly Vriess; and Ron Perlman ( also from The City of Lost Children ) as the masochistic, mean Johner. All these actors provide amazing performances, that really bolster the movie.Almost everything about this movie, the directing, special effects, and acting, were excellent.  The only major flaw is the dialogue.  It was CRAP. I do enjoy Joss Whedon's dialogue most of the time and am a fan of ""Buffy:tVS"", though I thought that in this movie, what with it's dark atmosphere, his TV style ( quips like: Johner - in surfie talk -""Like, what did you do?"", Ripley -""I died."" ) didn't work or fit in any way possible.Despite the dialogue, I thoroughly enjoyed this great piece of cinema, and recommend it to any sci-fi-horror who wants to be blown away...",Alien - Resurrection

I truly think of this fourth movie as an equal.  You learn new things about the Aliens.  New twists are brought to the plot.  Ripley's cloned character, is so tough and interesting.There is so much humor, and so much depth in the writing, that I feel a lot of people have missed it due to the incredible action. Watch it again, imagine how you would feel as a clone, or as one of the recipients, or as a feeling synthetic.  There IS great depth to the characters.  Don't miss that. As for the plot, there are definitely enough twists to keep it going.And special effects?  Incredible.  A few weaknesses here and there.

384,timesplitterz,Easily one of the weakest films in the Alien serious but that doesn't mean its bad film,7,14 June 2008,"With this film I think Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (like all the other directors of previous Alien films) wasn't trying to create a film to match Alien or Aliens just a fun splatter film. it does introduce another new Alien to the universe with the Unborn Alien that many will question weather it is stupid or cleaver, either way Jean-Pierre Jeunet does give the universe something new instead of creating just another Alien action sci-fi horror film. One thing I was against was the use of CGI in the film. I strongly feel that when creating an Alien film that you should never present the aliens in CGI it just takes the whole horror of the creature away and leaves us with something embarrassing. even in the new Alien verses Predator films the aliens don't frighten people anymore because the CGI takes away that realism. Another new thing added to the ALIEN universe is that now the creatures can now swim underwater, being a STRONG lover of the Alien universe I still to this day find it hard to accept but then it was never discussed in any other film weather they could swim or not. The plot also was JUST acceptable although it does ruin the strength of the plot in alien 3, the dramatic ending now doesn't feel so dramatic because we now know she'll be cloned. However if your looking for a little sci-fi horror to wet your appetite or you if your a big fan of the Alien serious and wish to dive into the fourth installment then Alien Resurrection will be your next film to watch.",Alien - Resurrection
385,bluhmfamily,Better than Alien 3 in all ways,6,18 December 2010,"To view back at the previous films: Alien in my opinion was a mega-hit success and one of the only films I rated 10 out of 10. It's sequel, Aliens was also good, but maybe a little too much action, but the sequel still kicked butt and one of the few films I give 9 out of 10. But then came Alien 3 which in my opinion sucked, it had too many F-bombs and the Dog Alien was just a load of stress, Alien 3 was one of a number of films I gave 4 out of 10.But now here is the fourth film known as Alien Resurrection.This film was the runner-up to Aliens because I actually thought it was good. The film takes place in 2850 (200 years after Alien 3)but does not really seem like it actually.The story is about Ripley resurrecting from the dead after 200 years had passed after many failed tries. And 14 aliens come along and bring back the classic spirit of the saga. It also seems that Ripley was carrying and Alien Queen inside her and made the 14 Facehuggers.One of the strangest parts of this movie is the Alien Newborn, who the queen gave birth too but was killed by her own child. the newborn apparently has a crush on Ripley which I thought was kinda strange.But still, there was plans for an Alien 5 which is now never going to be made.

387,MrMuffinMan,"Weakest storyline and script of the series, but good production values and cast",5,5 July 2006,"I'll start by admitting that I wasn't really expecting a great deal from this movie, and so wasn't disappointed. If you enjoy powerful, tight, quality scripting and cohesive story lines, and come at this without having seen the other three in the series, you'll probably wonder what the fuss is about, and agree with me that this feels just like a standard studio money making exercise, and that it would have been better going straight to video. I'm pretty sure it would have done so if it hadn't cost the studios so much to make and if the they were not certain that public was still desperate to see anything new from the Alien franchise store. That we will still spend hard earned dollars on this insipid stuff, is a tribute to the expectations raised by the first two films in the franchise.**SPOILER** IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS FILM YET, THIS CAN'T SPOIL THE FILM ANY MORE THAN THE SCRIPT WILLEffects/Look and Feel The look and feel of the film is generally very good, apart from the **""Son of Mummy Alien""** which is just very sad looking all round. CGI effects, stages and scenery are all pretty well carried off. I imagine a lot of the budget was spent in this department. This area has served all the Alien films pretty well, and no-one has dared screw this up badly (yet) in any of the films.Cast Great leading actors with a very high quality supporting cast, you definitely get the strong feeling they were all trying very hard to keep it all hanging together and make it work. I've no idea what they cost, but I've seen most of these actors turn in very decent performances in other films.Script/direction This is what I think lets the film down. The actors, costumes, staging and effects are all just so much better than the incredibly poor, vapid and soggy script. It feels like there had been a great idea and script, but then someone went and lost the real script and scriptwriter the night before filming, and then just pulled a 4th grader in to recreate the entire story again from a two line summary, scene by scene, as they were filming. Having thought about this some more, and reading through several other comments I realise that is a bit harsh. The director is great when able to work from scratch - his body of work proves that, with several really inventive and interesting films. The writer is not cut out for this kind of film at all, he's really best suited to the fairly lightweight TV style teen dramas, and does these well. I think the writer needed an entirely different take on this script, given audience (for that read ""Alien Fans"") expectations, with it played straight down the line. Doesn't mean there can't be some humour - but that should be from interplay between characters, and not from knowing wise-crack devices for the audience. Often through the film, you had the feeling the writer didn't expect his audience to really believe any of the story, and got bored at points, slotting in quite a few pretty hopeless throwaway lines. Fair enough, many writers just don't get or like the whole (too?)""serious"" sc-fi genre. But it does look like Mr Whedon was never very comfortable with this one. Still, that's not to say there isn't room for a full-on Alien send up in the ""Airplane"" or ""Naked Gun"" style.Marks out of 10I've given it a 4, as I think that is what I would have given if I'd not seen the first two films. If you make any comparison to the first two films and their decent scripts and direction, the mark must be 3. Almost embarrassingly cheesy in parts, but saved from the pit by the nice presentation and interesting cast.The ""What Else Is On"" TestIf this is on, and there's nothing decent on any other channel, you'd probably stick with it until the very silly last 20 mins, when it gets annoyingly bad.

And even if it's a nice movie, with several nice scenes and plenty of cool special effects, you can't help but to have seen it all before. To me, ""Alien: Ressurection"" is very similar to James Cameron's ""Aliens"" (aka ""Alien II""), but it lacks the nerve and intensity of that film. And while Camerons movie from '86 was packed with new special effects that amazed most viewers, Resurrection doesn't come up with anything new. (Although the scene while they're submerged and they fire grenades under water, is quite cool.)All together, it's a good movie, and it delivers what you'd expect from the last movie in the Alien-series.

The underlying threat of the Alien is its mystery, like many things we fear even when we see the Alien its way of thinking is something vastly different to ours, simple and more primal, hence more perfect killing machine. In trying to 'delve into the Alien Psyche' the creature loses some of its scariness. It also lacks a lot of credibility storywise.  The Aliens lack numbers which is fine in a prison or a mining ship where there is no military hardware. Also where did they get bits of Ripley to regenerate when she burnt herself to nothing in molten metal, note the bits needed her DNA after impregnation!!????? Not a wholly unpleasant film but poor acting and a distinctly European feel (whose artistic emphasis lessen a necessary grittiness in this sort of Sci-Fi demonstrated in The 5th Element) mean you don't get quite as involved. Lets look to the novels and graphic novels and hope for an Alien vs. Predator again, which was planned before this apparently but got scrapped........WHY?????",Alien - Resurrection
393,Basement_kid,A disappointing and cringe piece of garbage,3,21 June 2020,"This movie is bad on every level. The tone feels confused trying to be lighthearted and serious and the same time, but ends up a mess. Unlike alien and aliens or even alien 3, which have a cast of characters that have great personality, this film has a cast of gimmicky good for nothing characters. Not even Ripley could save this movie, because in this film she isn't playing herself. She is playing a clone of herself, so even time she is in the movie she seems confused and over sexualizes aspects of her personality. They also feature the aliens way to much in this film taking out any suspense that could possibly be there. The are also many scenes including the spider scene and the overly insane chestbursting scene (if you watch the movie you will know what I mean) where I can't help but laugh at how absurd the movie is. I do like the twist at the end to an extent, but it is very poorly executed and the new design of the newborn is terrible, the scene where Ripley finds failed clones of herself is very powerful, but not as well executed as it could be. I found the death of the newborn hilarious even though I don't think it was supposed to be. I don't recommend this film, because even though it has so bad it's good moments, most of the film is either boring or bewildering. At least something like Batman and Robin is funny all the way through. This is just a sad excuse for an Alien film and seeing as Alien 3 wraps up this TRILOGY perfectly please for the love of God skip this one.",Alien - Resurrection

She's always great to see on screen but this was truly something to behold. and last but not least, I loved the storyline, how they brought the genetic aspect so cleverly. It was truly a new twist on the series, although I wouldn't qualify A:R as a REAL episode in the Alien series but rather a new begining. Jean-Pierre Jeunet did a great job in bringing his fantastic style to Hollywood. The creatures were cool and scary although I wish we had seen more of the Queen; we still had the horrific Newborn which was truly demonic.

What makes it different from the other Alien movies? Well, one of the great things about the Alien movies is that they were kind of intelligent. Interesting and scientific even. Pretty much throw that out the window here. Also, one thing that distinguished the other Alien movies from other ""Monster"" movies were strong supporting characters. You got to see them vulnerable and scared before the creature attacked. You actually cared about them. But here there is no supporting character development, they are just pieces of meat. Characters that the under-developed script writers drag along(characters that serve no purpose), just to kill them later. You can pretty much who will be next and when it will happen. That is unforgivable. Alien Ressurection is more like a comic book than a movie, and in this case, that is the farthest thing from a compliment.",Alien - Resurrection
399,mlg-t888,"Like resurrecting a man who died peacefully, only to then stab him to death with a serrated knife",4,25 May 2009,"Resurrection? Why, what's the point?, what's the logic? what's the reason?, what's the meaning? Why? These are questions that should have been asked before Fox greenlighted Joss Whedon's piece of work, ""Alien Resurrection"". This film is a failure on so many levels it's almost unbelievable.After the troubled production (and obnoxious, studio-meddling) of Alien 3, you would think that someone would just have enough brains to leave it be. Just let it end on a relatively good film (who's only flaw was the studio's editing after Fincher's walkout). But no, they just couldn't leave it alone, the resurrection of this franchise has absolutely no logic behind it. How could this film possibly succeed? Someone should have said.Let me begin my walkthrough of this horrible injustice. The beginning problem was Joss Whedon's script. Who on earth said ""Hey! let's have the buffy the vampire guy write our new Alien movie!"", And then the next big question is: Who agreed to it? The funny thing about it is that Joss has apparently escaped all retribution for this movie by stating that they filmed his perfectly good script wrong. But this argument doesn't hold up when you know the contents of the actual script, in fact, the resulting film did the original script justice (maybe even improvement).The film starts off with no setting, and no background. Where are we now? Why is this ship here? Who are these people? What is the universe's current condition? Are questions that are never fully or satisfactorily answered. In fact the film is so restricted by it's limited scope that it doesn't even seem to know the answers to these questions. It just makes a large amount of excuses to get both weapons and aliens into the picture, and let me tell you their excuses involve, cloning, evil governments and pirates or ""mercenaries"" or whatever they called them (they seemed like pirates to me). Where these people came from, and why are they pirates are questions that no attempt was ever made to answer.The biggest of the script's issues are the mind-numbingly wide plot holes that cause the entire film's premise to crumble. The excuses used to drag our battle-weary Ripley out from the grave is so clearly ridiculous they really can't fool even the most unscrutinizing audience.The foolishly ignorant use of science is used repeatedly throughout the film, most evident in the arrival of the ""Newborn"" (highly original name, ain't it). Apparently.(SPOILERS) Since a group of scientists removed an Alien queen out of a cloned Ripley (not like that even makes sense to begin with), the queen apparently takes on human traits, such as a human reproductive system, resulting in the birth of an alien-human hybrid. The hybrid kills the queen and then identifies with Ripley as her mother (which also, doesn't make any sense). The original Whedon-design of the newborn was so ridiculous that it had to be redesigned into a better (but still awful) combination which is somewhere between the hunchback of Notre-dame and Casper the friendly ghost. (NOTE: All this info is thrown at you within a 4 to 5 minute period towards the end of the movie). (SPOILERS END) So at about this point I was asking, why? what kind of plot device is this. Randomly thrown in, it doesn't help or move the story along just simply makes it more inconceivable than it was to begin with.So aside from Whedon's completely non-plausible script, the entire air of the story itself was a major problem. It successfully rips all terror and dark intensity from itself, only to replace it with what can best be described as swashbuckling campiness. Scenes with humorous intent were thrown here and there with no particular meaning, although the ending result was not humorous at all. There is no substance, not even one original piece worth noting, the entire film reeks of the staleness of it's own concept.None of the acting was really worth mentioning, almost all of the performances felt weak and contrived, none of the characters had any depth or soul to them. Even Ripley has been leached of all her relatability, replaced with weird alien-hybrid version of herself that really leaves no character relatabilty in the film at all especially after a disturbing ""sex"" scene between her and an alien (oh yes, that was in there), they all just seem like disconnected people that we just don't know or care about.As I wrap up here, I will say this, if you are dying for some alien action, this will not satisfy you no matter HOW desperate you are. In fact you would be better off watching AVP, which, regardless of how weak a film it was, was WAY better than this crap.3/10 stars",Alien - Resurrection
400,larseirikf,I almost cried...,2,1 June 2013,"So what I do is to buy the entire Alien Quadrilogy, and sit down for a marathon. The first two were awesome, the third being alright, and then I look forward to seeing how they could continue after killing off Ripley. And with Alien Resurrection, they proved that the third movie should have been the last one. Not sure if anyone notices, but the crew following Ripley in each movie have a lot to say for the atmosphere. The original movie had a spaceship crew, then come the marines, and after that come a bunch of space convicts. Sorry, but I can't see the people in this movie as anything else than a bunch of retards. Some scenes I loathe: the scientist that uses steam to tame an Alien, scenes with that gun-guy ricocheting bullets via the walls and things (it's just not going to work), the way Ripley shows little fear of the Aliens anymore, and (good grief) the new Alien introduced at the end of the movie: Clone-Ripley's hybrid-humanoid-alien-beast-thing. Let's take a look at the last one. To me, he became an instant Jar Jar Binks of the Alien universe. My first thought was: ""NO"". When they kill it, it even looks at Ripley with sad eyes and desperately cries ""Mommy!"" Dear producers, think for a second: this thing had been alive for almost five minutes, and now it has learned English. Just the ending in itself kills everything with the Aliens: the danger, the sinister promise of certain death, and the pure genius characteristic design of HR Giger. Just sad. Please, no more Alien movies after this one. Some things can not be repaired.",Alien - Resurrection
401,Kit-48,Tied for second-best,8,22 March 2000,"This is the fourth film in the Alien series and, for my money, tied with ""Alien 3"" as second-best of the lot, coming behind only the original ""Alien"" in quality. I'm aware that it's an unpopular opinion, but I definitely think that, while ""Aliens"" is a damn good action movie, it is a fairly ordinary science fiction movie, and the Alien series is first and foremost about science fiction.The plot of this movie is simple. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) died at the end of ""Alien 3,"" and now, two hundred years later, the United Systems Military has cloned her and the alien queen inside her. Their genes have become mixed a bit in the cloning process, though, so while Ripley is now something a little more than human, the Queen has her own unique surprises in store.This is an absolutely beautiful film, and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's direction is wonderful. The look of this film - both the sets and the aliens themselves, except for one - is fantastic. The actors are definitely competent, though Weaver, Winona Ryder (Call), Michael Wincott (Elgyn) and Brad Dourif (Gediman) stand out from the crowd. I must admit that I'm yet to be wholly disappointed by either Ryder or Dourif, and they don't even come close in this film.There *are,* however, problems here, or rather *a* problem. The last alien that Ripley must deal with, the nature of which I won't reveal, is a particularly uninspired piece of design. It's easy to see what Jeunet was trying to achieve with its look, but it comes off as tacky and, frankly, ridiculous. It's sad how such a potentially great film can have such a clear point at which it declines.Still, the failures of the last ten minutes aside, this is still a film well worth seeing. A particular highlight is the scene underwater; watch for the differences between the way Ripley moves and the other characters do, and see if you can pick up on exactly what she moves like.",Alien - Resurrection

I can't see why anyone hates this film. I think it's because people feel robbed that the aliens haven't made it to earth. But this film offers a lot. It has a lot of moral themes, it has some good action and it gives the old films a new vision (the ""kill me"" is given a whole new twist). Perhaps a few quirky lines could be taken out.
As a film this stands out for it's own merits, it just unfortunatly has very good predecessors that overshadow this little brother.",Alien - Resurrection

I do believe that its predecessor, Alien 3, had great closure to it, but Alien Resurrection was able to give yet one more great thrill for Alien fans around the world. There is great cinematography in this film. For instance, I think the underwater scene in the film is tremendously done with a combination of slow-motion and fast-paced action suspense sequences. Sigourney Weaver does another terrific job as a true female bad ass. I cannot get over the awesome basketball shot she delivers in the film. There is a very powerful relationship between Ripley's clone and the Alien. It is sad to see the reaction the Alien has towards Ripley betraying it in the end.

405,piajartist,Oh how it got so ugly.,6,12 January 2003,"This entire Alien story was originally a very horrifying sci-fi expererience.  As we past the first movie, they seemed to be filled with too much Hollywood action and attitude.  The characters have too much of the macho attitude towards the aliens.  The acting went downhil in this movie, and Weaver isn't fooling anyone with her attempt to be a dark evil human with thoughts of an alien within.  This movie did have a lot of nice close-ups of the aliens and the queen, so if you respect the anatomy of the Alien you should check it out mainly for the effects not the plot, its one of those kind of movies.",Alien - Resurrection
406,dgefuller,"It's not Alien 4, it's a new beginning",6,8 November 2010,"I've always been surprised as to how much negativity Alien Resurrection has generated. Like its direct predecessor, it is a much maligned piece of cinema. Unlike Alien3, however, Resurrection doesn't descend further into the harrowing nightmare that ended with Ripley's death; it completely shifts the paradigms of the series.You could easily view this film as something apart from the previous three. It doesn't even have Ripley in it, not really- it's a clone (one of eight), and Sigourney Weaver doesn't play her like she's Ripley, either. Undeniably, they look similar these two protagonists, but that is pretty much the only link. Other than the blood-thirsty aliens stalking the corridors of a military space station- which itself finally delivers on the idea of what might happen should 'The Company' (or at least 'a company' since Weyland-Yutani are no more 250 years into the future) get hold of alien DNA and mess about with it. It raises some really interesting ideas about the nature of the creature itself (how, exactly, do you clone a parasite from the host's blood sample? That's a sci-fi concept waiting to be explored), not to mention their more 'human' aspects (problem solving intelligence, for one, an implied sexual interest in their genetic grandmother- Ripley 8) making for some pretty nasty monsters.That's the bad point really though, because ever since James Cameron took a load of machine guns to a colony of xenomorphs in 1986, they've lost the menace the creature had in the 1979 original. They are just teeth and claws to be dispatched, and perhaps it's intentional with regard to these aliens being a little bit human, but they look far too organic (they even seemed to have developed goat legs, which doesn't make such sense, but perhaps it's for artistic flare, and the creatures do look very good, just not as good as they used to).Alien Resurrection really isn't business as usual, but then every film in the series has been different, so why not have a European black comedy thrown in, too? Personally, I love Jeunet's touch; despite his language barriers at the time, he injects great humour into the proceedings, without ridiculing the hallowed science fiction saga, and that is thanks to Joss Wedon's script. He's been incredibly vocal about his disappointment with the project, but Jeunet's visual style lends itself incredibly well to science fiction, creating a grubby, dystopian future an age away from the clean white space station of Aliens and a darn sight more believable. If man as a species takes to the stars, the universe will be filthy, and that is on display here in abundance.There are some fantastic set pieces(although the underwater sequence's CGI has dated in the last 13 years), and a brave attempt at taking the series in a new and frightening direction with the love it/hate it (mostly people seem to hate it) Newborn creature, born directly from the (sadly under-used) Queen's womb inherited from the genetic crossover (so when do we get to see Ripley laying eggs?).Like Alien3 before it, it takes up the reigns from an ending nobody really knows how to develop the series from. Sure, it would have been nice that Hicks and Newt made it. And sure, it might have been nice if Ripley hadn't died- but this series has been taking risks since the beginning. Captain Dallas should have been the hero way back in 1979, but he buys it halfway in. Ridley Scott pulls a Psycho on us, and we love it. Every time anyone else tries anything against the grain in this franchise, it's been met with disdain. The most popular entry into the series (Aliens) is the least subversive, all guns and war and even a happy ending. It's a masterclass in scifi action, sure, but I think Alien Resurrection is probably the bravest film of the four. It sort of writes itself into a hole at the end, but we've been there before with this series. I'd like to know what could happen next.Bizarre, grotesque, frightening and equal parts hilarious, beautiful and bold, Alien Resurrection is a film that has been brutalised by fans and critics alike; even by those who made it. It takes risks, and the result is a subversive and entertaining b-move schlock-fest with European sensibilities and an incredible visual flare (like Fincher, it doesn't matter how much a studio suppresses the choices of Jeunet, his style is too powerful to be completely oppressed).Alien was horror. Aliens was action. Alien3 was foreboding drama. Alien Resurrection is outlandish, kinetic and occasionally insane science fiction. You should give it another chance.

Sigourney Weaver did a decent job, but the movie itself was just too corny to be a valid representation of the Alien Series. Honestly, if you are a true fan of the series, I would advise skipping this one.To be honest, the book that either this movie is based on or is based on the movie (I am not sure which) had a much cooler storyline. I mean Ripley gets into a bare hands fight with an alien and wins. That would have been an awesome element to add to the movie.Winona Ryder is moderately good at acting, but she doesn't really stand out in any good way.And the storyline is very hard to believe, although they did take blood from Ripley in 3, so I guess the alien could be cloned, but I don't recall the Alien embryo altering the host's blood chemistry and DNA in any of the other movies, so all they should have is Ripley's blood.Anyway, it works, and the film does give you a little bang for your buck.

It's wonderful to see 200 years later in Alien 4, all the military guys are hired to run away from computer animation. Not being racist here, but since a French guy directed the movie, I would assume he would put alot of ""artistic stuff"" in the movie, man I was wrong... He and other french actors (he secretly hired) ruined the whole Alien movie for me. However, they did put in a handicapped person on wheelchair, and that was pretty nice for handicapped people.

While there's tons of gore and the non-Computer gen Aliens look realistic enough to raise an eyebrow, the acting, screenplay, cinematography and writing does not accommodate them as a horror or suspense theme. If you aren't really a fan and just want some entertainment, then this movie can be recommended. Its strange that they went for a weirdass and improbable story like this when they had tons of ideas for Alien 3 which they never even implemented? The movie can possibly be much more entertaining than Alien 3 which tries to be a horror but fails a lot at it because they ended up implementing the worst ideas. Even so, Alien 3 has slightly higher production values and suspense. But Alien 4 is just plain old fun to view. Both Alien 3 and Alien 4 cannot be put in the league of the first two parts.

The method behind re-incarnating Ellen Ripley is much more acceptable than other ""resurrections"" in the past.

416,oldbollweevil,Was it everything you'd hoped for?,7,28 July 2001,"**includes spoilers**I disagree with those of my fellow reviewers who say that this filmwas just a gratuitous cash-in with no logical basis in the earlierfilms.  It may indeed have been just a gratuitous cash-in, just like 2& 3 were cash-ins on the first one, and the first one was a cash-inon the post-Star Wars sci-fi boom.  But I found the premise notonly believable, but inevitable in the same way as the first three.That is, if the scientific developments of the last few years (secretcloning projects, creating embryos for the express purpose ofharvesting stem  cells, etc.) have taught us anything, it's that ifscience can do something, it will.  Given the Company's scientists'determination to get a specimen of the alien in the first threemovies, you have to know that if there was any way to reconstituteRipley and get the queen from inside her, they would.  You knowthis would happen.  You know that somewhere, some scientist(some government) would do this, no matter the consequences.
That's what the whole series had been about, so in a sense it wasinevitable that at some point the series would have to show thescientists actually trying to breed the alien.  In a sense, the wholeseries has been building to this.You can see it in Ripley's eyes.  Sigourney Weaver gives astunning performance in this film, showing us not only the effectsof the alien genes she now carries, but an utter disgust anddespair at what humanity has done.  Early on, you can tell thatRipley has just given up on humanity--the coldness she displaystoward the victims of the alien could stem from her alien half, orsimply from this disgust.  Certainly the soldiers and scientistsdeserved what they got.It's this odd mixture of feelings, I think, that makes the scene withRipleys 1-7 so powerful.  Ripley 8, and the viewer, is filled withhorror at the degradations human inquisitiveness is capable ofproducing, and pity for the victims of that inquisitiveness.  Ripleyherself is perhaps the greatest victim.That doesn't make it a perfect movie.  I agree with the reviewer whosaid that it hews closest to the formula of the second movie, whichin this case means lots of action and virtually no characterdevelopment.  Like Aliens, everybody in this movie except Ripleybasically exists either to kill or get killed;  and whereas Aliens atleast had the little girl to inject some real pathos into theproceedings, in this movie there's nobody to care about except forRipley herself.  We're supposed to care about Winona Ryder'scharacter, the robot girl, but somehow the character doesn't quitework.  Ryder just doesn't have the screen presence, the intensity,to make herself felt over the explosions.  (I tend to think she'soverrated as an actress anyway.)I also agree that in showing so much gore, the movie diminishesthe impact of the creatures.  The key to the first one was that youonly saw the aliens for seconds at a time, and you never got areally good view--they were always hiding behind something, or ina dim corner.  That's why they were so scary.  In this movie, yousee absolutely everything, and the result isn't so much scary asjust gross.  The newborn is a cool design--a misshapen human/ alien cross--but we just see too much of it.  The first one was ahorror movie;  this is a splatter movie.So I give this one high marks for concept and for Weaver (andmaybe for the look), and low marks for just about everything else.",Alien - Resurrection

Other then that, i think Winona Ryder's character, the new cyborg was cool, also the bad ass ripley and the crew of pirates.

It had a very tongue-in-cheek vibe throughout, and Sigourney playing a Ripley who may be half-alien was interesting. The film poked fun at itself, and at the way those aliens pick off crews one-by-one. I laughed at the CGI aliens, though. They weren't too good. The other Alien movies were scarier because you saw less of the alien, and in this one, you see it all the time. Ugh.OK, but I still have one beef with this movie: Winona. Who cast Winona? She plays some whiny girl who won't shut up, and when she finally gets killed (I praised the lord for that one...), she came back two seconds later. That was annoying.

Which is a shame, because I pretty much feel a good ""Alien"" sequel writes itself. Admittedly, the creators were written into a corner when Ripley killed herself in part 3. But I felt the device used to bring her back here was clever...she's a clone, duplicated in an effort to pull the gestating queen out of her. At first Sigourney Weaver plays this with just the right amount of innocence and curiosity you would expect from a new born. But about half way through she becomes just another wisecracker, like the space crooks surrounding her. I also didn't understand how I was supposed to get all ga-ga with fear over the fact that there were 12 aliens in the movie...remember, there were HUNDREDS in ""Aliens"".

What David Fincher failed to do in Alien^3, Jeunet succeeded in Resurrection, and bigtime. This is probably the best ripley ever, and the cast is magnificent and has wonderful chemistry on the screen. This is one movie that makes you go ""WOW "" when it ends. I've heard more than enough bad reviews about it. Perhaps it 's just a bunch of ""Aliens"" fans who can't accept that it's just a better movie, and perhaps it's right. But so far, the only thing I can say is :This is one record-breaking movie.",Alien - Resurrection
423,sampath,Unnecessary fourth installment of an all-time great saga,6,16 October 2000,"After Alien3, it seemed the Alien Saga had drawn to a (fairly acceptable)close.  But thanks to a rather ingenious premise, Ripley is back, but for all the anticipation, the film fails to live up to its predecessors.Director Jeunet's surrealistic style worked quite well in Delicatessen, but on this occasion it only serves to betray the spirit of the series.  There are some genuinely eerie moments, but most of the jokes fall flat, and the plot is predictable enough to extinguish any notion of suspense.  And the fact that Ripley is not really 'Ripley' means the audience has no one to root for apart from a cliched bunch of mercenaries about whom one could not care less.It would all be forgivable, however, had it not been for the diabolical casting of Winona Ryder as the Bishop-esque cyborg Call: she may be a good actress, but looks completely at a loss here.Alien: Resurrection is still a must-see, but only because it is part of something far grander than itself.6/10",Alien - Resurrection

425,neogeothecoming,Neither underrated nor overrated,6,20 July 2006,"There can be little doubt that Alien resurrection, as a stand alone movie, can be a highly entertaining experience. There is plenty of action, attitude and gore to keep everyone entertained for a few hours. Unfortunately, after all that concludes, one is going to say that the movie sucked and that would be especially true if one has seen the previous three Alien movies.Only Alien and Aliens ever did justice to the franchise. The rest of the series have directors and writers totally confused. They don't know whether to do action or horror and end up doing either one of them, totally failing to achieve anything on the level of either Alien or Aliens. There is of course one director called Paul Anderson who actually made an Alien(vs Predator) comedy movie as well.The entire premise of AR does not appear to be serious. It plays out as a semi-serious flick especially when compared to Alien-3. Some instances of poor CGI have ruined the fright value of the Alien. But the film does try to increase the same through extensive use of violence and gore. While you may be entertained by AR, at the end, you are going to come out, slightly less frightened or intimidated by the Alien, which makes the scope for sequels were unlikely.",Alien - Resurrection

427,gkuchmek,Whedon's script is juvenile at best!,1,4 March 2021,"It's more fun reading interviews, Wikipedia and other online articles about this film than it is actually watching it. I'm a big Jeunet fan and it's solidly clear to my eyes that you can't solely blame him for this massive stinker.Apparently, he doesn't do English well enough, so he had a translator to parlay his direction to the actors. That's a big problem from the start. Then you have Joss Whedon's script; which I found utterly stupid with awful dialog. There's something in Wikipedia where he's quoted at some fan convention saying that it's everyone's fault but his. He is kinda full of himself, I'd say. Yes, Jeunet's direction through a translator is tough and some of the acting is abysmal (Rider saves the day, but Weaver is awful and Perlman is a cliche here...even though he's great in everything else he does!), but at the end of the day the script is like bad comic book stuff for 12 year olds.Jeunet actually adds some visual stuff that elevates the film quite a bit. If you like Heavy Metal/Metal Hurlant magazines, you'll appreciate the style he brings to this film. The aliens, however, look totally different and barely reference Giger's originals (I don't even recall seeing his name in the credits?).I even saw the director's cut hoping it would do something the theatrical didn't. I'm not about to do a frame by frame comparison, but overall it didn't seem better. My guess is Jeunet was thrown in over his head and the film was never really going to be ""his"" anyway. It all ends up feeling like ""design by committee"" instead of by a visionary director of solid reknown. Such is Hollywood, I guess. Sigh.",Alien - Resurrection

He told me Don't be scared its just a movie, & we watched Blade First, but I got a little bored, so I only saw the first 5 minutes of it & the last 3 minutes of blade.Then At night some of my relatives came over & we saw Alien Resurrection, it scared the living crap out of me,I actually slept with a couple of stuffed animals for months because I just had that Alien Image in my head. Sigourney Weaver was the Hottest chick I ever laid eyes on,I couldn't even think of the name of this film that has been haunting me in all my elementary years, 8 years later I saw Aliens & I LOVED that film,Alien 3 was a bit boring, but still worth watching, Alien Scared me more than Alien Resurrection. It kind of bothers me that people hate this film just because of the hybrid.Alien=Horror Aliens=Action Alien 3=Suspense Alien Resurrection=ThrillerEach of the Aliens have there own unique settings & each of them feature a different Alien,Like on Alien it was 8 foot tall,Aliens Had a Queen,Alien3 had a runner & This movie had a Newborn, I thought the new born was the coolest thing I ever seen.

430,Mr_Triboro,Crippled by Joss Whedon's inability to be talented,5,19 August 2003,"There was no need for 'Alien Resurrection', I'll say that right now. 'Alien3' for all it's execution flaws, had it's heart in the right place. The alien is dead, with Ripley killing herself to prevent is falling into the wrong hands. I thought that was it. Most people thought that was it. Enter 1997. Enter 'Alien Resurrection'.First of all, the problem is this doesn't FEEL like an 'Alien' film. The pace is too rushed, some of the scenes too comicky. I cite the scene where General Perez removes part of his own brain as an example. The visuals are beautiful and it's obvious Jeunet is a very talented director. Unfortunately his style doesn't really suit the film. It's too bright, the colours too flashy. The aliens are obviously CGI, and it is actually disconcerting to realize that they are already looking dated. They have lost all sense of reality with their environment. 'Alien' used a suit, and for the most part it looks more real than it's brothers in 'Resurrection'.But the main problem of 'Alien Resurrection' is the script. Joss Whedon has disowned the film, yet the film bares a great resemblance to what he wrote. We have the cliche characters, the tacky dialogue, the need for a finale monster at the end (I actually didn't mind The Newborn, even if a lot of people did. It was a realistic and unhappy blend of the alien and the human. What Whedon originally wrote, before somebody with common sense told him to make something more realistic, is so utterly laughable it defies belief) and the completely out of place ""humour"" It's ironic a lot of people hated the characters in 'Resurrection' seeing as their ancestors are present in 'Aliens' In fact, it's painfully obvious Whedon is a fanboy. As it is, 'Alien Resurrection' is the perfect reason why fans of 'Aliens' should not be allowed to write an 'Alien' film. Joss Whedon is, without a doubt, a complete hack. If you've ever seen 'Angel' you'll know the digs at 'Resurrection' are about as subtle as a sledge hammer.Another problem with 'Alien Resurrection' (and hey, it's rooted in the script. How about that?) is it's complete lack of pace. There is zero tension or suspense after the aliens have broken loose. Word to the wise, Whedon, you can't have characters strolling down an empty ship one minute and expect your audience to be scared at a loud noise when you've built nothing behind it. The aliens aren't scary. They're interesting to watch, but they've really become more of a technical excersise. There is nothing in the way of the ultimate threat present in 'Alien' The aliens are really more of a nuisance. They pop in, they die. All of the other films established the terror of the aliens. If you encountered one, you would die. Not here. Now you make half witty wise cracks. Like all films caked in ""the 90s"" factor.I probably shouldn't blame the faults of this film ALL on Whedon, but the childish way he's attacked the film after it's release really annoy me. That, and the fact is most of the film IS his fault. I hope you email me, Whedon. Maybe then I'll get an apology. Five out of ten.",Alien - Resurrection

The first two thirds of the movie are actually quite good. A bit slow-paced, but nevertheless worthy of the Alien concept. Of course, I had hoped for a plot that would have let us see more of the Alien universe; the planets, the military, etc...Anyway, on to the ending, which I HATE. There is no other word for it. I hate the ending, because it violates the one thing that makes the Aliens movies so good - the Aliens themselves!!!The disgusting offspring of the Queen looks like a giant malformed human baby - and yet is more powerful than the queen herself! The Aliens, as you will recall from the first movie, were touted as ""perfect organisms"", something the ugly baby critter is most definitely NOT.

The Resurrection visual and sound design is nonetheless flawless. Acting is genuinely brilliant and cut timing is superb. Besides, this is about a wondering soul who knows there's no trade with the evil, and the struggle between this view and the desire to get a profit over anything.

435,tbiegalski-1,Riveting,9,17 June 2008,"While this movie is not entirely perfect, I felt the need to give it a 9 due to its overall rating of only 6.1.Too many people compare this Alien to the Aliens of past films. This is ridiculous, because every sequel has been almost categorically different from its predecessor. While the original movie was a groundbreaking landmark of horror-science fiction, the second movie, Aliens, was much more of an action flick than a horror movie. And the third movie, while attempting to be something of a return to the claustrophobic, narrow corridor brand suspense and horror of the first, was nonetheless a far different movie with a far different alien.This movie is a masterpiece. It exudes style, much in the same vein of The Matrix, but with a definite monster movie twist. This exuberance of style does threaten, at times, to overwhelm its viewers, but it is peppered with enough gut-wrenching violence that one's attention stays just under the threshold.This movie does demand, much more than its predecessors, that the viewer 'suspends disbelief.' The gore of this movie seems to be its only realism. Realism is sacrificed in the name of style, but to wonderful effect. Anyone who would expect any less must not be at all familiar with Jeunet, the movie's director (see ""City of Lost Children"").What this movie lacks in realism, it more than makes up for in style. Furthermore, while fans may have been disappointed by a lack of realism, I do not know how they could expect a character who was burnt to a crisp in the previous sequel to return within a realist paradigm. Even if it is science-fiction, one need only note that truly dead characters more often return to life in the likes of Friday the 13th and Halloween than 2001.And the ending sequence of the film is beyond harrowing. One of the greatest all-time monster movie endings I have ever seen. However it is definitely not for those with a weak stomach.",Alien - Resurrection

I really enjoyed what they did with the visuals and the story, turning it into a comic book sci-fi freak show. Unfortunately, Ripley's character takes a peculiar turn. Sigourney Weaver gave great performances in the previous installments, but I never fully understood what they were going for with her character this time around.

442,nick L,"A flawed, fascinating and distinctly Freudian monster movie.",10,24 November 1999,"I have to admit that this really is not the film that I had anticipated for so many months leading up to the release. Viewing some snapshots on the web page, I could almost feel that Gallic style that had oozed out of Jeunet's City of the Lost Children in this, the fourth of the Alien franchise. Yet, Alien Resurrection manages to be the most unremarkable of a series of films that has virtually defined the modern sci-fi action film. And while it may not be as frustratingly hamstrung as Alien3 was (which I actually thought was far better than people gave it credit for), Alien 4 has little of the action, suspense, tragedy, plot and unique style that the three previous films gave us. Perhaps that's just a bit too harsh, but for a film with such high production values and from such a diverse series of films, I don't think it's fair for the audience to have to put up with such an anti-climax (although scribe Joss Whedon, has said that this film is merely a prologue to the planned fifth film, which he will now script).For those of you that opted not to see Alien3, at the end Ripley chose to sacrifice herself so that the alien inside her would never be born. 200 years on, however, scientists on the USS Auriga have been attempting to clone Ripley so that they can get at the Alien Queen she was carrying when she died. Ripley's gene pool has been mixed with that of the Alien's, meaning that she is now a sadistic schizophrenic with superhuman strength and acid for blood. However, the scientists keeping Ripley overestimate the power of a glass box and (Surprise, Surprise) the aliens break out, causing the inevitable mayhem and frantic running around corridors. The band of likeable but morally cloudy alien fodder (re - the nostromo crew of Alien, the marines in Aliens, and the er... murderers and rapists of Alien3) are this time provided by the crew of the Buffy, sorry I mean Betty, the pirate ship which delivered the bodies needed to incubate the alien embryos. Jeunet regulars Perlman and Pinon make up part of the crew, while Winona Ryder is call, the ships engineer. A slight problem occurs when the survivors realise that the ship is heading straight for earth, finally allowing the Aliens the buffet meal they surely deserve for turning up in space uninvited so many times. Along the way, the Betty crew must weed out the traitor in their group and a confused Ripley must decide where her destiny lies.Writer Joss Whedon really has tried to make as good an action movie as he possibly can (and he can make good ones ... Speed). That's fine for a Die Hard movie , but it sure as hell is not what is wanted in an alien movie. Jeunets freaky French style is similarly unsuitable, due to being overly stylistic (which, again can work well in the right movies as his previous features have shown us) and never gels properly with Whedons script. However, the most excruciating aspect if the entire film has to be the way that so many elements are interchangeable with previous Alien films, notably Aliens. For example, the crew of the Betty, with their sexism and gung-ho attitude are bad copies of the marines in Aliens, with Perlman's Johner particularly similar to Bill Paxton's Hudson. Also, Ryders sole purpose in the movie seems to be to act as Weavers foil and someone who can outfox the males of the movie, in true newt style. But while Newt was endearing, touching and yet remarkably unnauseating, Ryder seems lost and dizzy for the entire movie.But it's not all bad news. Weaver gives possibly her most varied and difficult interpretation of Ripley yet, proving that she is one of the worlds most underrated actresses and making Ripley by far the most complex character ever to have appeared in a series of sci-fi films. And if this is the prologue to a more eventful fifth film, this could work better in context (a La Alien3). There are also some gruesome and highly inventive death scenes and the design and FX of the film are stunning . The highlight of the film has to be the truly suspenseful and original underwater chase, closely followed by a dark and tragic scene in which Ripley discovers the not so successful Ripley clones, with one agonisingly alive. The scene allows Weaver to shine fully and I was stunned after seeing that scene for the first time. Overall, the film is a very mixed bag indeed, with some good ideas, underutilised ideas, brilliant ideas and just plain stupid ideas.",Alien - Resurrection
443,caerdwyn,"See it, but don't expect much",6,19 June 2008,"Easily my least favorite of the Alien films, mainly due to the lack of identity. As another commenter posted, Alien = Suspense, Aliens = Action, Alien3 = Drama; Alien 4 has little going for it beyond gore and an almost shameless retread of the previous films. A retread, with little done right. Whedon's fingerprints are all over this one and although his sarcasm-laden dialogue works for some of the mercenaries, it does not quite jive with the Ripley character (despite her being somewhat more ""ruthless"" thanks to her combined DNA). Nothing will beat the rapport the marines had with one another in Aliens. The one area where this film succeeds is the display of the Company's tinkering with the Alien embryos and DNA, presenting a truly frightening gallery of failed experiments. This was something only hinted at in the previous movies and it was satisfying to finally see the twisted fruit of Weyland Yutani's tree.",Alien - Resurrection

It completely brought back to life a saga that was buried by another brilliant and not understood movie: alien 3. But the critics didn't let it. The issues of humanity, new way of facing the alien, new Ripley, dark environments, interesting characters and excellent direction make this film a near masterpiece of sci-fi, horror and action. The fresh direction from a french director that also brought us ""The City of Lost Children"" gives us a completely different movie that deviates from the normal pace of the alien movies. The only problem I can see in this movie is that the change is so big that the movie spends its entire time acomodating people to the changes, and doesn't face completely its issues, but that for me isn't a problem: on the contrary of what critics are saying, this opens the door for a grandeous Alien 5 in the future that could truly end the saga as it deserves.

Every critic and person who hated this movie disliked it because they thought the movies in the series should have been the same. Don't look at it that way. This film is a continuation, and none of the other films are the same anyway. The plot involves a military ship that clones Ripley from blood samples, but in doing so she becomes part alien. Then, when a rag-tag crew brings a mysterious cargo aboard, it appears there is a darker agenda for the military and scientists. The film is disturbing, eerie, and atmospheric. The cast has good chemistry and they play interesting characters. Great action sequences follow one after the other, and I love the frightening, yet sad and lonely ending.

447,fliper78617,Not as good as the first two but better than Alien 3,8,9 June 2003,"To sum this up Alien: Resurrection is great example of combining action and some suspense and make it entertaining as best as possible. While it doesn't have the scariness of the first two or the best acting, It's not as melodramatic as Alien 3. The story revolves around 200 years later after Ellen Ripley's death on Fury 161 where scientists have genetically cloned her since she had an Alien queen founded by the Company. While after the Queen Alien has been removed from the cloned Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), she is been kept alive for stasis etc. Then a cargo shop which has a load of humans that are to be used for hosts. A curious female later to be known as the android Call (Winona Ryder) finds the cloned Ripley and sooner or later all of the people are in trouble because, now the Alien Experiments have minds of there own and now are attempting to create a colony of there own. This movie was a pretty good one to watch I enjoyed the movie even if there were flaws. The one major one was Call, Winona Ryder is a good actress but I felt her lines were dry and she could have done better, and some characters that I felt that should have stayed in the movie more like the character Elgyn, and Brad Dourif. Another flaw was the Alien human hybrid creature it was just too sick and depressing for that kind of thing. Now off to the good stuff Sigourney Weaver potrays the Ripley clone in a different way but It's not bad I especially liked the scene where she founds out about the other Clone experiments failed. Ron Perlman gives a great performance as the muscle bound Johner who likes to make a joke at just about anything. Dominque Pinon was an Interesting character as Vriess, Kim Flowers was ok but had no character development but I did like Brad Dourif's humor relief (Especially making those faces at the Aliens) and J.E. Freeman was ok. The writing by Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer series) is a decent job but could have used some elements that could have given a more familiar Alien look to it but wasn't bad for his first try. The directing was stylish by French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet who's proberly directed a few classy french films before this one. The Visual Effects were good if not bad few were sorta fake but not bad. Overall I think this was a close to excellent movie that was underated and should have gotten more profit at the Box Office and to me Alien Resurrection was a near return to the Alien saga.Regular Scale-4/5: 1-10 Scale-8/10",Alien - Resurrection
448,jarnov,The Alien series comes full circle.,9,25 June 2010,"I won't write a start-to-finish review, as there are already plenty on here. What I *will* write, is about the experience this fan of the franchise had watching this movie for the second time in many years (shortly after the first three).For me, this is just the perfect little ending to the Alien quadrilogy. Aside from being a perfectly badass sci-fi action movie on its own, with a ridiculous amount of referenced subplots like the relationships between the pirate crew members and their individual stories, the crazed scientist who is ultimately killed by the absolute peak of his life's work and the timid general forced by his corrupt superiors to deal with criminals, it takes every classic theme from the series and does something cool with it.First, obviously, the aliens. Ripley, who died trying to exterminate them, is mercilessly resurrected, once again pregnant with a queen. The cloning process that in a way ""revived"" her, however, has fundamentally fused her physiology with that of the aliens. She has become that which has dominated her life for as long as she can remember. Ultimately, we learn that this has happened to her ""child"" as well, enabling it to give birth to a perfect cross between Ripley and the queen. In a truly moving homage to the end of the first Alien movie, Ripley ends the quadrilogy by once again blasting the final surviving alien into space, except this time the action is infinitely more profound, the alien being a confused child and Ripley being one of the mothers. Out of the blue, I literally wailed during that final moment. Never before have I seen the main antagonist in a series become so intertwined with the object of her struggle, literally *becoming* it, actually having given birth to it and personally destroying it. Weaver plays the role no less than perfectly.The synthetic. We went from the malevolent, corporate, heel android working against Ripley in the first film to the empathic ""good guy"" android saving Ripley twice in the next two films to the oddly completely and utterly logical successor to these, a ""second generation"" (ie produced *by* androids) synthetic human initially intending to kill Ripley (in a really neat reversal of the Ripley/android story from Alien) but ultimately working with her and saving her life (by noticing her on Betty's monitor). Call is a tormented synthetic, much more so than Bishop, and Jeunet pays a great deal of attention to this all through the film, from Joner's incessant stigmatizing comments to Call's reluctance to go to the ""dark place"" that is the cyberspace part of her belongs to.Finally, of course, the company. While Weyland-Yutani apparently doesn't exist anymore by the time this story takes place, everything the army and their scientists do is perfectly in line with the spirit of this evil corporation. More than in any previous film, human dignity is spat on completely, from the dozens of failed Ripley clones (including the one featured in one of the most haunting visuals of the film, the killing of which, incidentally, is also a neat precursor to Ripley's ultimate act of destruction) to the kidnapped ""hosts"" consciously being impregnated. In the most perfect ending I can imagine for ""the company"" (at least for the purposes of this quadrilogy-closer; I am excluding the AvP films from the story arc), the last host first beats Wren, the only surviving ""company man"" half to death in a fit of blind, superhuman rage, then holds him in front of his chest, just in time for the baby alien to burst through his brain (before the baby and its host are blasted to pieces).How people defecate on this so vehemently, I fail to see. Continuity errors? Every movie has some. Unexplainable plot elements? It is sci-fi. You've already accepted that a spider crab can make love to someone's face, have a small creature grow in their chest, burst out of it and within hours transform into a huge slimy predator. I would think a clone with memories isn't such a gigantic leap.",Alien - Resurrection

Alien 3 was worst of all and I expected even worse with this one but it's better and along with my fav I would keep Aliens in #1 position alien in #2 and #3 this part if it's not a cameron movie then don't expect it to be a masterpiece like the one cameron made,Alien - Resurrection

The Aliens are no longer horrifying, as they are brought right into the limelight, just where they don't belong. We see far too much of them.

I even enjoyed the second one and loved the mystical back-to-the-roots third one but the latest sequel is below my lowest expectations. It's one of the greatest dissapointments of all time and the worst movie of 1997. The plot is awful (2000 years of science and no-one cares with the acid-blood?!), everyone becomes tired when Winona Ryder starts to cry (while she just wanted to speak), the effects are just satisfactory and the new mutant-alien... argh!

Personally, i was disappointed with the Alien III.  However, I found Resurrection very entertaining and visually pleasing.

They then set a about creating a perfect clone of Ripley which for some reason, (didn't the alien pop out before she died?)contains an Alien. All a crew of modern day pirates deliever unsuspecting victims to be infected with Alien face huggers. Off course a long the way hell breaks loose the aliens free.But it's struggles with the one dimensional characters provided by scribe Josh Whedon that may be good enough Buffy but not for an Alien movie. The film may also have done better without the presence of Ripey or do I mean 8, who the whole film seems to be about. A lack of originality, basically this is Alien meets Aliens in a new location and some really strange and arty direction by Jeunet, there are a lot better established in this genre directors e.g. Renny Harlin. But the good, the new born Alien though his conception and birth may seem strange, did offer something original and new. The sets are impecable giving a gothic outlook to the film and then there is the cinematography which looks impressive.I really do hate Johner, who comes out with lines off, ""I don't get it, it must be a chick thing."" and ""I'm not a mechanic, I mostly just hurt people."" and for some reason calls Virese 'Ironside' who people now don't understand so I doubt they will in the far far off future.Will we witness the true Alien Ressurection, it all depends on Alien5.",Alien - Resurrection

This movie has such stupid ideas that i think that it is a very entertaining vieweing, espicially if you have your funny joke cracking friends with you watching it. Here are the pros for this movie:
It picks a decent pace to the story, and it was mastered excellently for the specific parts of the story.The action parts of this movie is thrilling, most specifically the underwater scene.Entertaining gore and some very good deaths.Some terrifing ways of portraying the power of the Aliens.And here are the Cons for the movie:

Well, 'Alien: resurrection' is indeed a terrible accident, what else to say? It's just a commercial move and Aliens saga fans must face it.This was predictable though, Alien3 was maybe weak and lame but got kinda syntony with the first two. J.P. Jeunet (or maybe J. Whedon) had the stimulant possibility of make those limy monsters finally land on earth but he probably thought it was too exacting and preferred the overworked story of infested ship... Anyway, he tried to invent something new in order to continue the tradition of renewal of the first 3 movies, Alien was a horror sci-fi, Aliens was an action sci-fi, Alien3 was a thriller sci-fi and now we have this comic-strip sci-fi that definitely cuts a bad figure compared to his predecessors... well, now i wonder what a 5th chapter could be and, unwillingly, i hope it won't be if these are the results...",Alien - Resurrection

Of course like everyone else I was not happy with the ending and the whole""baby alien"" thing was a joke. The creature design was poor and unsophisticated for the series. That being the only major flaw of the movie this piece got more respect from me than the third piece did. After several years I find myself watching all four installments all over again and yes, Aliens3 has gotten better with age. As will resurrection. It leaves the series open for another installment, even though it should have ended with 3. The 5th piece would more than likely be an alien invasion of earth, but first Wynonna needs to get out of jail before filming could start and her trailer would have to be routinely checked to make sure none of the props or costumes were taken.

Alien 4 really gets it's B rating in my book. I know it's a sucky film and terrible and yada yada, but I must admit I still purchased it...well, just to laugh and make fun of it. I love watching Horrible Films, they are just rad.But... I'd recommend to any smart person NOT to purchase or rent this movie.

Then everything goes, yet again, horribly wrong.This movie is argued about either being better or worse than ALIEN ³. I gave it the same rating as ALIEN ³. This movie was directed by french filmmaker Jean-Pierre Jeunet which gave this movie a different style. The sets are fine. There are some good action scenes. The characters are somewhat simple (exept for Ripley). The alien themselves are CGI and look okay but not great. There are the most gory scenes in this movie than in any of the other ALIEN movies.

Why? The main star of the show was ignored (the aliens) and instead crappy humour and visuals destroyed a good storyline. Another thing this franchise does not require Ripley to survive! The newborn was a good idea but looked really stupid. The idea that it thought Ripley was its mum was good and that when she killed you generally felt for the beast, but it looked crap, it had a pot belly for Christ's sake!. There were some good character development, and some characters to rival that of aliens, but other than that it wasn't that good. The story was the best thing. Another thing... Being a massive fan of the alien franchise mad me notice a few things about the creatures: 1. I suppose I don't mind them being brown in colour because if they were genetically bred from the alien on fury 161 and that alien was brown it figures really. 2. Why did the aliens roar? And why did it sound so lame? 3. Why did they spit acid? That was also very lame Now that I think about it this film isn't bad I suppose overall, 6 out of 10",Alien - Resurrection

Beating the likes of ""Bean"", ""The Avengers"" and ""Batman and Robin"".  The problem lies in the fact that it is totally the opposite of the original. Alien had suspense, I was actually scared out of my seat.  Why? because there was only one alien and I had no idea of its location.  However, Alien Resurrection has more aliens than would fill a galaxy. Horror films should follow one guideline.

470,gulhizyuksek,The End was the best part,1,20 April 2011,"In my opinion this movie was just released to make Fox some easy money. The trilogy was over but they had to ""resurrect"" it. Although the director has several other great movies I believe he was the wrong candidate to helm an Alien film. Jean-Pierre Jeunet injects the film with his signature French humor, which is great but does not work for me in an Alien movie. I want to take my Alien movies seriously, I want to feel scared, care for the characters but this movie jokes around with everything, never gets you scared (just disgusted), and I couldn't care less for any of the cardboard characters. I would say they could have cut down on the characters but believe that David Fincher pulled off the suspense with the huge cast from the previous film so I will just label the new bunch as incompetent.The best part in this movie is the final creature. I would always prefer Fox stuck with H.R. Giger, the artist who created the iconic alien in the first place, but think they did a good job by creating a memorable new addition with the ""newborn."" The animatronics, the facial expressions, characteristics, movements and sounds for this final creature are lifelike and believable. I only wished we'd seen more of it like having it stalk/hunt the crew throughout the movie for extra suspense.I saw this in the cinema when it came out with my die-hard Alien fan friend and we both couldn't eat dinner after-wards; now I stumbled upon the DVD in 2011 and watched it again but couldn't help fast forwarding and all I can appreciate is the end as described above.

Sigourney Weaver delivers a good performance but the rest of the cast fails somehow. Winona Rider... well, let's just say I don't really like her :).

Not in the least. What I got was unlikable characters, unused potential and almost no ****ing Aliens for the past 90 minutes. I decided to use the site features to my advantage and took a look to see who wrote this God awful story and to see that it was written by a Joss Whedon. ...wait didn't he make that popular series with vampires in it? ... I'm probably think of someone else. Now the directing by Pierre was good as always, acting was good as well. He did great, it's just the story that falls to bloody acid pieces. Aliens 3 was just passable in some story aspects making a good conclusion to a movie series with Ripley killing herself along with the Alien inside her in a pit of lava...however it seems that she was to likable of a character to die, so they brought her back through some weird excuse such as ""cloning"" her. How original. But wait, Ripley's also an Alien/Human Hybrid now...yay? Well, it's kinda pointless since see never seems to use her abilities that often, only seeming to use her acid like blood twice and not much else...waste of potential. I was wanting her to have a fist fight with an Alien the whole damn movie considering she doesn't even carry a weapon the whole bloody movie.Then we get introduced to some ""space pirates"" with of course half of them being unlikable so that we won't care as much once they die. Then the Aliens escape from their cells and all hell breaks loose. Now I know there should be only around 50 Aliens or so but really we don't see many Alien encounters in the movie. Then they had to leave the ship and destroy it since the ships on it's way to Earth...for some unexplained reason...Just as the story was coming to an end I was thinking to myself, ""Well, it wasn't that bad-"". That was until ""Newborn"" showed up. The apparent 'son' of Ripley. Now the design for this character is absolutely stupid. Especially since it somehow gets into the ship before Ripley with it's stubby legs. The ending just makes me want to hit Joss on the head with news paper for trying to make us feel bad for a creature that's barely gotten 20 minutes of screen time, when it gets killed from a hole in the ship and sucked into space.

476,objxs,"The Last One, I Hope.",2,22 March 2003,"I picked up this film after learning that it was made by one of my favorite directors, Jean-Pierre Jeunet (City of Lost Children, Amélie). It was my hope that this installment would be better than Alien3 which, at least on that count, it succeeds, even though that's a low mountain to climb.The plot for this film is a predictable rehash of the last three films. You have your evil massive organization who keeps forgetting that the aliens are really bad. You have an android subplot (this time played by Winona Ryder) which adds nothing but continuity to the rest of the movies. You even have your ubiquitous ""Kill me"" scene where Ripley must kill someone with a flamethrower to save them from too much pain.However, without sounding too critical there are some good points to this film. The cast is perfect for an Alien film pairing up big names (Weaver and Ryder) with an excellent set of character actors like Dominique Pinion (The Return of Martin Guerre and Amélie), Brad Dourif (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and The Two Towers) and the ever odd Ron Perlman (Enemy at the Gates). This cast gives a valiant effort to bring something out of a script that seems to have been written by some 13 year old boys. Even so, the dialog is so silly it's hard not to wince.However, the one thing that really saves this movie from the truly awful category is the cinematography and feel of the film. Jeunet, known for his dark films, has really kept the feel of the first two films. The underwater Alien sequence is nothing short of genius. Even the alien/Ripley love child (no, I'm not kidding) follows with the dark and brooding spirit of the original films.The best I can say about this film is it redeems the series from the catastrophe of Alien3. However, this movie is repetitive, silly and without depth.

They had around 5-6 different scripts for Alien 3, yet with this one they just take the 1st piece of crap someone writes for them. This is the guy who writes the Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series! You've got to be freaking' kidding me!So basically, they took what was a legendary series, even with the flaws of Alien 3, and turned it into a generic comic book story complete with a half alien Ripley and a retarded looking alien/human hybrid birth scene. I guess since the movie doesn't take itself seriously, neither should we. Either way, it still sucks!What made Alien so great was the realism in which it was portrayed. You could almost imagine a future like that and even the alien wasn't beyond reason. It was a parasite with a life cycle and(once Cameron came along) operated like a ant colony. It was pure genius. Now it's just a cash cow for the douche bag producers who screwed it up beginning with Alien 3.",Alien - Resurrection
481,REPRO,Amazing,9,28 December 1998,"I think J.P. Jeunet is the best director in history of filmmaking. I realized that when the grenade was thrown in this movie (if you thought it was good you know what I´m talking about), I´m really amazed that he was able to add his style to a movie so different from his earlier work. I can admit that the plot in this movie was not as strong as in the other three and Winona Ryder didn´t really act very well, which can also be said about Sigourney Weaver, I´m sad to say considering the brilliant acting in the other three, but the overall acting was really good, with the performance of Dominique Pinon and Ron Perlman. Dispite of all the bad elements in this movie the good ones made it up and this is without a doubt the best Alien movie.",Alien - Resurrection
482,KayCee-8,A lovely joke on Hollywood - viva Jeunet!,10,5 April 2000,"Every time I perceive this marvelously disgusting, erotic, hilarious, and pretty film I enjoy it more than before.  Yet its undeniably different character from the first three films in the series begs addressing.  After my ninth screening, I propose that _Alien Resurrection_ is actually Situationist-influenced cinema.The essence of the 1950s-60s French-based Situationist movement is ""constructing situations"" , a constructed situation defined as:""A moment of life, concretely and deliberately constructed by the collective organization of unitary environment and the free play of events."" --From the journal /Internationale Situationniste/ #1, June 1958
Of course that might describe every film ever made; the distinguishing factor methinks lies in both the character of the individual scenes, and their attitude toward the narrative.  The idea of ""constructing situations"" includes the notion of free play of events in a carefully arranged environment.  As far as I can tell, the purpose is to break out of the Spectacular trance by appreciating life in an immediate, sensual way confounding to the intent of cultural or ideological scripts.  An example of Situationist-influenced daily life would be anarchists rearranging billboard messages to expose the advertiser's evil intent,  going out for a walk and intentionally getting lost, etc. In _Alien Resurrection_ , the scenes were the thing.  The scenes often seemed directionless, haphazard, the acting even a bit fake, as if a troupe of really good improvisation actors had been given a particular situation, setting, music, costumes, and roles, and were told to work out what would happen, stretching it out to fill a particular time.  The cinematography lends a glow to the surroundings, like an aura of meaningfulness, that prettifies everything.  The score undulates unpredictably, imbuing piecemeal *deja vu.   In other words, it's as if they have, in a Situationist sense, constructed various situations out of which beauty unfolds, and the actors themselves experience this necessarily.  Indeed, from the various actors' commentaries, describing, for instance, the vaunted underwater scene, or the thrill of working with famous actors in a celebrated film series, it seems as though it was as much if not more fun and interesting to actually act in it as it is to perceive it on the screen.  The final product proceeded without flowing, scenes appeared interchangeable, the plot primarily an excuse for generating a series of well-done Situations.  In doing so, it's natural the work dismantles the ""ideology"" as it were of the first three films, and rearranges the elements to its own liking, for its own ends, in the service of situations.In this light, the disjointedness of the film becomes a focussing device, a hint of where not to look.  The joys of the film, as both apologists and reluctantly won over fans in varying degrees realise, flow from appreciating the various impressive situations, not from an elaborately engaging plot. Contrast with the intense, simple plot of A1, the well-rounded helping of plot and character in A2, and the muddling of both qualities for the sake of a well-stirred mood in A3.  Perhaps this degrades A4, or perhaps not.  If my proposition is correct, this not only paints the Alien Saga in a more subversive colour than hitherto appreciated, but also plays one of the largest jokes in cinematic history on the film studio that made it.  If _Alien3_ was a fifty-five million dollar art film, _Alien Resurrection_ must be nothing less than an eighty million dollar Situationist film. (!)  As such, of course, the title gains another significance...that of ""resurrecting"" Situationist ideas into the popular imagination, nested within the heart of the spectacle itself.  If it's true that, in keeping with rumour, Jean-Pierre Jeunet will never make another Hollywood film, it's certainly no wonder why not!",Alien - Resurrection

485,kghastie,A sad attempt at continuing a once great series,2,21 January 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Terrible.  It is basically a facsimile of the original, with only a few, mostly irritating tweaks.What's been added:A lot more cheesy, gratuitous ""neato"" action-movie shots, like a backwards sliding shot of a grenade rolling on the ground and a standard underwater chase scene.  By the time you see this movie, these techniques and technology will be old news, and are out of place in an Alien movie.Plenty of cheesy lines, none with any actual humor built in, like the ""Vasquez, ever been mistaken for a man?"" ""No, have you?"" exchange from the original.  And plenty of horror movie overacting, including repeated comical bug-eyes courtesy of Dan Hedaya as Perez.A pitifully out of place Winona Ryder, playing her usual Gen-X self (a la How to Make an American Quilt, Little Women, etc..).  Are you trying to tell me that this little waif got a job on a freakin pirate ship?  As a PIRATE? Her character, ""Mousy McSoftheart"" is a ridiculous star-power addition to the script, and Ryder fails miserably at breathing any life into it - it's as if she knows how out of place she is and doesn't even try.What's missing:Terror.  The settings of the original two films were absolutely terrifying.  The second film adds magnitude to the first film's visionary environment while maintaining that awful claustrophobic feel, and even Alien 3 is set in an unique and interesting place.  Resurrection has neither the feel of ""Oh my God, what's breathing down my neck - I can't get away from it!"" nor ""Oh my God, look at all of those... THINGS!"" nor even the unique perks gained from being set in a space-prison.Terror.  Where is that indestructible Alien (capitalized) that you JUST CAN'T STOP from the first 3 movies?  In this flick, as far as I can remember, every time someone fires a gun at one of the aliens (not capitalized), it goes down.  And the full shot of the queen they give you is not nearly as horrifying as the partial glimpses of the Alien you get in the earlier films.Terror.  I was not afraid for the lives of any of these character-less ""characters"" lives.  Even, dare I say it, Ripley.  *** POTENTIAL SPOILER *** While Sigourney Weaver's performance (especially her physicalizations) as an alien half-breed is interesting, (although unstable and off-balance - what's with all the smiles?  did becoming a half-alien make Ripley nicer?), her creepy motherly attitude leads you to distrust her.  And if she is capable of reproducing aliens, shouldn't she be destroyed anyway?  The only other character that I enjoyed watching was the pirate captain, and he's the first or second one to be killed off! *** END OF SPOILER *** And there is the addition of a mad scientist character who I assume is supposed to be creepy. Give me the icy menace of Bishop (from the first Alien) any time!Basically, if you haven't seen the first two movies, SEE THEM - they are excellent.  Don't waste your time on this one, or at least don't ruin the menace of the first two by starting here.  If you have seen the first two and loved them, don't watch this one because it will just make you sad. The only thing you will find astonishing about this sequel is how many things are simply repeated from the first two.  Here's a list so you don't have to waste your time watching the movie:*** POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD *** The military wants an alien specimen for their own evil purposes. Something goes wrong, an alien escapes from its cage, and now it wants to kill everyone. A cargo crew that wants nothing to do with the situation is left to deal with the mess; their captain dies; Ripley has to take over. Someone gives birth to an alien through their stomach. Someone turns out to be a robot. Someone gets burned with alien acid-blood. Someone gets an alien stuck to their face. Someone sacrifices their life for their buddy. The good guys climb down a maintenance shaft and get picked off one by one as they scamble to reach the escape pod and self-destruct the ship to rid the world of the alien menace once and for all and oh my gosh they make it! But wait!  One last alien makes it onto the escape craft with them. And here is the best part: Ripley saves the day by, what?  Why of course!  By hanging on to something in the cargo bay and sucking the alien out of the airlock!  I swear to God.Watch it only if you just can't get enough of the Alien saga.",Alien - Resurrection

Sure, they have all been a little worse then the one before, starting With the excelent Alien, followed by the almost excelent aliens and then the okay movie Alien3. But this, is a total letdown. In my opinion there is no reason to see this one. Actually, if you've seen the others, it's even more reason to skip this one as it takes some of the ""glow"" from the others by bringing down the franchise.It's not so strange though... The best movies seldom benefit from a followup. (There are exceptions though)So, don't see this movie unless you feel you have to. You are likely to be very, very disapointed.",Alien - Resurrection

Either in Brno here PM polcse (similar to Derek Riggs cover for Iron Maiden XFactro) or in Prague at a concert in 2000 PJ Jeremy. So I do not really know what to think about it. I do not like the face of the last monster, it is really unsympathetic discharacter. I am sure it is some kind of enemy that is hard to destroy and get rid of...

ALIEN3 was a perfect way to end the series but FOX just had to make another. I wasn't scarred once by this movie and that is what really killed it for me, there are even scenes in ALIENS that made me scarred but this one was just horrid. The Queen alien was not justified like in ALIENS. They added a gross ""new born"" alien which was unique yet wasn't a great idea. The fact that they brought Ripley back was a horrible idea. They killed her but they JUST HAD to bring her back. Lets see a raise of hands for how many think that was for the money...okay. Although the visual effects were astounding, everything else sucked. What really killed my enjoyment was the fact that the aliens were brought out into the light for the majority of the scenes that they were in.

I think most of the other reviewers are being movie snobs and perhaps were hoping this movie was more like the original. Now don't get me wrong, i enjoyed the original Alien, but I think some people are giving that movie too much credit. Sure it was an amazing and quite original movie, but that was in 1979. People were more dazzled by anticipation and suspense. Watching it now, there are some parts that I think are a little, dry, long, and boring. People complain about Resurrection's lack of character development compared to the original but I don't really see the characters in the original having noticeably wondrous depth as people seem to imply. I think both movies show people having as much complexity as reasonable and necessary in their circumstances. I really enjoyed Ripley in this film as she was bizarre, quirky and kick ass. Other than that I'll say that this movie is the most fun of the series. It's full of action, humor, a bit of horror,many interesting elements some suspense, and a lot bad-assedness. Also i recommend watching the special edition as it has some extra scenes that add more explanation and ""depth"" to the film.",Alien - Resurrection
490,thatwasrudeofme,A misjudged movie!,10,26 February 2005,"I felt this movie was wholly underrated. Its whole premise was an entirely original idea, set apart from the other movies in the series. It developed Sigourney's character, the main man ""Ripley"", superbly! In was done in such a way as to make the whole concept of resurrection (which if we're honest is a bit barmy) quite plausible. And indeed successfully illustrated,much due to the talent of saucy Weaver, how a person,even one who has been around the block as many times as the lovable lieutenant, would deal with such a traumatic and downright baffling experience. The anger,confusion,frustrating,and so and so forth. Not only this but the introduction of several original and exciting ideas were sprinkled throughout the entire movie,the new born,the resurrection itself, etc etc. And still despite all this it managed to provide a hilarious, laugh so much 'till a little bit of wee comes out,script. Topped with just the right amount of action, plenty of guns, big slobbery aliens and the like. And all this set behind a visually stunning set, eerie, strange yet oh so alluring.

What that means is while this movie may be really weird and off the rails and bloated at times, it has a certain charm and awesomeness to it that Alien 3 doesn't have. While I actually don't hate Alien 3, it is easily the worst of the main 6 Alien movies (Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, Alien: Resurrection, Prometheus, and Alien: Covenant).

497,CDallas,"Although most would view it as an attempt to revive what is called an already dead series, it is actually a great movie with true intrigue and innovation.",10,15 March 1999,"First off, let me say that I LOVE the Alien series, so please acknowledge that.  Here's what I think:  The first two Alien films were outstanding. The first is the scariest movie of all time, and the second is the best action film of all time.  I think the third was okay, because it did achieve the dark and creepy feel it was going for, but was also a bit of a disappointment.  What I think everyone didn't acknowledge about the film was the fact that it did a damn good job of resurrecting the aliens.  Think about it.  How else can you make a story that takes place after the third one and still star Sigourney Weaver?  Don't say to say the third one was a dream, because then that would be corny and immature.  I thought that the story was very good.  The characters, although slightly wooden, were very well drawn.  Several people say that the old Ripley was gone, but by the end of the film, she was acting just like the good ol' gal we all know and love. And something that only one critic acknowledged was this:  the newborn alien.  WOW!  That thing was ugly and scary as hell!  That's the type of alien you need for the ending.  You've been seeing the same old alien for 3.75 films now, and you've pretty much gotten scared by the creatures as much as you could, why not bring some fresh meat on the scene?  And plus, you have to include the alien tradition of battling a new alien at the end of each film.  In the first one, Ripley battled a normal alien.  In the second one, Ripley battled a queen.  And in the third one, Ripley battled a dog alien.  To continue the tradition, Ripley battled a human alien.  And if I may say, that thing is the scariest of them all.  What I don't understand is that everyone says that this series ran out of steam by the beginning of the third one.  I disagree.  The Alien films still have a flare going, but a fifth one would be all that you could have before the flame burns out.  I expect the fifth to be REALLY good, but also tie up the entire story and give an accurate epilogue to the series.  And think about this:  You're not going to resurrect a series like this just so that you can end the series again just before the credits of the said film.  Alien Resurrection was a good movie, and I think that it was as innovative as a third Alien sequel could be.",Alien - Resurrection
498,Von S,What is perfect? Why is this movie NOT!?,1,1 June 2001,"What is perfect? Answer: The Alien Creature, the pure quality of the being; its lifecycles, its seductive and poetic and immensely horrific image... in short; `The Alien'.Why isn't `Alien: Resurrection' perfect? Answer: Allow me to sum the perspective: The four movies: 1: Alien - A mystic and highly horrifying and chilling introduction to the Alien universe = Perfect!! 2: Aliens - Builds upon the previous story without any attempt of copying the first movie (which is often the universal mistake of a flopping sequel). `Aliens' adds another type of storytelling to the Alien-universe. It is told with high pace and with wild action of the highest quality = Perfect (especially directors cut)!! 3: Alien 3 - Just as the second movie it builds the story. Its telling technique is a little like the first movie but it never becomes an obvious copy and the story expands the Alien-universe even further > Perfect!! The same Alien-topic told differently in all three movies and every story builds the universe further: these three movies complete the cycle perfectly. Yet it is a cycle that can easily be expanded if it is done with the same grace as mentioned above! This is where `Alien: Resurrection' fail.`Alien: Resurrection' - The telling technique is not completely off yet very close to `Aliens', but it makes two fatal mistakes: I: The theme of the Alien-universe has so far been horror and action on the highest level. `Alien: Resurrection' is told in a way so the horror aspect is perhaps not lost but seriously down prioritised! One can justify this by saying that so was `Aliens'; that's true, though not as mush. However, it does NOT justify that humour and corny remarks are the new main ingredient along with action. But please Jean-Pierre Jeunet accept the fact that Alien IS HORROR and not something in between - which is the first fatal mistake the movie has! II: Referring to the definition of ""perfect"" as mentioned above, then there is no reason to change anything about the Alien creature: Why the new design of the eggs: Why make the opening of the eggs look like the anus of a fat jellyfish when the old design with a hard shell was perfect?! And most off all why change the whole mother design... making a big fat skeleton-baby instead? If one should change these two `mistakes' it would mean another design told in another horrifying way: That would have been a number four to be proud of!But let's face it! The movie has many great action scenes and after all it is Alien and one can't stop from being impressed a little - Therefore I recommend seeing it and that is the only `therefore'!Can't wait for number 5, perhaps it will bring order to the chaos `Alien: Resurrection' created in the cycles of the Alien!

Also weak is John Frizzells score, which is the absolutely boring standard-shocker music with high string tremolos and stomping percussions, the other 3 movies had great scores. And the worst part of it all: this movie doesn't even scare you. Instead of well build tension you get gore, gore, gore- my fantasies are much more frightening then liters of film blood. I give it a 1 out of 10, because Jeunet really failed in keeping up the high quality of the series (yes, i also liked Fincher's take on the beast, although you can feel, that it was heavily cut by the studio.)

It is difficult to put my finger on exactly what went wrong, I suspect the script has to bear some of the blame. Also, the villain was not particularly villainous and the heroes were not terribly likable and the aliens failed to instill the brooding menace of the first film, the terrifying vigour of the second or even the vaguely artistic and bizarre nature of the third.

Alien & Aliens are two incredibly fantastic movies - they probably defined how Sci-Fi movies would look in the future, like 2001 did, and featured incredibly talented actors and superb scripts.They have been the exact opposite to Alien3 and Resurrection. I feel this movie is too ""cool"", artificial and fast-paced - you cannot convey to the audience that what you see on the screen is really happening if things go much faster than in real life - which is really bad since suspense cannot really be created because you do not feel it could really happen. The cast and the script is a joke.Always look on the bright side of life - at least Weaver earned $11,000,000 for this one, according to IMDB. But still it is like accepting a bribe for making a really bad movie. It is against principle, it is dirty, and in the end, you have a bad conscience and wish it would never have happened.Weaver is an extra-ordinary actress who truely deserves several Academy Awards - but her public image suffers from bad movies like this one, which is very, very very sad :(",Alien - Resurrection
507,tadpho911,"Come on, let the series die",1,6 May 2006,"This film is an example of Hollywood milking a successful franchise to death. The premise is so absurd, such a hollow excuse to simply grind out another blood and guts shootout with a monster that has become a cliché. Once again we have the nasty monstery, the evil-doers who whip us into a frenzy of anger at corporations and government, space-vigilante smuggler types, the usual trotted out lot of superficial characters locked in a moral battle with big mean green aliens as a foil. The repeated regurgitation of this franchise detracts from the power and originality of the first film which, in my view, is arguably one of the best science- fiction movies ever made. Sigourney Weaver ought to be ashamed for accepting this roll. Perhaps money is getting tight.",Alien - Resurrection
508,sebster1001,ALIEN RESURRECTION = decent,6,1 August 2009,"I actually think this film is pretty decent. It's not as bad as the haters say, but don't get me wrong - it is certainly not a masterpiece, and certainly not as good as the two first ones. As Howars Hawks said: ""a film consists of three good scenes and no bad ones"". I believe there are three good scenes in this movie; the underwater scene, the scene where Ripley discovers the other 7 clones and the scene where the unborn is sucked into space (I love Ripley's face when her ""son"" is tortured to death)- but sadly there is also some very bad scenes. I like the characters from the ""Betty"" even though they are a little stereotypical action types, and I also like some of Jeunet's directing, especially with the visuals. One thing he does very wrong though is that he starts the action right away and he goes with cheap jump-scares. He should have built the tension like Scott did in ""ALIEN"" and then showed us some good action like Cameron in ""ALIENS"". I'm not even gonna mention ALIEN3. But in my opinion the fourth installment is a decent film, and worth watching.",Alien - Resurrection
509,Hollerbach,Buffy the Alien Slayer,1,10 March 2007,"This is an abomination. Classic stories work best in 3 acts, and the Alien Trilogy worked fine. Why was this necessary? If a 4th was to be done, it could have been good, had it explored the origins of the aliens, the boneship, and the ""space jockey"" species. The plot appears to have been drawn from a Dark Horse comic story, about breeding Aliens for profit. 20th Century Fox could have developed a great screenplay. Instead, Joss Whedon is brought in to create one of the lamest scripts in movie history. Definitely on par with ROBOT MONSTER. The dialogue is appalling. Cringe inducing one-liners and throwaway wisecracks abound. Worse, they are delivered by the actors in pantomime style. ""Must be a chick thing"", ""Who do I have to f*** to get off this ship?"" and so on. Terrible visual ""larks"" are thrown in for good measure. There doesn't seem to be anyone who isn't overacting. Except maybe Ryder, who turns in a plank-like performance. However, Ron Perlman and Dominique Pinon, take the arm-flapping and mugging to extraordinary levels. Perlman, as Joner, the ""tough guy"" Space Pirate, shouts, grimaces, and demonstrates that he is the badass of the story. The X-treme Badass. Pinon as the ""physically challenged"" character, annoys from start to finish. He whines, pouts, and plays the underdog part with the subtlety of a pipe-bomb. A pity, some fine actors were involved- Brad Dourif, Michael Wincott, Leland Orser. All wasted here. There are goofs throughout- blasting an alien head, through it's mouth, then extracting a pristine tongue/jaw. Christie has his hands by his side. Then not. Then back again, etc. This movie can be viewed, just to spot the many goofs. There are too many ""hijinks"", and extroverted attempts at ""comedy"". Jeunet and Weaver had too much ""creative control"" and appear to have made the film by constructing it around set piece shots and scenes: ""Let's have Ripley dreaming that she is covered in cheesecloth"". ""Wouldnt it look brilliant to have a pit of squirming tentacles?"". ""What about an Alien pushing the punishment button with it's inner jaw? Not it's hands, it's dripping jaw!"". ""A robot in a Chapel! How very subversive, and avant garde!"". The end result is forced, and seems to serve only these ostentatious ""artistic"" scenes. Logic is nowhere to be found in this tale. Christie cuts himself loose and thereby sacrifices himself, for his little buddy, for no apparent reason. He isn't incapacitated, the acid on his face looks little worse than a bad case of acne. Is he so vain, he would prefer death, to a future without a modeling career? Joner displays his edgy, in-your-face disposition, by blasting a spider, whose web he is inconvenienced by. Spiders on space ships? What do they catch to eat? Never mind, it is symbolic of their struggle against the aliens. Spider, bugs, aliens... get it? Tres anarchistic! The production itself blows chunks. The movie starts off well enough, but soon descends into a gaudy, psychedelic style. There appear to be lights that serve no function other than to provide a multi-coloured wash. The sets look far too big and are more ""Poseidon Adventure"" than ""Alien"". The bombastic score reminds the viewer this is a suspenseful movie, with a melodramatic- Dun, dun, dun ...DUNNNN! In over the top leathers, Weaver seems to meander through the part, falling back on a role she used from her last production. The characterization of Ripley-clone, and ""The Queen"" from Snow White, are awfully similar. There is actually a scene, where Weaver repeats the same ""signature"" hand gestures, with Ryder, that she used in ""SNOW WHITE: A Tale of Terror"", which was shot just prior to this. Perhaps she was channeling the Evil Queen through Ripley? Or telling us that Call is really a banished Princess? There is at least one dwarf. ""What were you expecting? Santa Claus?"". No, but I wasn't expecting this piece of ****, either. It makes Armageddon look cerebral. Buffy the Alien Slayer. Fox really should have hired a director who spoke English. Jeneut is not entirely to blame. Weaver and Whedon did little to help. Was going to give it 2x stars. But just thinking about this mess, makes me angry. It takes a dump on the Alien Trilogy. Ripley: ""We did it. We saved the Earth"". Call: ""What do we do, now?""... Make another multi-million dollar, crappy rip off, from a now violated, cinematic legend, of course!",Alien - Resurrection
510,samdaleimagery,Take away everything that made Alien (1979) great and you're left with Alien Resurrection.,3,15 July 2015,"In the first Alien we got a cinematic spectacle that made the jaws of audiences remain open throughout the film, in a state of awe and suspense.For me the first Alien was the best and they have gone downhill ever since, I liked Aliens, and I even appreciated some moments in Alien 3 but Alien Resurrection was so far removed from the Alien world I have come to love that it left a bad taste in my mouth.Although the visual effects were improved in this installment I would say that this is the only thing the film had going for it. Firstly the film seemed too funny, there was too much visual comedy that made the film feel almost like a parody of itself. Also the character of Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) despite (SPOILER) being a clone in this film, she still lacks the human nature that the role took on in the previous Aliens and it made her unlikeable.She is not the only one! There isn't a likable character in the movie so it becomes hard to root for the characters and fear for them when they are in danger... Speaking of fear, it is something I didn't feel once during the film as the Alien creatures have become too familiar, also director Jean-Pierre Jeunet might want to look up the definition of suspense in the dictionary.Overall this was quite a silly, needless movie, the visual effects and set design were very well done however it is a shame the story wasn't up to scratch and left me feeling unfulfilled.Take away everything that made Alien (1979) great and you're left with Alien Resurrection.",Alien - Resurrection
511,suasifaa,Could have been better,5,2 January 2021,"Worth watching once. Ripley back as creepy human-alien hybrid adds an interesting dimension to the character. Unfortunately the script basically ignores this until the final few scenes. Scenes featuring the aliens are generally over-reliant on dated CGI, which detracts from some otherwise good action sequences (like the underwater scene).",Alien - Resurrection
512,jenniferadarby,Disregard the negative reviews!,10,15 April 2018,"This is my FAVORITE in the Alien series. It is very dark, suspenseful and has just a greater setting in space than the others in the series. I hated Aliens ( a cat and Bill Paxton ruined this film for me as I hate cats and Paxton has his worst acting in this film!) and Alien 3 with a passion and this was a breath of new life the series desperately needed. I also love the overall story and action scenes in this movie and recently grabbed in on Blu Ray to add to my collection. Definitely worthy against those who disliked it, and I have noticed fans that didn't like this movie also like stuff I hate. So this is DEFINITELY one of the only movies that split up the fanbase like how JJ Abrams has ruined Star Wars forever! Anti-Disney. Anti-Abrams because he is one of the worst directors EVER!",Alien - Resurrection
513,Skippy-13,"Awesome, but has some severe set-backs.",7,12 October 1998,"This movie rocks.  I have 3 main criticisms though. The higher level of violence was different from the other films, but was not too disgusting(graphic and lingering).  The insinuated physical relationship between Ripley and the Queen though was vulgar and completely unnecessary. The second main criticism was that the film was shorter than the others in the series, and no time was spent on trying to get to know the characters (esp. the smugglers).  Surely 10 minutes could have been spent on making them better defined and known. Thirdly, the new-born. It was a huge disappointment.  Granted, the first time I saw the film, it was horrible and scary, but Aliens DON'T have eyes!! The concept of a new alien was good, but surely they could have found something more 'alien'.",Alien - Resurrection
514,GJ-4,The Perfect alien follow-up,9,22 December 1998,"Jean Pierre Jeunet proves his enormous talent in film making. Alien Resurrection is the perfect follow up on the alien triology, and matches the other films to a great extent. Already in the beginning of the film (when the camera moves ""into"" USS Auriga, and we learn about crew etc..) I got the special feeling that only the alien films give me - Especially when one could hear the ""alien music"" which has been used in number 1 and 2.Sigourny Weaver manages her role as a clone 100%, and the selection of actors that follow her are perfect.What prevented me from giving the film 10 (I gave it a 9) was some lack of action, and the unrealism in some of the shooting (when the alien avoids the bullets, and when its head explodes)The film now holds a special place in my movie-collection.",Alien - Resurrection
515,skydog,Travesty,1,23 January 1999,"Awful film, a tired self-parody. Winona Ryder a joke. Ripley without a soul left. The mutated baby monster laughable. All the cliches of the series trotted out and hammed up. Pathetic. I'm one of the decided minority who think Alien3 is literate and engaging, a worthy successor to the first two. ""Resurrection"" just squeezing the last bit of juice out of the concept.",Alien - Resurrection
516,qus,I love French sense of humor!,10,17 June 1999,"If ""Alien"" by Ridley Scott wasn't the first and original, I would say that ""Resurrection"" was the best one from the series. The first movie was full of suspense. ""Aliens"" were complete failure - no ideas just a lot of shooting. Third part was very picturesque and poetic. Fourth is just funny and dynamic! If you like the kind of black humor used in ""Delicatessen"" or ""City of lost children"" you will find yourself laughing hard at some moments (unless you're American and can hardly catch the kind of intelligent European humor bursting from this movie) I am not a die-hard fan of Aliens, but it *IS* one of my favorite movies, and having all four of them at home ""Resurrection"" is my most frequent choice, right after ""Alien 3"".",Alien - Resurrection
517,LepInDaHood,A disgrace to the series.,2,1 August 1999,"Okay the third one was bad-but this one is just horrible, simply horrible. The first two were sublime-they are two of the best sci-fi movies ever, and have been imitated dozens of times. The third one was just a bunch guys with British accents who you couldn't tell apart running around and getting killed. The third one ruined the series, but at least it was a trilogy. This one not only destroys the trilogy status, but disgraces the series.So lets see where do I start? Well first of all the characters are evil space pirates that have probably killed many innocent people, and you don't really care what happens to them. From the beginning, you can pretty much tell which ones will live and which ones are just there to die. The movie might have been more interesting if it had more people in it, but everyone abandons ship, leaving only a few boring people to entertain us. And of course, in the tradition of Ash and Burke, there's the one bad guy who betrays them-I'm sure we can all guess what happens to him.Then there's the aliens. In my opinion, the second one had the most real-looking aliens because they were animatronic. The aliens in this one were just bad. In this one they lost all their insect-like characteristics which made them creepy. CGI effects haven't quite been perfected yet, so it looks like a cartoon has been inserted into a movie. This one is no exception. The hybrid alien at the end is just plain awful. Words can't describe how incredibly bad it is, but by this point in the film you don't even care anymore. But wait, there's more! After the crew is seemingly safe, the alien comes back for what is possibly the worst moment in film history.This film uses the formula created in Alien and Aliens- [---A group of _______s is trapped on a ______ and is being hunted by______(some kind of monster). During the escape, _______(usually multiple persons) is/are killed by the monster(s). The remaining crew gets to an escape craft, but the monster comes back and is killed by the hero. The end---] There are even scenes which seem to be directly lifted from ""Aliens"". Out of 10 stars it gets 2. Don't waste your money by renting it, wait for it to be on TV.",Alien - Resurrection
518,20below,Not that scary,7,5 December 1999,"As a fan of the series (especially ""Aliens""), I was mildly disappointed in ""Alien: Resurrection"". Mildly, because what can you expect from a third sequel. For some reason this movie is not scary. It's gory and visually quite impressive, but still it doesn't make you feel the excitement it should as a part of the ""Alien""-series. And it is way too gory. I think we could have done well without the scenes where the aliens demonstrate their bloody ways to kill people. I mean that the earlier movies had already pretty much established the horrible way these creatures treat their victims.As I said the movie is visually quite impressive, but in this case it does work out right. I'd say the computer generated aliens look great, but not real enough. And they shouldn't be shown so much. They would be much more scary they were more ""mysterious"" as in the earlier movies.The story line and the characters are basically OK, but still the movie seems a bit too ambitious in trying to make it sell. But still, it is a must for the fans of the series, because it doesn't spoil the series in any way.",Alien - Resurrection

I base this on the fact that the Xenomorphs are nothing like those of the first three features.  The uncontrollable salivating is ridicules!  The characters, however, are great.  Number 8 rocks!  The crew of the Betty are fantastic. The Auriga crew are great.  The use of Mother's counterpart I think is a little hokey.

524,iainmcmullan,Not so bad second time around,6,4 April 2007,"I watched this film again for the first time since it's release ten years ago and was pleasantly surprised . When this movie first came out I had great hopes for it because of the directer on board , great cast e.t.c and being a huge fan of the series . My unabiding memory of seeing this movie first time is round is of huge disappointment but after watching it again my opinion has somewhat softened . I think we have seen so many bad films in this jaunra in the last ten years this film has started to grow on me .The film itself is visually very good Juenet captures the dark intense atmosphere of the ship very well , very reminiscent of the first alien . You can see they have went down the action adventure root like aliens instead of the psychological thriller root of one and three which is not a bad thing but the character and menace of the alien creature itself somewhat get lost in this one .The acting is quit good Weaver is great as usual Pearlman a Revelation but Ryder does not have the presence or charm for us to care for her character . The effects are not bad and still stand up today and the film has got a good pace to it and does'nt lag .BUT! and here's the but as with the first time around the ending is quit a let down . It's quit over the top gory and for me ruins the film . In remaking a new creature they loose what made the series so good the alien itself and the new hybrid cannot even compare to Giger's creation and becomes just another horror movie monster with no lasting resonance . I would love to see Scot or Camerron come back and finish the series properly I think it deserve's that . All and all I think it's six star rating is appropriate",Alien - Resurrection
525,terminatrkid,"You'll never end up reading this, but",2,22 September 2001,"as you have probably already read a thousand times, this movie is a real-stinkeroo. Well, kinda. Apparently, military scientists have cloned Ripley (believe it or not), and she is about 25% alien, while the Queen, in turn, is 25% human. In fact, I enjoyed the first hour of the movie, then, WHAT THE *&%^ HAPPENED?! Suddenly we have people running and running and wandering around a ship that seems as though it was a junkyard pile of old and rusty ship pieces. I still cannot figure out how the ships used in the future de-evolved. The ship in Alien was clean and white... then, the future's Military vessel is dark and leaky and seems to be blowing steam out of every single pipe.What the heck happened in the last 30 minutes? We have Ripley falling through the grating onto the Alien's nest, where she sinks through a pulsating layer of Alien flesh. How did this come about? It's almost as if the movie ""borrowed"" StarCraft's Zerg Creep. Then, she is either hugging an Alien drone or is having sexual relations with it. The ""Humalien"", as I like to refer to it, is very stupid looking and does not capture the feeling of terror that the aliens usually embody.This movie explored the Aliens' ""Fleshy"" possibilities, by adding more organic elements to their species. This bit! The Aliens were supposed to be like insects, for goodness sakes!If the Aliens series has any chance at redeeming itself, it should do so in ""Aliens vs. Predator"". In fact, this would redeem both titles from sucky sequels.This movie left me saying, ""Huh?""

Sigourney Weaver is superb, she is very right for this part, and no film should ever call itself Alien without her (like aliens versus predator does :P). Winona Ryder on the other hand whilst there is nothing wrong with her acting looks a little out of place. The supporting cast are generally good, especially Ron Perlman; come on him loosing at basket ball to sigourney weaver?

529,Three-Jane,Pity for the Monster - The Convergence (Spoilers !),9,25 June 2009,"Alien is one of the rare cases, when follow-ups worked and brought up films as good as the first. Perhaps due to the fact, that every sequel was made by another great director and had another Ripley character growing more and more adapt to the superhuman forces involved here. And that there was some kind of development of the alien species. Perhaps also due to the co-production of S.Weaver, who might protect her Sgt. Ripley against decay.Alien is hard SF and hard SF is about possibility alone, neither about reality as the crime genre nor about myth as fantasy and horror. It is not at all the task of SF-authors to make real predictions - do you think they'd not work as engineering inventors or in policy, should they be capable of that ? No SF classic describing a nearer future as ""1984"", ""Brave New World"", ""20.000 miles under the sea"" has come only near to reality.That is why hard SF is about possibilities. And the reader/spectator has to accept superluminal transit, for example. Attempts to fill the gap must inevitably fail by the missing scientific qualifications of the authors. In ""Solaris"" the alien is sending tormenting hallucinations to men - so far no problem - and Stanislav Lem tries to elaborate them as ""neutrino bundles"". That is ridiculous - in my view the only flaw of this masterpiece, but a severe.Fortunately there is nothing like ""neutrino bundles"" in Alien 4. But unfortunately there are essentials of the plot too far from possibility. To pick out only one: The DNS Ripley 4 is made from could not have withstood the heat of the fumace in Alien 3. At the good end the plot has a marvellous outline and the length of IMDb's quote list proves the quality of the dialogue. A good part of its laconic humour comes from Ripley 4's alien nature and is quite appropriate. Nevertheless these holes are the main reason for me not to give a 10.Slightly off-topic: For me Alien 1 is fine, but the poorest of the series. The only feeling it gives us is an always identical mixture of disgust and fear. It has a very very well done rhythm of terror and it has Sgt. Ripley, but these are the only extraordinary features - too poor for a masterpiece.The Ressurrection is using constants of the former sequels: Powerful Ripley against claustrophobia, militarism, feasibility obsession of degenerate scientists and against haunting aliens. Birth, spaceships with the flavor of lube, little colours.This Ripley 4 is no more human at the beginning and S.Weaver is playing the alien and her development of what we call humanity extremely well letting us never forget Ripley 4 is post-human. The salvation of her misbred precursor models is showing her first tears and very moving.And as Ripley 4 is more alien, the aliens make a move towards us. We never learned, what might be in the alien's minds. Alien 1 even let the question open, whether this species is intelligent or not, at least since Alien 3 we have learned it is. Here we are told of extreme abilities of that intelligence. And the reprieving of Sgt. Ripley in 3 was a first step to the Newborn recognizing Ripley 4 as his mother here (who is in fact his physical grandmother).Thus this sequel 4 is consistent further development of the former. It is consequent to enrich the story with elements of the initial contact genre adding something to the series i always missed (there is another initial contact - that of the scientists to Ripley 4). And it is completely in the anti-militaristic line to overcome the terror that these simultaneously insectoid and lizard-like beasts are spreading - in a sense we spectators are reliving the process Ripley's feelings at them are going through.The Newborn is an Alien Queen's creation in direction to mankind. The Queen apparently has understood the small child pattern. But creation under pressure and possibly the Newborn is misbred. Any remarks on his guise should be made with this possible narrative intention of misbredness in mind.That scenes with him led me to the hope, he might survive tamed by Ripley 4. And to pity with his death. That is an equally logical and amazing climax of the whole series. Pity for this ugly and deathly monster - an extraordinary experience impossible with anything else than a great movie.",Alien - Resurrection

It did seem to have a little too much slime and alien guts.

As with most movies, you have to watch it a few times before you catch everything. But I have to say, the confusing link between the queen and Ripley was...well, confusing...and still is.I was disappointed in it, but all in all, I'm disappointed in most movies...I do still hope for an Alien 5, or better yet a Predator 3, even better would be an AVP movie that doesn't suck!As most things go, the movie was decent, and I'd recommend it to any monster/sci-fi/gore fan.",Alien - Resurrection

The plot with recreating Ripley from a stain of blood and then just accept that she has some remnant memory of things from her previous version turns my enthusiasm off.It is not a bad movie, but it doesn't measure with the first 3 films.

When I first saw both Alen 3 an Resurrection I liked neither of them. It was only after watching both several years later it dawned on me how great they actually were. The extended editions also help greatly. And while they aren't without their problems, they are truly worthy to be part of the series (I think we can all agree the same can't be said for the abominations that are AvP and AvP2).People always point out what they perceive to be plot holes in the movie. Why is Ripley cloned 200 years later, why not straight away? Easy, while its never actually explained why, it doesn't matter, you can think for yourself. Maybe they didn't develop the tech until then. Hence the 7 failed experiments. In aliens no one ever questions why the narcissus didn't get found until 57 years later with Ripley in perfect condition. How do they clone her with the alien inside her? In Alien3 Clemens uses medical equipment on Ripley, when she first arrives her clothes are bloody, who's not to say that alien DNA can't be already mixed with her blood?I will concede that the USM Auriga crashing into Earth is major. Wouldn't it kill millions of people? perhaps even had meteor like consequences? Stupid.As for the characters, they are all perfectly believable for what they are. The cloned Ripley is a fascinating character, but more should have been done with her. Overall its just a great movie, with plenty of action and interesting scenes.It's undeniable that Alien and Aliens are true classics. Alien3 and Resurrection are also classics, in their own right.",Alien - Resurrection
533,DelfinoD,"Not as good as the classical Aliens, but still a bit underrated",7,11 September 2010,"Alien: Resurrection is much different than classical Aliens. As a result many Alien-maniacs are disappointed and give it bad notes in the reviews. In my opinion one should look at the movie in a different way. It is not a clear continuation of the story, but rather a variation on the subject.Alien 4 is not perfect, not even great, but still it is a good science fiction movie. The story is very well written. Many people criticize the idea of cloning Ripley along with the alien inside. Of course I agree that this is completely naive and unrealistic (even the general asks how it is possible), but we have to accept this as a convention. There was no other way to have Ripley back in Alien 4. Well I can imagine Ripley waking up and saying 'Hey, it was just a dream, I didn't jump into the burning lead', but this would be even more ridiculous to me. In Star Wars for example there are many naive and unrealistic things but it doesn't stop it from being a great movie. We accept them just as a convention.Other people note that Alien 4 is not scary at all. I agree. But I still think that it wasn't supposed to be very scary. In Alien 1&2 Ripley was scared as hell and so were we. In Alien 3 she wasn't scared as much, as she knew from a point, that the Alien wouldn't kill her. We were not scared that much either. In Resurrection Ripley is not scared at all, as she is a bit of alien herself. Why should we be scared then? In my opinion this confusion, whether Ripley is more a human or a alien and who to chose, is the best feature of the movie. It is not a pure action but also a bit of psychological drama. The newborn alien is a masterpiece to me. Ripley, who has strong maternal instinct (see Aliens) feels that it has some of her DNA, that it is her own child. She has real doubts whether to kill it or not. And what is even more interesting is that she probably kills it only to save Annalee. I think she would not kill it just to save a human, which were shown in the movie as beings not really better than the aliens themselves. She did it to save the robot, who in her opinion was probably much more of worth. And that is how I actually felt while watching the movie. ""The newborn alien is so cute, maybe let him kill those freaking human beings."" But then I would be sorry for Annalee...In my opinion this is a very good movie, with nice climate and many philosophical questions asked. But if you care only for good action or horror, then you might be disappointed.",Alien - Resurrection
534,calculon00,"Good Sci-fi movie, mediocre Alien movie",8,13 March 2004,"Don't get me wrong, I love Alien Resurrection.  As sci-fi goes, its one of the best, but it makes a mediocre Alien movie.  And to those who think they should let this series `die', the only reason most people feel that way is because the series has been going down-hill.  If they make an excellent Alien 5, it would completely justify continuing the series.First off, I want to express how frustrated I am at the scenes that were cut in the theatrical release of Alien Resurrection.  In the uncut version in the Alien quadrilogy, there is this scene where Ripley is getting her intelligence tested by naming the pictures that are shown to her that was cut.  In the uncut version, there is a shot where she is presented with a picture of a girl, which clearly reminds her of Newt from Aliens.  These few seconds were cut from the scene in the theatrical release which would have added greatly to the movie, as it shows that the movie does not forget its roots and gives the Ripley character more personality and emotion.Another cut shot which should have been included is during the scene where Call and Ripley are in the ships chapel and Call is hacking into the ships computer.  Ripley tells Call that she remembers a girl who was very important to her, but now she can't even remember her name.  This should have been included for the same reasons and the first cut shot.Winona Ryder and Sigourney Weaver do excellent performances in this movie (Pretty much all the acting is done well), but I think the key thing that this movie and Alien 3 were flawed in was that they showed the Alien too much, taking away all its terror.  Perhaps that is why the latest two movies are not as good as the first two.In short, the movie is good sci-fi, but needs more focus on the actual characters.  While they all did have good development (Except for General Parez, who seems to be the stereotypical, stupid-military guy.) they needed the personality detailing that the first Alien movie had.  That way the audience actually cares when they die.If they do make an Alien 5, I hope that more focus will be on Ripley and her emotional struggle at all the loss she's endured in her lifetime.",Alien - Resurrection
535,underme0000,A great close out to the Alien Series (at least for now),9,10 August 2004,"Alien Resurrection has problems, I will agree with that. I do not agree when people say that this is an action film though. The film spends over thirty minutes setting up the story and the acting throughout is very well done. To me the Alien movies (not even the first one) scared me. They were more about making the heart race a little bit, giving a tease of the creatures. I loved the ironies in this film as well. The computer is named ""Father"" the aliens using the machine to freeze a human! The aliens are in this film for certain and it most definitely has an action feel to it but again I harken back to Aleins. Aliens was a pure action movie. We saw the aliens in it more than we did in any other film I still believe. Aliens was not scary, it did not make you freak out like the first one did. Aliens and Alien Resurrection share this in common, they are both very high powered action movies with deep integrated plot lines. The movie is not perfect, but what film is. I think most people are too over critical. ..its a movie.. .about aliens with acid for blood.",Alien - Resurrection
536,prohibited-name-2023,Part of the ever worse decline of the Alien franchise,3,19 September 2007,"This movie is further proof that the Alien series should have been left to rest. Instead of growing, becoming more gripping and keeping the same intense, dark and bewildering monsters that made man look so inferior as a species and so alone in space the Xenomorph's powers wavered sporadically from immortal to easily killed by an obnoxious and poorly cast group of space bums, the idea of the ant-like hive and all the subtle connotations involving gender and Darwinism were lost making them nothing more than boogie-men. The fact that the movie was toned down so much in terms of violence and gore, a classic Fox tactic for shooting themselves in the foot, renders even that rather pointless.The cloning idea was not only a stretch but utterly ridiculous even for the nonsense-tolerant genre of science fiction and all the menace of the alien hoards is lost, not to mention anything special about them by the time they have adapted to human DNA. This movie will go down in history as the slayer of any hope of a return to form for the Alien franchise and a stain on the career of the creative genius that is Joss Whedon.",Alien - Resurrection
537,my_name_is_aoshi_of_the_oniwaban,Alien Resurrection is Slightly Underrated,8,5 March 2005,"Audiences are automatically drawn to dislike sequels, which is understandable. I had the fortune to see all four movies in one sitting and this movie was just another part of the series, as it should be. I can see some of the arguments against it. It has some weak parts and is definitely different than the others but this one has its own powerful message and actually ends on a happier note.While I agree its the weakest of the series I don't believe it ""sucks"". It's not scary like the original and isn't as action-packed as the second. It's most closely related the the third one but it's its own story. I think it adds a whole new depth to the character of Ripley.If you like the first three Alien movies there's no reason why you should not enjoy Alien Resurrection.",Alien - Resurrection
538,altugonur,It's as bad as depicted by the audience,4,29 August 2021,"This one wasn't as good as its predecessors. I mean yeah it has suspense in it and better graphics for the aliens but that is not a surprise since the time passes and CGI technology gets better. Other than that weak acting, absurd and cringy dialogs and bad camera angles. Since they changed director for this one it's not a surprise. When it comes to the science fiction part, the movie lacks in that department as well.Not the worst movie i've seen but, it has lots of shorts.",Alien - Resurrection
539,aridge23,Terribly disappointing.,5,26 September 2009,"I LOVE the alien movies. And I love Joss Whedon. I was extremely surprised to find out that he wrote the screenplay. I console myself by assuming that the character writer wrote the awful dialog, and that the producers made changes that he would not have agreed with. And that he did not cast wynona ryder. she is horribly annoying in this movie. I loved Heathers, and this was the movie that made me start to dislike her. The aliens are scary. The new Ripley-hybrid is an obvious Whedon powerful superwoman. But the story is not as good as the others. It is less coherent in places- perhaps it was edited poorly. And some of the dialog is Embarrassingly Awful. I really did not expect that from a movie in the alien series. Even though Aliens, the 2nd one, is mostly an action film, not at all a serious Ridley Scott scifi work, and has a corny line or 2, it was well done, enthralling, and scary as hell! There are some of great actors in this movie(Brad Dourif, Michael Wincott, Ron Perlman -although his performance was terrible), Ripley kicks some ass, more corporate horrors are revealed, and the aliens exhibit some new and terrifying behavior. But it is definitely my least favorite of all the Alien movies. And if you are just starting the series, you can skip it. You don't miss any information relevant to the AvP movies or any future installments. There was no super secret Bishop or Weyland Industries revelation that mattered.",Alien - Resurrection

541,Hippi,Utter crap,1,18 January 1999,"There must have been some very good reasons for the release of this film, but on the evidence of how the film turned out, this film should not have seen the daylight. Almost everything is done wrong: Ripley's character is ruined in to a clone, supporting characters are simply idiots, the aliens only manage to be scary in one single scene and the ending is without any scientific base or sense of logic. The new alien, Newborn, goes only for a bad joke. What was about to be an exciting twist in the overlong tale of Ripley came out as as repulsing variation  of a cheap splatter film. This film is horrifying in all the ways the makers didn't intend.",Alien - Resurrection
542,NenaX,One of the best SF movies ever!,10,11 September 1998,"Alien: Resurrection has restored my faith in Alien serial and SF genre in general. Idea for the movie is brilliant and, even if the story has a few smaller gaps, it gets you through the movie without blinking. Atmosphere is most like the one in second part of the serial, and the Aliens are as scary as ever. Newborn is just a perfect addition to the movie. Jean Pierre Jeunet gave as an inspiring directing, with an obvious European influence. Sigourney Weaver has once again shown that she is one of the best actresses ever! Her portrayal of Ripley once more makes us feel everything that she is going through, even if this time it is a totally different struggle that she is fighting inside herself. Winona Ryder also gives an outstanding performance, so I may say that the whole team has hit it off perfectly and made one great movie.

543,harrs,The best sequel ever!,10,11 July 1999,"I have always loved the Alien series and Alien Resurrection couldn't have been better! AR would've s*cked without Ripley and I am grateful that the producers brought her back. Nonetheless, there's a major difference between this installment compared to its predecessor (Alien 1, 2 & 3); the characters have more powerful weapons to kick those aliens' ass! I loved Ron Perlman's character, at first he acted like a total jerk (on the Betty) but later he turned out to be a good guy! However, I felt sorry for both the queen and her newborn, as they were both killed. (The newborn killed the queen and then Ripley killed the newborn). I even find it laughable in the scene where the aliens have escaped and one of them sneaked into the escape pod and killed all the soldiers. As for the ending, I didn't like it a bit!! WHY did the alien have to be sucked out of the spaceship?? And HOW did it get aboard? Like in Alien and Aliens, no explanation is offered as how did they managed to sneak in and then in all of a sudden, they showed up from nowhere and jumped on their preys! I certainly hope this sequel is the conclusion to the Alien series and please, NO Alien 5, let Ripley retire for God's sake!!",Alien - Resurrection
544,cyrano-7,Aliens becoming more human ruins the whole idea.,1,14 January 1999,"Alien: Resurrection bites the hand that feeds it.  One of the greatest triumphs of this series is the alien's remarkable differences from what audiences have seen in an on-screen monster before.  What were the writers thinking when they decided to change the appearance of the alien into a more human creature?  That's all we need is another monster-in-human-clothes story.  Suddenly, this series has lost its energy and has become part of the movie muck we see too much of.  Let's see the aliens on earth in a global invasion (as UNLIKE ID4 as we can get).  Let's see the aliens battle Predators.  Let's see gorilla-aliens, bird-aliens, shark-aliens.  Let's see something different after two abysmal disappointing movies with a potential for greatness.",Alien - Resurrection
545,obiwan-6,"Good Lord, that was awful!",1,6 December 1998,"Since there was nothing else very interesting on cable this evening, I watched ""Alien Resurrection"" for the first (and last) time on HBO. I am a tremendous fan of both Sigourney Weaver and Winona Ryder; therefore, by the end of this waste of celluloid, I was sad to have seen them in this... this... send-up? (I think Weaver and Ryder knew the truth, because, wow, were they just walking through their roles.) The best of all the Alien films was the first: ""Alien."" Why? I can think of three reasons right off the bat -- 1) Ridley Scott directed masterfully (especially for a first feature film), 2) this was a film based on characters (even the alien) and not gadgets, and 3) because in ""Alien"" the idea was new and fresh, it was (dare I say it?) original. And credit Scott that it was at least as suspenseful as Hitchcock's very best -- possibly more so. For ""Aliens"" John Cameron (writer, director) thought the original idea was good, so instead of being original himself he threw a bunch of money at it. He tossed in some unnecessary back story, filled the screen with gadgets and people in black rubber suits crawling through the air conditioning ducts atop sound stages at Fox, and had nearly all the characters play it either ""over the top"" (Bill Paxton comes to mind) or over-simplistically. Do you really want me to believe that, with the exception of Vasquez and Hicks, those intergalactic Marines were a group of ""tough hombres""? But then, maybe Cameron was just practising for ""Titanic,"" great eye-candy with little or no script support (he co-wrote) or depth of character. Give credit where it is due, though: Cameron sure has made a lot of money at the box office. Does this say something about him, or about us? Meanwhile, back at the Alien films... ""Aliens 3"" was just dreadful, and had story potholes that could swallow a Buick. (Actually, the book was much better than the film. Surprise, surprise.) I did find a bit of humor in it, upon reflection, when Ripley did herself in the very same way Arnold Schwarzenegger would later do in ""T2"" (another Cameron film, proving he can even steal ideas from himself... I wonder if he realizes it?). But did ""they"" stop there, stop milking this cash cow? Heavens no. They gave us ""Alien Resurrection."" To tell the truth, I wish they hadn't, and had donated the shooting budget to their favorite charity instead. Or maybe they could have spent some of it on a script that would have created some audience connection with -- and caring for -- the characters. But then, such stuff as ""story"" in a bad action movie would have just gotten in the way of making one more ""really cool"" special effects shot. Come to think of it, though, there really wasn't anything ""special"" about those, either: that sort of computer stuff has been done again and again, though I think the dinosaurs in ""Jurassic Park"" (for instance) had more heart and soul, more character -- more STORY -- to them than these goop-filled head-bangers did. I do wonder, though, what the day-rate was for the grip to do the run-around-in-the-queen-alien's-prenatal-abdomen-just-before-giving-birth shots... Just wondering... There was one -- count it: ONE -- good thing in ""Alien Resurrection"": there was no ""grip-help"" from just-out-of-frame -- Sigourney actually made the backwards half-court basketball shot, and got nothing but net. I'll bet it took Jeunet a few moments to call ""cut"" on that take just from the shock. Should have wrapped the whole movie there and gone home... Oh, well...",Alien - Resurrection
546,silent-7,Excellent,10,25 February 1999,"Starting at the begining... I saw the movie ""Alien"" for the first time ever in 1997.  Slowly the viewer approaches a ship that looks almost like a city. We are taken inside.  Breezes and small sounds fill the inside of the ship. We are taken on a silent tour, and then watch as the computer wakes the few passengers up and the movie begins. After watching the movement and feeling that Ridley Scott (the director) put forth for all us ""movie goers"" my curiosity was stirred.  Honestly, as a woman myself who lives a complicated human life I could relate to Ellen Ripley.  Whether it was her struggle to keep alive even while all those around her are destroyed, or just a struggle to stay in her status position or responsible position.   All of us feel all that way at some time.  So, after Alien, I saw Aliens.  The sequel was well written and believable. That is something one doesn't see very often at the theater.  Ellen wakes up after 57 years and seems just as human as before.  The journey in that sequel is filled with suspense, drama and even laughter.  The ending is once again filled with sorrow yet hope remains.  For most, Aliens is their favorite movie of all 4.  The child and the new and complex characters sparked many other viewers interests.  Alien 3 was of course the movie I saw next.  I believe the 3rd sequel and last journey for Ellen is misunderstood. Many great fans of the saga do not like Alien 3.  Many say it must have been Ripley's dream and could have never really happened in her life story. I loved it.  I appreciate the introduction we all get into reality.  Because in real life, (just as Number 8 (the cloned Ripley) says in this new film Alien Resurrection), we die. IWhen Alien Ressurection first came to the theaters I was amoung the very first to get in line to see it.  Suddenly the lights go out.  A very  recognisable type of music begins. Skin is pushed around the screen, something is being made.  Space surrounds you.  Things are strangely quiet once again.  Another ship is in the distance.  We enter the ship, the ""Usm Auriga"" space craft and walk through the door to see the same men we remember from Alien 3. Men in white lab coats.  Inside a embryonic tube we see a child.  Quietly she says to herself,  ""My mommy always said there were no monsters.. no real ones.. but there are.""  Any fan knows this child is quoting another child named Newt.  Yet this time the words take on new meaning.  This journey of Ripley no.8 is a new one.  I think it is a very important addition to the saga.In conclution, after seeing all of these 4 segments of Ellen Ripleys' story in a row,  I think that the meaning behind it all is more than feminism or heroism.  I really believe it is all about being human.  I have really found a treasure in these 4 films and I hope that the future generations to come find her story just as interesting. After all, the year this movie came out we cloned an animal successfully for the first time.  What do we clone next?........",Alien - Resurrection

Well, it hasn't got that original ""Alien"" feeling, with dark, narrow corridors and terrifying hunts. It wasn't even interesting. What's next a Aliens Vs. Predator movie? *smirks* Second, the story is so unbelievable, I mean how did they actually clone Ripley with all memories intact and with the alien embryo? Furthermore, the creator of the original Alien design, H.R. Giger was not even credited in this movie, and the fact that he has not been working on this one is rather obvious when you see that ugly alien in the end. To sum it up: The alien saga would have been better off without this one.",Alien - Resurrection
548,Griffin-22,"It's over man, game over man",7,9 August 1999,"The problem with Alien Resurrection wasn't the fact that it was a bad movie. The problem was that it never seemed to know what it wanted to be.  The thing that I loved about the previous movies was the fact that each movie, while a continuing story line, was a different vision.  Alien was a pure horror film.  Aliens was an action/war movie.  Alien3 was a gothic thriller. Alien Resurrection seems to be a cross between a modern slasher flick, a art house movie, and a slam bang blow-your-brains-out John Woo style action movie.Like all of the other Alien movies Resurrection's characters are both well defined and acted.  The scientists bored me, but I was both intrigued and entertained by the crew of the Betty.  Each member had their own distinct personality that didn't just seem like a clone from one of the previous movies.  I really liked the character of Analee Call, played adorably as always by Winona Ryder.  I think that if this series is to continue she is without a doubt the heir to the throne.  Call had an intriguing ""little girl in a world of big bad scary pirates"" thing going on, which was interesting. I also like Johner who was like a mix of all of the meanest characters of all the Alien movies thrown together.  He provided a good level of comic relief and managed the near impossible feat of being more frightening than the Aliens themselves are.All in all, Resurrection was neither a bad Alien movie nor a bad movie period.

549,Silent_Fury,Worst Movie Ever,1,29 August 2000,"I just finished watching the special edition Aliens on DVD and I love that movie now even more than before.  James Cameron worked a brilliant sequel off of Ridley Scott's masterpiece.  Both of these Alien films were just that, FILMS.  The parallels and symbolism that they draw to feminism, childbirth, man vs nature, and even the Vietnam war are poignant and powerful.  Alien 3 wasn't as good as the first two, but it was still a good sequel directed by the amazing David Fincher.  I was really looking foward to Alien Ressurection when it came out, and never have I wanted 2 hours back so much in my life.  This couln't have been any worse.  From the cliched dialogue, to the gratuitous action scenes, Ressurection was 109 minutes of the worst piece of sci-fi period.There is nothing new or creative about this movie.  It covers the same allusions to the pain of birth, except this time we have to hear cheesy one liners to ""lighten the mood"".  If I want to leave a theater feeling light hearted I'll go see Babe Has Fun Somewhere.

551,kls73,Accurate Summary...,2,9 January 2007,"What can I say? Alien: Resurrection was a vomit stew of everything that was wrong, bad, ugly and laughable from the original three films.Alien - The original genius! Undoubtedly one of the top 5 classic sci-fi films of all time. This film continues to awe-inspire, terrify and disturb people - and will for a long time to come. It contains some of the most recognizable scenes from sci-fi movies ever. (8.5/10)Aliens - This film picked up where Aliens left off - it doesn't try to re-create the genius of Alien, but revolutionizes the genre. This film IS the modern sci-fi genre. It went where no sequel had gone before (like T2), in being recognized by many as better than the original. (9/10)Alien3 - Not quite up to the high, high standards of the original two films, and it contains quite a few sizeable plot holes. Yet enjoyable enough if your into this kind of min stream nonsense. It follows in the legendary footsteps of Alien in having only a single alien villain. A mediocre romp if you don't take it to seriously. (4.5/10)Alien: Resurrection - Sheer - absolute - awful - vomit. Terrible acting, screenplay, direction, filming, special effects, characters - the list goes on. Complete and utter crud.",Alien - Resurrection
552,Senefra,So close yet so far away....,7,18 May 2001,"**SPOILERS**Allright, admittedly this film does not come close to the previous films. But I think that was the whole point, seeing as how each film in the series was directed by a different director each with their own vision of how the common threads of the series (Ripley and the Alien) were portrayed.""Alien"" had Ridley Scott working closely with H.R. Giger(whose design inspired the character) to bring something that audiences had never encountered before, which was a scifi horror with human elements (mainly brought by the character of Eleanor Ripley, brilliantly played by Sigourney Weaver). Scott wanted to give us an anticipated chill by portraying the alien as a killer who is barely seen, but when revealed is more terrifying than anything we've come to expect from horror genre, while elevating scifi to a new level. With the introduction of Ripley, we find ourselves empathizing with the character because she's so human and therefore fallible.""Aliens"" director James Cameron brought the action and SFX needed to give this series a jolt. In this one Ripley's just beginning to realize what has happened to her, but by setting it 57 years after the first one, becomes even more of a shock to the system. With her daughter dead, a mining colony on the same planet where the alien was found, we find her growing physically capable while slowly becoming emotionally detached. The addition of the marines (a group straight out of a Vietnam War pic), a sleazy lawyer (played neurotically but with an underlying menace by Paul Reiser), Bishop (the android at the opposite end of the spectrum for Ash in the first film) and Newt (who basically represents the daughter Ripley never had a chance to raise), Cameron adds the action portion while still containing the human elements we loved from the first film. Here Ripley has grown from a damsel-in-distress to a woman capable of handling an entire nest of these aliens, as well as introducing the Queen (an incredibly beautiful touch by Cameron on his part on the similarities between insect colonies/alien colony)), a complete turnaround from dealing with just one of them from the first film.David Fincher, the director of ""Alien3"", wanted to have that one lone menace from the first film, but redefining the series by setting it in an abandoned maximum security prison/lead works, run by the former prisoners (all men) of the facility. By putting Ripley in that testosterone-filled setting, he changed the rules. He even upped the ante by allowing the alien to carry on through other creatures, besides human, be hosts for it. By doing this, he gave the alien abilities and a new look by taking characteristics from it's host (the dog) and fusing them with the alien's capabilities. Fincher also brought to us the alien's POV, which had never been seen before in the series, and used it with great effect. And having Ripley as the host for the new queen was an unbelievable way to end the character because at that point, she had finally reached her full potential. The analogy of Ripley (the strong capable leader) and a queen alien being inside her was just perfect, and having them both die together while Ripley flings herself into the lead works becoming essentially a saviour/martyr of the remainder of humanity was a great way to end the story.Finally I come to ""Alien: Resurrection"", which must be treated as a separate film with the common threads of the series, Ripley and the alien. Director Jean-Pierre Jeune brought to us the fantastic visual style that made his last effort, ""La Cité Des Enfants Perdus (The City of the Lost Children)"" such a cult classic. But by doing this, it weakened the expectations of the audience, who hoped to see the same old Ripley vs. Alien scenario, which in this case would not have worked, seeing as how the character of Eleanor Ripley had died in the last film. Sigourney Weaver decided to play the new Ripley as a being with inherited memories of Ripley's, but also sharing alien characteristics (acidic blood, fast reflexes, healing and heightened strength). In this way the character becomes almost like a double agent of humanity and the aliens, leaving you wondering whose side she's on, and depending on certain parts of the film, leaves you guessing. The new elements of the military experimentation, pirates (with Winona Ryder as Call, an emotional android capable of being humane) and the sense of humor brought to the table by Ron Pearlman and Dominique Pinon's characters are surprisingly enjoyable, but a far cry from what we know of the series. And yes I thought the ""Newborn"" indeed repelling, but I also felt sympathetic towards it because of it's emotional state (not sure who to trust and how to handle being what it is, almost as if it were a newborn puppy). And with aliens actually heading for Earth, which the first three films were aiming toward by preventing such a thing to happen, that brought an adrenaline kick to the film. The ambiguity of the ending left me wondering where the series might be headed.Final analysis? ""Alien: Resurrection"" may not be on par with the earlier films, but as a scifi/horror/action film, it holds it's own. I give it a rating of 7 out of 10, minus three for plot elements and acting.",Alien - Resurrection
553,aristide-1,The worst of the bunch.,1,13 June 2001,"Before Alien Resurrection it was referred to as the Alien Trilogy.  After it's release it was still referred to as the Alien Trilogy, that fact pretty much sums up the value of this movie.  The ""Alien"" story is a mere backdrop for the latest in special effects, and spectacular though they may be they certainly can not make up for what is missing.  The most important aspect of ""Alien"" was that it was believable, totally plausible, and filmed in such a way that the seriousness of the story was always the most important aspect. That fact remained intact for 3 movies, until Jeunet came along and turned it into a parody of itself.  Jeunet steals lines and scenes from the earlier movies to bolster this movie's credibility, but with little success, and even less originality.  Given Sigourney Weaver was not initially paid for ""Aliens"", I prefer to think of Resurrection as ""Sigourney's Revenge"". She probably got paid more for this movie than the 3 prior movies combined. All this so she can do a poor imitation of Ah-nold from ""The Terminator"". Winona Ryder is pitiful as the emotional android.  She should stick to being a burned out teenage pot head, because that's the role she plays best and obviously comes most naturally. But that's not totally fair, because you can't act if you don't have a plot.  The scene with the flame thrower was ridiculous, it was such a poor copy of the incredible original. The scene where frozen limbs break off, what an original idea that was, can you spell T2? The mother alien, the largest, nastiest, creature that ever ripped an android in half with it's 2 hands, was killed off by a single blow from it's own offspring, a creature that looks like it's outfit was picked up at a Halloween costume store for $25.   Everyone I know laughed when they saw it. ""Unique visual genius""?  Please, picking up a medical journal and molding plaster to look like real deformities is not genius, it's exactly what the whole movie was, a total rip off.  File this one behind ""Space Balls"".",Alien - Resurrection
554,alfietowler,Enjoyable for the first and second acts but what the hell was the third act,5,27 June 2021,The first and second act are very enjoyable and tense but still a bit weird with clone Ripley. The third act was a complete mess. The human Xenomorph the and the fact that it can talk is so stupid and the Android twist is no where near as good as the one in the first one.,Alien - Resurrection

556,The Hierophant,adventures into surrealism,5,28 January 2002,"If one thing can be said about Jeunet's direction of this film, it is that he has an uncanny visual sense of the alien (no pun intended) and surreal. From Ripley's weird little body movements into which she occasionally lapses to the makeup and costume design of the human/alien hybrid at the end of the film, this is one visually trippy experience.The cast is pretty good -- with stand-outs being Sigourney Weaver (the ultimate femme bad-ass), Brad Dourif (the weird and crazy alien-obsessed doctor), and Michael Wincott (the surly yet likeable captain of the spaceship Betty). Unfortunately, though, Joss Whedon (whose Buffy TV series is about the only reason I miss having a boob-tube) really screws up the script. He never allows the characters to breath, constantly forcing them to spit out stupid one-liners in practically every scene.
Additionally, the plot is nothing we haven't seen before in this series and offers little to keep us guessing. Overall, it's a decent effort, though one must wonder how much better it could have been in the hands of a more capable script-writer.FINAL RATING: 5/10",Alien - Resurrection
557,wooozle,"OUTSTANDINGLY GOOD SciFi, well written continuation to 3 with a gut/heart-wrenching ending",10,24 October 2001,This is easily the best 'Alien' movie since the original. The screen imagery is superb and quite believable with excellent furturistic settings that appear to work fluently. The storyline makes a very good attempt of continuing after the all but final self-immolation scene at the end of 'Alien3'. There is a gut & heart-wrenchingly brilliant and at the same time sad ending. Needs watching twice to gather the full impetus of the film. The only slight criticism I could think of is that one or two of the jokes are a bit trite and come at the wrong time but that could be due to the director being French !,Alien - Resurrection
558,juliebooth,THIS MOVIE HAS EVERYTHING!!!,10,9 August 2004,"OK when I first saw this movie I had never seen Alien, I'd seen maybe half of Aliens and I had turned off Alien 3 after half an hour because I thought it was SOO bad (the CGI alien is a DISGRACE)! But I was at a movie marathon and Alien Res was on so I sat through it - AND LOVED IT!I'm now a massive fan of both Alien and Aliens (Alien 3 still sucks in my opinion and is responsible for killing the 'real' series) but I like each for totally different reasons. Alien has awesome suspense and for its time was completely unique. Aliens has a great story line, brilliant acting and is one of the greatest action films ever!But Alien Resurrection has everything you saw in the first 3 films but wanted MORE of in close up GORY detail!!! There's evil Ripley who is now truly indestructible, evil doctors, surgically removed chest bursters, lotsa army guys with big guns, a pirate ship crew who get slaughtered one by one, aliens swimming, an alien nest, a hybrid alien, clones-gone-wrong, REALLY corny jokes and CHEST BURSTING AND MORE CHEST BURSTING! It is worth seeing this movie just to see one chestburst through a guys head.OK but even more than the violence and corny jokes I love the characters. Basically Joss Whedon has just written another 'scooby gang' but they're great. And the movie makes so much fun of itself its hilarious! The doctors explaining to Gen. Perez why she has memories is absolute gold.If you're not out LOOKING for the greatest movie ever then you'll enjoy this but I can understand why people who were fans of the trilogy saw this and were severely disappointed. I can't say a thing against it though, it has EVERYTHING you could want in an entertaining film.Who'd you think it was gonna be? SANTA CLAUSE??? - Vriess",Alien - Resurrection
559,mindbullets,Pointless and awful. Guess that makes it awful pointless.,1,22 January 2002,"I feel sorry for Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Obviously a talented director with an eye for spectacle, he has been saddled with one of the most hackneyed and downright groan-inducing scripts ever. Basically a haunted house movie set inside a spaceship (two, actually) full of the eponymous Aliens, writer Joss Whedon scraped the bottom of the cliche-barrel, bringing us not-at-all-lame scenes of people wandering down dark hallways and sticking their heads into acid-burned holes for no particularly good reason (other than to be eaten, of course). The movie liberally steals ideas and scenes from Jim Cameron's Aliens, which is okay, I guess, in an incestuous and cannibalistic kind of way. The sets, the characters and the banter are all pale, inept imitations of stuff we've already seen in the series. Too bad they couldn't have stolen a speck of intelligence from the previous three Alien movies.
This is a noisy, ugly and boring movie... but like a train wreck, it's worth seeing, if only to awe in how someone could manage to louse up a movie about shooting aliens and wearing leather pants. But my hat's off to Whedon, Jeunet & co.; they loused it up royally.",Alien - Resurrection

561,davideo-1,The only place for the series to go.,8,19 October 2002,"One of the great things about the 'Alien' series is that it has benefited from a staggeringly bizarre range of directors, each of who-- from Ridley Scott to James Cameron to David Fincher to Jean-Pierre Jeunet -- brings an almost totally different vision into the mythology. As mythology, the 'Alien' series has also always been more than just the sum of its parts--consider that famed fantasy/surrealist artist H. Geiger helped design the look for the original Alien and its hive, and you begin to get at the 'intangible' elements to the series; 'Alien' has always wanted to be that thing crawling straight out of our nightmares. The '79 and '86 films were stark, simple, and brutal, and the '92 film was brooding and disturbing (to say the least).Well. The interesting thing is, the Alien meme doesn't belong to the mythology, but to whoever is creating it. David Fincher's directorial debut was Alien 3; his version of 'nightmare incarnate' seems pretty prudent when you consider his work in something like Fight Club. Why bring this up? I think that Jeunet is just about the most interesting directorial choice for this series, at this point. What, exactly, can we learn from the nightmares of the director of 'Amelie' and 'City of Lost Children'?Simply, I think there is a lot more subtly and a lot more depth in this movie than people are giving it credit for. Many of the spiritual, religious, and human relationships are, in a way, very simple (as they are in Amelie or C.O.L.C.), but they cross-over in some wonderfully complex ways. This is the *only* movie in the 'Alien' series to truly recognize how much the 'Alien' phenomenon comes from our own heads, our own dreams & nightmares . . . the direction of the Alien series is inwards, and this is further 'in' than any of the previous films. The cinematography is appropriately wonderful, too-- fans of the series & genre itself are already spoiled on mood lighting and tension-riddled close-quarters shots, but these things are expressed with all of Jeunet's tremendous gift for mise-en-scene. Ryder is great, and of course so is Weaver; she may be tired of playing Ripley by this point but she has brought to ""Resurrection"" a curious maternal passion for Ellen Ripley, who by this point must be pretty damn sick of being chased through air ducts.Overall, this is a beautifully realized vision; it is even, in some strange ways, a comic treatise as well, while still keeping that requisite 'Alien' creepiness. The last scene in the movie is, of course, horrific and even horrible, but even that has its grotesque place within the nightmare vision. Oh - and a fun factoid: Sigourney Weaver actually made that over-the-shoulder basketball shot-on the first try.In the end, consider something dear old Nietzsche said (perhaps in anticipation of this series, eh?): ""If you stare long enough into the abyss, the abyss stares back."" Indeed.",Alien - Resurrection
562,alexmcausland,"Utter, utter bilge",1,23 September 2008,"I am at a loss to explain the large number of positive reviews found on this site. I can only assume that people are judging it as a standalone affair, rather than one of the 'Alien' series, or that those true Alien fans gave up on the series after Alien 3. I hope so, for they were spared much suffering.That this film carries the Alien title is, frankly, offensive; any comparison with the first two films comically absurd.Even when viewed as a standalone generic action film this is utter drivel. The makers should be banned from film making, and criminal charges brought against those responsible for handing them the keys to the series.",Alien - Resurrection

Once I saw the first and second I of course realized that they were much better and in fact are probably two of the best sci-fi movies i've ever seen, however I think this movie takes a lot of undue heat because these people are constantly comparing it to the first two movies. Pretty much any sci-fi movie that you compare to the first two movies will look bad and understandably if you are hoping it will be as good as the first two you will be let down. As a stand alone move it obviously doesn't warrant a 10 but people give it such a bad rep that i think it scares a lot of people from even giving it a chance, its really not that bad.

THAT WAS NOT ""rad"" IT WAS JUST GAY!i did like the end thoughbecause in the previous alien movies there wasn't an emotional connection to the aliens in any wayBUT at the end of ALIEN RESURRECTION the human/hybrid newborn sees Ripley as its mother and it has (unlike the others mindless aliens) it has feelings and emotions, it feels love, & its not just a retarded mindless zombie like the rest.it may be big slimy and ugly but in a way it has a mind of a baby & when Ripley killed it you could see that it felt pain & unlovedbasically that's like if you were a toddler or baby and your mom started to stab youHOW WOULD YOU FEEL!!!honestly i felt bad for itTHAT WAS REALLY THE ONLY GOOD PART THOUGH OTHERWISE THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!THE ORIGINALS WHERE BETTER! but it was better than AVP",Alien - Resurrection

It was pretty interesting from its very beginning to the end! I've just been watching it and didn't even go to take one more cup of tea or something.. Great acting made me love these actors more than I did, Ron Perlman did his best, Dominique Pinon was not so good though.. These scary scenery were just like from other Jean-Pierre Jeunet's movies, especially in that lab scene.. But the real question is WHY did they killed that baby?! It was really cute! It was looking at its 'mom' and saying 'please, why are you leaving, don't, why are you trying to kill me, mom?' I almost cried. She could make it not to kill people, the child was supposed to listen to its 'mom'.. And I don't know really why the hell it killed the queen, she was just like a woman and I didn't expect that baby's gonna kill her.. Finally, from now on it's in my favorites.

568,Nova72,Nice film for an evening in front of the TV.,5,27 March 2004,"Alien Resurrection. 1997-USA-20th Century Fox.Attention may contain spoilers.This is the fourth and last (until 2004) part of the Alien films. It is a horror/action movie that has a lot of interesting ideas, but at the end, to the viewer's disappointment, fails to develop them into an interesting plot and a good movie.Special effects, sound, music and the atmosphere are just perfect. Some problems appear with some minor detail, for example towards the end we see the spaceship Auriga passing by Jupiter with a speed that seems to be close to the speed our 20th century satellites use, but we are informed that in less than 40 minutes the ship will land on Earth. I don't remember exactly the distance between Earth and Jupiter but it has to be an hour of light more or less, which means that they used a speed close to the speed of light. Warp speed? Then why did they have to use cryosleep? Or another one where we see two Aliens attack a third one killing it so the acid they have for blood to make a hole through the floor and escape. Ten minutes later we see an Alien spit acid and the question is, if they can spit acid why did they have to kill one of their own?Scenes with action or horror are well directed, but the good work ends here since the rest of the film fails to give anything more. It fails to talk about the special relationship developed between the Aliens and Ripley. As it fails to give life to the military and scientists aboard the vessel, they are just puppets waiting to die just to make a good action scene.Sigourney Weaver as Ripley is below average, a disappointment for the heroin of the other three Alien, but it is to consider the difficulty of the part as the complete failure of the director of giving something more than action.Average Winona Ryder as Call. The part was ideal for something more, an android more human than humans.Good are the performances by Ron Pearlman as Johner and Brad Dourif as Gediman.Bottom Line: Nice film for an evening in front of the TV, Cinema for the fans of science fiction.Film Rate: TV (5/10)[ByDVD (9-10-11/10), Cinema (7-8-9/10), Rent (5-6-7/10), TV (2-3-4-5/10), DSE-Do Something Else (0-1/10)]Actors Rate:Sigourney Weaver as Ripley: 4/10Winona Ryder as Call: 5/10Ron Pearlman as Johner: 6/10Brad Dourif as Gediman: 7/10Dominique Pinon as Vriess: 5/10Dan Hadaya as General Perez: 5/10",Alien - Resurrection

The reason why I think that it wasn't ""Alien"" material because there was to much comedy even though the second installment of Alien had some comedy in it, it still didn't seem like it went over board like I thought it did in the forth installment but if thats what the director wanted then thats the way it would be but it didn't fit but this is my own felling about the movie but don't get me wrong it was still a good movie I think it deserved better then a 6.0 out of 10 vote maybe more like a 7.0 but remember this is only me comments.",Alien - Resurrection
570,Gcrispey,Why are we discussing this movie?,3,28 August 2014,"I was and always will be a big fan of the Alien series. Alien is a very sensitive movie, introducing a then maybe unheard range of terror. Aliens for me was a climax as the claustrophobic situation amounts to a ""best nightmare ever"" scenario and the pace and idea of the original movie is very well followed. Dark, rather slow, characters mostly carefully chosen, presented and evolved. Aliens 3 was somewhat of a necessity to close the thought, to kill the beast, to end it for the viewer and Ripley. Even though a little less fascinating it was still colour- , sound-wise as well as felling-wise in the range and did do the job. And now this. I understand the interest to continue a winning story, but it has to be done in a decent way that does not damage an excellent series. Alien: Resurrection would do exactly this, if you counted it. But it should not. The biggest surprise is the introduction how Ripley and the alien inside can live as she was burned in Alien 3. It is the most uninventive explanation, cloning. Well, cloning from blood samples might once become possible, but the alien queen in her chest is actually depicted in her genetic information? Really? So this starts a reign of horror concerning ideas how to make a movie that does not really need to be made. The characters are flat, simple, the dialogues are atrocious most of the time. The pace of the movie is so much quicker and uneven that you feel put into an splatter action B movie. Yes the pictures are nicely done in some scenes, but this does not help a lot, as dumb and uninteresting people are getting killed and you really don't give a damn about it. If there was not Sigourney Weaver, who sometimes herself seems disgusted by the sentences she has to speak, the movie would deserve less than my 3 stars. She holds up her acting in what could be a very interesting character, changed from the first 3 movies. But this potential subsides in very little genius of developing something. On the whole, if you like the series, it might not be a good idea to watch it, you might be disappointed.",Alien - Resurrection
571,Brujerizmo,Not without it's flaws *spoiler*,6,6 August 2004,"Let's get the obvious out of the way - this film had nothing on either Alien or Aliens. Having said that, it is still enjoyable, and much better than Alien 3.On the negative side, the script contains many flaws, and I personally feel the ending was somewhat out of place. Yet Alien: Resurrection is a very captivating film to watch, for one main reason. Due to it being a Jean-Pierre Jeunet flick, the film is packed full of unique and unusual visual ideas (the 'Viper Pit' scene stands out somewhat), and the film as a whole has a brooding, creepy atmosphere.In terms of content and pace, it falls somewhere between the dark, eerie atmospherics of Alien, and the action-heavy bravado of Aliens.Actors Ron Perlman, Michael Wincott and Sigourney Weaver are outstanding. However, I feel that Brad Dourif should have had a much bigger role. But hey, we can't win 'em all, can we?Overall, despite it's flaws, it's still a good all-round film. 6/10",Alien - Resurrection

573,theogb,Surprisingly good if you're a fan of Buffy...and you realise this is a black comedy,7,29 August 2005,"Personally I put the third Alien film at the bottom of the franchise. On a recent re-watch from the Quadrilogy I realised that it's really quite a decent film but my problem is that it provides nothing to the franchise that Alien didn't already do.Comparatively, while 'Resurrection' isn't a fantastic film in its own right, it is a different sort of film to the others by virtue of being a darkly ironic comedy. The set-up alone is preposterous (to do with cloning and memory-containing DNA) and drives the whole film to be of a different level.Joss Whedon has disowned his script...which is a shame because it smells strongly of his style: We have characters who are sharply defined and somewhat comic book in style, and they are quick to throw out humorous one-liners. Moreover, the sort of tensions between them are the same that we saw in the original Alien film and it adds a little to the feel.There are definitely some terrible aspects to this film: the final act is hampered by some bad SFX and the typical Hollywood thing of ""Okay, everything's got to be BIGGER this time!"" but even so, this film has never deserved the slating it always received and as a fourth film in a series it's certainly winning out by far against crap like Jaws: The Revenge, The Phantom Menace, Police Academy 4 and Superman IV...",Alien - Resurrection
574,dark_one71,Mostly Tolerable except...,6,8 October 2006,"I'd say that this movie was alright. Not great, not terrible, just alright. I try to keep an unbiased opinion and will first do a little compare and contrast.Alien: A suspenseful horror that has you enthralled through most of it.Aliens: A bit more overt action oriented, but still enthralls you in the scenes where the marines are being sieged by the aliens and eventually manage to escape. (not to mention a few others).Alien 3: A hashed together reason for a crash landing but otherwise well done character development and interaction. Dialogue was alright and was an 8 out of 10.Alien 'R': Good setup, makes you scratch your head and brings you in. But once it has you it is fairly shallow. The dialogue is the bare minimum required to progress things along between actions scenes for the most part. (all in all this seemed like it was half-finished).Now here go the big moments that just glared as ridiculous and that I couldn't ignore at all. I don't care what your excuse is... this just doesn't make sense. (these won't be chronological, just what comes to mind first).Scene 1: Post underwater swimming they begin climbing the ladder shortly after losing Frank's main squeeze. Christie is carrying their crippled friend on his back when ""Oh no!"" the alien climbing the ladder grabs a hold of his foot. In an effort to take him down Johner lets out a barrage and finally kills the thing. Weakened from the swimming and the acid in his eyes, temporarily (or permanently?) blinding him Christie is weakly there being held on the ladder by his passenger. In an unfathomably stupid writing, Christie dies by valiantly sacrificing himself... The way that alien was dangling... all he had to do was shake his foot. Just a little jiggle and away it would go. But no, he drops himself down into the water into what should have been him shortly pulling himself back up... Last time I checked acid burns didn't kill you.Scene 2: The simple fact that when cloned ripley somehow has a foreign creature inside of her... Last time I checked DNA doesn't contain a parasites details in it... It isn't like copy and pasting something, only the original organism gets copied over. Unless the fact that the face hugger's alter the hosts DNA when they impregnate them was omitted from the last three movies.Scene 3: With seemingly no motivation besides, just because, the sociopathic Dr. Wren does his best to screw over the mercenaries. Even going so far as to betray them for no reason other than ""Hey look! I'm evil!"".Scene 4: When the Origomo (sp?) crashes into the earth it seemingly was large enough and contained enough force when detonating to take out Africa as a whole. The majestic sunset scene of a peaceful sky greeting them when there'd already be atmospheric consequences occurring everywhere.My final and biggest criticism. The whiny humanitarian android lives, the bad-ass ""Ripley"" lives (though that's expected), the crippled guy lives (though he's plucky and neat so expected), and the misogynistic asshole lives? Not the captain... or his girlfriend... or the almost meditative trick shot Christie? Hell I would've settle on The random security guy joining up with them over Winona Ryder's character.",Alien - Resurrection
575,bbepr,Ryder helps a lot!,10,11 February 2005,"Winona Ryder helps this film a lot I think. I know that Call could have been played by many others, but I think Winona's performance in the film is truly magical, cause she created a person who is both whimsical and innocent at the same time. Thanks to her acting we have another main character. It helps Weaver, who does't have to act like she was the only really interesting character in the film (I think the same thing was made by Ian Holm and John Hurt in Alien). Ryder was to be a robot and she really looked that way - notice that there is no sweat and such things (ok I know it depends on makeup, but anyway - she did her part really good).",Alien - Resurrection

Scott, Cameron and Fincher all gave unique glances into the future and the story of Ellen Ripley. There was only one curse that followed these films, they made money. So a fourth installment had to be made, seemingly for that purpose alone. The plot is set several hundred years after ""Alien 3"" where military scientists have cloned Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) along with the alien queen inside of her. They then proceed to breed the aliens until everything goes nuts and they escape. The plot....pretty much ends there. There's no real story in this film. Each of the others had strong, different stories being told throughout the mayhem and blood. This is purely a money-maker film. Flashy special effects and some pretty nice violent scenes simply cannot save the film from its failure to let you identify with even one character in the film. Since Ripley is a clone, her story has changed because she's no longer human. The filmmakers hope was that the sci-fi action and gore would be enough to carry the film for 2 hours. They were wrong. Its no fun seeing the aliens up-close all the time. There's no mystery to it, nothing to scare you. The essentially become another 'Jason' or 'Michael Myers'. But, for die-hard ""Alien"" fans, this film could be interesting simply if you want to see new stuff they can do with the Aliens in terms of special effects. Other than that, do what I did and consider "" Alien 3"" the ending of the story and completely forget this film exists. Kind of like ""Halloween: Resurrection"".",Alien - Resurrection
578,johndaly-1,I really liked it,9,17 August 2006,"I thought this was a wonderful movie, the feel of the movie was very consistent, and the story was really good. If you look at in the light of being a spoof, and take it as lightheartedly poking fun at the series it is part of and the genre in which it belongs, it is really quite funny. I laugh every time I see it. Some of the action sequences were really good, the underwater one comes to mind. There are multiple endings available - the box set with all the Alien movies has both, I think it is the director's cut. The characters are fairly well developed, diverse, and interesting. They interact well and are a big part of what makes the movie so good. There are a couple parts that are a little weak, but they are short and don't detract too much from the movie. And it very funny that it is directed by the director of Amelie.",Alien - Resurrection
579,theresamooninthesky,A film from a Belgian Artiste,5,5 May 2005,"I don't really think of this as the fourth installation of the Alien series. I think of it more of a ""Hey, Hollywood came up with a film with an unthinkably horrible plot and handed it off to a famous Belgian director who can make anything look good."" That being said, Jean-Pierre Jeunet did with it what he could. There wasn't much to do to it, but at least he made it look pretty! And, of course, there's Dominique Pinon, who has been in every single film by Jeunet that I've ever seen.I thought the Alien series was great, but it had a good closer with Alien3. If you like French films by artistic directors, and you want to see what directors do when given an American-action-movie palette to paint with, then watch this flick. Otherwise, pass Alien: Resurrection by.",Alien - Resurrection
580,Rulke_the_Great_Betrayer,I don't understand how this was made...,2,13 July 2014,"""Resurrection"" is by far the worst film in the main Alien franchise. To put it bluntly it is filled with sub par acting, a lackluster story and incredibly uninteresting characters - not to mention the fact that it's a disgrace to the other entries in the series. The film even suffers aesthetically, and not just in comparison to the other Alien films, at some points it looks flat out ugly. Even the ending is highly derivative of the first two films.When watching Alien 3, a movie I wouldn't necessarily call good, I kept thinking to myself that I was watching a movie that could have been. When watching Resurrection I kept thinking to myself that I was watching a movie that should never have been.2/10",Alien - Resurrection
581,daniel-feld76,"simply made in the wrong year, achieved what giger would have wanted",8,2 January 2015,"I think this film just had the bad luck of being made a few years too early. I think the biggest draw back to this film was the use of CG which was still very much in its infancy. When you look at the story, and the writing this film is right up there with the rest of the films and seeing how the Alien DNA changes to creating something totally different actually gives a bit nod to the eventual Prometheus movie. On a different subject... Giger... I think this director captured Giger's true vision for how these creatures act... its a slightly erotic form of extraterrestrial violence that Giger illustrated in a large number of his works. And come on... Ron Perlman was f-ing amazing in this film. In the end I must urge you all to look at this film in context of all the films trying to use CG at the time. It wasn't quite ready for the big screen on the level that Jean-Pierre Jeunet was really hoping for. When you are able to cut this movie a little slack for not living up to 2010's special effects standards you'll be able to concentrate on the great story, the great directing, and the great characters.",Alien - Resurrection
582,redlenses-89347,Worst excuse for a movie ever.,1,14 March 2015,"Long time fan of the Alien universe; that being said - Biggest piece of crap in the franchise and that includes both AVP films although Requiem is 2nd biggest piece of crap. Joss Whedon should have stuck to Buffy. Too bad his ridiculous demon of the week episode style found its way into an Alien film. Awful doesn't begin to cover it. Horrible B version of an Alien story with some awful over acting and bad special effects in the way of goopy green slime for Alien blood instead of watery acid as was introduced to us in 1979. Not scary or creepy at all. More like a bad comic book story with bad Alien effects imagery to match. Yes, Alien 3 left something to be desired somewhat in the way of plot but at least it tried to stay true to the franchise in the general feel of the Alien universe.",Alien - Resurrection
583,mad_monkey-56349,Terrible film!,4,4 July 2021,"I watched the directors cut and Jean-Pierre in the intro said he was happy with the film released in cinema! Wow, that was a opportunity missies not to fix this film. I can't believe they thought this was a good idea especially when you consider how good the previous films are, I genuinely can't think of a good thing about the whole film.",Alien - Resurrection
584,Josh-is-not-you,Don't think of it as an Alien film,6,9 March 2006,"Don't think of Alien Resurrection as an Alien film, but rather a Joss Whedon film. Yes it's different. But the others are separate types of movies also. Alien is a creepy monster thriller. Aliens is an action movie. Alien3 is a goth nightmare gone wrong. Alien Resurrection is a Whedon film. Me being a big fan of Firefly/Serenity and his Astonishing X-Men comic book series loved this film dearly. Yes it may require some thinking to understand, due to the cloning and cross-breeding stuff. But it isn't bad to have Hollywood make you think with an action/horror movie. If you think of this a different kind of movie I think you'll enjoy it like I did. But if you are looking for the same kind of movie a before you might a well pass this one.",Alien - Resurrection
585,paolotedesco,Don' t think of it as a film,2,11 June 2021,"Don't think of Alien Resurrection as a film, but rather a pile of unwatchable garbage.The plot makes no sense, everybody is acting at their worst, there is no tension at all and is actually boring to watch.I don't know how this franchise could go so much down the drain.",Alien - Resurrection
586,blakeindisguise,Close your eyes and pray for it to be over,1,3 November 2016,"Being a huge Alien fan I've forced my self to sit through all their films from the Vs Predator, and 3. And now comes i guess the 4th. I'm going to keep this short for anyone reading. If i paid to see this in a theater i would have walked out, and I've never had that thought occur to me in all the films I've seen. And when me and my brother chose this for our honorary crappy movie night. Upon this night it would also be our first crappy movie night that we went to bed early and never finished. If you ever see this appear on your guide, do the same. The extra sleep will benefit yourself much more.And for anyone whose still reading the acting, script, and lord have mercy on the camera angles. I'f the film was pitch black and just speech was heard throughout it may have benefited. The angles range from ugly annoying generic panned and zooming out shots to put emphasis on a generally annoying actor that you also do not care for or like, thanks to the script.",Alien - Resurrection
587,hydesmith,Not great but still has its place in the series,7,14 May 2006,The first 2 Alien films have gone down in history as two of the best horror/thrillers ever so the final 2 sequels had a lot to live up to. Alien Resurrection was seen in a negative context from the start as it was seen as near ridiculous the main character should come back to life. This often turns out to be the film's main weakness. Ripley in Alien 4 is far from the hero we know and love. I should say now that to do the last 2 films justice you should buy the DVD set and watch the special edition cuts. The special cut features some scenes which really strengthen the plot and Ripley character (e.g. Ripley talks about her memories of Newt from the second film). Alien Resurrection is probably the weakest of the series although it has its moments where it beautifully displays the spirit and atmosphere that Alien is all about (e.gg the cloning lab) unfortunately the characterisation and dialogue are too weak to do these moments justice.,Alien - Resurrection
588,tedsunsayng,Continuing Fox's gross mismanagement of the Aliens franchise,7,8 January 2006,"If anyone has a doubt as to the influence and appeal of the first two movies in the Aliens franchise, just check out some of the merchandise selling like crazy 20 years after Aliens. The first movie, Alien, set up a working class future (as an acknowledged forerunner of cyberpunk)and a legitimately disturbing monster and set designs. The second film introduced the hugely popular Colonial Marines and their realistic technology and weaponry. The story line of Aliens also earned the the genuine affections of audiences for the characters Hicks, Bishop and Newt. Then comes Alien 3. During the opening credits Hicks and Newt are killed, showing Fox's tremendous disrespect for the fan base of this franchise. After the sting of disappointment wears off, Alien 3 otherwise proves to be a nicely Gothic film with attractive visuals, but lacking the thrill of either of its predecessors. As for Alien Resurrection: from the moment the credits roll over disgusting scenes of roiling flesh, bone, teeth and eyes, we know that all the dignity and intellect of the initial trilogy is gone. Joss Whedon's cloning storyline is absurd, and mature sensibilities will certainly be offended by scenes of both the non-viable clones and the death of the new creature. Ultimately, the mismanagement of this franchise comes down to Sigourney Weaver. Yes, we love her as an actress, and we love Ripley, but if you want to continue to play a role, don't approve a script that kills your character. The success of Alien vs Predator shows that Ripley is simply not necessary for the success of this franchise. And Winona Ryder's synthetic Call is trebly expendable. Unfortunately, the buzz on future films indicates that Fox is sold on both Weaver and Ryder. For die hard fans, lets pray that the buzz on Ridley Scott's and James Cameron's future involvement is true.",Alien - Resurrection
589,rahul_grvr19,awesome!,8,18 August 2006,"well...majority of the comments are contradictory and present a very negative image of the movie. but my comment proves to be otherwise. i have always loved alien movies..and esp. sigourney weaver..for her amazing acting prowess. it will sound weird..but i also liked alien 3(which was hated by almost everyone).i liked it for its intensity and depth. coming to alien resurrection..its very different from the previous ones. alien and aliens... were the defining aspects of the alien creature..but this one presents the foul results and its exploitation. of course..the visual effects are amazing..there are also new alien characters like the baby alien- the hybrid of human and alien species.. no doubt, it looks awful and horrifying. but thats what it has to do. the story is amazing. the acting..is as usual extraordinary..by sigourney..and winona ryder was a surprise. she was refreshing. even perlman..looked cool. overall a worth watching experience. the additional new aspects as ripley's relationship to the aliens and the alien intelligence and their capability to swim...prove to be a new dimension to the movie..which makes it special. finally reaching earth...also gives a refreshing end. no wonder...alien 5 comes into picture soon.i think it will be welcomed...with sigourney again playing the lead. a must buy for all DVD collectors.( i have done it already).",Alien - Resurrection
590,Contender79,A wholly pointless sequel,3,28 October 2007,"Unlike some Alien fans, I was gripped by Alien3. I found it to be a very worthy and successful return to the claustrophobic low-tech horror feel of the first, classic Ridley Scott film. It was also an appropriate and dignified end to the series, I thought and to Ripley's character in particular.And so we thought the beast had been destroyed.I guess the money-men and suits in Hollywood did not agree.Sigourney Weaver must have been paid a hell of a lot to appear in this rubbish.When I heard there was to be a sequel with Ridley ""resurrected"", I thought that surely this was an empty cash-in on a great idea, dragged out beyond its natural course.As a great fan of the first three films of this series, the fourth in the franchise seemed redundant, unnecessary and quite frankly stupid and unappealing with stock characters and really inappropriate and distracting 'humour'. This was a long long way from the dark, intense Gothic masterpiece of the first in the saga. This was a cartoon of a crude kind, barren of ideas. A facsimile of a facsimile of a great idea.It added nothing to the already distinguished heritage of the series, and to my mind devolved an intriguing frightening sci-fi legend into the sort of B-movie cheesy nonsense that Alien could have been had not Ridley Scott and his team got their hands on Dan O'Bannon's original script.A backward step in all areas of film making.A sorry and shoddy end end to a great film franchise.One to miss of you love great films and the Alien legend.",Alien - Resurrection
