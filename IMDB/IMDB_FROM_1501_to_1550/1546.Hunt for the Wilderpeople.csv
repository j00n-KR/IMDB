0,MartinHafer,Worth the hunt....,9,13 October 2016,"""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" is a marvelous new movie from New Zealand and it sure makes you want to see more from writer/director Taika Wiatiti. It's a sweet and enjoyable film from start to finish and the young star of the film and veteran Sam Neill are a joy to watch together throughout the movie.When the film begins, a very strange social worker, Paula, brings Ricky (Julian Dennison) to live in yet another foster home. The kid is angry and a mess and yet somehow Bella makes the boy feel loved and all is well...until Bella soon unexpectedly drops dead. Her husband, Hec (Sam Neill), isn't thrilled with keeping the kid and has every intention of returning the kid to Paula. However, before he can do this, the kid disappears...off to live the 'thug life' in the New Zealand bush! As for Hec, he makes the fateful mistake of following after the boy. Why is this so bad? Well, after finding Ricky, Hec falls and shatters his leg and they are now in the middle of nowhere and are forced to camp out and live off the land. In the meantime, Paula alerts the police and soon there's a nationwide dragnet to find the boy...and folks all believe Hec is some sicko who's kidnapped the kid! So, when they finally return, they are nearly killed by angry idiots and they are forced, once again, to return to the countryside. What will ever happen with this oddly mismatched pair?!If the plot sounds familiar, it's actually very much like a live action version of ""Up""...with a few changes of course. There's the dead wife, the grouchy old man, the needy kid and their eventual search for a supposedly extinct bird...all familiar ""Up"" elements. But it works as well because there are some lovely differences...and instead of schmaltz and sentiment, the film relies on the kid being a cute little budding sociopath as well as some wonderful dialog by all the characters. Well worth seeing, lots of fun and a great look one of the most beautiful countries I have ever visited. Additionally, in Hunt for the Wilderpeople, look for the director in a bit part as the minister performing Bella's funeral...it's a very strange and funny scene.Incidentally, if you enjoy this film, there are a few other great Kiwi films I strongly could recommend, such as ""Once Were Warriors"" and ""Whale Rider"". All three are excellent family films, though ""Once Were Warriors"" is definitely for an older and more adult audience (no pre-teens for this one).",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
1,Leofwine_draca,Pleasingly quirky,7,17 July 2020,"Kiwi director Taika Waititi can be something of an acquired taste; so far I've loved one of his films (THOR: RAGNAROK) but pretty much hated another (WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS). Thankfully HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE is far more like the former than the latter; it's a fun adventure-style movie that boasts an effectively small scale and some wonderfully endearing characters who bring the story to life very well, particularly Julian Dennison who gives a stand-out turn as the child lead. Sam Neill excels as the grizzled straight man while the jokes come thick and fast and a high proportion of them hit home. What's not to love?",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
2,SnoopyStyle,funny dark indie,7,26 February 2017,Child welfare services officer Paula Hall sees foster kid Ricky Baker as a troublemaker. Auntie Bella takes him in and quickly wins him over. Her husband Hector Faulkner (Sam Neill) is a gruff woodsman. Bella unexpectedly dies and Paula Hall is coming to take Ricky back. Ricky accidentally burns down the shed and runs away. Hec hurts his foot after finding Ricky lost in the woods. Paula rings the alarm as the police fears Ricky has been taken by Hec. It becomes a large manhunt in the wilds of New Zealand. Ricky calls themselves the Wilderpeople after the wildebeests who migrate long distances.I like the kid despite his sometimes inexplicable bratty behavior. He and Sam Neill have good chemistry. The character Paula Hall does bug me at times. She's trying to be comedic but she's also off-putting even considering she's a villain. There is a joy about the humor that feels real. The kid and Sam deserve a lot of praise.,Hunt for the Wilderpeople
3,nogodnomasters,This ain't no foster kid child,10,28 August 2017,"Ricky Baker (Julian Dennison) is an unruly foster child who ""spits"" among other things. He is taken in by the Faulkners, Bella (Rima Te Wiata) being a collector of stray dogs and such. Her husband Hec (Sam Neill) is not keen on the boy. Ricky develops a love and admiration for very independent Bella. After her death, child services ""no child left behind"" comes to take Ricky back. Ricky takes off into the woods, Hec tracks him down. Through a number of circumstances they are gone for a long time and a bounty is put out on them. They encounter some characters along the way, including the under used Psycho Sam (Rhys Darby) who wears a colander to prevent the government from stealing his thoughts.The characters were all great and likable, even the ""bad"" guys. The dialogue was superb with old film references. Worth going out of your way to watch it.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. Talk of child molesting.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
4,kosmasp,What we do in the ... mountains,10,18 June 2017,"So after the faux-reality TV soap slash documentary about vampires, we get real. Well still weirdly funny and exaggerated, but still closer to reality then the previous film entry. One thing is for sure: The casting department did their job well. The kid is phenomenal. To play off Sam Neil like that? Respect is due to him.But it also has a tight script and if you liked the other mentioned movie, you will very likely go for the humor in this one too. It's not PC and it may bother some people who are easily offended. That being said, it doesn't mean it has no heart. Quite the opposite is the case, I'd argue it has a lot of heart. And you may feel emotional during this ride/trip the movie takes you (no pun intended) ... don't be ashamed! It's a good thing ...",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
5,gavin6942,Taika Waitit's Best Work Yet,8,19 July 2016,"A national manhunt is ordered for a rebellious kid (Julian Dennison) and his foster uncle (Sam Neill) who go missing in the wild New Zealand bush.Director Taika Waititi has been on quite a role, moving up in the world one big step at a time. ""Wilderpeople"" is his fourth film to premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, after ""Eagle Vs Shark"", ""Boy"" and ""What We Do in the Shadows"", which have all opened to critical acclaim. ""Boy"" was nominated for an Oscar, and ""Shadows"" is already considered one of the top genre films of the 21st century.The New Zealand film industry in general has skyrocketed since Peter Jackson turned his lens on the landscape for ""Lord of the Rings"". (Of course, horror fans knew who he was well before that.) From the opening scene, ""Wilderpeople"" takes full advantage of this same landscape made famous by the world of elves and dwarfs. In fact, with the bulk taking place in the lush woods, this may be the best unintentional travel advertisement the country has seen yet.Seeing Waititi's name piqued my interest in the film, but before I even noticed him, I saw the name of Sam Neill. And I asked myself: Has Sam Neill ever appeared in a bad film? Well, of course, he probably has, but none quickly come to mind, and I am pleased to announce his portrayal of Uncle Hector in this movie can be added to his long list of successful roles. He has apparently now reached the point in his career where he can play the grizzled old man (who mistakenly is thought to be a kidnapper and possible pervert). Though all the actors do a fine job, Neill adds a level of gravitas to the production.What makes this such an enjoyable film is that the subject matter is handled in the most light-hearted way. The main character has a background in juvenile delinquency, including setting fires and spraying graffiti, but we never see him as a bad kid. The duo is pursued relentlessly by the police and an exaggeratedly-cruel social worker, but even here there is no threat of danger perceived by the audience. ""I'm the Terminator, and you're Sarah Connor,"" she says, painting an amusing image (and clearly indicating that she knows she is the villain, even if only subconsciously).""It's just like Laurel and Hardy in the wilderness,"" Waititi says. ""I just thought it would be very funny for a kid who's obsessed with Tupac and being a tough kid on the streets of the city to be thrown out into the harsh realities of the New Zealand winter."" Now, the Laurel and Hardy comparison is not quite right, because our heroes are not nearly as helpless or bumbling. But they are an odd couple, to be sure, and are not immediately all that interested in the other's well-being.The real humor comes not from the two leads, but rather the cast of characters they run into. There is Psycho Sam (Rhys Darby), who is not the slightest bit crazy but deeply wishes that he were a local legend. And one highlight comes in the form of a preacher who sermonizes that there is a door that leads to Coke Zero and Doritos but to get to Jesus you need to enter a second door. ""Jesus is tricky like that,"" he deadpans. The preacher is played by none other than Waititi himself.This is Waititi's best work yet. And he is already moving on to even bigger things: directing Marvel's next ""Thor"" movie, which may bring some fresh air to the weakest of the Marvel franchises. ""Hunt For the Wilderpeople"" had premieres at Sundance and Fantasia, and I suspect will receive a wide release in the fall of 2016.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
6,lee_eisenberg,call of the wild,10,28 November 2016,"""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" is the first Taika Waititi movie that I've seen, and I'm impressed. This look at a Maori boy and his adoptive white father who go on the run in rural New Zealand is at once a look at the status of the Maoris and a look at New Zealand's landscape. One might interpret the characters' period in the wilderness as a way for the boy to connect to his heritage more (it certainly helps him bond with the adoptive father).It's a really good movie. A particularly funny sequence is when Ricky and Hector stay with the man living off the grid (the next sequence seemed like a cross between ""Mad Max"" and ""Thelma and Louise""). A fun time, but also a socially conscious one. This is one movie that deserves a lot of recognition. I hope that Taika Waititi makes more movies like this.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
7,Quinoa1984,a unique (in the correct sense of the word) comic discovery!,9,21 November 2016,"Hunt for the Wilderpeople, about a 13 year old runt who thinks he's a gangster (or, actually, uses other slang words for it that few of us will actually understand) and, not wanting to go back to foster care and likely Juvenile Prison after his foster mother dies suddenly (also Sam Neill's character Faulkner's wife) and runs away into the New Zealand 'bush'/woods, with this old man following along to make sure he isn't eaten alive or whatnot and a manhunt via Child Protective Services and a damn swat team, reminds me... movies need more Sam Neill paired with good kid actors.And actually this one, Julian Dennison, is so good at making this character both a laugh riot and a genuinely feeling human being and not someone who is a total caricature (only sometimes), makes it for this not too arguably featuring the better kid than Jurassic Park. Writer/director Taika Waititi (his name even sounds like an unlikely cocktail) is pretty easily the best director NZ has given the world since Peter Jackson.This is a film loaded with boundless visual and creative imagination, and tone that shows a distinct voice - if you saw What We Do in the Shadows, his spoof on vampire cinematic lore and reality shows, that was seeing one side of his talents (also as an actor), and this shows that he has an ambitious reach into showing dynamic, three-dimensional characters and a story that keeps the comedy going, usually in ways that make the filmmaking *itself* funny (it wouldn't surprise me to find out, for example, Edgar Wright's a fan of this), while never losing a strong dramatic and even tragic backbone. The stakes in here counts, and we believe in the world, so the comedy comes from part of a reaction to the madness that comes.Really the only thing keeping this wholly charming and frequently wall-shattering-from-the-vibrations-from-my-laughter funny comedy from quite the masterpiece height of WWDITS is that the Child Welfare character, Rachel House I think (while certainly given her all) is too one-note, which wouldn't be an issue if Faulkner and Baker weren't so developed so well.A truly unique vision that is not shy of getting grandiose with its visual technical sweep or for bringing an eclectic soundtrack that could be my favorite of the year, its one more notch in the quality belt for a filmmaker now tasked with...... Thor 3..... Uh, sure, why the hell not? Get some comic humanity with those Gods!",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
8,grantss,Slow start but good once it gets going,7,12 November 2017,"Bella and Hector, two reclusive country folk, become foster parents to Ricky, a problem child from the city. After some adjustment, things go reasonably well. However, the death of Bella means Hector now has to look after Ricky, and they didn't get along too well. Moreover, her death causes Child Services to decide to send Ricky back to the orphanage. Ricky refuses to go back and runs away, ultimately sparking a national manhunt for him and Hector.Sweet, funny movie, written and directed by Taika Waititi who wrote and directed the superb vampire-comedy, What We Do In The Shadows (plus, more recently, directed Thor: Ragnarok). Starts slowly, with only a smattering of humour and limited engagement. However, from a point it ramps up. The humour comes thicker and faster, you start to root for the characters and the plot becomes quite interesting. Some great scenes - the ones involving Psycho Sam (Rhys Darby) being the pick of the bunch.Overall, not too powerful nor poignant, but very funny, interesting and full of heart.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
9,neil-476,Delightful from start to finish,10,20 April 2017,"Mildly delinquent 12 year old urban Maori fat kid Ricky has been in juvenile care all his life. His social worker places him with Bella, who lives with surly husband Hec, miles out beyond the back of beyond. Ricky tries running away, but there's nowhere to run to. And gradually, Bella's sheer joie de vivre begins to win him over. Then Bella drops dead, devastating both Hec and Ricky. Ricky will have to go back into care, so he runs away into the Bush. Hec pursues him and, on finding him, breaks his ankle and can't move: the two are stuck in position for some weeks. And everyone assumes that taciturn loner Hec....This is a small film, mostly a two-hander, treading a moderately well-trodden path (see also Up). Julian Dennison is a joy as the tubby Ricky, both streetwise and naïve. And the heavily bearded Hec, looking and sounding like Hugo Weaving is played by Sam Neill. And it's a revelation. The part is miles away from anything he's done before, and he is terrific.The film is funny, suspenseful, heart-warming, sad, and beautiful to look at.Heartily recommended.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
10,evanston_dad,Feels Like a Wes Anderson Knock Off,7,12 October 2016,"A young boy is fostered out to a New Zealand couple and then takes off into the wilderness with his foster father when the mother dies and the system demands that he be sent to a new home. The authorities with the help of some irksome locals begin a manhunt to bring the boy back.""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" has its heart in the right place, and there are some genuinely funny moments in it, but it ultimately is just a little too aware of its own cleverness for my taste. Director Taika Waititi clearly owes a debt to Wes Anderson, as his film tries to capture the same sprightly whimsy that Anderson has practically trademarked. But that Anderson tone requires a delicate balance to maintain, and Anderson doesn't even always get it right. Waititi always feels like he's imitating rather than speaking through his own directorial voice.Grade: B",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
11,ferguson-6,Uncle Hec and Ricky for the win,8,23 June 2016,"Oak Cliff Film Festival 2016 Greetings again from the darkness. It just doesn't seem very many movies are designed to be funny to a wide range of viewers. There are raunchy comedies for taboo lovers. There are comedies for young kids. There are even Nicolas Cage movies for unintentional laughs. But writer/director Taika Waititi actually delivers a thoroughly entertaining movie that will generate laughs across multiple generations  it's quite simply, a fun time at the theatre.It's based on the 1986 book ""Wild Pork and Watercress"" by Barry Crump, who himself is a bit of a legendary figure in New Zealand. The film begins with Child Protective Services (or whatever it's called in New Zealand) dropping off 12 year old Ricky Baker to his new foster family. Paula, the CPS agent, considers Ricky a lost cause and describes him as ""a very bad egg"" as she rattles off his list of previous rebellions to new foster mom Bella, who takes note of Ricky's heft with a couple of wisecracks – delivered with a well-meaning smile.In a terrific screen introduction, ""Uncle"" Hec slowly comes into frame flashing a world class scowl and a wild boar slung over his shoulder. Ricky continues his habit of running away at night, but Bella slowly wins him over with her kindness, understanding and breakfast offerings. A tragic occurrence and fear of being shipped back to the juvenile center, has Ricky disappearing into the New Zealand bush. Soon enough Hec catches up and the two begin a relationship that is the core of the film.Rima Te Wiata plays Bella as a perpetually optimistic woman with a sincere drive to help Ricky adjust and find some joy in life. Sam Neill plays Hec in full grumpy curmudgeon mode  a nice compliment to the extraordinary presence of Julian Dennison (Paper Planes) as Ricky. Ricky and Hec together are a hoot to watch. It's not simply the generational differences, but also a clash of one man who wants little more than to be left alone and a young boy who wants little more than to be noticed and cared about. It's not so much the direction of their relationship that surprises, but rather the manner in which it develops.Director Waititi's next film is Thor: Ragnarok, so this makes us appreciate even more his pleasant little indie film that features not just colorful and interesting characters, but the beautiful landscape of the New Zealand bush  much of which we see during the humorous manhunt for Hec and Ricky. It's a farcical comedy with a dose of profundity and loads of adventure for two social misfits. Rachel House is pretty funny as the obsessed CPS worker, and Rhys Darby (""Flight of the Conchords"") is downright hilarious as Psycho Sam. Watching criminial-wannabe Ricky literally count off his Haiku, leaves little doubt as to why this one has been such an ""audience favorite"" at multiple film festivals.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
12,FlashCallahan,"You're more like Sarah Connor, from the first movie.....",9,14 September 2016,"Ricky Baker (Dennison), a defiant young city kid, is sent by child welfare services to live in the country with foster parents,whom he calls Aunt Bella and Uncle Hec. When Bella passes away and child services decide to take Ricky back to a care home, Ricky runs away into the bush with Uncle Hec in pursuit. Child services arrive to find the house empty, and come to the conclusion a bereaved and mentally unstable Hec has abducted Ricky. A national manhunt ensues, and the two have to get over their differences to survive.....When we first meet the wonderful Neill as Hec, you would be forgiven that this was another one of those films where a grumpy old man hates the ne'er do well child at first, but gradually begins to like him, and they build a bond which will make them metaphorical father and son come the end.The type of film that Sean Connery and Kirk Douglas made in their wilderness years.Now this follows the same arc, but it steers clear of all the sickly sweet tropes, and the obligatory speech one of them has at the end regarding life lessons and how they're adventure together has opened their eyes to the good in life.This is simply a wonderful tale of two lost souls who get lost, and eventually find the most bizarre and hilarious people, who in turn, subliminally teach them that all isn't lost, we are all different, and we learn to cope.Dennison, pardon the tired expression, is a revelation as Ricky, who, no matter what he's done in the past, is just someone that humanity forgot about and turned its back on.But again, unlike other, similar movies, Ricky is a pleasant character all the way through the film, and the banter between him and Hec is beautifully whimsical, especially when they are talking about the career of that of being a 'gangster'.There are some really standout scenes, if there is a funnier funeral scene in a film, I've yet to see it, and the locations and cinematography only add to the films charm.It's a shame that films like this go pretty much unseen at cinemas, thanks to soulless big budget films, deprive potential viewers from a thing of beauty.Highly recommended.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
13,trashgang,could be a Disney flick,7,12 January 2018,"This is fun to see, it has an overall Disney atmosphere, you know, rebel kid coming to foster parents, the woman loves him, the man hates him, woman dies, and off they go, man and kid for an adventure.The brutality people talking about is when animals are involved. They are killed in a savage way. I guess that youngster could even watch this because it all works out fine towards the end. Siometimes it goes a bit over the top with the army involved.Also some nice shots of the bush in New zealand.

Well then, to our luck, 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople' is one such film, that does exactly that. Funny, Touching & Charming, Taika Waititi delivers a Delightful Adventure Comedy-Drama, that is anchored with mesmerizing performances by Sam Neill & Julian Dennison.'Hunt for the Wilderpeople' Synopsis: A national manhunt is ordered for a rebellious kid and his foster uncle who go missing in the wild New Zealand bush.'Hunt for the Wilderpeople' is about freedom, love, adventure & ultimately, friendship. Though one might take the relationship between its central characters as father-son, this is actually a story on friendship in the wilderness. Taika Waititi's Screenplay, which is based on the book Wild Pork and Watercress by Barry Crump, is funny & filled with charm. The narrative is strongly constructed, offering moments of hilarity, amusement & sheer warmth. I was enthralled by the journey of these two unlikely men. Taika Waititi's Direction, on other-hand, is excellent. This man has a vision & we shouldn't expect anything lesser but madness from Thor: Ragnarok (his upcoming film). Cinematography captures the wilderness & the emotions of its characters, magnificently. Editing is razor-crisp. Art & Costume Design are top-notch. Music by Various Artists, is wonderful.Performance-Wise: Sam Neill and Julian Dennison are mesmerizing. Its such a pleasure to watch Neill in such great form after a hiatus. The veteran sinks his teeth into the part & brings it out with flying colors. This is his most effective performance in years. Julian Dennison is a miracle. He chews on the scenery & stands tall against Neill, never getting lost in the middle of a mighty veteran. He's absolutely terrific & creates an adorable character. I wouldn't be surprised if both of these scene-stealing performances get recognition in the awards-circuit next year. Of the supporting cast, Rima Te Wiata & Rachel House leave a strong impression.On the whole, make time for 'Hunt for the Wilderpoeple'. Its completely worth it!",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
15,lasttimeisaw,A massive crowd-pleaser in the international festival circuit from Kiwi country,7,21 November 2016,"A massive crowd-pleaser in the international festival circuit from Kiwi country, Taika Waititi's fourth feature has already become the top grossing New Zealand film ever, and Waititi himself has been propitiously recruited by Hollywood to run the show of the upcoming MCU tent-pole THOR: RAGNAROK. HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE taps into the universally viable prescription of an odd-pair adventure, a tubby juvenile delinquent Ricky Baker (Dennison) is sent to a new foster home in a rustic land by child welfare services, he is welcome by the heart-of-gold Maori woman Bella (Te Wiata), yet Bella's shaggy and grumpy husband Hec (Neill) doesn't seem to warm up to him. Ricky's escape attempt is thwarted by the place's unique topography, a remote house in the middle of nowhere adjunct to a green expanse of forests. And his resistance begin to thaw when aunt Bella's all-embracing maternal care overcomes a boy's innate defensive mechanism. But good time doesn't linger, he and Hec are bereft when Bella drops dead out of the blue, and under pain of being transferred to a juvenile prison on account of that there will be no more foster homes available, Ricky fakes his death by setting the barn alight and heads to the forest with Bella' ashes, which he intends to scatter in the place closer to the sky just as Bella wished. Strayed in the wilderness, Ricky encounters Hec, who is looking for him. But, finally, they embark on a months- long living-in-the-woods fleeing while being subjected as the target of a national manhunt, insisted by the relentless welfare services officer Paula (House, hams herself up in caricature, ""no one is left alone""). Waititi is aptly conversant with all the ropes, in the duo's solitary journey, inevitably both will open their hearts and comes to terms with each other (Hec is an illiterate with a manslaughter past, and Ricky is highly haiku-dependent), subsequently a heartfelt mutual understanding and rapport registers itself and ultimately, the blasé but none-too-mawkish father-son bond that transcends blood lineage and overcome even the most skeptical onlooker. En route, they come face to face with forbidding threats (both from fellow humans and wildlife), but heartwarming greetings also episodically arise: an extra friendly Maori family where Ricky entrains a ritualistic admiration of Kahu (Ngatai-Melbourne), a girl of his age, and a zany hermit living in the wild, Psycho Sam, played by Rhys Darby with a scene-stealing offbeat exultation. Waititi knowingly plays up the scenery-porn of New Zealand's otherworldly terrain and its lush flora and fauna, together with an ethnic and eclectic soundtrack, but pulls punches with the harsh reality of how to survive in the nature, for example, it is sheer inexplicable that our hero can keep his chubby figure unaltered after all his tribulations, which tallies with Waititi's precept of downplaying anything (death, funeral, ash-scattering and a malicious sniper) that would hinder its cardinal quirkiness and light-heartedness. Many film references are being felicitously inserted, from one-liners of THE LORD OF THE RINGS and TERMINATOR franchises, to the faux-THELMA & LOUISE (1991), over-elaborate climax. Under Waititi's Wes Anderson-like fabrication of a feel-good fairy-tale, newcomer Julian Dennison gives a properly scintillating child performance, sometimes precocious, sometimes wide-eyed, but never rubs the audience up in the wrong way (although the self-conscious patter to the three gormless hunters detailing what they do in the woods is quite a stretch for him to pull off). Sam Neill, magnanimously saves much spotlight for his inexperienced co-star but sends off a pulsating vibe as a man who is completely at ease with his self-effacement. Last but not the least, a wonderful Rima Te Wiata radiates splendid affability and effervescence which affectingly provokes a tang of loss when her screen-time is due, and prompts us wonder would it be nice if it were an aunt-and-boy venture. Woefully, under the sexist climate, that would never be green-lit for an obvious reason.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
16,KineticSeoul,"Sort of a better version of ""Moonrise Kingdom""",8,5 October 2016,"Watching this film was sort of like watching a better version of ""Moonrise Kingdom"". As a matter of fact the style of this movie sort of reminded me of the vibe I got from Wes Anderson and Jared Hess films. Where it's a bit awkward, eccentric and quirky but does not go overboard with it. Although the beginning starts off a bit slow, but it quickly picks up afterwards. And start the develop the character dynamics very well. The plot is like a mesh of ""Moonrise Kingdom"", ""Mud"" and ""Joe"". Where a boy and his somewhat mentor like figure are on the run in the woods. And quite of a bit of quirky and yet endearing and heartwarming and even funny development happens between the two characters. Overall, for the most part I enjoyed this movie and by the end I thought of it as a heartwarming fun film that sticks.8.5/10",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
17,Hellmant,Taika Waititi obviously has some talent!,8,11 August 2016,"'HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE': Four Stars (Out of Five)A New Zealand comedy-adventure-drama flick, written and directed by Taika Waititi (who also co-directed, co-wrote and costarred in last year's outstanding 'WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS'). It's based on the 1986 book 'Wild Pork and Watercress' (by Barry Crump); and it stars Sam Neil and Julian Dennison. The film tells the story of a rebellious orphan boy, who runs away (into the woods) with his adoptive uncle. Child welfare services, and the law, hunt them down. The movie received rave reviews from critics (99% positive on Rotten Tomatoes), and it had the highest grossing opening weekend (at the Box Office) for any New Zealand film! I really enjoyed it.Ricky (Dennison) is a rebellious young orphan, who's had trouble finding a home. Child welfare services places him with a couple in the country, named Hec (Neil) and Bella (Rima Te Wiata). Ricky has trouble, at first, adapting to life there; but he eventually learns to love his new home. When Bella suddenly passes away, child services decides that Hec is not a suitable guardian for the boy (on his own). Ricky then decides to run away, into the woods, out of fear he'll be stuck in a juvenile detention facility. Hec goes looking for him, and child services assumes the boy was abducted by the man. This results in a national manhunt, looking for the two.The movie is sentimental at times, funny at other moments, and it's also even exciting (on a few occasions). One scene even made me cry (involving a dog). It's also a quirky, and very charming film. Neil and Dennison are both very likable in the leads, and the supporting roles are all fittingly cast. I think Waititi obviously has some talent, and I look forward to seeing what he does next. This film is definitely an enjoyable one.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/UotWSwc37KA",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
18,cherold,generally interesting but tonally inconsistent,6,15 June 2020,"This film follows an unfortunate orphan boy's adventures with a cantankerous adopted dad. It's a rather odd movie, in that the boy and the father and mother figures feel comic but quite real whereas the rest of the characters are broad and cartoonish. I found this a very distracting approach that prevented the movie from fully committing to either being a touching comedy drama or a wild burlesque.The cast is good and there are a number of good scenes, but the movie isn't nearly as effective as either of director Taia Waititi's other boy-based movies, Boy, and Jojo Rabbit.It's not a bad movie, but I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to watch it.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

Its endearing and relatively realistic central relationship thankfully always comes first. The film is just an entertaining time throughout, an eclectic amalgamation of farcical comedy and character growth, and it's an incredibly unique experience that never takes the easy or expected route, in terms of neither its plot nor its laughs. This makes every weird, oddly cohesive moment all the sweeter, especially when it collates into an end result as fantastic as it is. 8/10",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
21,Bored_Dragon,Forgettable,6,25 September 2018,"""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" is defined as adventure/comedy/drama. When it comes to comedy, the movie has just one hilarious black-humorous scene and drama is not particularly dramatic. The premise is interesting and has a lot of potential but, besides just a few strong scenes, this adventure was quite boring. This is one of those movies with no significant flaws, but which simply evaporates from memory soon after watching.6/10",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
22,Reno-Rangan,"He finally found his place, and now it's in jeopardy!",8,14 November 2016,"The fourth feature film for the Kiwi director Taika Waititi. I loved all his films except the previous one, despite it was a famous title that the world loved, I'm not. So according to me this is a great comeback after a cheap vampire mockumentary. I was very confident that this would take up the New Zealand's the Oscars slot and then disappointed to find it was not in the initial list released by the Academy. Anyway, it does not need a tag like that, it is really an awesome film for everyone, though the theme has some adult contents in an indirect manner and violence like killing the wild animals. That means still it can be watched by kids with their parents' consent.Watching it takes you to the location live, so you don't want to end your vacation in the beautiful New Zealand wilderness which feels like untouched. It was nothing like you have seen in 'The Lord of the Rings' that altered with the computer tricks. This is raw and beautiful like the Tasmanian jungle from 'The Hunter'.This is the story of an orphan boy named Ricky Baker, who is a troublesome. Finally a family from the remote place adopts him where with the initial hiccups, he started to get used to it. But after one of the members dies in his new family, the child service wants him back. This is where it all begins, because he finally found a place where he belongs, but they are trying to take it away from him. So he launches his protest that comes from a mistake which later becomes a national news. What's going to happen to him and the others around him told in the remaining part.""Sometimes in life it seems like there's no way out. Like a sheep trapped in a maze designed by wolves.""Seems Ricky is obsessed with the films. He always talks about them and compares his actual state of condition to the different films he had seen and admired. Especially about the gangsters, I think that's why he became so rebellious, apart from his struggles in the orphanage. This film was based on the book called 'Wild Pork and Watercress' and I praise the author for creating a character like Ricky. As usual the screenplay by Taika Waititi was amazing. Not without the support from his crew and especially the actors like who played Ricky. So was the Sam Neill in an important role.First of all it is a fun film, despite whatever they have shown in this like about the feud between the child service and the kid. The film kind of looks like Wes Anderson's 'Moonrise Kingdom' without his signature. Except the initiation, what follows is quite aimless plot. So, not easy to predict the scenes, but somewhat we come to know the ending. It has to conclude either way, like happy or sad ending, or maybe both. But the overall film keeps us in the guessing mode, providing some laughs and thorough good entertainment.It's really an appealing title and so the equally satisfying film. Especially if you like wild and green landscape, you should not miss it. The story was told in chapters which actually did not require, but those slices were helped to understand each section and its focus. I think it was a direct influence from the original source.The director is now on a big leap, doing a superhero film in the Hollywood. The third 'Thor' film, that reunites him with Sam Neill for the second consecutive time. I'm waiting for that which is going to be a visual extravaganza. He has done great with smaller films till now, which are mostly the comedies, but what comes is his biggest challenge so far and if he does pull it off successfully, he would be another Kiwi director in the big league after Peter Jackson. Praying to happen that. In the meantime, I recommend you to check this one out.8/10",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
23,sol-,What We Do in the Bush,7,27 January 2017,"Lost in New Zealand's bush outback, circumstances cause the local authorities to incorrectly assume that an elderly farmer has kidnapped his foster child for deviant reasons in this blend of comedy and drama from 'What We Do in the Shadows' director Taika Waititi. The film pulls in somewhat expected directions with the old man and the boy gradually bonding despite neither really wanting much to do with the other in the first place, however, the movie is constantly elevated by the quality of the principal performances. Julian Dennison (in his first leading role) is charming as the boy in question and Sam Neill offers one of his most heartfelt turns as his adoptive father. The supporting performances are a little uneven with Rachel House over-the-top as an overbearing child protective services officer who takes her job far too seriously, though there is something to be said for how heartless she is around Dennison, even early on, describing him as little more than a 'problem child'. This ties in well with the film's themes of perception and misleading appearances as we soon discover that although sullen and moody, Dennison is a warm and energetic young man; indeed, the overall story is about two lonely souls who connect as they find themselves equally misunderstood by the world at large. Message aside though, 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople' is a downright funny film. Some of the humour is a little on the cute side, but all of Neill and Dennison's interactions are great; same goes for the scattered movie references throughout.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
24,tomgillespie2002,A near-perfect blend of comedy and drama,9,2 October 2016,"Before Hunt for the Wilderpeople was even released, director Taika Waititi had been headhunted by Marvel Studios to helm what will be one of their biggest releases in 2017, Thor: Ragnarok. The talented writer, director and actor duly obliged, and will no doubt bring his unique brand of charm and laugh-out-loud humour to what has been tantalisingly described as an intergalactic road movie. His relocation to Hollywood helps bring a sense of bittersweet gravitas to Wilderpeople, almost as if he is waving goodbye to his beautiful New Zealand, smashing the opening weekend box-office in his native country in the process.The film tells the story of Ricky Baker (Julian Dennison), an overweight orphan who dresses like the gangster rappers he frequently quotes who is placed in the care of foster parent 'Aunt' Bella (Rima Te Wiata). Bella lives in a remote cottage and welcomes the troubled child with open arms, switched on to exactly how to deal with Ricky's unique brand of rebellion. The same cannot be said for her husband Hec (Sam Neill), a grizzled frontiersman who we first meet emerging from the hills with a huge boar on his back. Hec has no time for Ricky, but when tragedy strikes, the child heads out into the wilderness to survive on his own. It doesn't take long for Hec to catch up to him, but when the huntsman is injured, the two are forced into spending a huge amount of time together, becoming wanted outlaws and local celebrities in the process.Waititi's previous film, the cult vampire mockumentary What We Do in the Shadows, was complimented by its cast of talented comedic actors and surprisingly gory set-pieces. While Shadows was certainly a riot, it could be argued that it lacked heart. Wilderpeople certainly doesn't, and Waititi seems to have an uncanny ability to know just when to inject sentiment into a mix of memorable one- liners, bizarre supporting characters and pop culture references. A lot of this is down to the two central performances. Dennison proves to be one held of a find and the ever-reliable Neill is perfect as the grumpy foil who slowly and convincingly forms a bond with the child. Many of the laughs come from Ricky's childish naivety - when he sees the military and their sniffer dogs hunting them through the trees, he exclaims, ""Ninjas! Direwolves! Child Services!""There is also a fine performance from Rachel House as head of child services Paula, a grotesque woman who seems to have stepped out of the pages of a Roald Dahl book. Her motto is ""no child left behind,"" but doesn't seem to grasp the meaning of the words as she takes her job far too seriously and leading the manhunt herself. While the film seems to slightly lose focus towards the Thelma and Louise- inspired climax, it never loses its heart. Adapted from Barry Crump's book Wild Pork and Watercress, Waititi's is clearly in love with the film's characters, as well as the beauty of the New Zealand wilderness. It's a near perfect combination of comedy and drama, knowing exactly the right time to switch gears. If Waititi can bring the same levels of charm and offbeat humour to his Thor movie next year, it will be one of the most intriguing movies of the year and a standout in Marvel's already-impressive track record.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
25,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Street humor, the New Zealand countryside and a heartfelt story make for another success from Taika Waititi",8,21 December 2016,"New Zealand filmmaker Taika Waititi is making the funniest films you haven't heard of. 2014's ""What We Do in the Shadows"" was a brilliantly conceptualized and cleverly executed mockumentary depicting vampires as people with ordinary problems, and ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" is a surprisingly endearing ""unlikely relationship"" comedy.Waititi's gift is deadpan, awkward humor. He finds ways to tether larger-than-life situations and improbable scenarios to very simple and relatable notions, allowing him to build big stories that never lose their grip on reality. So often in ""Wilderpeople,"" you forget just how preposterous the whole thing really is.The film begins with as commonplace a setup as any: a troubled 13- year-old foster child named Ricky (Julian Dennison) is adopted by a couple living in the New Zealand ""bush,"" or countryside. Things take a turn, however, when Ricky runs away into the wilderness. His foster ""uncle"" (Sam Neill) finds him, but their disappearance causes a massive public manhunt.What ensues is a goose chase of sorts that forces an awkward urban teen into hip-hop together with a soft-spoken Crocodile Dundee-esque curmudgeon, all of which is set against a picturesque New Zealand backdrop.In some ways, ""Wilderpeople"" is just another story about a child and an adult who want nothing to do with one another becoming unlikely friends, only this one's got a lot of gorgeous and lush scenery. Although Waititi takes several moments out of the film for landscape shots (some echoing ""Lord of the Rings,"" frankly), nothing about the setting feels particularly essential to the story other than serving to make it more unique.It's a small hollow patch, however, in a film that's about belonging at its core. Waititi creates these two separate notions, one of being an outlaw and alone versus togetherness, companionship and playing by the rules. He simply has it all play out under entertaining and visually interesting circumstances.The cast is outstanding. Dennison's humor is reminiscent of Rebel Wilson (though it could be the similarity in stature and accent) and Neill plays off him extremely well in situations that are humorous, dramatic and dangerous. The surrounding cast also has terrific comedy instincts including Rima Te Wiata, Rachel House and a last- minute cameo by Waititi regular Rhys Darby.If nothing else, ""Wilderpeople"" will win fans for Waititi's application of modern, street-wise humor (Ricky names his dog Tupac) to a rural setting, which creates a humorous contradiction that just works, probably because Waititi doesn't force it. When Ricky says ""$&*% just got real"" with a hunting rifle in hand, it pretty much sums up why the movie is hilarious.For all the shenanigans sprinkled in, ""Wilderpeople"" never loses sight of who its characters are beneath the surface and what really matters to them. Waititi shoehorns in his awkward brand of humor the same way any comedic filmmaker would, but he keeps the relationship and themes at the core of story intact every which way he twists it. That ability is what makes his directing of the next ""Thor"" movie incredibly promising. If he can do what he does so well with a tent- pole budget and major studio demands, he won't be making the best comedies you've never heard of for long.~Steven CThanks for reading!

26,paul-allaer,Charming adventure-comedy from New Zealand can be enjoyed by people young and old,8,7 August 2016,"""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" (2016 release from New Zealand) brings the story of Ricky Baker, as 12 or 13 yr. old boy. As the movie opens, we see Ricky being dropped off by the New Zealand social services to a new (and very remote) foster home. ""Nobody else wants you!"" says Paula the social worker. But foster mom Bella takes a quick liking to the overweight and shy boy. Her husband Hector, though, remains aloof and grumpy. Then, just as things seems to be working out okay, Bella unexpectedly passes away, and Social Services informs Hector that they will take Ricky back to place him in a new foster home. At this point we're 15 minutes in the movie, but to tell you much more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from New Zealand writer-director Taika Waititi, who most recently brought us ""What We Do In the Shadows"". Here he goes in a very different direction, bringing a light-hearted adventure-comedy with some serious undercurrents. The movie is brought in 10 Chapters and an Epilogue. The comedy aspects are sprinkled throughout the movie, and makes this a most charming viewing experience. The adventure aspects, set in the gorgeous landscapes of New Zealand, are never all that serious, focusing instead on the relationship between Ricky and Hector, and what true love and friendship between a parent (yes, even foster parent) and a child is all about. Because so much of the movie is set in the beautiful outdoors, the movie feels like a long commercial for New Zealand (and I mean that as a compliment, not as a complaint). I mean, it just looks gorgeous! The acting performances are top-notch, including New Zealander Sam Neil, but with all due respect, the movie is simply stolen by Julian Dennison, the young man who plays Ricky. He is smart, and funny, and completely believable in this role. Surely we have not seen the last of him! The movie made quite a splash when it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. It is now playing in its second week at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and the Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely. The audience absolutely LOVED the film, laughing at all the right times, and clearly enjoying themselves. Bottom line: ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" is a charming movie that can be enjoyed by people young and old, and hence it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
27,subxerogravity,A Fantastic hunt indeed!,8,6 July 2016,"So this was a pretty fun movie. Sam Neil like I never seem him before plays a man named Hec living in a shack with his wife, who decides to take in a troubled youth who has been bouncing from foster home to foster home in hopes that he does not end up in juvie. Suddenly, this guy's wife dies leaving him to take care of the foster kid, Ricky Baker, who runs instead of going back into foster care and do to a grave misunderstanding, Hec is now wanted by the authorizes for kidnapping the boy. Now the two are living off the land in the wilderness trying to keep out of jail.Young Ricky Baker explains to Hec that what they are going through is a lot like Lord of the Rings, I seriously doubt that. Though both movies were filmed in New Zealand, I think Hunt for the Wilderpeople could only pay for the craft services on just one of the Ring films. Although, it was quite a big adventure.Ricky Baker is like a fat little Hobbit and the man he calls Uncle Hec is like a crazed Gandalf. They go on a journey confronting creepy hunters, psychopaths living alone in the woods, raging warhogs and of course the law. Aiding them on their journey is Ricky's dog Tupac and Hec's dog Sam as they learn to bond as a family. Ricky Baker even gets to met a princess (sort of).So I guess in a lot of ways it is like the Lord of the Rings. It's definitely just as epic of a journey, watching them survive the terrain of the wilderness for almost a year.There was a cameo in the movie from this guy who starred in another New Zealand film called Boy. I really like that movie and this movie has a similar style. Not a coincidence as it turns out he directed this movie as well as Boy. Taika Waititi is a type of filmmaker I like. It's like 80s retro style with a twist of 90s influence, which hits me right at home. It's not that I have not seen other filmmakers use the style, but he gets uniqueness points for his use of Brown people and the New Zealand setting. This is the a guy who I want to look out for and see his stuff, and I just discover he's doing the next Thor, so even more reason to want to see that flick.But see this one first, it's an excellent adventure like Lord of the Rings but way funnier.http://cinemagardens.com",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
28,jtindahouse,Has heart and is genuinely funny,9,31 March 2016,"Taika Waititi is starting to make some real waves in the film making industry. It's as simple as this - every film he makes, people like. In fact, people like them so much he's been trusted with the directorial duties in the next 'Thor' film 'Thor: Ragnarok'. That's big and shows people trust him with making their film. That decision was made prior to the release of 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople' but I can confirm that this film will do his reputation no harm. In fact it's going to do it a lot of good. It's a very fine film and in my opinion his best yet. I thoroughly enjoyed 'What We Do in the Shadows' but my one qualm with it was I felt it lacked a story to drive the humour. The man learns from his errors fast though and there is no such problem here. The story, while simple, is a driving force and makes sure things never get mundane or boring. Also helping this is a terrific cast of actors. Julian Dennison in the lead role blew me away and showed comedic timing far beyond his years. Sam Neill was as fantastic as ever and every cameo throughout is terrific and hilarious in its own way. The film not only manages to make us laugh though, it also has a heart. There are some very sad and moving elements to the film which are handled exquisitely by Waititi. He makes us think and sobers us occasionally but never takes us away from the fun time we're having with the story. There's a lot more to the film than I expected going in. It has layers and works on a lot of levels. I can't say enough good things about this film. An absolute pleasure to sit through.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
29,billcr12,On The Road,8,2 March 2017,"This is basically a road picture with the difference being that instead of the road, the adventure takes place in the New Zealand wilderness. Sam Neill plays the caretaker of a troubled adolescent boy who has been placed with him and his wife through the foster child program. The wife is out of the picture early on, and thus begins the strange journey into the woods with the state authorities in hot pursuit. The scenery is spectacular and Neill has a Mel Gibson like wise ass quality which works well in the interplay between him and the boy. They meet many odd people along the way, and I am surprised that the film wasn't chosen as one of the nominees for best foreign film for 2016; it is that good. Great acting, smart script and a good soundtrack add up to a really good movie and one of my favorites for 2106.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
30,jadavix,"A kids' movie for adults, or an adults' movie for kids",7,23 January 2017,"""The Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" is a strange bird. It's part black comedy about two people who are tragically misunderstood by society, and part kids' wish fulfillment fantasy. It seems to shoot itself in the foot by being too ridiculous, too much a party to the fantasies of children to be taken seriously as an adult movie, and is too potty mouthed for many parents to find it suitable viewing for their kids.Ricky is an overweight Maori boy who is at the end of the line with child services. He has, apparently, been through many foster homes and orphanages, and his next stop will be young people's jail, if his latest posting doesn't work out.The menacing youth worker who delivers him to his new home reels off a litany of offenses he has supposedly committed, including vandalism and thievery. She speaks like she's incanting a protection spell against the boy. He doesn't say much, and dresses and walks like every young thug you've ever seen.He isn't, though, and you start to wonder what this youth worker's deal is. She compares herself to the terminator in a comparison that is too fitting. This is not an accurate depiction of people who work in social services, and you wonder why they went so far making her into an unfeeling, inhuman villain. Were they that desperate for a bad guy?The movie forgets, very very quickly, that Ricky was supposed to be a problem child. He's a dream: clever, polite, obedient, thoughtful. The only bad behaviour we see if his running away, which is not really an issue as his foster family live in the bush; he can't get far.Anyway, Ricky and his adopted ""uncle"", Hector, played by Sam Neill, end up on the run when Ricky attempts to live in the bush, and Hector comes to find him. It is assumed Hector has kidnapped the boy. The movie from then on out is sporadically entertaining, and mostly fits into a familiar kids' movie template about the tough guy with the heart of gold and the streetwise, misfit kid learning to trust each other.The movie approaches making its likable lead, the small, round, Ricky, a believable character, but with details like a late-movie car chase – in which he shows driving skills Mario Andretti probably couldn't rival – you are reminded of the movie's split personality.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

Despite what sounds like a very serious, dreary premise, there's a lot of innocent joy, moments of pure brightness and continuous good humor in Hunt for the Wilderpeople.While they evade pursuit in the Kiwi wilds, Ricky (the adoptee in question) stands up for himself and earns a place in the old man's heart, plus a dash of respect, without losing any of the magnetic, irreverent qualities that make him so much fun to watch. Youthful Julian Dennison is a great fit for the part, playing the hard-edged wannabe thug with a straight face while smoothly indulging the sillier ticks and quirks that make it clear he's still young at heart. Sam Neill, nearly unrecognizable beneath a thick white beard and thicker local accent, makes a fine addition as his gruff, prickly counterpart; a bitter, lonesome man who still harbors the spark of warmth beneath several prohibitive outer layers.Sweet and genuine, effortlessly funny and smoothly charming, it's partly Napoleon Dynamite, partly Wes Anderson and partly its own thing entirely.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

35,NateWatchesCoolMovies,lovely,8,4 December 2016,"Taika Waititi's Hunt For The Wilderpeople speaks to the lost boy in all of us, tweaks our sense of humour with subtle doses in all the right places, taking what could have been a familiar feeling story and sending it miles down the road less traveled, in terms of emotion, comedy, script and pacing. This film has the largest scope of any he has made so far, but it's purely for atmosphere; he remains steadfast in his need to explore what fascinates him the most: people. Their fears, desires, eccentricities and idiosyncrasies laid out bare and blunt, with none of the trademark gloss or cookie cutter cue card normalcy that so much writing has these days, clouding the potential for characters to feel genuine. They feel just that here though, and inhabit a world of harsh realities, unpredictable outcomes and organic, unforced interaction. Hell, even when his protagonists are vampires, they still feel far more lifelike than many a human character in film these days. The story is benign, until slowly kindled by all the elements I have just outlined. Child services, in the form of a tyrannical bitch (Rachel House), bring wayward boy Ricky (Julien Dennison, a wicked new talent) to stay with his new foster parents on a remote farm in rural New Zealand. The couple (Rima Ti Wiata and the legendary Sam Neill) couldn't be more different than the young lad. He's a hoodie wearing, rap rhetoric spewing, pop culture paintball gun of colloquial gibberish and big city malarkey. They are a withdrawn, earthy, isolated type of folk, content with farm life and each other's company. Ricky is a disruption which they both need, creating a mini culture clash that provides countless moments of amusement as we wade our way into the story. The aforementioned unpredictability strikes when Neill's wife passes away without buildup or ceremony, leaving him and a kid he barely knows, let alone likes, alone in the world. What follows is a touching, picturesque and endlessly funny glimpse at two people who are thrown into the thick of it together. These people are both lost in different ways; Ricky has never known a real family, tethered to nothing and set adrift among a sea of cyber role models and unreliable elders. Neil has just spent the majority of his life in a rock steady routine with his farmer's wife and clockwork existence, suddenly unmoored and left with not a clue how to proceed. The two are hilarious together, providing each other with bushels of character development and scene after scene of purely inspired, bona fide human interaction that feels so utterly, blessedly unforced. They're set among a slide show of breathtaking scenery, lively supporting work and attention to detail that adds up to quite the unforgettable package. If Waititi's latest is any indication of what's to come, lay down that red carpet runway post haste, because he'll continue to take us by storm",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

Netflix and Amazon are great for these kind of films and Hunt for the Wilderpeople really is a cracking little film.This is the story of city kid Ricky , who gets a fresh start in the New Zealand countryside. He quickly finds himself at home with his new foster family. When a tragedy strikes that threatens to ship Ricky to another home, both he and Hec go on the run in the bush. As a national manhunt ensues, the newly branded outlaws must face their options: go out in a blaze of glory or overcome their differences and survive as a family. We all know the acting qualities that Sam Neill has and he is great in this but the star of this particular show is Julian Dennison who plays Ricky. Rarely have I seen comedy timing from a kid like he has in this film. 
I laughed out loud several times during this movie which is unusual for me and comedies.

This movie was so damn good I can hardly comprehend how it didn't even get the Golden Globe nominee for best COMEDY, while ""Florence Foster Jenkins""-a movie that I am sure is okay but not nearly as great as this-gets the honor, mainly because it happens to have Meryl Streep in it (of course, I have not seen that movie, but based on everything I know about it it cannot be nearly as special as this masterpiece).Anyway, this film is practically flawless. I will admit that a few jokes were a bit too cliché and predictable, but for the most part all of the humor is great, unique, original, and hilariously dark. Some of the funniest scenes in the movie come from a funeral and suspected child molestation.Despite its sometimes sick sense of humor, the film also has genuine heart. The arc of the two main characters may be slightly predictable, but it is presented in such a way that it tugs at your heart strings while also making you laugh and cry. It's a hilarious movie with plenty of heart, warmth, and sadness. The characters are all memorable and well developed, the performances-especially Sam Neil-are all fantastic and usually hilarious, and the plot is absolute insanity.

Off-beat films like Eagle vs Shark (2007) and What We Do in the Shadows (2014) have certainly gained some notoriety in recent years though anyone subscribing to Jemaine Clement's Twitter feed may not be watching those films with the director in mind. Those who have no idea who Clement is need not apply. Yet Waititi's Boy (2010) ranks among the top grossing New Zealand films and Hunt for the Wilderpeople is poised to overtake the director's sophomore effort, and with good reason. Hunt for the Wilderpeople is one of the best films you're liable to see this year and perhaps, one of the most wistful coming-of-age stories of the decade.The story begins with the young and rotund Ricky (Dennison) being escorted by child services' Paula (House) to a remote farm house mere hectares from ""the bush"". Ricky first meets his foster parents with a quixotic warm and cold welcoming. Bella (Te Wiata) does most of the talking, taking every opportunity to make the urban-adaptive Ricky feel at home in rural New Zealand. Hec (Neill), the gruff and irascible man of the house coldly asks if Ricky does anything or is he merely ""ornamental"". After a series of unfortunate events, Hec and Ricky find themselves the subjects of a manhunt by authorities and are forced to hide in the bush.The details of Hec and Ricky's predicament are hinted at in the trailers though explaining them would deny you the viewer the opportunity to see a stunningly wonderful movie through fresh eyes. Like encountering a rare bird, this movie shouldn't be talked about, analyzed and autopsied but rather looked upon with awe and wonderment. Once over, the moment should be followed with the quiet contemplation of Walden Pond.Sam Neill and the young Julian Dennison are pitch-perfect as the miscreant odd couple. Dennison's inept braggadocio aches of street- smart malady mixed with the quiet simpering of a child completely out of his depth. Sure he's led a tough life, much tougher than most I suspect yet next to Hec he's but a mouth whose seen one too many movies. Yet even then he's instantly likable as a character. His resilience, his humor, his moments of pre-teen angst are so honest and sweet that I for one saw myself despite never wanting to become a ""Skug."" Sam Neill as Hec proves resourceful, forthright and even nurturing in his own individualist way. Despite being functionally illiterate, Hec puts his faith in ""the knack,"" his way of staying calm and tough in distressing situations in the bush. ""You know often times when people are found out here, they're naked...they panic and think their clothes are slowing them down,"" he says before following the stream to high ground. If civilization ever crumbles, Hec is the kind of guy you want leading your war-party.Much of the film has an off-kilter quality to it. The humor stems from baffling moments of exaggeration from the characters. Rima Te Wiata's Bella exudes cartoonish provincialism while Rachel House's child services stooge is layered with Dahlian villainy.While eluding authorities, the duo always seem to come across the same trio of hunters (Walker, Minogue and Holloway) who are craven for reward money but always wind up looking like Elmer Fudds. Then there's Rhys Darby's part which I dare not ruin lest to say his introduction energizes the film just as it begins to lose a little luster.Sincere, direct and exaggerated in all the ways a children's tale should be, the film earns all its laughs, tears and moments of suspense with two singularly charming performances and a Spielbergian sense of wonder. Well perhaps Spielbergian may be a malapropism; after all, the film does get laughs out of sly Terminator (1984) and First Blood (1982) references. With Waititi set to direct the next Thor (2011-Present) film, I think we all should hope it ends up being Waititiesque.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

47,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,One of the 2010s very best family films. And so much more.,10,28 October 2017,"Hunt for the Wilderpeople is Taika Waititi's fourth feature film, and arguably his finest one. I love this movie: the New Zealand scenery and cast of this film not only helps with the film's broad yet culturally specific appeal, it tells story that is hilarious, touching and very memorable. Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a comedy-drama about family and how social misfits only truly understand each other. Ricky Baker is adopted by Bella and Hec. And things only get more complicated and wacky when Bella passes away, leaving Hec to take care of Ricky himself.The film takes surprising turns when you least expect it to. It's still very much a comedy but one that takes emotional risks for the sake of the story rather than shock value. Taika Waititi based this film off a book, that may have been so niche that it doesn't have its own wikipedia page. It's great we live in a world where a director like Waititi gives life to a story where the world doesn't realise it wants it or needs it. Hunt for the Wilderpeople is one such film.If you want a film that provides belly-laughs and great characters, Hunt for the Wilderpeople is surprisingly easy to get into. Watch the film; just see it asap. It's a Kiwi-delight and one of 2016's best movies.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
48,Troy_Campbell,An absolute gem of a movie.,9,2 June 2016,"Those familiar with writer-director-actor Taika Waititi's last three films – What We Do in the Shadows, Boy and Eagle vs Shark – already know how bloody brilliant the New Zealand native is both behind and in front of the camera. If there is any justice in the world then his most recent Kiwi adventure, which maintains the ridiculously high standard he has set, will attract big crowds and greatly expand the number of people fortunate enough to watch this master at work. This charming tale of a rambunctious orphaned kid (Julian Dennison) trying to find his place in life, and in the NZ wilderness where his latest foster carers reside, beautifully blends cartoonish humour and meaty themes into its fascinating story. Adept at finding both poignancy and hilarity in the simple moments, Waititi's observations on culture, relationships and human behaviour draw you in to his world, which is all too real yet somehow heightened at the same time. Populated with subtly compelling characters whom you want to hang out with, laugh with, cry with and struggle through life with, the 101 minute runtime utterly flies by; when the end credits roll you'll not be ready to leave. Acting alongside screen veteran Sam Neill (outstanding – obviously) for the most part, the absurdly charismatic Dennison is an absolute revelation too, looking completely at ease filling the shoes of defiant 13-year-old Ricky Baker. Hopefully many more roles are forthcoming. At times hilarious, at times heartbreaking, and always enthralling, Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a gem of a movie that verifies Waititi is a filmmaking genius.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

I tend to enjoy wacky offbeat comedies and when it comes to plot, the weirder the better for me, so 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople' was right up my street.The best thing about this film though has to be the characters. They are deliberately over-the-top/exaggerated based on real-world stereotypes, such as the stroppy kid, incompetent police and the unsympathetic social worker, who was my personal favourite.Entertaining, fun, well-written and well-acted throughout.

51,proud_luddite,Conventional but enjoyable,7,12 May 2018,"Ricky (Julian Dennison) is an aboriginal, delinquent teenager who is transferred among foster homes in urban New Zealand. His newest foster assignment is in a farm near the wilderness. After a series of mishaps and misunderstandings, Ricky and the man of the house (Sam Neill) live in the bush as they are hunted down by government authorities.There is an early disappointment in the film when a likeable, eccentric character disappears too soon. Also, the plot device of an ""old grouch"" unlikely bonding with a misunderstood teenage boy has been done many, many times before.Despite these complaints, ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" is still an enjoyable movie. This is mainly because of Dennison's and Neill's performances - both individually and in their mutual chemistry. The film also gives credibility to a repeated theme: that bureaucrats rarely (if ever) give outcasts the help they need but still try to dominate their lives. Near the end, there is also a nostalgic reminder of ""Thelma and Louise"".With some good humour and the beauty of the New Zealand wilderness, this movie comes off as rather gratifying.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

53,sharky_55,I processed that one for ages.,9,24 January 2017,"Taika Waititi tells us a lot about Ricky Baker in the opening of Hunt for the Wilderpeople without a peep from his mouth. A police car rolls through the hills to a choral musical backing. When he steps out from the vehicle, we get a glimpse of the Illuminati-inspired motto on the jacket back, and the soundtrack acknowledges it with an alien twang. Ricky is spoken for on behalf of welfare officer Paula, who immediately labels him a lost cause in a montage of his criminal activities (the lengthy rap sheet includes throwing rocks, kicking stuff, defacing stuff and lots of other heinous stuff). ""He's a real piece of work,"" she proclaims. Ricky inspects the place quickly, and then wordlessly returns to the police car. This, and other various markers throughout the film, say a lot about how he has been bounced around foster parents all his life. He doesn't even rate himself lasting the day here - might as well get onto the next 'home'. But this couple do want him. Well, half of them do. In a wonderfully affectionate performance lasting all of twenty minutes, Rima Te Wiata crafts a character of great warmth and wit who seems to be able to do it all; the only thing she's missing is a child to pass it along to. Aunt Bella, like most of Waititi's characters, is a hyper-caricature with a good heart; she's thoughtful enough to leave both a sharp knife to kill monsters in the night as well as a hottie to keep Ricky warm. She relays this through the door because she has an inkling of what a good mother's qualities are, having envisioned this her whole life, and tries to respect his boundaries. Yet she is so excited she peaks around the door anyway, if only to make sure that he hasn't vanished on the spot. In the morning she urges him to at least have breakfast before he runs away. She's at once honest and revealing, and under no illusions of what Ricky has gone through. Her birthday rendition of what has to be a self-written ode to ""good as gold"" Ricky on a little toy piano is as heartwarming as a big gulp of hot soup on a rainy day. Has Paula ever told Ricky he has value? Has anyone? But then a thunderclap of a curveball hits them, and the film descends into the well-treaded material promised in the trailer: the formidable team of cantankerous old Hec and the chubby, impressionable Ricky on an adventure for the ages. The story is doled out in chapters unveiled in white, curly text giving the impression of a storybook come to life. Each frame Ricky stumbles across in his oversized hoodies are filled to the brim with character and attitude; see how Waititi overlays several Rickys in the same shot to simulate the fact that he is lost, how he contemplates rationing then scarfs down the rest of his food, or how he manages to start a fire but is not cooking wild game, but trying to heat his hottie. Ricky is one of those twenty-first century children who communicate extensively through their knowledge of pop culture, and like the hazy, dreamlike visions of Michael Jackson in Waititi's Boy, Hunt for the Wilderpeople also freely indulges him. His introduction to the bloodshed of the bush is a thudding Psycho-inspired montage that zooms right up into his squished, horrified face. When he is first called upon to wield a gun to potentially save his uncle, action music pumps into our ears before the recoil unceremoniously drops him. If he was old enough he'd declare himself Clyde and old gruffy Hec Bonnie. What these also reveal is the self-soothing nature of Waititi's characters, and how Ricky has fashioned himself a defense mechanism; he can conjure music at will, and the fact that there's nothing around but sticks and leaves has never stopped him. Locals will fondly remember Julian from Waititi's anti drug-driving commercial in 2013, which itself took from his short film Two Cars, One Night. Both contemplate the uncanny ability of children being able to apply their own humour and logic to darker and more uncomfortable situations, revealing the flip side of parental negligence. Ricky doesn't even get to have that experience. His dialogue unconsciously reveals the pains of his upbringing, and how he recycles the positive mantras that have been beaten into him: ""Okay Debbie Downer, let's write a haiku."" Paula's escalation in her attempts to recapture him hint at the self-fulfilling prophecy that she anoints each foster kid. At first he's a real bad egg, but by the climax they're being cornered by tanks and SWAT squadrons as if they were international criminals. It's a stigma that grows exponentially. Her self-stylised motto 'no child left behind' initially seems heartwarming, but becomes more sinister with each iteration; she's not so much concerned with his wellbeing as she is with making sure there is another foster family lined up. Ricky never stood a chance. In Chapter Seven, titled 'A Normal Life', Ricky is allowed to settle into the home of Kahu (Look at how Waititi shoots their fateful meeting. She's approaching from the left, she's approaching from the right, she swishes her hair in slow motion, the lens flare blinds Ricky! He's in love. Hilarious.) They sit down and begin to tentatively open up about their past. And then the camera pans across, and reveals Kahu's dad to be silently listening on the couch beside them. The shot is brilliant because it sneaks up on us. It represents all the ideals of warmth and family that Ricky is so unaccustomed to, that someone could just sit and listen and understand. The feeling envelops him like a baby's swaddle, and for the first time in forever, he sleeps soundly. Ricky may not quite receive the same amount of affection from Hec, but their co-penned haikus are majestical.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
54,tenshi_ippikiookami,Really good,9,11 June 2016,"""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" seems like your run-of-the-mill movie about kid with problems that connects with older person, and then both of them learn how to understand each other and how to deal with the whole wide world.And it is.But it is much more than that.Directed by Taika Waititi (whose other work also offers the same kind of humour), ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" may not be a very original movie, but it is a movie with heart and lots of comedy and silliness that never overstays its welcome. If you don't laugh, at least you will be smiling throughout the whole affair, feeling a connection to Neill's Faulkner and Dennison's Baker, two of those characters that are so easy to relate to, one bitter and old and the other bitter and young.The script keeps things fast and loose, the jokes coming, and all under a clear patina of surrealism. The direction is assured and never let things get out of hand. But the best is the acting. Sam Neill has never been better, and Julian Dennison shines. But all the cast does an amazing job.It is tonally uneven in a couple of places, and it takes a couple of strange decisions, but those are minor quibbles in a very funny and heartfelt movie.Totally recommended.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
55,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A fantastic earlier work by Taika Waititi.,8,5 February 2021,"After enjoying films like Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and Jojo Rabbit (2019), I decided to watch some of director Taika Waititi's previous films. First up is Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016), a humorous outdoor adventure that doesn't hide many of its influences, which ends up being a good thing. The plot and style are somewhat reminiscent of Moonrise Kingdom (2012) but takes advantage of New Zealand's wilderness to tell its own story. There is plenty of character development, and the two leads-played by Sam Neill and Julian Dennison-work well together to create a meaningful connection.Anyone who has seen other New Zealand comedies are likely to enjoy the specific cultural brand of humor here that feels like an evolved version of the classic British humor of the 1960s. Hunt for the Wilderpeople uses its minor characters to deliver its humor, with Rhys Darby carrying an exceptionally funny sequence. It's this irreverent humor that hints at what Waititi's future works would become. There were plenty of instances where I could see how this film eventually influenced films like Jojo Rabbit. Sure, there are still some rough edges here, but it's nice to see what Waititi could do with the raw elements at his disposal.Some of the musical and directorial choices here feel like an homage to Wes Anderson's style, which I certainly am not complaining about. There are still fantastic, uniquely Waititi bits, though, including a montage that seems to be shot in one continuous pan across the scenery. One can only wonder if this plot would have suffered were it not for Sam Neill and his best Harrison Ford impression, though. The vulnerability in this tough-guy façade made the adoptive father/son dynamic work well enough that it carried the whole film.A fantastic earlier work by Taika Waititi, I give Hunt for the Wilderpeople 4.0 stars out of 5.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

The movie looks familiar because it contains scenes similar to ""Thelma and Louise"", ""Rambo"" and at one point it goes ""Old Yeller"" complete with the wild pig and the same outcome.The performances, cinematography and score are all outstanding.

Despite what sounds like a very serious, dreary premise, there's a lot of innocent joy, moments of pure brightness and continuous good humor in Hunt for the Wilderpeople. While they evade pursuit in the Kiwi wilds, Ricky (the adoptee in question) stands up for himself and earns a place in the old man's heart, plus a dash of respect, without losing any of the magnetic, irreverent qualities that make him so much fun to watch. Youthful Julian Dennison is a great fit for the part, playing the hard-edged wannabe thug with a straight face while smoothly indulging the sillier ticks and quirks that make it clear he's still young at heart. Sam Neill, nearly unrecognizable beneath a thick white beard and thicker local accent, makes a fine addition as his gruff, prickly counterpart; a bitter, lonesome man who still harbors the spark of warmth beneath several prohibitive outer layers. Sweet and genuine, effortlessly funny and smoothly charming, it's partly Napoleon Dynamite, partly Wes Anderson and partly its own thing entirely.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

Then he is accepted by a larger than life woman in the shape of Bella. She is wed to curmudgeonly old Hec – (Sam Neil) who is less than impressed with the new arrival.Life has a way of throwing the unexpected at us and so it does here resulting in Hec and Riccy sort of going into the Bush but being pursued by an over zealous child care officer and what looks like half the police in new Zealand – what unfolds is a funny and moving story that will hopefully warm the cockles of your heart.I really enjoyed this – it is one of those films where you can just sit back and enjoy. Everyone is great and little Julian Denison as Riccy was superb. This sort of works for the whole family too so pretty much gets to tick all the boxes – completely recommended.,Hunt for the Wilderpeople
59,agmoldham,Slightly twee,5,30 September 2016,The Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a coming of age drama about Ricky (Julian Dennison) who is a foster child. He is placed with Hec (sam Neil) and Bella (Rima Te Wiata) by the child support agency. Ricky is fairly unresponsive and in many ways similar to uncle Hec. Auntie Bella is by far in a way the most energetic and happy as Ricky settles into his new life.The movie focuses on the changes in Ricky as he is exposed to the challenges of life. The movie does have some faults such as the involvement of the child support agency which seems needlessly slapstick. Those scenes should really have been played straight and the movie would have been much improved. For the most part though it is a pretty entertaining movie.,Hunt for the Wilderpeople

It starts off as an offbeat comedy (think Eagle vs Shark) but then moves towards a more Hollywood friendly tone, but is a bit confused about which style it wants to be as the story unfolds.

61,bryank-04844,The best is 'The Hunt for the Wilderpeople'!,10,23 January 2017,"Taika Waititi is one name you will soon remember for a very long time if you don't already know it. Waititi is writer/director here for 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople', which is already in the top 5 BEST movies of the year, but Waititi is also an actor too. He starred in and directed the recent 'What We Do In The Shadows', as well as directed 'Eagle vs Shark' and even worked on 'Flight of the Conchords' amongst other films. He is currently directing the upcoming 'Thor: Ragnarok' film for Marvel, and it's easy to see why Marvel hired this guy by watching 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople'. Even if the premise here is similar to other films, Waititi makes the story and characters entirely refreshing and original.If you're a fan of Wes Anderson movies and Edgar Wright movies, then you're sure as hell to enjoy Waititi and his 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople', which is funny, charming, action-packed, and very heart-warming. It could be difficult to have all of these qualities in a film, buy Waititi weaves these elements in flawlessly and even leaves you wanting to spend hundreds of more hours with these two main characters. The film centers on a young, portly teenager named Ricky (Julian Dennison), who has been in and out of foster homes since he was a baby. The child services agent drops him off at his aunt's house in the middle of the New Zealand jungle and tells her that Ricky is somewhat of a problem child. That doesn't phase her much, as Ricky settles in to his new home in the wilderness, complete with his basketball sneakers, name-brand hoodie and flashy baseball cap.His aunt Bella (Rima Te Wiata), is a fantastic person who tells it like it is and is blunt- in-your-face. She even makes jokes at Ricky's size, but it's done in such a fashion that it really is a term of endearment. Her husband on the other hand, Hector (Sam Neill) is the opposite of Ricky. Hector is a real outdoorsman type who doesn't talk much and knows how to handle himself in the woods. After an accident, Hector and Ricky must learn to get along, but when the child protective services come back to get Ricky, the due head off into the wilderness, so that Ricky won't have to go back to foster homes or worse – juvie.Hector teaches Ricky (who fancies himself a wannabe gangsta) how to live in the woods, which comes with great laughs, when Ricky's only goal in life is to find toilet paper. Eventually the police and even the military start looking for Hector and Ricky after months of living in the wilderness, but the two come to bond and realize they need each other to express their feelings and loneliness. There are great quips of comedy n the vein of Wes Anderson and Edgar Wright here, as Hector and Ricky come across some interesting people in the wilderness, but there is also some dramatic moments here too, where the two try to express their past sadness in the form of funny haikus.There is an action set piece here as well, which I'm sure scored Waititi the 'Thor 3' job, and after seeing this film, he is more than capable of making the best 'Thor' film or even Marvel movie thus far. The performances by Sam Neill and Julian Dennison are phenomenal. They have such a good and hilarious chemistry and are very real people without ever getting too sappy or over-the-top, which we can thank Waititi's screenplay and direction for that. There are some excellent movie references and a ton of heart and soul into this film that make 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople' one of the BEST films in a long long time.MUST-SEE!!",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
62,msbreviews,Rating: A-,8,6 August 2017,"Christmas is being great for me so far, I'm glad I left the good movies to watch around this time of the year! Humble performances, unbelievable direction by Taika Waititi (he's directing Thor: Ragnarok as well, so my expectations for that movie just increased a lot), beautiful soundtrack, amazing humor and a great message for kids these days.I'll start with the cast: Sam Neill and Julian Dennison are incredible! They're the film's engine and without them, everything would crumble. Humble, honest and captivating, they give great performances that kept me invested in the plot and in their relationship, which is the main focus of this movie. They're so much different and the constant bickering between them made me want more and more from them. It gives a truly heartfelt message for kids that no matter how tough growing up is, you'll always have someone to help you along the way, even if they seem to be the complete opposite from you.I love the supporting characters, especially Psycho Sam (Rhys Darby), I laughed so much with his scenes. I didn't like this guy that kept asking the kid for a selfie, he's super annoying, but thank God he's in the movie for only a couple of minutes. The partnership between Andy (Oscar Kightley) and Paula (Rachel House) is also very funny and, by the end, they're the main source of humor that Taika Waititi knew how to explore.Talking about the man, what an amazing filmmaker! I'm so humbly grateful for his work, he controls this movie in such a wonderful and masterful way. The editing is spot on, the characters are greatly developed, the violent scenes are well shot for a NR-rated installment, the comedy is so good and the soundtrack is delightful. I have no flaws with his work, it's perfect!The only issues I have with this film are the sometimes slow pacing and the forced ending. I don't believe that a certain character would behave in the manner that it is showed, it feels forced so that the movie can actually have an ending and it kind of ruined what could have been an A+.Still, Hunt for the Wilderpeople is one of the best comedies of the year, it delivers a beautiful and heartfelt message through two honest performances, a perfect directing by Taika Waititi (don't forget this name!), great humor and a wonderful soundtrack.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

65,MrDHWong,"Revels in a unique, idyllic quirkiness that could have only come out of somewhere like New Zealand",8,9 August 2017,"Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a New Zealand film starring Sam Neill and directed by Taika Waititi (Eagle vs. Shark, 'Boy' the Movie, and Thor: Ragnarok). Based on the book ""Wild Pork and Watercress"" by Barry Crump, its unique charm and humour boost the appeal of what would have been an otherwise generic bonding story.Ricky Baker (Julian Dennison), a juvenile delinquent, goes on the run from child protective services in the New Zealand bush. Reluctantly joining Ricky is his surly foster uncle Hector (Sam Neill), who is forced to bond with his nephew while trying to find ways for them to survive in the wilderness. Eventually, a nationwide manhunt is launched by the police to swiftly bring the two of them to justice.Funny, poignant, and well-cast, Hunt for the Wilderpeople revels in a unique, idyllic quirkiness that could have only come out of somewhere like New Zealand. The film's dramatic moments always hit home and never feel like they were inserted merely for cheap emotional effect. The humour, which is very dry and tongue-in-cheek, frequently adds to the film's likability and unconventional tone. Newcomer Julian Dennison shines as Ricky Baker, a rebellious young boy with a heart of gold and Sam Neill plays off him quite well as his irritable foster uncle.I rate it 8/10",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

Before Waititi made it big with the likes of Thor: Ragnarok and Jojo Rabbit, he was one of New Zealand's newest up & coming filmmakers with films like Boy and What We Do in the Shadows. In between all of those films, he made a film adaptation of Barry Crump's Wild Pork and Watercress, Hunt for the Wilderpeople, which at the time was the country's highest grossing film.Centering on juvenile delinquent Ricky Baker and his foster father Hector ""Hec"" Faulkner, the two become subjects of child welfare and other killers upon getting stranded in the New Zealand wilderness. It's clear from the start that this is a character driven narrative, as most of the development is based on Ricky and Hector having to work with one another just to survive. With Hector being Ricky's only father figure and the wilderness being the closest Ricky has ever felt to a close connection, partially from Hector's late wife Bella, their chemistry works the most whenever the forest forces them to work based on their surroundings. By contrast, whenever the child protective services are around, the film portrays them as sinister without painting them as soulless corporations all the time. While Ricky loathes based on what they do to kids with no foster parents left, they're only trying to do what's best for the kids despite not realizing what the child really needs. In many ways, the wilderness speaks to a niche selection of people, therefore it can never connect to the services in the same way.In addition to the characters themselves making the journey fun, the actors do so much with the material they're given. Sam Neill and Julian Dennison are simply delightful as Hec and Ricky, especially with their basic old man vs young kid schtick bouncing off each other so well. With Neill being somewhat of a veteran in New Zealand cinema and films in general, his performance as a bitter yet well intentioned wilderness man is enough to make one feel for the man. Even the supporting cast is delightful in their own right, especially Rachel House having so much fun portraying both the good mannered yet somewhat evil side of child welfare worker, Paula Hall, and Oscar Knightley as her loyal yet voice of reason police in command, Andy. The notable characters that Hec and Ricky meet along the way range from foes against them such as three foolish hunters to genuine defenders like Kahu and her laid back father. Whether they be all for or against the two wilderpeople, these characters cement the journey as a truly harrowing experience.In terms of cinematography, this film might be one of the most bold cinematic experiences of showcasing the outer and inner wilderness of New Zealand in history. Everytime the wilderpeople are out in the open, there's no limit of just how vast and gorgeous the forests are, from pristine plantlife, to specific shot compositions, to gorgeous lighting; it's all a sight for the eyes. Considering the film had a budget of NZ$4.5 million, the filmmakers really knew how to utilize their limitations, and even the occasional digital effect blends in well enough with the world the film is set in without coming off as jarring. In addition, the music score adds in that authentic flavor of adventurous music that you almost never quite hear anymore. If there's one genuine complaint to give the film, it would be that they occasionally rush through some key details, such as Ricky's feelings for Kahu and the resolution after the climax. While they get their points across concisely, they also feel underdeveloped and maybe could have used a little extra screen time to allow the viewers more substance from the story.There aren't many movies I've seen that really showcase just how vastly gorgeous the countryside of New Zealand really is, especially one that was made by a native from said island. In addition to being a well crafted movie on its own, Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a thoroughly entertaining flick with enough humor and pathos to blend in with the character's journey. If you're a fan of Taika Waititi's work and are yet to see this or if you'd like to get a good flavor of New Zealand cinema, this one should totally be up your alley. After all, it ain't everyday you live the life of wilderpeople.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

He never touched the Boy. I take that stuff very seriously and DO NOT EVEN LYE OR JOKE ABOUT IT.
But it is a fantastic Movie. Oh and the Music, Songs in this Movie was PERFECT. I loved the album in this film it was great.
That Nutball dressed as a tree bush was also very funny and terrific.
That Women Officer in that film hunting down the young boy. She was also funny, nuts, right down to the law, Loved how she Bossed everyone around she was a fantastic woman in charge.
(DO AS I SAY)
I loved that part standing in front of a MAN OFFICER. Yelling at him to get real POLICE MEN to the Job.
He said I am a Policeman. Then she says ya a real one that carries a ""GUN""
He just looks at her and puts his head down and walks away Lol.

68,garethcrook,Majestical,8,29 January 2020,"A confession. I've never seen Hunt for the Wilderpeople. This feels like a glaring failure on my behalf and it's proved to be the case... it's wonderful! Ricky is a young, bored, orphan boy, who finds himself thrust out of the city's welfare system and into the rural home of Bella & Hector. Things don't go quite according to plan though and Ricky finds himself out in the bush with Hector, as both insular characters begin to find out things about themselves and one another. It's darkly funny, but tongue and cheek comical too. Sam Neil is brilliant as Hector, himself an outcast, not comfortable with society and certainly not at ease with 13 year old hip hop loving Ricky. Julian Dennison as Ricky though is a revelation, a bundle of joy perfectly complementing Neil's weather beaten world view. A series of both heartbreaking and innocent incidents sees them on the run from the ridiculously farcical welfare authorities, resulting in a mix of tenderness and satirical hilarity, wrapped up in an 80s style buddy picture, complete with delightful synth heavy score. As if all that weren't enough, Rhys Derby's cameo is nothing short of perfection... or should that be 'Majestical'.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
69,socrates4,Great Comedy Adventure,8,20 April 2020,"Taika Waititi keeps cranking out these great little comedy films. This one felt a little bit different to me than his previous films EAGLE VS SHARK and BOY. I think that was because it was based on a novel.It's different in a good way, though. It's a great story and full of unpredictable twists and turns. The two main actors in this are great together. Recommend.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
70,diane-34,A Totally Enjoyable Film,9,3 June 2016,"Diane and I saw this film in Fremantle yesterday and both of us greatly enjoyed it. This film will soon point out its origins because of the quite staggering beauty of the backgrounds: one might say unequaled in the world. Leaving my obvious enamor of New Zealand I enjoyed the script and the two lead actors: Sam Neill and his young sidekick, Julian Dennison. Neill plays a gruff Grey-bearded Bushie who is married to a young woman who heads a cast of exceptionally good fill-ins who take roles in this massively enjoyable film that devolves into a man-hunt for this very unlikely pair by equally unlikely searchers; however, the film does not in any way lose its enjoyment factor in the least.Of course, there will be commentators who will trot out the ""usual suspects"": slack script, cardboard characters, actors that just mouth their lines, we have read all of these comments before if they have any pretension of ""true film academia"" but in my opinion forget that film is for enjoyment and Hunt for the Wilderpeople is for pure enjoyment.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

This movie doesn't have a lot of story, but the characters and dialogue are funny. It's got heart and some really silly moments as well. A great role for Sam Neil amongst a lot of pretty good newcomers, plus the beauty of New Zealand.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
72,ethanbresnett,One of those films you can't help but love!,8,9 December 2020,"There really is something special about Taika Waititi which makes his films irresistible. Jojo Rabbit is one of my favourite films of recent times, and so I had no reservations at all about jumping into Hunt for the Wilderpeople.It was everything I was expecting. Absolutely bonkers, intelligent, heart warming, meaningful, enjoyable, poignant and beautiful.Most of the screen time was dedicated to Sam Neill and Julian Dennison's characters, which was great as both performances were exceptional. The two had such a believable chemistry, and the transformation of the two characters through the film was a joy to watch. Taika is brilliant at crafting unique and engaging characters, and Hunt for the Wilderpeople definitely had its share of them in the supporting cast.The story was really engaging, nicely paced, and scripted to perfection.Taika's direction was superb. He managed to capture the vastness and beauty of the New Zealand landscape, while also managing to hone in on the personal and close story of the two central characters. It was a feast for the eyes for sure.The humour also hit the mark for me. This isn't an outright comedy at all, so don't expect a laugh a minute, but it injects humour in all the right places and all the right amounts.A fantastic film!",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
73,chicagopoetry,The Kid Doesn't Lose Weight?,8,18 September 2016,"I loved this movie. I had fun watching this movie. I thought some of it was really over the top and silly but all in all it was a fun buddy movie. But I have one complaint. The kid doesn't lose any weight. The kid is out there, in the wild, eating nothing but eels and rabbits and whatever else they can find, for six months or more, and he doesn't lose a pound of weight. He's just as obese at the start of the movie as he is and the end of the movie. Now I don't expect a child actor to do what Robert DeNiro did for Raging Bull, but come on, at least give him a girdle. At least try to create the illusion that he was out in the wild for six months living on nothing but roots and the carcasses of birds. That's really my only complaint about this film. Otherwise, enjoy.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
74,CineMuseFilms,'great family fun' if you are a Kiwi,5,31 May 2016,"Some movies make you wonder why they were made at all. Today's crowded cinematic space suggests that if you are going to fund a feature film then surely you have a special story you want to share. Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016) has all the ingredients of a good film, including star drawcard Sam Neill, an extraordinary setting in one of the most beautiful places on earth (New Zealand) and a respected tradition of filmmaking that includes The Piano, Lord of the Rings and An Angel at My Table. But labelling Wilderpeople as ""comic dynamite"" and ""pure genius"" did not help produce as much as a single laugh in my cinema, although it would have been hard to find an honest label that gives the film any sense of purpose. But New Zealanders love it.The main plot line consists of a ""national manhunt"" by bumbling police and reward-hungry bad guys in pursuit of grouchy old Hector (Sam Neill) and likeably obnoxious 11-year old Ricky (Julian Dennison). The weirdly funny Child Welfare Officer wants orphan Ricky back in State care and Hector is regarded as a possible 'pervert' so the duo head for the hills. They must deal with wild boar, crazy hermits, hunger, broken limbs and cold, but all of this is grist for the mill as Ricky loves living rough and playing a real gangster on the run. He has never known home or family so Hector is his salvation. Like in most runaway-chase films, the fugitives keep narrowly escaping the law but eventually come to rest and find redemption in each other.This film would be 'great family fun' if you are a Kiwi. For everyone else however, even their closest Aussie cousins, this film is little more than a spectacular tourism advertisement for the rugged landscapes and mountainous lakes and gorges that are scattered across beautiful New Zealand. The cinematography is absolutely delightful and will undoubtedly encourage many to see it for themselves. Without Sam Neill's capacity for gravitas, grouchiness and gruff sentimentality the film would struggle for audiences, and even with him it's a niche market only. If you dig hard, some will find a heart-warming tale about family or its emotional variants, but there is little more to this film than a few quirky characters, a romp through the forest chased by silly people, and script that probably read better as a book.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
75,MovieCriticOnline,A little gem I missed,7,26 December 2019,"Love to see I finally enjoy, especially with so many garbage coming out, I mean overwhelming amount of bad films. I caught this because of the director's latest film, Jojo Rabbit, which was great. This was not as good as JoJo, but nevertheless well worth seeing.I just love the blend of humor and drama approached with realism, not over the top and bad acting, but a realistic approach despite some of the dialogue and situations being someone ridiculous (in a good way).Most directors would tend to make actors force the humor and literally wink into the camera for laughs, but not Taika Waititi, and thank God for that.Go see it for the adventure ride and laugh out loud moments.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
76,peefyn,Hilarious and utterly charming,8,8 October 2016,"I find it difficult to pitch this movie, because the plot does not sound all that exciting or fresh. But it is not the story that makes this a good movie, but the brilliant characters. The casting for Ricky Baker is either really good, or he got to shape his character into what we see on the screen. The same goes for Sam Neill's Hec, and the other characters they stumble upon in their journey. It's plainly a comedy, and they are not realistic in their behavior or dialogue, but it's all presented in a dead pan, understated way, similar to other New Zealand comedy, like the Flight of the Conchords.At the same time, the movie does has some good, heartwarming character moments that feels surprisingly genuine. Coping with loss, accepting change, growing old, building relationships, all of this is touched upon in many (sometimes silly) ways.All of it ads up to a very funny, charming and warm movie.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

78,coreyjdenford,Bush Buddies,10,16 September 2016,"This is my review of Hunt for the Wilderpeople (spoiler free)***** (5/5)TAIKA WAITITI HAS had a stranger career trajectory than most. That he's the man who can be trusted with Thor: Ragnarok by Marvel Studios implies that a certain kind of director, but his previous film a vampire horror-mockumentary What We Do In The Shadows – suggests someone entirely different. This is much like his previous film with a lot of charm and humour at its heart. From the first glimpse this may seem like a strange Indie movie with a ridiculous plot, but it's actually smart and it is a genuinely beautiful story about life, and the fact that it can take a rather vicious turn. If you were surprised to see Marvel hand him such a high-profile gig, then Hunt for the Wilderpeople is hardly going to make you feel differently. But that's by no means a bad thing. Coming on like a low-budget live action version of Disney Pixar's Up directed by a Wes Anderson who doesn't mind getting a little bit muddy, this adaptation of Barry Crump's 1986 novel Wild Pork and Watercress is the ideal showcase for Waititi's exuberant sense of humour and his flair for inventive absurdity. Neill is the national star, as grieving ex-convict Hector Faulkner but its 13 year-old actor Julian Dennison who gets all the best and funniest lines as juvenile delinquent Ricky Baker, he is a troublesome kid who has a tendency misbehave and is on the verge of being sent to juvenile prison but has a lot of fun on his outback adventure that gets just that little bit wild and is a whole bunch of fun and filled with laughs. One example; is when Hec and Ricky are hiding from a bunch of soldiers and Ricky is making these finger gestures and Hec can't quite figure out what he is saying, and after the soldiers leave he shouts ""I was trying to tell you it's a lot like Lord of the Rings!"" there are whole bunch of those moments hidden amongst the bush of: lets call it humour.The story is brilliant full of warmth, charm and wit that's beautifully told over ten hectic chapters which feature a rather strange eulogy (courtesy of a fantastic Waititi cameo), seemingly gigantic CGI wild boar and a climactic car chase that references Thelma & Louise, Wilderpeople presents a comically heightened world. This may nudge a few of its inhabitants enter caricature territory, but it's mitigated by a strong sense of warmth, sweetness and humanity pervading the entire film. At the beginning when Ricky meets his foster parent he first meets his Aunt Belle (Rima Te Wiata) who he likes straight away with her whimsical characteristics. His 'Uncle Hec' however doesn't much like him. In terms of character development its progressive much like the story as we learn about 'Uncle Hec' who shows to be a man who likes his space we learn about Ricky and the fact that he has to recite some Haikus that he writes himself that he says aren't particularly great but these make the character very likable and add a huge amount of human touch. But it shows that once again, Dennison is the hero here. As Ricky, he can be obtuse, offensive and obsessed with being ""gangster."" But moments he'll remind us he's an abandoned child in need of emotional security – such as when he develops a dependency on hot water bottles or envisions a girl he meets in a kind of faux-erotic '80s Flake ad.At other moments and maybe throughout the entire film it is weird but an excellent concept human touch is delivered throughout as the moments in life take hold, but along the way there are music hunting montages and a lot of other strange moments mainly involving colanders made into hats in case of 'government hunting' said by a really crazy hermit-like character who's weird but brilliantly likable straight away. Filled with heartwarming moments that will make you cry and scream but also will make you completely fall deeply in love with this handsome and extremely funny comedy which is just an insight to the weird, wonderful and beautiful mind of Taika Waititi. There's a refreshing lack of sentimentality to Wilderpeople and Waititi allows the drama to hit hard where it needs to, so it roots itself far deeper than the whimsical trimmings might suggest. Some scenes will get you swearing that there is something in your eye; others will make you honk like a goose on nitrous oxide. You'll be left with a glow that'll ensure Wilderpeople a place on your best-of-year list. This deftly balances humanity with comedy, it creates nuanced, lovable characters within a style-heightened world. Actually, perhaps Waititi's Marvel gig isn't so surprising after all, in fact we can't wait. VERDICT: A bit like Up, a bit like Moonrise Kingdom this is a beautiful tale about life that's full of charm, warmth and wit. Waititi's latest is an oddball treat of a mismatched-buddy pursuit movie.10/10 extremely handsome and funny comedy.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
79,Ramascreen,I couldn't stop laughing,10,20 June 2016,"O, my goodness, I wasn't expecting this at all, I seriously thought HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE was going to be your usual predictable story about an orphan who looks up to an older man as his father figure. But the level of brutal honesty coming from all the characters is just off the charts. This is hands down, one of the funniest movies of the year, I couldn't stop laughing.Writer/director Taika Waititi who gave us ""Flight of the Conchords,"" and ""What We Do In The Shadows"" is back with this story set in his origin place of New Zealand where a defiant city kid named Ricky (Julian Dennison) finds himself at a home of a new foster family, an aunt that actually cares for him and Uncle Hec (Sam Neill) who'd rather be left alone. But a tragedy strikes which motivates Ricky and Hec to go on the run while a national manhunt ensues and brands them outlaws.HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE is absolutely hilarious, calling it a crowd-pleaser is spot on, no better way to describe it. And as I said earlier, the characters in this film are brutally honest, there's no holding back and the comedy lies in this huge case of misunderstanding. But deep down, the kid just wants to be part of a family that for once wouldn't quickly give up and leave him out to dirt at the first sign of trouble. I've never read Barry Crump's book which was the basis for this film, but I'm guessing Waititi saw something in that story that resonates because we all want to fee like we belong somewhere; we don't want to feel like some kind of vagabond or a stray. So despite the fact that this kid, Ricky, is hard to deal with and he'll make anyone frustrated, you can tell that he's just an angry and scared teen and when you look at him from that perspective, HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE will leave a lasting impression in addition to it being ridiculously funny. The things that Ricky says and does, you'll be laughing out loud till it hurts. Julian Dennison is a revelation, I hope he gets more gigs from this point forward.-- Rama's Screen --",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
80,The_late_Buddy_Ryan,"""Stay Maori, bro!""; or, ""Who ate the guy who ate all those pies?""",9,27 December 2016,"I'm tempted to pitch this one as an updated, Kiwi version of ""True Grit"" (willful teenager joins forces with elderly badass on wilderness quest...). Julian Dennison is adorable as Ricky, a wayward city kid who's spent his life in foster care. With his thirteenth birthday approaching, he's almost aged out of the system, so when his last-chance placement on a hardscrabble farm falls through, he lights out for the bush---not the moors and mountains of LotR fame, but a trackless upland forest infested with feral hogs---rather than chance the dreaded juvie. After a couple of ingenious, almost plausible plot twists, he ends up on the lam with his soon-to-be-ex--foster parent, Hec (pron. ""Hick""; a perfect part for Sam Neill), pursued by tac units in body armor, vengeful bounty hunters and a Javertlike social worker with scary eyebrowsThe odd-couple dynamic of the mouthy Ricky in his flashy ""skux"" gear and the taciturn bushman is hard to resist. (Skux = Kiwi for playa or gangsta, depending on context.) It's formula stuff, to be sure, but the script's a lot tighter than Taika Waititi's previous efforts like ""Boy"" and ""What We Do in the Shadows"" (did that one even have a script?), and the film builds up some real ""Thelma and Louise"" momentum as the popo close in on the outlaw duo. Great locations, great soundtrack, great performances---Rhys Darby (""Flight of the Conchords"") has a dorky cameo as a crazed backwoods hermit that breaks the spell for a while, but otherwise it's all good.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

82,gavinp9,"This director and his stars certainly have the ""knack"" for a great film",8,2 January 2018,"From New Zealand's best director, Waititi ('Eagle Vs Shark', 'Boy', 'What We Do in the Shadows'), comes 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople', which is a title that doesn't make much sense, but when explained with kid logic, it does - ""Wildebeest walk thousands of miles. Feels like we've walked that may too. That must make us Wilderpeople!"" Simple premise - Ricky (Dennison) is an orphan adopted by Bella (Te Wiata) and Hector (Neill), but when Bella dies unexpectedly, Child Services want to put Ricky back in 'juvie', so he runs away into the bush, where Hector has to protect him.There's so many things to like about this film - the score is great, the little chapter subtitles keep the pace moving, the visuals are stunning (or ""majestical""), being filmed on New Zealand's north island, there's plenty of great jokes/quips and, most importantly, there's lots of heart. There's some nice sentimental moments and some sad ones, handled equally as well as the comedy. The bond formed by Hector and Ricky isn't forced or fake - it happens naturally and you become really attached to the characters, since it's mostly the two of them throughout.But there's still some time for some good support cast - Paula (House) as the 'Terminator'-like Child Services Officer hunting them down, Waititi himself as the priest and ""Psycho"" Sam (Darby). Probably my only criticism is that the film needed more Rhys Darby! It's great to see Neill understated and slowly shed his shell, but the film belongs to Dennison - chirpy, optimistic in spite of his ordeals and genuinely funny.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

After Bella unexpectedly dies, Ricky and Hector team up to escape Paula, the relentless Child Welfare lady (Rachel House). It escalated into a hilariously ridiculous car chase between Ricky, Hector and the police. There's a couple of brilliant cameos: writer/director Taika Waititi as a priest and Rhys Darby (Murray from ""Flight of the Conchords"") as conspiracy theorist Psycho Sam.Even if you only watch it for the beautiful New Zealand scenery as Ricky and Hector travel, ""Wilderpeople"" is highly recommended.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
84,ExpendableMan,Ninjas! Direwolves! Child Services!,8,11 February 2017,"Okay, so I sat down with 'Hunt For The Wilderpeople' today after hearing lots of good word of mouth and enjoying the trailer on Youtube. About fifteen minutes in, I decided I loved it. There was a scene where a Priest makes a catastrophically awful speech which was so funny I had to pause the film so I could calm down and not miss the next few scenes. That speech was made at a funeral for a character who's death was utterly heartbreaking. And essentially, that sums up why 'Hunt For The Wilderpeople' works so well. It's a film that mixes bittersweet sentimentality with some genuinely funny moments. There are moments where you'll smile knowingly to yourself, moments where you'll chuckle politely and a few where your stomach muscles will hurt from guffawing so much. There are more laughs in this film than Adam Sandler has managed in the last ten years.The film focuses on juvenile delinquent Ricky Baker as he goes into foster care at a farm house in the New Zealand bush. His new Aunt Bella adores him, while his new Uncle Hector just wants to be left in peace. Events conspire to cast Ricky and Hector into the wilderness together. One injured ankle and a few misunderstandings later, they're at the centre of a manhunt and have to flee because...well, because they didn't choose the Skuxx Life, the Skuxx Life chose them. The end result is a film that's packed with quotable dialogue, a wealth of memorable characters and an infectious sense of humour. This is a movie where there are no cool or commanding personas, everyone is a little bit rubbish. There's an over-zealous child support worker who thinks she's a Terminator, a few Cops who are nowhere near as committed as they should be and a chatty teenage girl with a cheerfully idiotic dad.Most of all though, there's the central duo. Julian Dennison's wayward thirteen year old and Sam Neil's exasperated old-timer make a wonderful lead duo. Neil makes a reluctant father figure, forever struggling against a world full of morons while Dennison's Haiku- writing teen is a great foil. They bicker constantly but inevitably, form a bond over time. But unlike so many similar themed films, their eventual friendship feels genuine. They look and behave like real people, rather than actors abiding by genre conventions. And that makes the experience all the more entertaining.By the time they hook up with the scene-stealing ""Psycho Sam,"" it's only too obvious why 'Hunt For The Wilderpeople' has been called one of 2016's best films. It's a warm, engaging and very, very funny jaunt through the forests down under, like an Antipodean 'First Blood' where everybody is just a little bit stupid. The scene where Dennison tries to make a hot water bottle with a camp fire is worth the price of admission alone.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
85,shobanchittuprolu,Hunt for the Wilderpeople is entertaining at its best with brilliant performances and music.,7,13 January 2017,"Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016): There is a strange victorious feeling when I watch a infamous indie film which marks a great impression than a heavy budget Hollywood Productions.Hunt for the Wilderpeople is such a great watch that it is easily one of the most entertaining movies of 2016.So how is it possible?Plot: Ricky (Julian Dennison) is a troubled orphan, raised on hip-hop and rejection. Placed with the latest in a series of foster families, this time on a farm far away from the city where he styles himself a gangster, Ricky is reluctant. But his foster aunt Bella (Rima Te Wiata) breaks down his defences with down-to-earth love and affectionate mockery. However, when a tragedy threatens to steal back the life that Ricky has come to love, the boy finds himself on the run in the bush with Bella's grizzled husband Hec (Sam Neill) and a dog called Tupac. Gradually, the two rejected loners who only had Bella in common find a kinship, united against the authorities that hunt them down.Plus Points:1)Performances: Sam Neil (Jurassic Park fame) is brilliant in the role of Uncle Hector.Julian Dennison is fantastic and the major pro of this movie.His chemistry with Sam Neil is the highlight of the movie.Neill's and Dennison's characters are so, so charming on-screen and are fully apt at weaving through the dramatic, comedic, and sad points of the script.2)Music: Music by Lukasz Buda,Samuel Scott and Conrad Wedde is not at all the type we heard before.They tried something new and it definitely gave a new feel to the movie.3)Cinematography: Cinematography Lachlan Milne is eye popping.The woods and the aerial shots of the village are brilliantly shot.4)Comedy: As I have said earlier,Sam Neill and Dennison characters are so hilarious that this movie never makes us feel bored.They thoroughly keep us entertained with their funny antics and dialogues.Waititi is ably supported by a uniformly hilarious and committed cast.So,Hunt for the Wilderpeople is entertaining at its best with brilliant performances and music.My rating 7.5/10",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

Not the fruit. It's pretty much a kiwi classic already, everyone here loves it and everyone here loves Taika.I don't have much to say at all, it's funny and heartfelt. It's not challenging or emotional for the most part, it's just fun and I can't even deny that. I really like most of the performances, getting the actual news anchors is pretty hilarious and almost every scene is quotable.My favourite element is easily the script, it's consistently funny and keeps slower scenes entertaining with comedic moments riddled throughout. The locations used are also great, they're places people who live in New Zealand will likely recognise and that adds another layer of enjoyment for me.I enjoy the score quite a lot but I'm a little biased as one of my relatives did all of the percussion... which is my favourite part of the composition. The score is only used in a couple scenes though and is not very special overall, the rest of the music is made up of pre-existing songs which all fit they're respective scenes well enough.Check this out if you like easy going, funny fun movies. If you prefer more of a challenge you won't enjoy it unless you have been to or are from New Zealand. Being a kiwi really helps when watching Taika's movies, makes them feel far more personal than they might be.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

The film is sweet & funny. It's all put together well. It's not going to change the world but who wants to watch a film that's trying to do that? Furthermore! Who makes a film that's trying to do that; other than Nazis and other not-rights.Well done to all involved.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
88,austin0731,Amazingly Hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt,8,21 December 2016,"Hunt for the Wilderpeople is very heartfelt and at the same time hilarious. The chemistry between the two main characters is great and this is really just a very offbeat and different film. This is a case where a small film is done right, when you go to watch a low budget movie like this you would really be looking at the story and the acting as special effects and such wouldn't exactly be the most magnificent. The mains Ricky, and his foster uncle Hec were just so likable as a pair, thanks to the amazing performances while being very different from each other they were a great pairing with great chemistry. Sam Neill was great in this film, I would say topping his performance in Jurassic Park, He had such an edge to him in this film yet his portrayal makes him so layered and relatable. Another great thing about the film. The subtle comedy in this film, it does not rely on over the top acting or slapstick to achieve its great comedy. In hunt for the wilderpeople the really ordinary and subtle dialogs and trades are charmingly written and this is probably one of the biggest laughs I've had in the theater. I really enjoyed this movie.And when this film hits with the emotions, they're not tear jerking moments but very under the skin and bitter moments. These moments that really allow viewers to relate are dished out through various aspects of the film. I must say this film makes me very intrigued as to see how director Taika Waititi will present and portray the character of Thor in Thor: Ragnarok.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
89,youngcollind,Heartwarming adventure elevated by dry wit,8,31 May 2021,"Light hearted and whimsical with a couple plot twists that take the film to unexpected places.

Perfectly paced with an excellently curated soundtrack, it manages to drift into some sentimentality without overtly sappy pandering.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
90,PetarNeo,It was a wild story,9,20 November 2016,"Ricky is a delinquent boy that was adopted by family that lives in wildness of New Zeland and as their lives are turned around they found themselves on a run from everybody. Introduction into characters is amazingly funny and keeps the light touch on everybody but as Bella dies it is obvious their lives just went down. Ricky gets on run from everybody and not long has passed he starts to feel deprived and lonely but Hec shows up and now they are both on run from police and child welfare. Their survival is funny, they find themselves in rather difficult situations and lost a lot in the way. It is obvious that they become good and their mission continues easily but after a long period of running Hec feels tired and just wants to end all so he could live a little bit normal. There are some scenes in the movie that feel ridiculous and easily solved, for instance when they are in the car and being chased by bunch of vehicles and helicopters it was probably one scene that doesn't quite fit in the movie. Also there are couple of scenes that just feel thrown in there without explanation. There are also Paula a child welfare worker, her character is probably most annoying and boring as well dull and stupidest and least funny character in whole movie. Movie has some of the great scenes shoot and incredible cinematography and comedic aspect that keeps it light but reminds you always that it's a story of escaping from reality. Sam and Julian are incredible in the movie as they try to keep each other but with mixed emotions and slowly becoming a great friends. Finally at the end you see product of the movies character forming and how they understand each other. 3.5/4",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

The introduction of Julian Dennison as Ricky Backer was great and brought so much genuine talent, humor and personality to the character of Ricky Baker. Sam Neil as Uncle Hec was great too and also had a great performance in the film, It's been a while since I've seen him and it was great just to see him back on the screen again.Every character in the film is unique and entertaining including Waititi himself who appears in the movie.

There are few movies that effectively blend gut-busting comedy, heart-retching drama, and life-affirming tenderness as deftly as this film, and I found myself wondering why it took so long for me to watch this next great tale by one of the worlds leading film makers. The movie is equal blends comedy, coming-of-age story, drama, and thriller, and I was rapt with attention from beginning to very end. The film will make you smile, make you shed a few tears, will keep you in suspense, but most importantly, it will swell your heart and remind you that while the world is going to hell in a hand-basket, that there are some genuinely good people out there who do great things for each other. It's the kind of movie you watch and makes you hug the people you love afterwards. It's the kind of movie true film connoisseurs look forward to with baited breath. It's, without a doubt, one of the finest examples of film making in 2016. Exceptional in every possible way, it deserves to be seen by anyone who enjoys and cherishes great film making.

From the Ricky Baker Birthday song to the ""Just Got Real"" scene, I was laughing out loud for most of this film.Yes, the film has a jarring number of similarities to the classic Pixar film ""Up"", however, the hilarity and witty dialogue made up for that.

96,SpoilerAlertReviews,"A delightful, refreshing and heart-felt masterpiece.",9,18 September 2016,"New Zealand's acclaimed director, Taika Waititi does an adaptation of Barry Crump's novel, Wild Pork and Watercress, about a thirteen year rebellious, wannabe-gangster, Ricky Baker getting fostered by an isolated, peculiar couple living out in the kiwi bush. Ricky, played by a chubby Julian Dennison is simply amazing, it's impossible to dislike the kid as you witness his attempts to both escape and connect with his new foster parents, the smothering, eccentric, warm-hearted Bella (Rima Te Wiata) and cold, distant, do-not-disturb Hec. (Sam Neill) Events are set in motion and without giving anything away, Hec and Ricky inadvertently end up as fugitives and go on the run in the bush, forming an unlikely bond. They meet an assortment of quirky characters each blossoming hilarious moments. Especially Rhys Darby playing Psycho Sam the Bush Man who I recognised from The Boat That Rocked as Angus Nutsford. Quite similar to the type of characters and wit you should find in a Wes Anderson film or a live action Studio Ghibli film. It's extremely refreshing when a comedy allows facial expressions of shock and frustration tell the story and release some of the best laughs. But it's not all laughs and the emotional elements are touching, sharp and incredibly heart-warming, though you're not left to wallow in sadness long before they're back on the run with the stubborn social services matron, Paula, hot on their trail, played by Waititi regular Rachel House. The soundtrack and score is mixed, but so superbly well, from enchanting harmonics to eighties synths credited to a trio better known as Moniker, a dance/trance group. It's a film certainly for my era loaded with movie references from the eighties that some younger viewers might not fully appreciate, though Ricky expresses an extensive knowledge of thug- culture naming his dog Tupac. The film certainly brought back fond memories of films like Thelma & Louise and Secondhand Lions. It's comedy genius that's delightful on a grand scale, beautifully shot with some extraordinary scenes. It's cleverly edited, brilliantly scripted and perfectly paced for 101mins of running time. One of those perfect films you can watch over and over again.

A lot of credit has to go to the actors in this one.
The Kiwis really know how to laugh at themselves and the cast carried it off to perfection.
I've watched it four times now and laugh as hard and enjoy it as much as I did the first time.
Hollywood take note: this is how it's done.

98,alisonc-1,"Coming of Age, New Zealand Style",9,17 July 2016,"Ricky Baker (Julian Dennison) is fat, unwanted and unloved - hopping from foster home to foster home in the New Zealand child care system, until he is taken in by Bella (Rima Te Wiata) and Hec (Sam Neill), in whose house he seems to have finally found a family of his own. When Bella suddenly dies, however, he is told that he will be sent back to ""juvie,"" and Ricky decides instead to run away into the nearby forest, but Hec can't let him just run off on his own, so he goes too; and soon the entire police force and Army are out searching for the fugitives.There was a terrific film a year or so ago called ""What We Do In The Shadows,"" about modern-day vampires just trying to fit in; ""Wilderpeople"" comes from the same director, Taika Waititi, and while the story here is completely different, it's just as wacky, off- beat, flat-out hilarious and occasionally poignant as that first film. New Zealand has only looked more beautiful in ""LotR"" (which is, of course referenced here in a very amusing aside); but it's really the people, especially Julian Dennison as the unforgettable Ricky, who are the stars of the film. Waititi is apparently directing the new ""Thor"" movie at present; let's hope Hollywood doesn't dilute or destroy his original, funny and deeply humanistic talent.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
99,quinimdb,Hunt for the Wilderpeople,8,22 December 2016,"""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" is a wonderful family comedy film, and I don't use the word ""family"" lightly. When most hear the word ""family"" applied to movies, it means the film is pandering to children, although I honestly believe anybody could watch this movie and enjoy it. The film deals with mature concepts of loss, loneliness, etc., and it does have some more serious moments, but the film never betrays its fun and lighthearted tone throughout; it never takes itself too seriously.Ricky is a mischievous child who has never had parents or any other sort of guardian for that matter. The parents he is given to are Hector and Bella, although the only one that really wants him there is Bella. While at first he is rebellious as always, he soon realizes that his loving guardian is all he really needed, and he starts to appreciate her. Hector, on the other hand, doesn't care much for Ricky. In fact, all he really wants is for Ricky to leave him alone. It seems the only thing either of these two characters have in common is that the only person they have is Bella.The film is fast paced and stylistically directed, and also genuinely funny and heartfelt, with great characters and great performances by the actors portraying them. In fact, it had me actually laughing out loud even while watching it alone, which is a pretty rare achievement. The film is directed with a playful tone, almost as if the audience is experiencing these events from the perspective of Ricky. What the film is really about is the bond that slowly forms between Ricky and Hector. Together they deal with change and loss, and eventually form a genuine friendship. Ultimately, both of them needed each other, even if they didn't realize it at first.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

This was nothing short of a remarkable little gem, a touch of brilliance, utterly charming in every way.I have never liked Sam Neil... yes, he can act but... in this marvellous romp of a film he's actually likable and perfect in his role.As for Julian Dennison... this kid is brilliant... nothing overdone, the best delivery of the one-liners that were all through this joyful masterpiece... I'm not so sure this boy was actually acting or just having a very good time! All of the cast were perfect, every face fit the bill.The script - not sure how much came straight from the book, possibly quite a bit - but this was truly funny! The rarest thing in a movie ever these days is anything that is genuinely actually funny. The moving moments were smart, direct and quick and all of the actors knew how to carry these moments well. I can only think that the director was superbly working all the moments, that this very, very clever, funny film was filled with care and attention and lots of remarkable talent.I couldn't help myself, I watched it two days in a row.

With a solid cast, excellent writing and an ability to laugh at one self, the New Zealanders show the Australians how to make movies.This movie kicks political correctness out the door. The female characters are as flawed as the male characters (yes, they occasionally make movies with flawed female characters these days), especially Rachel House (Paula) who is not afraid to show the ugly side of child support agencies in a light-hearted and very funny way. Sam Neill is good as Hec, but Julian Dennison (Ricky) does an even better job. Julian also performed superbly in Paper Aeroplanes (a politically correct but surprisingly good Australian movie). I would like to have seen more of Rima Te Wiata (Bella) who played a superb combination of tough, gentle and funny.There are many funny moments in this film. There are very few scenes that insult anyone's intelligence, which is rare in a movie for kids. If I had to single out a forgettable character, it would be Rhys Darby (Psycho Sam).If you are going to watch this film with kids, I would suggest it only suitable for children at least 10 years old. There is swearing and some surprisingly disturbing violence in the film. However, it's usually used to comic effect. However, if your child is sensitive, give this one a miss.This movie reminds me of how backward Australian films have become. Congratulations to New Zealand for avoiding politically correct film making. By comparison, Tomorrow When the War Began was abysmal - but the John Marsden remake ticked many politically correct boxes and passed the bechdel test (which supposedly defines quality these days).Well done New Zealand, well done.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
103,julian-mumford,Hugely enjoyable comedy adventure with serious undertones,8,17 April 2016,"Kiwi director Taika Waititi of ""Boy"" and ""What We Do In the Shadows"" fame will shortly be stepping into the big leagues directing the next ""Thor"" movie.In the meantime he has conjured up another slice of real Kiwi life on a budget that would probably fail to cover the catering bill for his new movie. Waititi translates Kiwi writer Barry Crump's book into a screenplay full of Kiwiana, irony and humour.We meet Ricky Baker (Julian Dennison) as the local police (Oscar Kightley) and ""enthusiastic"" Child Care worker ""Paula"" (Rachel House), attempt to rehouse the young Maori lad with his new adoptive foster parents. ""Aunt Bella"" (Rima Te Wiata), child loving and with a heart of gold together with husband ""Hec"" (Sam Neill), a loner bushman with little desire to house a young delinquent.Ricky's long list of offences are mentioned, including ""smashing stuff and throwing rocks"" but Paula is very determined, oft repeating her personal motto, ""no child left behind"".The opening scene sets the tone perfectly, as Ricky carefully surveys his new accommodation and quietly returns to the police car.Despite finding his new basic rural surroundings somewhat bewildering, including a gloriously bloody wild pig hunt, Ricky starts to become part of the family as he is showered by Aunt Bella's practical love and understanding.Following an event, Ricky and Hec strike out on their own into the New Zealand bush as a national man hunt for the pair commences. Can they get on, will Hec's heart eventually melt, if indeed he can find it? This is a comedy drama with emphasis on the humour with incompetent hunters, crazy bushmen (Rhys Darby) and comical situations. However framed with underlying sadness and a serious story under pinning the whole endeavour. The tone is reminiscent of director Waititi's' ""Boy"" and manages to stay consistent throughout. Waititi even allowing himself a brief cameo, to great comedic effect.There are plenty of belly laughs for those that understand and know New Zealand well. Neill essaying your everyday ""she'll be right"" Kiwi bloke, whilst providing a much needed straight man to all the shenanigans.Some scenes are pushed too far, with Paula's quest going to ridiculous length's for the sake of comedy and Darby overbalancing his scenes with his usual shtick. Somehow with the solid anchor of Dennison's fresh performance and Neill's experience, the ship manages to stay the right way up.The New Zealand bush is shown in all it's glory with the addition of a great choral track to accompany the shots of the overhead tree canopy.Overall a much more approachable and enjoyable film than ""Shadows"" which will play especially well with Kiwi's and Australians but does have broader appeal. Summary Hugely enjoyable comedy adventure with serious undertones and represents a real return to form for Waititi. It's also good to see Sam Neill on the big screen again, opposite a great new young talent.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

105,Equalizer16,Once in a lifetime film,9,1 October 2016,"A wild, hilarious, adventurous journey between an experienced old timer, and a young boy seeking thrills and treating the world like a game. Long story short, the non-animated version of UP.Hunt for the Wilderpeople ( adapted Wild Pork and Watercress by Barry Crump) portrays the journey of Ricky Baker, (Julian Dennison) a no good bad egg who has been passed from home to home, but has finally puts him with animal skinning country couple Bella (Rima Te Wiata) and Heck (Sam Neil) or informally known as Auntie and Uncle. But after events unravel, we find Ricky goes on a wilderness journey with Uncle and the pair become the most wanted in New Zealand being pursued by child welfare, and various SWAT teams.Taika Waititi, one of the masterminds behind What we do in the Shadows, and the artist currently working on the upcoming THOR Ragnarok, takes us on a marvellous experience into the nonsensical world in New Zealand of friendship, wilderness survival, and facing up against society. What enthrals the heart of the film is the nonstop laugh out loud humour that will have you without break, but also the touching bond formed between our two heroes Heck and Ricky.What we have maintaining the strength of the film is the a ray of great performances especially by Dennison, and Neil as the two share wonderful chemistry while living in the wild. We engage with our characters in a familiar tone similar to the relationship between Carl Fredrickson and Russell as the two grow and live by the spirit of the 'knack' But hats off to the rest of the supporting cast especially by Rachael House portraying the fixated mad child welfare supporter 'NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND', along with her dim witted sidekick Andy (Oscar Kightley) and then also by the excellent highlight of the film Psycho Sam (Rhys Darby).The film beautifully opens with a sublime Aerial shot of the majestic New Zealand forest, and only continues to deliver magnificent camera work by Lachlan Milne. The film holds and portrays an amazing style and atmosphere that is performed perfectly by the editing used throughout the film and superb soundtrack. Especially one montage featuring Sinner Man by Nina Simone.What Hunt for the Wilderpeople is, is not really clear as it is itself something new and unique among any other comedy adventure film, with its own original atmosphere, but is a great fun time and awesomely executed film with barrels and barrels of laughter.

107,vsks,A Charming and Funny Film Out of New Zealand,9,19 July 2016,"This New Zealand comic gem is about 13-year-old misfit Ricky Baker, whose last-resort foster placement is way, way out in the bush. Frankly, he'd rather be in urban Wellington or Christchurch, hanging with his homies, busting out to his walkman, tagging prime real estate, and living the gangsta life (in his head). But it isn't to be. He's too far and too needy to make it back. Not for want of trying. When Ricky (played superbly by Julian Dennison) disappears into the bush with his foster uncle Hec (Sam Elliot, almost unrecognizable under a beard), the child protective system moves into high gear to ""rescue"" him. This dramatic and high-profile effort to save the boy, one can only imagine, comes after a dozen years of ignoring his needs and the quality and suitability of his placements atop no real understanding of what children need. Directed with great energy by Taika Waititi, who also wrote the script, it has perhaps one chase scene that goes on too long, but as it occurs, the viewer is still basking in the enjoyment of Hec and Ricky's hilarious encounter with a real bush man. Colander, anyone? Manohla Dargis in the New York Times acknowledges Waititi's effervescent touch reminiscent of Wes Anderson, and says, ""Charming and funny, it is a drama masquerading as a comedy about an unloved boy whom nobody wants until someone says, Yes, I'll love him.""

It's not often a movie comes around that tops movies like ""Dead Poets Society"" and ""Spotlight,"" but this one really did. It topped them.Truly one of the best films ever. It pushes the line between drama and comedy, much like ""American Beauty."" In fact, and this is coming from a person whose favorite movie ever is ""American Beauty,"" this movie is EVEN BETTER. I don't like it more, but holy hell, it's actually better than ""American Beauty!"" Now, not by a whole lot, mind you, but still.The realism is the film's only slight, slight weakness.The directing was amazing. The long, sweeping shots of the beautiful New Zealand landscape were almost as well-done as the intense action scene with our two leads versus a wild boar. I kid you not, that is one of the best action sequences in film history.The writing was brilliant. Hec was written absolutely perfectly, and Ricky, while he may have suffered slight conflict of character, was very well-written as well.As far as acting goes, we owe the two leads a huge apology for not making them movie stars sooner, because they were phenomenal. The sublime involved in both characters was astounding.This movie was the funniest drama I've ever seen, or the most dramatic comedy I've ever seen. Again, (like ""Wolf of Wall Street"" and ""American Beauty,""), it's extremely hard to classify. There are scenes in this movie that will make you cry. There are scenes in this movie that will make you laugh, and did make me laugh, harder than you ever did while watching a comedy movie.I didn't expect a film to be this good again until the next Scorsese movie came out.

112,Mikelikesnotlikes,Enjoyable and pulls the right strings,7,24 October 2016,"I have quite liked all the quirky Kiwi films I've seen so far. Albeit these few were hilarious black humour horror films made many years ago. (seek them out as Easter eggs).As an Aussie recently moved to NZ I have had the opportunity to experience the national psyche, raw and unfiltered. I'm beginning to understand how the mismatch of so many high profile invading cultures and turbulent history effects the population of these small islands and generally accounts for the way Kiwis express themselves. ""The Wilderpeople"" really showcases the 'trying on' of the unduly prevalent external values which are reflected by the youth demographic in the film.I 'get' the Kiwi sense of humour and can appreciate our differences. We both have the ability to chuck off at ourselves in an exaggerated way without worrying too much about how we are being perceived by others. True, some members of both our societies will resent being portrayed this way but, broadly speaking, what you see is pretty much what you get, and we are both plainly speaking cultures. But as much as this film is an opportunity to dissect a culture flooded with American and British influences, let me discuss the film itself for the benefit of the casual viewer.The way the film continues to entertain, without bogging down in some very weighty issues, is impressive. The death scene for instance is both heart rending and deeply pivotal to the plot but doesn't slow the pace nor does it chase down a boring formulaic path.The deeply self-involved man doesn't suddenly become a loving father figure. The boy doesn't become grief stricken or withdrawn. There's a sense of honesty that tags along with the (inappropriate) humour and the pacing ensures we are kept interested and involved throughout.A fun film that shouldn't be taken too seriously. The unlikely ending wraps the film up with cartoon-like efficiency. Good for kids and adults alike.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

Child welfare!"" is a line that sums up well the absurd yet endearing humor of this film.As a director, Taika Waititi reminds me more and more of Guillermo del Toro, able to move from blockbuster movies for Hollywood to very personnel movies on their home turf, affirming their own brand of stylishness and writing. The other thing they both have is an eye and love for actors. The pairing of veteran Sam Neil and young Julian Dennison is gold.This is a road movie with two very relatable people crossing paths with a range of strange characters, each encounter defining the relationship of the man and the child a little deeper.I believe you won't regret spending a couple of hours hunting for the Wilderpeople.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

116,RileyOnFilm,This child wants to be left behind,6,25 November 2016,"Hands on activities are always better for kids. Getting away from a desk and into the wilderness would be an effective way to foster problem solving skills in a child. What's more, real life problems yield better solutions than ones in book at a desk in a public school. These are ideals I agree with, even as a public school teacher myself.This is a quirky and strange movie if you don't pour some sort of meaning into it. Early on, I had a meaning I got from it and that's why I think I enjoyed it so much. I'll tell you what it was, as long as you remember that movies are like all art: you get out what you perceive from it.The evil social worker lady represented the restrictive educational policies of George Bush. They were called. as most will recall, ""No Child Left Behind."" She in fact repeats this phrase many times as her battle cry to find the protagonist. It's also derived from the bumper sticker wisdom: ""All who wander are not lost.""This film looks a lot like Moonrise Kingdom in its silliness and campy presentation. Some will find humor in that alone. A preteen juvenile delinquent keeps escaping from school and eventually, after his caretaker aunt dies, he goes on a wilderness expedition with his ""step-uncle."" A bunch of stuff happens, some interesting, some funny, some dull. At any rate, it becomes another aphorism: ""Life is a journey."" It's made to show how much more this child gets out of surviving with his uncle than he would in public school, or the juvenile correctional system anyway. The actors are all speaking in Australian accents which makes it seem like an independent film (which in fact it is).If you're willing to sit through a whole movie of goofiness to see this director's point about open and unbridled education, you'll probably laugh a lot. I've seen better quirkiness like this in the film Nacho Libre. That's also about an underdog who emerges victorious  and the jokes are funny. I'd recommend this film for fans of understated humor and who don't agree with restrictive educational policies. I'd say it will be liked six and one half-dozen the other by the general public.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

The boy and his reluctant protector escape from the child welfare officials who seek to put the boy into juvenile prison. The escape develops from a survival story into a manhunt of epic proportions.This movie has heart and rhythm!! — It's brimming with life, New Zealand humor and most of all: A genuine sense of a developing friendship. The story never prods along. It feels fast paced but not rushed, with just enough time to give each character some depth.Cinematographically, there's some really cool editing in here and some beautiful high production shots of New Zealand's impressive landscape, overlaid by funky 80's tunes.

119,maxastree,finished movie from Taika Waititi,8,10 April 2016,"This movie is really good - I have to say I enjoyed it and would probably see it again.A far more developed example of what Waititi can do as a director and storyteller; the film has examples of pathos, comedy, action, drama, art film, satire, good cinematography and even a few decent VFX shots. His last film, vampire mockumentary ""What We Do in the Shadows"" was a lot of fun but also a narrative disappointment, despite NZ media committing to expose the film and help generate sales. Something of a misguided indulgence, ""Shadows"" made the mistake of letting three or four (very) minor indie celebs improvise in digital for many, many hours, then the director tried to create a concrete whole in editing and post. Didn't work. Great intro though.Hunt for the Wilderpeople focuses on the life of Ricky Baker - a young, overweight, orphaned juvenile offender that idealizes hip hop and creates haiku poetry as a method of externalizing emotional conflict, due to the influence of counseling and therapy sessions. Stuck in New Zealand's sub-par youth welfare system (known for endless governmental restructuring with little or no substantive improvement), Ricky ends up on a rotting farm somewhere in the rural back blocks with foster parents. The film clearly shows elements of the barren, social realist film of early 80s NZ, but with bigger, better cinematography, and Waititi's indie sense of the quirky and offbeat. ""Quirky"" can become a meaningless attribution in today's market of indie features where anybody and everybody can have a go at being ""quirky"" to make up for budget and spectacle, but this film also has real nuance and character development, and a quality cast that seem to get the idea of being a bit ""quirky"" and ""meta"" without forgetting that emotional investment is what an audience really needs to feel involved with the story. Rachel House is hilarious. So's the director in an excellent cameo.Some of the early scenes don't read as naturally as they could, and also Tioreore Ngatai-Melbourne's mother in the film is referred to but is never actually seen for unknown reasons. In addition, New Zealanders might complain about the films location improbabilities, but that's been standard practice in US features for years. Cool movie!! Go see it!!",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

121,rachelgallit,Bewilder(people)ing and Heartwarming,10,14 October 2018,"This movie is a kooky blend of New Zealand sass and off-kilter heartwarming familial bonding. When troubled youth Ricky is sent to a farm in the Bush as his last option before Juvenile Detention, he comes to live with curmudgeon Hec and his kindly wife, Bella. When Bella dies, Ricky flees into the wild lands and is pursued, and eventually bonds with Hec, as they survive the perils of the wilderness, and of a life on the run from the law. In a fantastically oddball coming of age tale, director Taika Waititi presents a unique point of view on the challenges of growing up as a child in the welfare system in NZ. As the antisocial and set in his ways Hec opens his heart, and gangster-wannabee Ricky learns to put aside appearances and work with integrity, the movie presents fulfilling character progression alongside gorgeous natural scenery. Lachlan Milne was in charge of Cinematography and created a visually delicious film in line with his best known stunning work: Stranger Things.

The kid playing Ricky Baker is excellent too and delivers his lines with perfect comic timing. The female parole officer who thinks she's the Terminator and he's Sarah Connor is hilarious too.

But then they kill off the most interesting character (the aunt) and what you get after that is a New Zealand version of ""Up"". It was so refreshing to see a female character with such humor and joy and rich personality like the aunty character. And then you are left with the cliché of an old grumpy man and a problematic fat kid, that didn't lose a single pound during God knows how many months of living in the bushes. OK, the story is alright, but the jungle chase gets just boring at some point and the dialogues weren't that interesting as in the beginning. The movie ends with a spectacular car chase with explosions like it was some cheap action movie. That was quite disappointing for me.

Based on the book Wild pork and watercress by Barry Crump and adapted by the film's director Taika Waititi, it's a wonderful romp through some of NZ's most scenic wild places beautifully captured by cinematographer Lachlan Milne. Julian Dennison is 12 year old Ricky Baker and Sam Neill is 'Uncle' Hector and between them, they both make and steal the show.

130,yourfavoritecritic,"Like Up, but Make it Gangster",8,29 December 2020,"Hunt for the Wilderpeople, is written and directed by Taika Waititi and stars Sam Neill and Julian Dennison. The film follows the misadventure of a young boy, named Ricky and his foster Uncle Hec, as the two escape into the wilderness all while a nationwide manhunt is underway to find the pair. Taika Waititi has made a name for himself as being a very respected writer/director, with a quirky style á la Wes Anderson and Hunt for the Wilderpeople more than solidifies his reputation.I went into Hunt for the Wilderpeople with moderate to high expectations after hearing pretty positive praise surrounding the film, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the end result, enjoying the film from start to finish. It should be noted, as many other's have pointed out, that the film's framework is very similar to Pixar's Up (2009); as both films feature a disgruntled older man who has just lost someone close to him and an energetic young boy who has a semi-warped view of the world and lacks a parental figure. However Hunt for the Wilderpeople, does an excellent job differentiating itself from the surface level comparison and can be enjoyed just as much as the Pixar classic.I found the bond that grew between Hec and Ricky to be heart-warming as their adventure elapsed many months, encountering all kinds of different people, problems and animals along the way. I really rooted for the pair, even when their situation grew to be more dire, I must praise Waititi in that aspect as he was able to really make the character's likeable and easy to root for. It also helps that the performances were also great with, as Neill and Dennison both gave compelling performances that were full of heart. I was particularly impressed by Julian Dennison, who I was worried was going to become loud and annoying as the movie progressed, however through his solid portrayal of Ricky, he grew to be a protagonist that I really enjoyed seeing. Although the dynamic between the two character's is a joy to watch, the film has a equally pleasing presentation that is interesting and unique in its own right. Hunt for the Wilderpeople is presented in chapters, which signifies a new point in the duo's journey, and usually hints at what's to come. The film is also really pleasing to look at, with many interesting shots, one of my favourites being how the filmmakers captured montages, with one shot pans that almost superimposed the character's moving about different parts of the forest. It's a little difficult to explain but noticeable when viewing the movie, and I thought it was a clever way to establish the journey without featuring a montage littered with jump cuts.In closing, Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a highly enjoyable film that I see myself returning to, it's clever, heartwarming and full of adventure. Although aspects of the story do not try to reinvent the formula of a misfit-buddy film, I still took away lots from this film and is overall a treat to watch. There a many small details that I'm sure I didn't notice as you can clearly tell Waititi poured a lot of heart into the creation of this film and for that reason I am giving Hunt for the Wilderpeople a 8/10.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

I'm assuming it's a unique brand of New Zealand humor and it's done quite well.Given enough time, the film could possibly move to cult status due to the bigger-than-life character villains who seem to take their establishment jobs far too serious.The plot may deliver a few over the top stereotypes yet there's also many unexpected gems. An off-beat spin to the typical coming of age story for a lad who's had a rough start to life. But rather than take a dark and brooding tone, the film uses indigenous storytelling and pop culture influences as the boy's escapism tools. When he lands in yet another foster home, he finds a surrogate family willing to accept his odd behavior. Yet, the happiness doesn't last and tragedy strikes again. Rather than go back to the authorities, the boy decides to fake his death. This is a lad used to running on imagination rather than common sense. So he decides life in the wilderness is a better option to yet another foster or group home. Unfortunately, he's ill-equip to handle the rough terrain let alone hunt. The rest of his journey unfolds in unpredictable ways although we know eventually he will get caught. Most viewers will probably root for a happy ending or at least envision him escaping his fate. All I will say is the film doesn't disappoint, which is a good thing.These days international and indie films are on my watchlist as I'm a bit jaded towards Hollywood and it's CGI regurgitation formulas. I'm still trying to figure out why there's a need to make both Suicide Squad and Dr. Strange. One would have sufficed!

Checking the cast list I notice 2 characters: the beautiful, talkative girl on the horse and her daggy dad omitted. Who the hell are they? They were great! No wonder Sam Neil has had such an amazing career. The layers he reveals in his grumpy old man transforms him into a big-hearted hero. Rima Te Wiata gives us an Aunty filled with such joy, love and musical talent that she lingers in the heart.

New Zealand audiences love it as they see a part of themselves and their lives reflected back to them - Bush tramping and hunting are as stereotypically Kiwi as you can be. Maybe I wasn't in the right mood at the time but the pathos was lost on me, appearing ham-fisted. Some of the acting was cartoonish but maybe that was the point, it is a comedy after all, but it didn't work for me. Perhaps I have seen too many good comedies down the years done really well.

For starters, the child protagonist is still just as obese after 4 or more months in wilderness survival mode. Maybe the director thought that was absurdist humor, but I thought it was just stupid, and even felt angry that the director would use the boy's obesity as a comedy vehicle. The acting of the woman who plays that Social Services woman is atrocious. Sam Neill acts like he wishes he were somewhere else. The writing is poor. The film is rarely funny...too many flat gags and witty exchanges that are not witty. Much does not ring true about this film, from stilted conversation to contrived, silly scenarios that wouldn't even be charming in a fantasyland. Clichés abound, like the wild boar being shot by the boy just before it attacks then plopping down dead right in front of him. There's even an American-style car chase with a police car flipping over.

154,AussieMovieReviews,That Score is just a marvel.,7,9 January 2017,"7/10. When a boy and his foster Uncle, (Sam Neill) go missing, there is a nation wide manhunt to track them through the New Zealand Bush. This is a real wacky movie, that at times is so weird, and at others times has heart. Young Julian Dennison is hilarious, and does such a fantastic job for a child actor, his accent and his attitude just cracked me up. He is also paired well with Sam Neill. Two completely different kind of people come together to form a bond, that plays well on film. And the score for this movie is so out there, it is so weird and quirky, and yet somehow marvellous at the same time. It's worth watching just to listen to the score, it's a little Tarantino esque. This is a real stand out for Director Taika Waititi, I think he has done New Zealand proud. I found the movie enjoyable, quirky and quite funny at times. Though maybe not for everyone, I would recommend seeing it. Hunt for the Wilderpeople #huntforthewilderpeople",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
155,laptoppclaptop,Lovely movie but not Waititis best,7,1 July 2016,"I do love Taika Waititis movies and I totally dig his style. I also think he is a very talented and unique movie-maker. I liked ""Wilderpeople"", but in my opinion it was not as strong as Boy or What we do in the shadows. I feel that his off-beat low key style went a little too far this time, so that as an audience I lost emotional connection with the story and characters a few times. The flow of the movie was not as good as in Shadows or Boy, and with this style of movie, the right flow is very important. Also, it felt at times that the style was prevailing over the content. It is interesting that even though the story line in What we do in the shadows was even more fragmentary, it somehow worked there. And even though Shadows had a also a very unique styling it never felt like forced or artificial. Also I thought that the dogs in the film were totally unnecessary. They did not add anything to the story and the way they were filmed created the feeling of dis-continuity. In some scenes the dogs appeared and in others seemed to have disappeared forever. Then again they appeared erratically as if the director suddenly had remembered: ""Blimey, i had the dogs a few scenes ago, I need to show the ears or the tail for continuity. ""Having said that, overall Wilderpeople was still a positive movie experience. All characters were funny and likable, even the evil social services inspector. The kid who played the main role was simply wonderful and so cute. Sam Neil as ""uncle"" and actress who played ""auntie"" did great job as well. I loved the cinematography, the intentional bending rules of ""good"" cinematography, the New Zealand-specific details in peoples homes, etc. I admired the unique and quirky cinematography already in the Shadows, and here Waiti continues serving an intentionally off-beat strange and wonderful cinematography. Also I liked the idea - two free spirits, outcasts of the society against the heartless and bureaucratic system. I loved that in the end the kid and the uncle were reunited in a straight forward happy end fashion. Even though the film had some flaws, definitely would recommend it as another example of talented and unique Taika Waititis work and also showcasing some wonderful NZ actors. Ups, almost forgot:besides the leads, auntie and social inspector one of the best characters is the wild bush man, played by the funnyman whose name always escapes me but he was the leader of verwolves in What we do in the shadows (Remember ""We are the verwolves, not the swear-wolves""?)",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
156,mother_of_popcorn,Can't Be Faulted - Full Of Laughs; Quirky And Crazy Fun!,10,28 June 2016,"Knowing that Taika Waititi, the comedic mastermind behind the hilarious What We Do In The Shadows and Boy was also the force behind Hunt For The Wilderpeople, I was jumping out of my skin to know more. Watching the trailer, the scene was set for me to thoroughly enjoy this film.And it didn't disappoint full of great one-liners and incredibly dry humour throughout, I am struggling to find a fault with this film. Sam Neill is fantastic as the no-nonsense grumpy old foster parent, as is Rachel House as the stern, unstoppable Child Services worker Paula ('no child left behind' her self-appointed motto). But no one can out-shine Julian Dennison who plays no-good delinquent Ricky Baker. His comedic delivery is spot-on and you're rooting for him from beginning to end.I'm so thrilled to see our Kiwi neighbours soaring in the film industry, particularly with Taika having co-written the next Disney animation Moana and also taking the reins of the upcoming Marvel juggernaut Thor: Ragnarok which is currently in pre-production.This movie was so great that I actually saw it twice if you love quirky comedies a la Flight Of The Conchords and Wes Anderson, you will love this as much as I did.motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

160,jen-lynx,An almost perfect film about growing up and growing old,10,21 September 2016,"Going to the theater and seeing a movie on the big screen can be such a magical experience, especially when watching a film as poignant and funny as ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"". I had heard great things about the film and the reviews were mostly positive, but I just kept putting it off. When the last local cinema was clearly winding down its showings, I decided this was one I was not going to miss. I could not be happier with that decision. This is, hands down, the best movie I have seen this year.This story is told in several chapters, each a unique experience. Ostensibly a coming of age story, ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" is also a perfect example of the pitfalls of social and professional media, that is, the inevitable distortion of fact. A so-called problem child, Ricky (Julian Dennison), finds a new home with a couple in rural New Zealand. The wife, Bella, is ready and willing to take on the challenge of a boy who is a difficult placement for Child Welfare Services. This may sound like a recipe for a bad film on the Hallmark Channel, but an excellent script, some brilliant acting, and outstanding cinematography brings this film to new heights, or like a lake that is closer to the gods.This is not a realistic story. This is a story of pure fiction. I say this because some reviewers seem to think otherwise and were disappointed by the lack of realism. I don't know what to say other than perhaps it is time you got a new hobby. ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" is a lovely experience and with the overhead shots of the mountains of New Zealand, a breathtakingly beautiful experience too. I will be adding this one to the collection, and seeing as this is the second film of Waititi's that I have loved, will be adding him to my list of must see directors.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
161,davorslistdepot,The best film I saw in a decade,10,20 September 2016,"OK, I'm not living under a rock to give such a bombastic title. It most certainly is THE BEST film I saw in many years. Trumps Hollywood at every level imaginable. After initial shock of amazement, I also read a book. It is even better than a book because the melodramatics are stripped to a bare minimum, so the fun is not spoiled by it. It is there, but only just. Great intervention in a script. This film is fun. It is brave and sincere. Even Taika appears for a short role. It speaks of freedom and integrity in a way that it is also fun, but serious, and then fun again. It is easy to identify with the characters, although it is unlikely you'll ever even meet anyone with such lifestyle. In short - I'm amazed. I had great fun.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

163,huey2088,It's a rare gem.,8,2 June 2016,"They don't make movies like this one anymore where plot and character building and relationships take centre stage. Also where sequential explosions and CGI can render the viewer's senses numb in even the mini blockbuster nowadays, there is a charming sentiment that Taika Waititi brings to every one of his films. He injects it in almost every scene for Hunt for the Wilder People. It is the laid back humour where you have to listen carefully or you'll miss the subtle jokes that keeps you involved. The plot is simple, but realistic especially about how humans interact with each other and the impressions they leave behind. The cast is very gifted, from the experienced and amazing Sam Neill, to newcomers such as Julian Dennison and Tioreore Ngatai-Melbourne. Kiwi talent is inexhaustible and unique. The story explores a few of life's issues such as bureaucracy, teenage pregnancy and mental health just to mention a few. And for those who like action, there is also a heart stopping high speed car crash scene. This is a special movie where it will make you chuckle at some rude jokes to bringing some tears to your eyes or just marvel at the beauty of NZ nature. But it will definitely make you think about a lot of things, from the past to the present. It's good in a way that there are so many predictable trilogy blockbusters with lacklustre story lines out there and coming soon. It's when you stumble across movies like Hunt for the Wilder People it really brings you back to the truly important issues in life and the people in it. However, don't despair. As Waititi intended, life is more tolerable when you laugh through it.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
164,esthercross,Taika Watiti is a genius,10,26 November 2016,"I was initially concerned about seeing this film because going to the cinema having forgotten your long distance specks can turn a fresh 2016 release into an 80s home video. It wasn't so bad though as I was the keeno in the front row and I didn't notice that the film was slightly fuzzy because of how relentlessly entertaining it was! There was something instantly inviting about the plot and the well curated quick shots, quirky style and humour had won me over within the first 5 mins. Taika Waititi continues to deliver the treat that is the dry kiwi sense of humour which was on tremendously high form and I was roaring with laughter at many points (causing a rather niche pain in my collar bone). This films style of humour is that winning combination of being both ludicrously silly and intelligently observant. The characterisation of tough yet quirky farm lady Bella will warm every ventricle of your heart! We only see her for the first 15 minutes of the film but in that small time frame we become very fond of her eccentricities, and the relatable familiarity that comes from the details in this brilliantly portrayed character. She is a refreshingly strong female who I feel I've been waiting so long to see depicted so triumphantly! Oh how I love a good old unlikely protagonist. The gorgeously rotund lead character Ricky was portrayed amazingly by Julian Dennison. The character was charming in his errors. He is written off at the start for being a useless foster home reject and then as the adventure unfolds develops a strength of character that retains and celebrates his differences at the end. The clash of contemporary trend in this movie with traditional raw hunting life was a fascinating feature of the film. Whenever there is modern references within a film it generally falls flat as a embarrassing bid to be accepted by young audiences, but this film tackled up to date references in a very switched on way! The film was a sarcastic adventure tale of an unlikely union between two of society's rejects one old and bitter the other young and naive which allowed for such poignant chances for the characters to learn from each other. The film definitely doesn't lack for moving moments and because of how successfully sensitive the film seemed to be in capturing the human condition through humour I just knew the film would expertly deliver on the inevitable emotional scene! (which yes defiantly stole a tear or two) I would definitely recommend this film if you are deficient in genius references, beautiful New Zealand landscapes, and some tear shed attributable to both laughter and mild sobbing. It is not one to be missed!",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

The film features a typical strong performance from Sam Neill, but the young lead Julian Dennison is also fantastic. Waititi has a knack for finding true gems for child actors and knows how to get standout performances from them. This film is full of the humor and charm you'd expect from Waititi but also delves deeper into the human issues faced by youth growing up in out of home care. It is a touching feel good story without being over the top cheesy and beautifully filmed in remote locations of the New Zealand wilderness.

While Hector, played by Sam Neil, teaches the young boy about wildlife, the guy teaches lessons about today's world and pop culture. This film is less funny for Waititi, it is more about life, about relationships with each other. Ricky's figure just craves one family for nothing else. You'll find that, too, but the guardianship gets in and they want to take you back to the correctional facility. The relationship between the two characters is well structured, neither suppressing the other. The film's humor is more based on figuring out the contrasts between the two characters, so we can follow the two unfortunate frantic chases along with crying and laughing.The film is about responsibility for each other and ourselves, trust, exclusion from society.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

It's silly, funny, touching and sweet, but never saccharin.It's jam packed with irreverent humour, in-jokes at New Zealand's expense and pokes fun at outsiders preconceptions of Kiwi's.The characters are also all great. It's probably my favourite role I've seen Sam Neil play in a long time. He is brilliant. The supporting cast are likewise, excellent. Rachel House's child protection officer, has some of the funniest lines and plays what could have easily been an over-the-top character, on just the right side of mad. Her moment on Kiwi breakfast TV had me rolling on the floor.The star of the show however, is Julian Dennison's gangster orphan. Who's crimes include such heinous acts as, loitering and throwing stuff. He is effortlessly funny throughout and very likable. He is able to handle subtle humour, sensitivity and drama in a way that would put many actors 3 times his age to shame.The locations too are beautiful, really showing off NZ's landscape.If you like comedy with a bit of heart and don't mind silliness on occasion, this movie is right up your street.

Then it could have been a truly, great film. Unfortunately, Taika Waititi felt the need to crank the humor up to eleventystupid every once in awhile in an otherwise very sincere story. Seeing the polar characters of the 13 year old, overweight kid Ricky and his grumpy foster parent Hector come together and develop their friendship was not only very funny. It was told with respect for the characters. Both actors, veteran Sam Neill and youngster Julian Dennison, did an awesome job in portraying these misfits, who both seem to have no place in society. The movie worked best, when it was just the two of them. Unfortunately, you cannot say the same for the rest of the cast, most notably perhaps for the cameo of director Waititi himself as a minister at a funeral service. He was a caricature and not taken to be serious for any moment. And he was not the only one, who ruined the tone of the movie for me. Paula, the head of child welfare, who was supposed to be the antagonist, also was just laughable. I just couldn't take her serious, she was just preposterous, and that undermined a lot of the story for me. Both Ricky and Hector had real problems: they have been sort of exiled from the rest of the world, they had to deal with some real, personal tragedies and I rooted for them. But this was undermined by characters and plot lines that were not for a single second believable and completely out of place. I wish, the movie had taken it's own convictions a little bit more serious. Then, this could have been a really touching movie. Now, it is more of a farce, that has some real funny moments, two great actors in the middle, but ultimately feels a bit hollow.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

But despite its quirky sensibility and smattering of genuinely delightful humour, the film does fall flat at times, leaving a prevailing sense of desire for emotional stakes and consequences to be further built upon and delved into. Whilst applaudable not to dwell on more tragic moments, more visible reflection from characters and subsequent conflict (such as post-Wild Boar encounter) is noticeably absent. On the other hand, you can understand with the soft approach of the movie this decision, which clearly delights in its light frothiness and affability.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

It was Hunt for the Wilderpeople that started my interest in Taika Waititi, as well as Thor: Ragnarok before Jojo Rabbit. Those are the three movies I've seen by him so far. He's definitely the funniest guy from New Zealand and one of my favorite filmmakers. Now, Hunt for the Wilderpeople, I would say, is probably the funniest movie I've ever watched, especially if it's from New Zealand, excluding any superhero comedy movies like Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man, and Thor: Ragnarok. Taika had a short cameo in the movie, which was quite hilarious. The directing from Taika Waititi is very stylish and full of wacky fun. The performances of Julian Dennison as Ricky Baker and Sam Neill as Hector Faulkner were very impressive, as well as their chemistry and their adventure throughout the movie is entertaining. The humor throughout the movie is also wickedly funny and quirky at the same time, which will leave you laughing out loud and crack yourself up.. You could almost quote some of the lines. It also doesn't just have comedy, it also has some charm and adventure that you can enjoy, as well as some fast pacing.

It sports hilarious performances from Julian Dennison (Ricky) and Sam Neill (Hec), however, I wanted to talk about Taika Waititi's direction in this film.At times, his work reminded me a bit of Wes Anderson, with its use of jump cuts to guide the viewer through specific scenes. By doing this, Waititi speeds up the pace of the film. It is not a frantic pace, but one that highlights the best parts of what it has to offer, such as the first birthday party Ricky shares with his new foster parents or the scene with him dancing in the forest. Waititi's direction highlights those hilarious moments so well. I also really enjoyed the way he framed specific characters. He tended to start with a character in the center of the frame - specifically in a close up - and fill out the rest of the frame from there. I thought that focus drew my attention to the center of the frame well.

In many instances the movie tries to be funny by being over the top but it just does not work. It's also really bad at showing how much time has elapsed. At various points in the movie the characters have to say how much time has passed between scenes because it's not illustrated visually.

The characters were well realised and even though some of those on the fringe were caricatures, all felt that they were real people. I can give this no higher praise than this is up there if not better than the best of Wes Andersons oeuvre. The two leads are superb with young Dennison fantastic but I absolutely loved Neill as the grumpy reluctant ""Uncle"", but even the most minor of supporting characters were well realised.

The relationship between Hec and Ricky feels organic and the actors play off each other incredibly well. The farcical nature of the over the top social worker Paula is also one of the excellent points of the film, providing some wonder lampooning of Hollywood archetypes.One other thing I must call out as a point for me that really makes this enjoyable is that it never insults its audience trying to crowbar in overly idealized Hollywood style happy endings. Not to say the film ends in a sad way, far from it, but it's a realistic and three dimensional ending with fleshed out characters that do not simply ride off into the sunset in perfection. The fact that every character is flawed and human is exactly one of the finest points of the film, and the story lives up to those characters.Highly recommend this, well worth watching.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

The main emotion here being used is anger. But when the child is alone, he doesn't seem upset in the least about his situation, only ever grumpy. It bothered me a little and the acting pulled me out of it a few times. I think the boy did a great job in the comedic and conversational parts, in fact the conversations seemed very real and you can see in some situations where Sam Neil wants to say more but looks like he doesn't know what to say. One thing I hate about amateur movies, I'm sorry if you don't see this as one but I do, is they put in scenes, take shots of things because they cost money and or put an actor in the spotlight, but they feel There are a few slightly lulling moments you might be bored by, but some real gems like the lord of the rings reference and some Rhys Darby moments you'll probably love.

187,baileykerr,Fun movie with fun characters,8,18 August 2016,"Ricky Baker is a thirteen year-old delinquent of the New Zealand foster care system. He is under the delusion that he is a thick-skinned gangster, constantly spouting ""I didn't choose the skuxx life, the skuxx life chose me"". He is not too much of a delinquent that he is unlikable but he doesn't have a heart of gold either. He is not the brightest bulb in the lamp but picks up on necessary lessons quickly if the right people are around to teach him. He is wildly obese, clueless as to how to survive in the wilderness, and he even commits destruction of property in an attempt to convince the foster care system that he is dead (he never had a chance of being successful with that last one). Ricky Baker could have easily been written as an obnoxious dead-weight of a kid-character. What makes the Hunt for the Wilderpeople so fun to watch is that he is funny and as much as his past hurts him, he doesn't spend his time moping about it. What makes the film even more fun to watch is his partnership with the rugged, primeval Hec played by Sam Neill (finally a role where he does not wear that obvious smile silently screaming ""Can you tell I'm the villain of this picture?"").Now onto the story. Ricky has been placed in a home with new foster parents, Bella and Hector or ""Hec"" for short. The two connect with the primitive way of living, hunting down boars with only knives, containing essential skills for surviving in the forest (or ""bush"" as the New Zealanders call it) before possessing skills for housekeeping and such. Bella is excited to have Ricky stay with them and shows it often with motherly affection while Hec is, of course, not so keen to the arrangements. He is closed off and the more grizzled of the couple.Early on in the film, Bella unfortunately passes away, causing the foster care system to determine that Ricky must be placed in a new home. Hec is not pushing Ricky out the door but he has thrown it open to indicate that Ricky should pass through it at some point. Ricky does not want to go back into the system. What is his best course of action then? Leaving a note claiming that he has burned himself to death in the property barn, leaving a drastically unconvincing dummy of himself in the barn, burning the entire barn down instead of only the dummy as he intended, then running away in the bush with few supplies and even less knowledge on how to ration. Of course. I'm surprised I didn't think of that first.Ricky's scheme to run away causes Hec to come get him, which causes Hec to break his ankle, which causes the two to be stuck in the bush for a few weeks, which causes the foster care people to begin a search under the accusation that Hec has kidnapped the boy, and the story spirals from there. Throughout the film, I kept thinking to myself that if this were to happen in real life, chances are quite strong the main characters would not survive as long as they do. But I found myself smiling, laughing, and interested in their welfare. Why? Because the movie gives a shrug and casually prefaces ""I know this is out there. But I'm here to tell a good joke or two. Not to please the public"". And surprisingly through that attitude, it pleases a majority of the public.Hunt for the Wilderpeople is exceptional at recognizing one essential element of comedy; putting interesting characters into a funny situation and watching how they specifically handle it. One small but well choreographed scene finds Hec and Ricky running away from men who want to hand them over to the police. They manage to get back into the forest, then decide that the only thing to do to keep them both out of the government system is to survive in the bush. They begin to run away. After two steps of running, Hec's bad ankle and Ricky's obesity cause them both to come to a grinding halt, panting like they just sprinted for one hundred meters. After a few seconds of panting, they agree that a ""fast walk"" would be equally effective then begin their journey again.While I am not sure this film deserves its 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, I definitely enjoyed myself. It had elements of Wes Anderson in there, it stayed only as long as it needed to, and it followed silly yet grounded characters who I wanted to see achieve happy endings in a great story.

188,Coolaj56,The Peak of Waititi's Comedy,8,28 February 2019,"A crazy fun comedy. It is a bit slow early on, but it picks up pretty quickly and remains fun the rest of the way. The last couple chapters of the film have the best jokes as well as some strong emotional moments to round out this excellent film from Taika Waititi.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

190,Esteban10,"Funny, smart: feel-good comedy of the year!",8,15 October 2016,"Congratulations to the team that made this movie. It's genuinely funny (i had a few laugh-out-loud moments, and i'm not the kind of person who has much of them), and also capable of make you feel about the characters. Speaking about them, Sam Neill delivers a very believable and moving performance. The kid is brilliant also (in one of his scenes he made me almost choke in laughter bi just saying 'what?'). The movie starts slow but gains pace throughout and never loses it. If I would describe the movie, it's a tale about two guys who live excluded from society and discover together the concept of family and partnership. Watch it with you friends, girlfriend, parents, anybody. This is a film for everybody. Gonna watch it again for sure.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
191,freekyfridays,It's the kind of film that you'll be talking about years from now,10,15 March 2016,"While Taika Waititi takes over Hollywood with his next two projects: THOR 3: RAGNORAK (2017) and a sequel to his funniest film to date WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS (2014), hysterically entitled WE'RE WOLVES, his latest ""little film that could"" should put Sam Neil back on the map with a wonderfully gracious performance.This magical realist New Zealand adventure drops an unloved, rebellious, little fat kid into the wild, wild southwest — and I'm here to say that this was the feel good film of Sundance this year. Luckily writer/director Waititi has held onto his unique dry-humor, which dates back to his debut feature EAGLE VS. SHARK (2007) as well as his underrated second film BOY (2010). But this krazy kids flick is not just satisfied with referencing all of the 1980s films its creator grew up loving: The movie itself is an actual throwback to the kind of children's fare that were laced with some very heavy adult issues like Walter Murch's RETURN TO OZ (1985) and Nicolas Roeg's THE WiTCHES (1990). Make sure to catch this truly loving film upon its initial theatrical release. It's the kind of experience that you'll be talking about years from now, perhaps even sharing with children of your own.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

195,morrismatalon,Delightful!,7,9 March 2018,"I just saw ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" (2016) and it was absolutely wonderful. All the performances were good. I didn't hate the kid and Sam Neil was very good as Hector. There was a very believable bond between Ricky and Hector, and when they had the ""get mad at each other and leave"" scene, it didn't feel forced (partly because of the subject matter) and I loved that it didn't go on for too long. All the cinematography was fantastic. It was very funny and I love the kind of dark sense of humor that the movie had. I think this had a great soundtrack! and it's not just great songs that already existed and wasn't composed for the movie (though there was a lot in there), also the composed music is really good. It gives off a very mysterious feeling. All the characters were very likable, and not stereotypes (except ""psycho sam""), and it was great. I wouldn't give it a 10/10 like some people are, because it has some problems. There was some stereotypes in the movie, (An example being ""psycho sam"" being the conspiracy theorist stereotype) I think there should have been some more time devoted to the relationship between Ricky and Bella, and I think the plot was kinda predictable. But, I still think this movie was very fun and enjoyable, and I'll definitly recommend it. i give this a 8/10",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

I didn't expect to laugh so hard I was grabbing my stomach, or almost starting to cry the next moment.

197,harihar90,"Not quite 'Majestical', but pretty close :)",8,24 September 2016,"Beautiful locales, a brilliant score and sound track, a host of funny,colorful characters that manage to stay on just the right side of the quirky-annoying line, an extraordinary sense of place, Sam Neil with all the gruff you can ask for and the funniest kid you have seen in movies in a long time.. This movie was damn near 'majestical' for much of its run-time :) An underwhelming climactic 'War' segment notwithstanding, this is still a blast with bucket-loads of charm and some crackling chemistry between the two leads played by Sam Neill and Julian Dennison (the kid). And if you are not grinning like an idiot by the end of this movie you (I am sorry to say this) are dead inside!",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
198,AtomicAce,Warm-hearted and wacky,7,27 May 2016,"The ""Wilderpeople"" in this quirky comedy are two lost souls: a wayward youth from the city (Ricky Baker –Julian Dennison) and his grouchy foster uncle (Hector – Sam Neill) with a past he can't forget. This odd couple find themselves on the run and dependent on each other in the New Zealand wilderness. I must admit I am a sucker for quirky unpretentious New Zealand comedies that are warm-hearted but resist the Hollywood schmaltzy formula. The humor in this film is typically Kiwi – dry, offbeat and irreverent. Julian Dennison is great as the rotund teenager with a sense of fun and adventure. As the escapade moves to its climax, the plot becomes more and more farcical. While some of the scenes are funny, our empathy for Ricky and Hector fades. Empathy and farce do not mix well. And the ending is hurried and not completely satisfying. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie and the Aussie audience came away wearing a smile.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

A no fail film. The actors are unassuming and they just grow on you as you find yourself becoming rather attached to them emotionally. Living in the US, it is refreshing to see scenery shot in New Zealand that is not mythological 'Lord of The Rings' style. There is something that is very honest about this film. It's been a few weeks since I watched this film in the theater and I find myself still thinking about it.

I was not let down. This movie is amazing, from beautiful scenery and authentic sets, I was totally drawn in. The mood established thought the film is on a level of comedy so hilarious and so balanced with the overal theme that I can hardly handle it.

216,kumar-anurag7654,a different kind of funny,10,27 September 2016,"when i started watching this movie, i had very low expectations. but, by the end of the movie i was stunned. the movie merges the funny story telling with complex relationship dynamics. the character of Ricky was introduced like a stubborn ignorant kid who is always making troubles in the beginning but, how having a social relationship with a fellow human being can change even the most stubborn kid or the most stubborn old man was really fun to watch. The movie also captures the scenic beauty of the nature, locations are very precise to the nature of the movie and actors are also hilarious. there were a lot of funny circumstances and all of them seemed pretty natural, not like the comedies of these days in which they forcefully put a scene just there to be funny (which actually kills the fun). this is one of those comedy movies, which doesn't give you a loud laugh but what it gives is a more satisfying smile. watch it for a good time.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
217,warrengooding,Don't believe the hype !,5,24 September 2016,"What a disappointment! I was expecting a quirky, but down to earth, charming drama with comedic elements and an engaging story to be enjoyed by young and old. The first 10 -15 minutes are overall promising but it is generally downhill from there. Initially I had no intention of seeing this film as the posters looked as if the film was essentially aimed at kids and it holds a 12A classification. In retrospect the publicity got it right! However, the reviews on IMDb, the comments, reputation of the writer/director and overall score of 8.3 convinced me otherwise. Unfortunately the story is formulaic and offered no originality on the central theme of a 'damaged' child who finds friendship and meaningful relationship with caring adults after various events. The acting at times was clunky from the central young character and other minor roles as was the dialogue on many occasions. The humour was derived from too many forced situations and the peripheral characters became increasingly unbelievable and the overall feel just juvenile and very childish. There were several incongruent bloody scenes involving animal slaughter which simply felt unnecessary when sitting along side the more silly story arcs. The scenery was indeed spectacular but the characters' placement on extreme peaks at times was totally unbelievable and done simply to showcase the background. The last 30 minutes became predictable, mawkish and there are a ridiculous series of events which are aimed at creating laughs at the expense of any credibility. I think this is an overall miss as the level of humour and plot could only be appreciated by uncritical 8 - 11 year old's who it is not primarily aimed at! This review may seem harsh but is needed to counterbalance all the OTT positive reviews whose motivation for such praise is perhaps questionable. It is a 6/10 but I have voted 5/10 to offer some counterbalance.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
218,manasdashoec,Whoa! Its Majestical.,9,29 September 2016,"God! It has been a day since I watched the movie. But when I am in the elevator, in bus, while cooking or just sitting idle for a moment, the scene of vast green ""bush"" with those two running comes to mind like a replay!This is precisely what mixed genre movies should be like and, well, sue me for saying, this is what is expected from a off-the-hook movie. Just wow! The minute details, little facial expressions, background scores, redundant angles, and what not; all of them put together so nicely that you can not weigh one down. Such a nice direction. And acting. The little fella would make you fall in love with him soon.When the movie started with a chapter narrative, I thought, "" Oh, its like The Grand Budapest Hotel."" Indeed, rather in a better way, the story pacing and the relevance of the chapter titles are so perfectly engineered. It is a movie which you might begin with ""Well, lets see"" and then towards the end, you would feel compelled to check how much time is left and then start feeling sorry that it would end soon. If that's not the characteristics of a master piece, nothing else will ever be.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
219,redxction,Good,7,10 April 2017,"The film is of great simplicity; that is full of great laughs and touching moments all down to the great performances and the script but most of it is because of the relationship between the uncle and the boy; as we see this relationship blossom and develop that helps us as the audience, feel more intrigued into the lives and the outcomes of the characters thus we feel more welcome to laugh and feel sad as the film progresses. But it's also the tiny things that the director adds which makes it a little bit better like the use of the chapters to the set the tone for them series of acts in that specific chapter or the montage at the start giving a quick overview of the boy's misfits in urban life, sometimes the little things do matter.On the other hand though this film isn't perfection or a masterpiece(you shouldn't expect it to be)the pacing feels 'awkward' or 'misplaced' which sometimes destroys the atmosphere of the film. But it's exactly what you expect it to be, which can always be good sometimes.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

I found it cute and interesting. Nice scenery. Aside from Sam Neill's portrayal of the uncle, the characters are broad and one-dimensional.

I knew NZ was like a Heaven on Earth, but this movie makes it crystal clear to whomever sees it. Extremely breathtaking 'bushes' spread across millions of hectares.Secondly, the Actors and the Story. The story was based of a Ricky(Julian Dennison) acts brilliantly and fitting as the Fat- orphaned kid who's sort of a Rebel in attitude, adopted by the couple Bella(Rime Te Wiata) & Hector(Sam Niell), both suiting their characters who live in the middle of the breathtaking forests all alone in their comfortable little house. Ricky tries to adjust to his new family, until a tragedy struck them. Hec & Ricky set out on sort of an unexpected expedition, which the Child Welfare services mistake it for Kidnapping and order an National Manhunt longing for several months. Will the Boy & Uncle get away from the clutches of the CWS trying to get hold of the boy and send him to Juvie ?Thirdly, the director, Taika Waititi whose previous work isn't yet aware to me, has done some fitting screenplay with the way scenes are shot in the wild.Lastly, the soundtrack of the movie goes in so well that I keep listening again. Overall, The movie's definitely worth your time as we go on a laughter riot, emotional and visual adventure. P.s. The movie contains a two short bits of killing of wild animals. If you can bear it, It's enjoyable !",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

The dialogues in this film are memorable, the jokes are hilarious with universal appeal strengthening the laughs and they never once overstay their welcome. The performances in this film are brilliant, with Julian Dennison straight up breaking the mold of 'child actors are terrible' by spearheading this hilarious film with full angst, childhood emotional trauma and heartwarming wholesomeness. All this is only complimented by Sam Neil's brilliant emotional mimicry that even with little dialogue, formed a heavy brunt of the film's emotional weight.The plot itself follows an oddball story that spirals into the realms of media madness. All throughout the well-played-out story, we are spoiled with a wealth of brilliant shots of beautiful settings and some memorably clever camera play at work. Aside from the two leads, the film is also littered with quirky side characters that, although not as well fleshed-out as the leads, still leave a hell of an impression with their performances derived from such an amazing script.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

250,harrywhitehead,"A comedy which is genuinely funny, with a cast of charming characters",7,15 September 2016,"Taika Waititi's new comedy, set in the New Zealand bush, sees the wacky manhunt of a young orphan, Ricky (Julian Dennison), and his foster uncle Hec (Sam Neil). Following the threat of returning to the public system, Ricky flees his new remote farm home, with his foster uncle tracking him down shortly after deep within the bush. With the authorities believing their disappearance to be kidnapping, both Ricky and Hec quickly become fugitives running from the law.Waititi's excellent brand of comedy doesn't disappoint, with solid character based humour and genuine laugh out loud moments throughout. If you're a fan of Edgar Wright you're sure to enjoy the visual comedic style of the movie, as well as the levity and frivolity, which isn't too dissimilar to that seen in Wright's cornetto trilogy.Casting is solid with the partnership between Neil and Dennison producing some excellent chemistry; well balanced by the comical partnership of unrelenting and headstrong child-services worker Paula (Rachel House) and incompetent police officer Andy (Oscar Kightley).",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

Taika Watiti plays a cameo role in it, you will know what I mean when you watch it. The characters are likeable and the directing and choreography is well planned.While story is quite simple, the way its been written makes each and every character have more personality and individuality than most ""characters"" from other high budget films.It also has a realistic, well-thought-out and satisfying ending as well that left a good feeling in the stomach upon it ending.

The cinema was packed with an amazing demographic of people, for example, on one side of me were toddlers with their Mums, on the other a lone hunter-type and behind me a group of retired farmer ladies. I think this speaks volumes on the draw of this film. To put it simply, it ticks all the right boxes. Everyone in Aotearoa (NZ) will know these characters in some form or another; from the gruff old bushman, to the earthy mother figure and the chillaxed cop. It is that familiarity that makes it more engrossing and funny. But not just here, its mix of subtle bathos and pathos will make it universally appealing, of that I am certain.

But truth is stranger than fiction and I entered the portal more than willing to love a good old fashioned bush romp. It has pathos, humour and intrigue. It has good diction, I didn't miss a word (gangsta speak excepted) and there are 'characters' that make a good yarn even if they are a bit larger than life; we want that, don't we. Isn't that what wends a story?

276,annieburke-72582,Purely and utterly delightful!,10,20 July 2018,"I wanted to explore the rest of Taika Waititi's filmography after loving everything he did on Thor: Ragnarok and decided to watch this one with my mom. (**THOR: RAGNAROK SPOILER**: Sam Neill who plays Hector, actually has a cameo in a play about Loki and portrays the actor who play's Odin) 
This film was so quirky with the concept of Ricky Baker, a troubled teen who is in the New Zealand foster care system sent to live with couple Bella and Hector, who live in the vast New Zealand bush. Ricky Baker had never felt comfortable in his previous foster homes, and warms up to Bella and Hector, whom he dubs his ""Aunt"" and ""Uncle."" Bella treats him with such love and kindness and even gifts him with a dog for his birthday that he names Tupac after the rapper of the same name. Suddenly as Ricky begins to truly enjoy living with Bella and Hector, Bella passes away. Taika Waititi makes a very memorable and hilarious cameo as a priest at Bella's funeral. Ricky is informed that social services will be coming to pick him up and take him to a new foster care home, since it was Bella's idea to take Ricky in and not Hector's. Knowing this, Ricky decides to run away into the bush with Tupac and fakes his own death. This is discovered by the scene stealing Rachel House as Paula Hall, Ricky's social worker and she and the police, as well as Hector make their own searches for Ricky. Ricky and Hector end up finding each other and sticking together for several months on the run from Paula and the police. Several run-ins with zany characters including the approximately named Psycho Sam and several hunters all end in a police chase that leads to Hector getting arrested for allegedly kidnapping Ricky based on misinterpreted statements Ricky told the hunters that Hector was making him do things he didn't want to do. Ricky eventually reunites with Hector after a while and upholds his promise of teaching Hector how to read. 
Overall, this was another zany, brilliant story from Taika Waititi that is well-paced, well-shot, and isn't overly filled with deliberate jokes and humor like Thor: Ragnarok; as the humor mainly comes from how the story plays out and doesn't need to be relied on by a comic-relief character. Although, Rachel House and Rhys Darby who plays Psycho Sam are very humorous and can be seen as comic relief, they just let the jokes flow naturally and don't feel forced to tell them.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

278,iamjamalrashad,Amazing Film!,10,11 September 2019,"Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016) is an epic adventure written and directed by Taika Waititi, a New Zealand director probably most recognized by his works What We Do in the Shadows (2014) and Thor: Ragnarok (2017). This film is based on the book Wild Pork and Watercress, written by Barry Crump, and stars Sam Neill (Jurassic Park, 1993, Escape Plan, 2013), Julian Dennison (Deadpool 2, 2018), and Rachel House (Moana, 2016).
Hunt for the Wilderpeople alternates between obvious and subtle references to pop culture while updating what it means to be an ""epic adventure"" in today's film industry.
The film's protagonist is teenage boy who has bounced from foster home to foster home until he reaches his last stop before being sent to a juvenile center. His world is uprooted, and he finds himself in the middle of a nationwide manhunt that leads to some personal growth, heartwarming moments, and interesting characters.
This film was an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish. Waititi's penchant for natural, comedic dialogue allows you to not only relate to the main characters within the first fifteen minutes, but it allows you to love them as well. The music had a folksy feel to it and the cinematic direction and editing of certain scenes gave me that ""pay attention to this because you will see it later"" feeling and I was not let down.
Hunt for the Wilderpeople does an amazing job referencing pop culture as soon as it starts. The film's main character, Ricky Baker (Dennison), steps out of the back of a police car, dressed in flashy, urban-esque clothing. Not only is his attire inspired by a certain sect of Black American culture, the back of his jacket has the quote, ""All Eyes On Me,"" a reference to rap icon Tupac Shakur's album All Eyez on Me. What's interesting about Waititi's directorial and musical choice to introduce Ricky Baker is that we get an up-close look at the words on the back of Ricky's jacket accompanied by a foreboding musical score that gives a bit of foreshadowing through the character's introduction before we even see his face. Even Ricky's past antics (shown in flashbacks as his new foster parent is briefed on his history), hopes, and dreams are heavily influenced by urban culture and music. During a point where Ricky states his desire to get back to the city, he states his plan to get ""some new gears, become a drug dealer, a rapper, and die in a drive-by."" This is a huge perception of rap culture in America that has spread worldwide where people of other countries often have the common misconception that that lifestyle is what all rappers live.
Throughout the months that pass in the movie, the film shows Ricky and Hector (Neill), go from being at each other's throats to almost inseparable. The best part about the way we learn how much time has passed is that it's through dialogue. Now, one may argue that announcing the passage of time could come off as forced or contrived, but Waititi blends it into the conversation in such a way that is not only natural, but with a sort of dash of exposition to catch us up after we've enjoyed several minutes of the duo's adventures and bickering.
It's because of these things that Hunt for the Wilderpeople is an epic adventure updating the definition of what it means for a film to be an ""epic adventure."" We no longer live in a time where we have to tell stories of old like 300 or Troy or Gladiator because the Greek are not the only people who spent months or years on an adventure. We live in a day and age where epic adventures are happening all around us and Waititi does a great job capturing the one between Ricky Baker and Hector Faulkner. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking to have a great laugh (and maybe even a cray) with amazing characters with references to pop culture that almost all of us will understand.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
279,mamaidy,Very entertaining,9,10 February 2020,"Hilarious, fascinating, heart-warming, touching and action packed, Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a New Zealand adventure comedy-drama from 2016. Movie directed, produced and written by Taika Waititi. The movie was based on a book by Barry Crump - Wild pork and watercress.
This film is about a thirteen year old boy named Ricky Baker (Julian Dennison), who's life was, changing from one foster family too another. He's biggest dream was to become a gangster in the future.
At the beginning of this feature we see a beautiful view of New Zealand and later Ricky who is delivered to his new foster family, an old couple, Bella (Rima Te Wiata) and Hector (Sam Neill). Bella is a very caring and energetic person. She is giving a lot of attention to Ricky and surrounds him with love. They connect quickly and she wins his trust. Hector on the other hand was a grumpy person and preferred his own company. When Ricky finally has a normal life with a loving family, something happens that forces Ricky to run away and when Hector finds him, they begin their journey full of adventures, mostly running away from the police and hiding from the world.
The movie is set in a beautiful country, New Zealand. I was so happy that Taika Waititi decided to show the spectacular nature of New Zealand. During the movie when we have short breaks from the action and even during the most important parts, we can observe how beautiful is this island so far away from me in Poland.The music soundtrack is perfect for this movie. Some of the songs are so well chosen, that the words kind off match with the scene. The funniest part was Ricky's birthday song, which was very surprising, original and comical.The characters are very well created, they seemed real, and because of that every sad scene was even more sad and I felt like I was affected by that even too.
The actors did a wonderful job they created such realistic characters and It didn't feel fake like I said earlier I felt that there were real people and not acting. Sam Neill is a popular actor and did a good job but Julian Dennison despite not having such a big acting experience, he did a marvellous job and in my opinion his acting was as good as a professional adult actor.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
280,jankowskaju,Great film,9,10 February 2020,"Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a movie, that was directed by Taika Waititi. It is based on a novel called Wild Pork and the Watercress written by Berry Crump. The film was set in different locations, including the Central Plateau and the Waitakere Ranges in New Zealand. The adaptation features Julian Dennison, Sam Neill and Rachel House. The soundtrack in the movie is an Original Motion Picture Soundtrack by Moniker, that was written especially for Hunt for the Wilderpeople. The adventure comedy-drama focuses on many relationship based themes and issues.The tale centers on a boy called Ricky Baker (Julian Dennison) who is a trouble maker, and is considered a ""real bad egg"". Because of that, as well as his past, he struggles to find a stable home. That is until he meets his foster parents: Bella (Rima Te Wiata) and Hector (Sam Neill). It's hard for him to adapt to his new home at first, despite Bella's efforts. Unfortunately, after he starts settling in, he is forced to go on an adventure with Hector because of a difficult set of circumstances. They need to run away from the authorities and Paula (Rachel House), hunt in order to get food and search for shelter. The plot is fascinating, interesting and overall well-made. Some parts of the movie are touching, some are funny and some are even heart-warming: for example the way that Hector changed from being cold hearted and barely showing any emotion to becoming a likable man.
The actors are talented, therefore the characters are played very well. They are convincing, lively and unique in their own way. The director did a very good job.In conclusion Hunt for the Wilderpeople is light and funny, but has its moments of touching drama and exciting action. It is likeable, charming and just plain fun. I would recommend this coming of age film to people of all ages. It is definitely worth watching. However, it does include a bit of violence. There are scenes where animals are being hunted for and killed, which might not be best for sensitive viewers.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

Ricky and Hector are going through a lots of up and downs but at least Hector is finally building a relationship with Ricky. The budget of this movie was only 2.5 million USD and almost the entire film was shot by using only one camera. It took only 5 weeks to filmed The hunt of the wilderpeople . In my opinion the main actors played their roles great, especially Julian Dennison(Ricky Baker). We can see that he needed to played multiple emotions and Rachel House(Paula Hall). The movie it's self was also very funny and had a lot of jokes which made the film even better. The movie was also divided into chapters which in my opinion was really creative.RECOMMENDATIONSIn my opinion the movie is really great! I really enjoyed watching it. Hunt of the wilderpeople is a good movie to watch with friends or family. The only thing which could have been better was filming of it,I think that if the movie was shot with multiple cameras it would be better.Althoug the movie was funny and had a lot of jokes but it's not the funniest movie you can watch ,because it had also some sad and dramatic scenes.I personaly rate this movie a 8.5/10. ☺",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
282,franekxpx,A great movie!,10,25 February 2020,"Taika Waititi's ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" is a adventure comedy drama movie inspired by Barry's Crump ""Wild pork and Watercress"".The movie can make you cry,can make you laugh and can make you think and show the situation in New Zealand.The movie is set in the ""bushes"" in modern New Zealand.The film was made to show how the system failed for the maorians and other people.The system has left behind them and never provided them everything that was available in for others in developing cities and towns.This movie can perfectly explain what is going on in New Zealand.There is no easter egg up hereThe movies main character Ricky Baker which is a 12 year old orphan with a character based on hip-hop culture and ""street life"" taken from movies,stories and games.Ricky was considered as a thief,vandal and someone that makes trouble by the Child welfare.
The movie begins with Ricky arriving to his new foster house which is a little huntsman house located in dense bushes in New Zealand.Bella(Rima Te Wiata) and Hec(Sam Neill) are his new ""foster parents"".At first it was hard for ricky to feel like it was his ""home"" and to adapt to the situation.
After some time Ricky felt more at home and had better relations between Bella and Hec,a tragic and unexpected event got in the way.The event led to Paula Faulkner(Rachel House) from the Child welfare take Ricky back to Juvenile or to look for a new foster home.Ricky is really mad and disagrees to go back.So what Ricky does is he escapes with his stuff to the bushes alone.After some hours Ricky wanders and gets ""lost"".Because Hector new Ricky is not going to do well alone in the wild forests,he went for him.They finally met up.They all decide that they have nothing to lose so the escape and hide in the bushes starts the whole series of the adventures of Ricky and Hec.After some time in the bushes it turns out that Ricky does really well in difficult conditions.Between Ricky and Hec a ""male friendship"" is born.
It's a film which we cannot miss out on.It made on me a very big impression.The movie looks phenomenal and beautiful and the New Zealand nature is stunning.
The movie for me is a story of a hard friendship between rough Hector and eccentric Ricky,but there is one thing that unites them-it's the need of acceptance and being loved as they are both orphans.
There is only one thing that makes this movie unique is the absurd sense of humor.
The movie is funny,intelligent and unique.Filing the whole and something i admired in this movie is the music which perfectly gives the movie the NZ theme.For me it makes a big difference.
If you haven't watch this amazing movie, i strongly recommend!!!",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
283,sol-48,A great movie,9,17 April 2016,"What a great story, Funny, heart-warming and great acting from all actors - especially Julian Dannison and Sam Neill and Rima Te Wiata. But also the shorter performances by Rhys Darby, Taika Waititi and Stan Walker are hilarious. A lot to laugh, but on a good level. Though I do not know the original story by Barry Crumb it does not really matter as everything is so familiar. Kids coming into foster homes, and it is not what you expect.Great nature images from New Zealand Another proof that Maori stories from New Zealand can attract a big audience too. Sometime s you wonder whether all the jokes will come through as they are very kiwi Taika Waititi has done it again after ""Boy"" ""What we do in the shadows""",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
284,vrussell-04002,enjoyed every minute,10,9 November 2020,"This is very funny and very sad, but the uplifting ending makes it somehow more than the sum of its parts. Also, there is a great track of ""The Partisan,"" that somehow manages to be both moving and hilarious because of what is going on with it in the background.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
285,marinaschool,Highly recommend!,10,4 December 2020,"This movie is the perfect combination of heart warming, funny, and entertaining. The camera shots are awesome, the characters are relatable and some parts are so sweet you can't help but tear up. I watched this movie randomly, without knowing anything about it, and I was very pleasantly surprised. Would definitely watch again, and recommend others to see it!!",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
286,alexdocg,No Faults - Brilliant Comedy,10,9 January 2021,"Before I watched this film, I read nothing about it, so I wasn't sure what to expect at all. Judging by the display image on Netflix of a boy holding a gun, I thought it would have a serious undertone. I was very wrong; it was an incredibly quirky comedy.A foster parent and an orphan hiding in the wilderness from the child safety authorities in New Zealand. That's all I'll say!Brilliant film!",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
287,hayden_lee-30518,A movie you want to keep watching,9,1 February 2021,I didn't expect anything when I turned this in but thIs was one of the best movies I've watched recently. This movie has some of the most likeable characters and a story that doesn't really go anywhere but keeps you so invested. A truly haertwarming tale.,Hunt for the Wilderpeople
288,johnsouthernacademy-16369,Embarrassingly mediocre,2,14 February 2021,"Well, just like many others I was drawn to the high score ""this must be great, right?""....wrong! Although it starts with some amusing scenes it quickly highlights wooden acting, a poor script, and the question of why oh why does the score for the movie equal that of The Blues Brothers?
Another reviewer mentioned that it was perhaps a case of the Emperor's new clothes, I tend to agree; also perhaps a fiercely loyal following from the Kiwis.....I get that they would want to celebrate their own, and the beautiful scenery which abounds.... but the film itself is really only watchable until the funeral scene and then becomes tedious.
I am sure that everyone involved with the production were lovely, enthusiastic, and trying their best to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, but sadly it remains just a sow's ear that looks like a purse.... The film is probably between 3 to 4 (no higher) but I hope my 2 will help to re-calibrate the score and act as a suitable caveat for film buffs everywhere.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
289,tdumboi,If you disagree with my review just go jump off a cliff or something,1,7 August 2021,"People are giving this movie like 8 and 9 star reviews. Imagine you're watching this movie and the clip where the dog dies comes up ""so funny and family-friendly. Definitely for kids under 2 years old so they can watch a dog get brutally killed by a wild boar, and then get shot. Man, how funny is that?"" 100% family-friendly for someone who likes killing pets. So if you could never review family-friendly on a movie where the main character dies like 15 minutes in and a dog dies, that would be nice.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
290,mda10,Lighthearted family comedy,6,14 September 2020,Starts off strong with the potential to be a brilliant movie but loses momentum midway and spirals downhill into a mediocre light hearted comedy. One to watch with the kids!,Hunt for the Wilderpeople

292,pak_kad_kee,Very Entertaining,8,7 November 2017,Story of the group of outcast that shares same tragic Very Entertaining Everything was good but I feel that it's a bit too long Could cut off 10 minutes of the movie will not harm a bit Acting was good Sam Neil nails it. And the director is also in the movie as always funny and interesting all the time.,Hunt for the Wilderpeople
293,queenofrebel,"Not what I expected, but still a brilliant flick with a lot of heart",8,27 January 2017,"I came to this movie from Taika Waititi's 2014 gem What We Do In The Shadows, which was friggin hilarious and totally my favorite comedy of the decade! Keeping that in mind, I was expecting a laugh-out-loud dark comedy, but what I got was a heartwarming coming of age story about a young boy and his journey of finding a loving family. There were a couple of jokes here and there, some dry humor and sarcasm, but never once did it get anything more than a slight giggle from me and both instances were at the hunter cabin, with the cauc-Asian thing (which was in the trailer) and the ""pervert innuendos"". In the end, the movie gave me heart fuzzies! Kinda reminded me of Mr Fantastic actually, which I think came out the same year! The correlation is more in the tone I think, a dramatic movie with wildly quirky characters, beautiful scenery, authentic family bonds/interaction, natural feeling comedy and a nice message of love! So if you were like me, here's a warning: watch this with the premise of seeing a cute indie flick about a chubby ""gangster"" who disobeys, steals, spits, runs away, throws rocks, kicks stuff, loiters and makes graffiti. Also swears a lot and loves haiku!",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

296,azwhite-611-827353,The Best Wes Anderson Movie of All Time,9,3 January 2021,"It's honestly as if Wes Anderson traveled forward in time, saw this movie, and based all of his movies on this one. This movie is hilarious, touching, compelling, and thought provoking. The only reason it's not 10 stars is because a few characters and scenes are over the top in a slightly annoying manner, but for the most part this movie is gold. I immediately watched it a second time, and I'll happily watch it again.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
297,kim-porter,Great Movie!,10,22 June 2016,"What a great movie - justifiably now the alltime biggest box office NZ flick.Here's something that may amuse many people: despite going into it knowing that Sam Neil was in the movie, at no point, (absolutely literally), did it ever occur to me that Hec was Sam Neill. This must surely be the performance of his career.From the superb cinematography to some very clever sliding/blended shots, the film was an absolute delight for the eyes. The soundtrack was also perfect.With a couple of extremely leftfield surprises, this is not a movie that anyone will second guess. My wife and daughter were seeing it for the second time - I'll be more than happy to watch it again!",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
298,haroldhooney,Taika's best movie so far,10,1 April 2016,"It's too hard to fault Taika Waititi; he's excellent at what he does, and this movie is surely his best yet. The story has serious matters at its heart, and yet it managed to stay well above maudlin at all times, being moving and downright hilarious most of the time.Also a great spotlight once again on New Zealand's native bush, with many great little nods to Kiwi movies of years gone by. The leads, Sam Neill & Julian Dennison, are wonderful in their roles, and the supporting cast were not far behind. So much a Kiwi movie and one for all ages, yet it's humour and story will definitely appeal beyond our shores. Go and see it now!",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
299,Brayden-pavey,"Humorous the whole way through, with standout performances by New Zealand's finest in comedy.",10,5 June 2016,"I saw a trailer for this film that had me intrigued, I then went to watch it at the cinemas. It was an incredibly humorous film with moments of great drama, the outsider Ricky Baker forms an unlikely bond with some farm dwellers on the outskirts of New Zealand's wilderness. A lot of stand out performances from some incredible New Zealand actors and actresses, proving that they have incredible comedic chops and ability. This film is going to put the New Zealand industry on the map, helmed by Taika Waititi who had done an incredible job of telling this story. This film has everything, from non-stop humour to some intense action scenes, followed by dramatic moments. I would recommend everyone see this film in cinemas.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
300,goranferencina,Hunt for the Wilderpeople,9,25 November 2018,"Having loved the only previous movie I saw directed by Taika Waititi, ''What we do in the shadows'', I decided to give this one a go after having it in my watchlist for what seems like forever, and I was not disappointed.
The first thing I noticed while watching Hunt for the Wilderpeople, was that I couldn't fit it into any of the usual genres, and I couldn't figure out if I was supposed to laugh my guts out or to cry like a child for the duration of the movie. In the end it ended up being a bit of both, an emotional roller-coaster, full of incredibly funny bits, such as the cameo of the director Waititi in the role of an eccentric priest, as well as really sad moments, when the comedy of the characters' actions hits a great dose of uncompromising reality, and the two things happening very close to each other somehow accentuates both.
Speaking of the characters, the acting is superb, and the casting seemed perfect, as everyone did an amazing job at selling their part and making the viewer feel close to them.
One of the things that surprised me the most though, was the cinematography department, which not only succeeded in portraying the tone of the cold seasons' bush, but exceeded my expectations in doing so. The movie's tone is set since the beginning by a cold dramatic filter, which does its job in contrasting the funny bits in a way that makes them even funnier, and by the end of the movie we feel comfortable in that mesmerizing colour palette. Some of the scenes in this movie are a wonder to look at, and some are very creative too, the first ones that come to mind being the boar hunt at the very beginning, and the rotating scene of the hunt for the Wilderpeople towards the end.
The music in the movie never stands out too much, which is not necessarily bad, as it does a decent job at supporting the scenes.
In conclusion, I highly recommend this movie for anyone in the mood for a great adventure, full of ups and downs, laughter, tears and a little advice on how to cope with the lows of life.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

302,timlillkvist,Amazing,10,17 July 2017,"This movie touched my heart like no other movie this past year have done. This movie truly shows what freedom is all about, it's doing what ever you want, because you only have one life and there is no second chance.It has happy and sad parts, and shows what its like to have nothing, like this little young boy in this movie. He wants to be free, like all of us here living on planet earth.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

305,jamesfrompapakura,Perfectly Beautiful and Hilarious,10,1 April 2016,"Beautiful story of survival, family and humor, Amazing Cinematography and relatable lovable characters. This film places deep characters and themes in a beautifully visual setting of New Zealand while making it hilariously funny and giving the right amount of action, thought-provoking situations and dialogue to make it a perfect film, Using every possible opportunity to give the audience an emotional and visual pleasure. The film covers so many aspects of developing emotions while delivering a heart touching laugh your ass off story and never letting the audience either laughing or awing for the story of this cute parent-less fat boy and his journey of running,hiding and surviving though the unique NZ bush and connection to his uncle Heck.The film allows the audience to leave with the most satisfyingly developed characters and story, while becoming a instant classic and a great showcase of New Zealand as a Country and its potential in the Film Industry.I consider this to be the best film By Tiki Waititi and there is no wonder why he the writer and director has been chosen to direct the anticipated Thor: Ragnarok of the superhero film genre taking over Hollywood.James Cameron",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
306,benedwar,I find it impossible to fault,10,1 April 2016,"A brilliant funny movie that still respects the sadness that happens in life but tries to show you that fun and laughter can still be our main focus. I think this is the best so far of Taika Waititi's films and recommend it to anyone to see. I saw it after a long-tiring week at work and I half expected to nod off in the cinema theatre because I was so tired. But I didn't. I laughed and chuckled most of the way through the film and came away re-energized and very happy I had gone. Would see again if the opportunity came up, which is likely as most of my friends are raving about it and a few are wanting me to go with them to see it again!",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

I can't wait to go again, and again.... Taika is a genius. The entire cinema clapped when it finished which I've never seen before. It's now my absolute favourite film of all time!! LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie!!!!!!! It is effortlessly funny with a brilliant cast of very talented Kiwi actors. The scenery is of course beautiful because it's set in New Zealand's stunning landscape. Even though there are serious, universal underlying issues within the script they are dealt with in a way that is from the child's innocent perspective so the film remains light and entertaining throughout. If this film doesn't do exceptionally well off shore and get the global recognition it deserves, it will be a travesty.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
308,jakeallen-47029,This was a great movie for anyone to see.,10,8 April 2016,"Hunt for the Wilderpeople was one of my top movies at Sundance. The film used symbolism expertly. The director was able to convey powerful symbolism through something as small as a rubber water container. It was used as a symbol for home. It showed that in a harsh world full of rejection, what we all really want as humans is to be loved and wanted by other people. This movie shows that even though people can have a hard time trusting others with themselves, relentless love can break down barriers. In the movie, Ricky shows us that even though being truly loved by someone can feel foreign and awkward, once you get a taste of it, you never want to let it go. Through the rubber water container symbol, the film shows that when life circumstances change, we still just want intimate relationships with other people. Although it may appear different on the outside, it will always be similar at its core. This movie also shows how much our pasts want to dictate our future. We see outcasts of society searching for freedom from who they were, but how people around them are trying to not let that happen. Where they find the most freedom is exactly where society is trying to rip them out of. They would rather keep in the lowest levels of civilization rather than let them have their freedom. Just like with these characters, the world will identify us most by the things we least like about ourselves. Whether it is an addiction, or a mistake we would rather forget, these are the things the world continually wants us to live in rather than finding freedom from them. It is a fight to live in that freedom rather than being dragged down to believing we are still those same people from our pasts. This film shows that freedom is possible. No matter what is in our past, that does not have to be who we are today, but it is a battle. We will have to run, fight, or go against what people around us are telling us to do, but we must seek to live in that freedom. This film is fraught with other symbols and social commentaries. It is at the top of my list of recommendations for people to see.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
309,catebilbrey,Amazing!!,10,16 April 2016,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It was excellently developed and had the perfect cast. 10/10 would see again. It had the perfect balance between comedy and drama. I laughed, I cried. Every component of it was thought out in detail and it worked perfectly! Even while it was funny, it had an overall meaning and made you consider different aspects of society. To be entirely honest, when I first heard what it was about, I wasn't interested but it is now one of my favorite movies I've ever seen. Please, if you have the chance to see it, you must. I guarantee you, you won't regret it. There was absolutely no part where I thought ""well, this could have been better"" or ""that could have been excluded"", it was so so good. From the cinematography to the cast and script, it was perfect, I couldn't have asked for a better movie.",Hunt for the Wilderpeople
310,deborah_e_fox,Hilarious but also a really moving story line,10,13 June 2016,"I will be so disappointed if this incredible film doesn't win a prize! It made me laugh so hard that I cried . . . then cry some more. Beautiful cinematography, incredible acting, great script writing and adaptation of the original book. This was a unique film that includes the full gamut of emotions. You definitely need to see this while it's still playing in the cinemas!In my opinion, this is Sam Neill's best performance to date. The interaction between his character and his foster son is heart-warming. Some of the later part of the story line becomes a bit unbelievable but it seems to work with the overall film. Such a joy to watch that I can't wait to watch it again!",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

I couldn't stop laughing due to the amazing performances from Juilan Denninson and Sam Neil. Really good film, great direction and screenplay. Julian Denninson is a great actor and i think he will go far in the future. Sam Neil was probably if not the best actor for the role he played and they couldn't of not picked a better actor for this film. As the film goes along due to the great performances you start to develop feelings for these characters and what they are feeling.

Why cant New Zealanders raise the bar and make an uplifting movie and show the better side of humans. The supposed humour in this film is relegated to low brow comments you would expect from a mean teenage bully, not adults. New Zealand is a beautiful country and makes for nice viewing it's just a shame the characters don't measure up to the same level, not all New Zealanders are this coarse but I guess this is how the world will come to think of the people, it's high time New Zealand made a decent movie without violence and the usual trash talk and put downs. NZers please make something Noble and uplifting!",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

As someone else pointed out, despite the gravity of the subject matter, Waititi keeps it light, although does not make light of the situation. We are left to consider the seriousness or the weightiness of life and death and our childcare system but through a humanizing lens. One could say this is a light political satire that delivers whimsy with its messaging, but I think the focus is truly on belonging.Recommend this to everyone!",Hunt for the Wilderpeople

I really enjoyed this film not just because it was extremely funny, but also because I have lived in New Zealand for a number of years and found it really homely. However even if you are not from New Zealand, this movie will really connect with you on an emotional level and almost feel like home. I found Hunt for the Wilderpeople more enjoyable than Boy (2010), another Taika Waititi movie, since it was faster-paced, had a more definite story line, funnier and contained less swearing.
