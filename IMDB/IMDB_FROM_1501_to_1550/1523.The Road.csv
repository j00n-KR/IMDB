0,Leofwine_draca,Well-made variant on familiar story,6,13 March 2012,"I'm a huge fan of the post-apocalypse genre so when I heard about this film I looked forward to seeing it. Now that I've done so, I'm left both impressed and disappointed. Impressed by the quality of film-making and acting on display, which is uniformly excellent; disappointed by the predictable nature of the story, which adds absolutely nothing new to an age-old genre, following staples set up by the likes of LAST MAN ON EARTH. Perhaps the fault lies with the novel, which I haven't read.Director John Hillcoat was previously responsible for THE PROPOSITION, an Australian western I thought was pretty much fantastic. He's adept at filling his movies with moods and atmosphere, and this film is no exception: there's an altogether downbeat approach here, a gritty, no-hope situation for every character on the screen. This makes it a rather depressing watch. The backdrop of a devastated world – we never learn what caused the apocalypse – is expertly realised and never less than convincing.The acting keeps you watching. The central thrust is the relationship between father Mortensen and child Smit-McPhee; the latter is very good in a breakout role, but it's Mortensen who gives the best performance in the film, as always, living and breathing a role which I feel few others could have adopted quite as thoroughly. There isn't much time for the other actors like the briefly seen Pearce and Theron, but I did enjoy Duvall's turn as a crusty, ancient traveller.The plot throws in the usual staples – cannibals, gangs of marauding truckers, underground bunkers, shoot-outs – and the action scenes are very well handled and packed with tension. Some moments, like when the twosome meet a thief- transcend the source material and become something altogether better. In the end, though, this is very much a B-movie picture dressed up with budget and talent to appear like a Hollywood blockbuster.",The Road
1,SnoopyStyle,bleakest of apocalypse,7,5 March 2015,"A man (Viggo Mortensen) struggles to survive a post apocalyptic world with his son (Kodi Smit-McPhee). It is a damned hopeless existence of cannibals and desolation. No animal has survived and even the trees are almost all burnt. They have a gun with only two bullets. In flashbacks, the man and his pregnant wife (Charlize Theron) initially survive the devastation.The difference between this movie and the rest of the apocalyptic genre is the utter hopelessness. Most of them would give some hope or a mission to save the world. This one has nothing but the bleakest of vision. There is a question about morality in a hopeless world. Exactly how far would he go to have his son survive. Could they still be the good guys? I would have liked him to face an ultimate choice in a final showdown.",The Road
2,Hitchcoc,The End of the Road is the End of the Road!,8,30 August 2010,"I did read the novel and I did get the same sense from the film. I wondered why this was chosen to be made into a film (probably in the aftermath of ""No Country for Old Men""). What we have here is our future. At some point it will look like this with the human species hoping to grasp that last straw as they sink in the mire. The acting is excellent, but everything is so hopeless. There's hunger, disease, infection, despair, and all that good stuff. There are two people we like and we relish each positive moment. A shower, a can of peaches, a kind word, whatever is enough to raise the spirits. At some point we will find a way to do this to ourselves or some fanatic will do it for us. I remember watching ""The Day After"" some twenty-five years or so ago. It left me with a hopefulness. As we ignore the forces in the world and they slip past the point of no return, I think Cormac McCarthy probably has seen a vision. I hope I'm wrong. When we lose compassion for our fellow human beings and judge them in our short sighted, petty ways, we get the future we've asked for.",The Road
3,claudio_carvalho,Gloomy and Hopeless View of the Future,8,16 July 2010,"In a post-apocalyptic world in a near future, a man (Viggo Mortensen) and his young son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) wander heading to South seeking good people through destroyed roads. Along their journey, they hide themselves from cannibal survivors and seek supplies in the debris of houses and stores. They have one revolver with two shells for self- protection or for an ultimate decision of committing suicide. The man recalls the good moments of his life with his wife (Charlize Theron) and begins to lose his humanity while his son pushes him to help and old man (Robert Duvall) and a thief (Michael Kenneth Williams). When they reach the beach, the boy has to decide his fate. ""The Road"" develops in low-pace a gloomy and hopeless view of the future of mankind. Unfortunately many fans of blockbuster movies have written unfair bad reviews in IMDb, probably expecting to see a fast-paced popcorn film with lots of explosions and special effects. However, the sad story is supported by a solid screenplay with a dark cinematography; great direction; and magnificent performances of Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee, followed by Robert Duvall, Charlize Theron and a magnificent cast. I loved to see Molly Parker again in a feature and despite her minor participation, her few lines are touching. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""A Estrada"" (""The Road"")",The Road
4,kosmasp,The journey is the destination,9,22 September 2010,"I haven't read the novel and I'm saying this right up front, just in case you were looking for someone to compare both mediums. Though from what I have read, it seems to be a very truthful adaptation. And while I probably will not be able (if I ever get around to read the book) to imagine the things described in the book, different from what I saw on film, what I actually did see, is very impressive. As far as visuals go (I watched it on Blu Ray), this is stunning.But it's not style over substance, though there is not this big a story to be found here (of course). And a friend of mine, who was watching the movie with me, liked the movie too, though he was wondering how the main characters didn't seem to let hope slip away. And he was asking about motive. Actually I think the motive is pretty easy and simple. And while it seems to have no destination at all, it does actually have one. The reasons for that target/goal? There are a few ways to interpret it I guess. And I will leave that up to you. There is the obvious one (which is also revealed in the final flashback), but there could also be another thought behind this all.A movie that lives with Viggo, but also with the little kid actor, who is just amazing. He has a tough role and he's still able to deliver. A movie that is thoughtful and very keen to deliver a special ""mood"". Not something, all people will like (everyone has different taste and that's good), but obviously something that you haven't seen like that before!",The Road
5,jboothmillard,The Road,7,25 September 2013,"I was annoyed when I missed the opportunity to see this film, I assumed it was a horror film because I heard parts of what it involved, but it was different to what I expected, in a good way, when I did watch it, from director John Hillcoat (Lawless). Basically an unspecified cataclysm has caused devastation across Americam killing most animal and plant life, and civilisation has collapsed and causing people have survived to either scavenge for food or resort to cannibalism. A father (Viggo Mortensen) and his son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) are walking alone through this catastrophe, travelling south to the coast in the hope of finding a warmer place, and along the way search for supplies, and through flashbacks we see the Man's life before the disaster became imminent. In flashbacks we see that the Man was married to a Woman (Charlize Theron) who gave birth to the boy before leaving him, due to the circumstances of the deterioration of society, and because originally he was supposed to leave enough bullets for them to commit suicide together should the situation get worse, he now only has two bullets. There is an incident with a Gang Member (Garret Dillahunt), and he shoots a bullet, leaving only one remaining, and another incident where they hide in a large mansion sees the Man almost kill the Boy as he planned in the past, but the cannibals chasing them are distracted and they can escape. Later the two discover an undercover shelter full of canned food and supplies, but noises coming from outside force them keep them moving again to avoid threat, and on the continuing they encounter a near-blind Old Man (Robert Duvall), the Boy persuades his father to let the non-threatening man have some food and spend some time with them. The father and son arrive at the coast, but while the Man leaves his son on watch the boy falls asleep and lets a Thief (Michael Kenneth Williams) steal everything from them, but they catch up to the thief who the Man suspects of following them, they initially leave him with nothing, but the son is upset, and the father does return his clothes and a can of food. They pass through an empty ruined town, the Man gets shot with an arrow in his leg, the ambusher is killed with a flare, the archer's companion is upset, she denies following them as well, and it is obvious the wound has weakened the Man. His condition deteriorates, until he collapses near the beach, he gives his son self-preservation and humanity values, and after he has died the Boy keeps going, he is eventually met by a Veteran (Guy Pearce) who offers him help, to join him, his wife, his children and their dog, they were the ones following the father and son because they were concerned, he agrees to go with assured that they are the ""good guys"". Also starring Molly Parker as Motherly Woman and Bob Jennings as Bearded Man. Mortensen may be a little too rugged, but he gives a suitably paranoid performance, the child actor by his side is certainly affective, the grey colouring and ash-covered post-apocalyptic scenery looks great, the tension certainly runs through as the duo go along the perilous journey, all in all it is a terrific futuristic drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Cinematography. Very good!",The Road
6,Woodyanders,Grim and haunting,9,17 August 2015,"A tough and determined man (superbly played with fierce resolve and conviction by Viggo Mortensen) and his frightened young son (a fine portrayal by Kodi Smit-McPhee) embark on a perilous journey across a barren and dangerous wasteland as they attempt to find safety in a bleak and hostile post-apocalyptic world. The pair encounter numerous obstacles such as deadly cannibals and roving hordes of scavengers on their pilgrimage.Director John Hillcoat vividly captures a potently brooding atmosphere of pervasive dread, despair, and utter hopelessness. Joe Penhall's stark and intelligent script smartly addresses the basic human need to survive and persevere without compromising one's morals or losing one's humanity in the process, with the strong bond of love between the father and his son providing a tremendous amount of gut-wrenching poignancy. The ace acting by the top-drawer cast keeps this movie on track: Charlize Theron as the father's bitter and defeated wife, Guy Pearce as a kindly veteran, Michael Kenneth Williams as a desperate thief, Garrett Dillahunt as a creepy gang member, and, in an especially bravura turn, Robert Duvall as a weary and rundown old man. Javier Aguirresarobe's gloomy widescreen cinematography gives this picture an appropriately grayish look and offers a wealth of striking shots of a desolate landscape rife with decaying trees, crumbling buildings, and rusty abandoned cars. The moody and melancholy score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis further enhances the overall dreary tone. An absolute powerhouse.",The Road
7,Tweekums,A bleak tale of a man and his son as they struggle to survive in a post apocalyptic world,8,28 May 2012,Set some time after a cataclysmic event has wiped out just about all life on Earth a man and his son head through a desolate wasteland heading south where they believe they might have a chance of survival. Food is incredibly scarce and many survivors are resorting to cannibalism so not only must they search for food they must avoid becoming food for somebody else. With such dangers other people cannot be trusted and acts of kindness can't be afforded. On their journey they eventually find a well stocked bunker but when they here signs of other people the father knows it is time to move on; always heading further south and towards the sea.While it is difficult to describe this film as enjoyable as it is almost unremittingly bleak and whenever something good does happen it only servers to make things look worst when things return to normal. The characters are never referred to by name giving it a more impersonal feel. Director John Hillcoat did a fine job; giving everything a grey appearance that made it look as if the Earth itself was getting old and dying. Viggo Mortensen did a fine job as the man and youngster Kodi Smit-McPhee was good as his son. Given the tone of the film it isn't as great shock to learn that the ending isn't exactly happy; even those who are still alive have to contend with the fact that they are on a dying world. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching; just don't watching if you are feeling down; you'll only end up feeling worse!,The Road

9,paul_haakonsen,Interesting,7,18 May 2010,"I had been told that this was a boring and uneventful movie, but still I wanted to see it.And now having seen it, I must say that it is not boring nor is it uneventful. Sure, this is not a movie with constant action and such, it has just enough action and suspense to keep it going and keep it interesting for its entire length.The story is nice and manages to get a lot of out very little. The entire movie is solemn and gloomy. The environments and settings were really, really awesome, despite their lack of color. But this was exactly what made it all work so well. Now, with a relatively small cast and support cast, the weight of the movie is carried by the few actors that are on the screen all the time. And they did a good job at doing just that. Hats off to the lead actors for their ability to keep the movie floating.However, I do not believe this is the type of movie that you will watch again at a later point.Definitely worth checking out, because it is quite different from most Hollywood movies.",The Road
10,Quinoa1984,"""You must think I'm from another world.""",9,21 October 2009,"The wonderful thing about the Road is that it will more than likely please the two camps: the one that has not read Cormac McCarthy's Pulitzer prize-winning book, and the one that has. There's the nervous feeling one gets when watching the theatrical trailer, though - will it be this super action-packed spectacle, will those images that open the trailer with ""THE END OF THE WORLD IS NEAR!"" stick around, and will Charlize Theron actually be in the movie that much? As it turns out, if you liked the book very much and worried about how its uber-bleak and incredibly dark and (especially) gray landscapes would appear, it provides that perfectly. And if you haven't read the book... it still works as a movie, as a simple-but-not story of a father and son survival drama- and clinging on to their humanity- first, and then a post-apocalypse thriller far second.To describe the plot is not impossible but sort of unnecessary. All you need to know going in (if you're part of not-read-book camp) is that a father and son, after becoming on their own after the mother of the house exits, are traveling together across a true post-apocalypse landscape to a coast. We never are given a fully clear explanation as to why or how the apocalypse happened. This is more than fine; because John Hillcoat's film centers on the father and son (called in the credits simply Father and Son, played by Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee), there doesn't need to be anything really specific. At least this will be fine for most people who may be by now tired of the usual viral or religious or (damn) 2012-type explanations. We're given hints though, to be sure, that there may have been mutations or some kind of earth-bound phenomenon (earthquakes happen a couple of times), and past this we, like the travelers, are left to our own devices.How it happened isn't as fascinating and visually compelling, anyway, than how it looks. The Road provides us many scenes and vistas that are precisely grim and desolate and terrible. Some of these are full of visual details like big city-scape shots, and others, like when the Father and Son are on the ramp of a highway, is intimate and hard (this setting also provides one of the most touching moments as Mortensen's character finally 'lets go' of two important details from the deceased mother of his son). And other times Hillcoat lets us just take in the gray-ness of everything, just as one could take in the sight of masses of flies in his film the Proposition. It's against this backdrop of rain and sludge and grime and decay that imbues this intense bond between the father and son so greatly, and the complexity that comes with not just staying alive but retaining humanity and dignity and doing right and wrong by the people they encounter.This may not be news to people who read the book. I still, having read it two years ago (which sadly seems like long ago in usually remembering specific images of a book), can't get the descriptions of scenes out of my head, or the stark manner of how characters talked and dread and existential horror was relayed. But, again, the film not only respects this but gives it further life. Dialog scenes in the movie- save for a couple of the flashback scenes with Charlize Theron's Mother character- are never obtrusive to the storytelling, which is a rightful concern to have with an adaptation of the book. And, more importantly, the acting and chemistry between the two leads is incredible. Mortensen is a given to be an actor embedded in his character, so much so that when he takes off his shirt we see his bony torso as being really that, and watching him is magnetic. Yet it's also crucial to see how good the kid Smit-McPhee is too, especially when it comes time for scenes where the boy has to deal with his father's growing desperation or the electrifying showdown with a thief.To be sure, a couple of walk-on roles by Guy Pearce as another fellow traveler and especially Robert Duvall as a ""90 year old man"" as his character says provide some needed space, and Hillcoat has a couple of very wise flashback/dream bits with The Man and his wife (namely a very small, brilliant moment at a piano), but it's the all on the two main character to lead the film, and it's on them that it delivers so strongly. As long as you know that this is a film centered not on big action sequences (though there are a couple), and not on big special effects (though there's that too), and it's more akin to a life-or-death-and-what-else story not unlike Grave of the Fireflies, you'll know what you're getting with the Road. It is very depressing on the whole, and not exactly what I would recommend as a 'first-date' movie - unless you're so hot for Mortensen and/or Cormac McCarthy you don't care either way. However, it's *good* depressing, and equally the best adaptation of the book possible while a tremendous, original vision for the casual movie-goer.",The Road
11,Coventry,"The Road Ahead is Empty, Paved with Miles of the Unknown",7,21 February 2010,"There's a small revival of ""it's the end of the world as we know it"" movies going on in the cinema since a couple of years, and that's a trend I can only encourage! I really love post-apocalyptic movies and lately we had some really great titles like ""I Am Legend"", ""Nine"" and ""Doomsday"". The very best of them all, however, appeared to be this faithful adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel. Why? Because it revolves on atmosphere, characters and morality lessons instead of on wild action. ""The Road"" is actually a very rudimentary and prototypic post-apocalyptic tale. This is how probably everybody always imagines the world to look like after some sort of devastating holocaust event: desolate, unfertile, hostile, depressing and with lethal danger lurking behind every corner. In such a landscape, a father and his son are heading south towards the coast. The father pushes forward a miserable shopping trolley with only a handful of belongings and meanwhile tries to teach his son that they are good guys and that it's up to them to ""uphold the fire inside"". Their long journey is often interfered with the usual cataclysm obstacles, like cannibalistic plunderer gangs, petrified fellow survivors, immense fires and emotionally demolishing flashbacks about their wife and mother who didn't have the energy to fight. There are a lot of elements in ""The Road"" that are exact right and couldn't possibly be improved. The ambiance, for one, is authentically melancholic and discouraging. This isn't one of those movies that claim that the remaining holocaust survivors will drive around in flamboyant vehicles and gather in psychopathic cults, like in ""Mad Max 2"" or ""Doomsday"", but actually illustrates that the survivors are the unfortunate ones. Irrevocably linked with the authentic atmosphere are the bleak filming locations and colorless set pieces. I read somewhere that the cast and crew traveled to real-life nature disaster locations, like for example the hurricane Katrina area in New Orleans, to shoot plausible tableaux. The film truly benefices from the realism, and the sight of dying trees and completely abandoned highways alone will leave a permanent impression on you for sure. Last but certainly not least, the acting performances are formidable. Viggo Mortensen once again delivers a truly dedicated and obviously fanatic performance as the father, and he receives astoundingly great support from the young Australian born Kodi Smit-McPhee, who coincidentally also looks exactly like his cinematic mother Charlize Theron. There are also some wondrous brief appearances from great actors like Guy Pearce, Michael K. Williams and particularly veteran Robert Duvall. Unfortunately, ""The Road"" isn't 100% the legitimate masterpiece that I somewhat hoped to have stumbled upon. It is an extremely slow film and honestly could have used a little more speed for its own good. I'm definitely a supporter of tight atmosphere and emphasis on detailed character drawings, but the sequences with the cannibals and the barely living skeletons in the basement felt like they were deliberately unfinished. The flashbacks with Charlize Theron are actually a bit redundant and seemingly just included to evoke more sentimental reactions from the audience. The music, courtesy of Nick Cave, is brilliant but just a tad bit overused and I personally found certain sequences (like the Coca-Cola sequence) to be slightly over-the-top saddening. Minor defaults like this are to blame that ""The Road"" presumably won't ever be considered as a classic or even unforgettable. ""The Road"" actually reminded me of the obscure mid-70's Sci-Fi gem ""A Boy and his Dog"", only with a son instead of a pet and without the pitch-black and sadistic humor.",The Road
12,michaelRokeefe,The road is rough and hopeless.,7,14 July 2010,"THE ROAD is an adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Cormac McCarthy.A depressing, but interesting saga of a man(Viggo Mortensen)and his young son(Kodi Smit-McPhee)trekking their way across a post-apocalyptic United States where hardly a disparaging word is heard. The man's wife(Charlize Theron)has her own ideas of how to deal with the assured end of her life...walking out into the ashen-black night to never return. The man and his son must find a way to survive starvation and roaming tribes of cannibal nomads in their search for something resembling civilization. The best acting comes from the young boy, while Mortensen and Theron may have well phoned their roles in. As you would expect the scenery has very little life, but is there to keep the movie in a dark and devastated mood. Two songs ""Westerly"" and ""Grey Eyes"" were written and performed by Mortensen. Other cast credits: Robert Duvall, Michael K. Williams, Gina Preciado and Guy Pearce.",The Road
13,hitchcockthelegend,The clocks stopped at 1:17,8,16 July 2010,"The Road is directed by John Hillcoat (The Proposition) and written by Joe Penhall (Enduring Love). Based on the 2006 novel of the same name by American author Cormac McCarthy (No Country For Old Men), the film stars Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee as a father and his son trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic world.How do you sell such a sombre piece to the film loving public? I'm not sure I personally can, such is the whirly like emotions dominating my thoughts. OK, it's a grim and bleak film, of that there's no doubt. Director Hillcoat is not out to make a thrilling end of the world actioner. Staying faithful to McCarthy's novel, this is now a world where animal & plant life is practically extinct, where this particular part of America is lawless and populated by cannibal types. Humanity has long since left the arena. How we arrived at such desolation is not clear - intentionally so. We are now just witnessing the after effects of something world changing, the fall out personally involving us as we hit the road with man & boy.Hillcoat and his cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe have painted a clinically dead world from which to tell the story. Scorched soil is home to threadbare trees, the skyline punctured by the wreckage of man's progress passed, storms come and go as if to taunt the characters. It's a living hell that begs the question on why would anyone want to survive in it? So here's the thing that finally hit me like a sledgehammer some five days after watching the film, it's not just the bleakness of the apocalypse that gnaws away at you, it's also the expertly portrayed study of parenting. So emotively played by Mortensen, with Smit-McPhee essaying incredible vulnerability, it sinks the heart the longer the movie goes on. All of which is leading up to the ending, where we get something absorbing, revealing and utterly smart.Tough viewing for sure, but compelling and thought provoking throughout. 8/10",The Road
14,Theo Robertson,The Bleak Tone Is Both A Strength And A Weakness,8,24 February 2013,"This film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's 2006 novel THE ROAD opened to rave reviews . Despite these reviews from professional critics it only received a limited release and fared very poorly . The brief glimpses I'd seen from via clips and trailers had cinematography that leapt out and grabbed me and I was puzzled as to why it didn't do better at both the box office and award ceremonies . After seeing the film in full it's perhaps understandable why THE ROAD didn't do better . Australian director John Hillcoat has crafted an impressive but utterly bleak and depressing movie where mankind is headed for extinction and considering a large amount of survivors have resorted to cannibalism one can't help thinking the human race won't be missed . Make no mistake this isn't the comic book capers of MAD MAX , nor is it feelgood post apocalypse cinema along the lines of the more successful THE BOOK OF ELI , or the wish fulfillment cosy catastrophe 1970s BBC drama SURVIVORS . This is nihilistic speculative fiction that American cinema ignores similar in tone to John Christopher Apart from the unrelentingly depressing tone some people might be put off by the lack of explanation to the story . The inciting incident of the apocalypse is never explained but it's easy to join up the dots that it was either caused by a Super-volcano or an asteroid strike leading to a nuclear winter effect . Why are people kept in a cellar ? You know why even though you don't like to think about . Sadly there's not enough explanation in other areas such as why is the father so bent on trekking across a desolate landscape to the Ocean ? And whatever his motives why has it taken him several years to come up with this plan ? As with most type of stories in this genre it's never explained what the protagonists have done to survive in this time frame lasting several years . Obviously the bad guys survived by eating other people but what the father , mother and son survive on during this time ? Everything starts collapsing from a logic point of view when you start dissecting the story Viggo Mortensen is the actor equivalent of cinematographer Roger Deakins . He's always impressive but since making his big breakthrough in LORD OF THE RINGS award ceremonies constantly ignore him . THE ROAD is the type of film that is carried by its lead actor and this film sees Mortensen give his all time best performance that was criminally overlooked at the Oscars but again you can perhaps understand why nominations for Best Actor , Best Supporting Actor and Best Cinematography weren't seriously considered . Oscar awards are usually given out to triumph of the human spirit feelgood type movies and THE ROAD is on a one way track to the extinction of our speciesAnd that's the fundamental problem with THE ROAD . It's not so much a problem because it is truly memorable , contains superb technical aspects and it's a film that makes its audience think . Unfortunately you'll be left thinking how lucky we are to live in a world of civilization and how quickly this might all fall apart . I was totally compelled and involved in this movie but I'm in no hurry to watch it again . In many ways it resembles the BBC nuclear holocaust docudrama THREADS from 1984 which seared itself in to the memory of the generation who watched it . THE ROAD will have the same effect",The Road
15,LeonLouisRicci,Plot less and Pointless,1,18 May 2013,"The look of this Film is akin to one those Pulitzer Prize winning Coffee-Table Books you have seen with all those powerful, bleak, and heartbreaking black and white photos of The Depression. Those sharply focused stills of unwashed Civilians, a lot of time Children and Women, looking, well, depressed. Why shouldn't they? All or most Hope is lost and they are living a bad dream of emptiness. Empty bellies and full of despair.So we get it, this is the World, or what's left of it, that is encountered in this bleak, plot less, pointless, and painful Film that must be endured to make, or rather wallow, in its point of no return and no value. What we have here is... ""to eat or not to eat...People"".""Carry the fire"", you must, or succumb to become without Soul. That's as deep and as profound as this painful Picture postulates. It paints, without color, a landscape of nothingness. The Characters are without hygiene and have low believability and an even lower empathy quota. The Papa is stuck in some kind of recurring rut of slow-witted stagnation and the Kid whines, cries and is forever pulling and tugging at everything but the heartstrings.This is just a one beat Movie that is a downbeat and in the end there can be no pity or uplifting turn, although the Movie tries desperately with a Hallmark Moment, spoiled only by a lack of soap and water, complete with a Dog.",The Road
16,dbborroughs,A solid but dark tale that will hang with you even if its a bit one note,7,10 January 2010,"After the end, a man and his son travel to the coast in the hope of finding something better.Cormac McCarthy's dark novel novel is turned into a dark film. Its a dark ride down the road to where there are only a few left and not everyone is a good guy. Beautifully bleak film its filled with rich performances and a dark sense of what happen after the world ends. What the end is exactly is never spelled out but it effectively destroyed civilization and then the survivors seem to have done much of the rest.I find that this is a hard film to write about. Its more a tone poem than a real story since much of what we see are fragments. Time shifts, the past is referred to but never clear. Lines of dialog imply more than we are told outright. Its a film that takes you to a place and then forces you to wander about. There is a sadness and a darkness that is troubling. There is little in the way of light.And yet there is hope. Not everyone is bad. One thing that happens seems to imply a lack of finality.Its a good film. Its not a perfect film. I find that there is a sameness to some of it (which is understandable considering what is going on). One sequence kind of disappointed since it spells out things that were otherwise implied, it also made me start to think about things a bit too much. In a weird way I'm kind of disappointed that I'm not more disturbed by the film (I was hoping to be completely depressed by it.) Look for a bunch of Oscar noms. I'm guessing this might even get a Best Picture Nomination since we're going to have 10 nominations this year (I wouldn't go that far). Certainly this is almost certain to get technical awards since the film looks so good.For those who want to see a dark tale I recommend it. For those who'd rather not think about such things I suggest you skip it.This would make a very good double feature with the recent film Carriers, about the world after an out break of a deadly disease.",The Road
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,The journey and destination are both well worth it,8,2 March 2010,"I have not read the novel(however, I understand that it is incredibly faithful in all respects), nor any other by the author, seen any other adaptations of his work, and this is the first film I've watched by this director. This instantly caught my attention, as I am always intrigued by dystopian, post-apocalyptic settings and the refusal to die. I won't lie to you; this is one of the only truly excellent movies to treat said subject that I know of(I have not been able to catch all that I could yet, but I've heard little to convince me that many of them are that compelling). Themes like humanity, hope, pragmatism, and living vs. merely surviving are all explored rather well. This is not a disaster flick, action or horror. It can be quite tense, and there is a continuous feeling of imminent danger throughout. The production design leaves nothing to be desired; the remains of the civilized world and nature are utterly breathtaking and unforgettable. While it can be downright gut-wrenching and devastating in its emotionally riveting drama and the dark and gritty tone are just about constant, there are cute and uplifting moments, but I will not give any away. There is the right amount of dialog, and every line is marvelously written and delivered. The acting is flawless. Mortensen proves his considerable talent once more, Theron, Pearce and Duvall are amazing with relatively limited screen-time, and Kodi Smit-McPhee... remember that name, if he gets a chance, he can become a huge hit. Such range for his age. So convincing. This is not about what happened... it is about what comes after. The ambiguity is effective. There is a bit of disturbing content, a little bloody violence/gore, infrequent strong language and a few instances of very brief male nudity in this. Since I submitted this, I got the DVD. It comes with a very good(if he does go ""uhm"" a bunch... he's not used to recording them) commentary track by John Hillcoat(where he, among other things, goes into talking with and getting Cormac McCarthy's blessing, about making it and difficulties related to doing so, etc.), a well-done, informational and concise 11 and a half minutes behind-the-scenes featurette, 6 and a half minutes of deleted scenes and trailers for five other pictures. I recommend this to anyone mature enough to handle it. 8/10",The Road
18,george.schmidt,A Journey Well-worth Taking; one of the year's best - career-high for Mortensen.,10,2 December 2009,"THE ROAD (2009) **** Viggo Mortensen, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Charlize Theron, Robert Duvall, Guy Pearce, Garret Dillahunt. Grimly realized adaptation of the award-winning best-seller by Cormac McCarthy's post-apocalyptic morality tale set in a barren, bleak wasteland in the near- future after some form of unspoken, cataclysmic event that focuses on an unnamed father and son (Mortensen in one of his best performances and stunning new comer Smit-McPhee) on the ultimate journey into fear: survival of the fittest indeed. Filmmaker John Hillcoat – who adapted the screenplay with Joe Penhall – successfully translates the despair yet unbridled spirit of humanity abetted by expert cinematography by Javier Aguiresarobe (all grey palette); Chris Kennedy's amazing production design and Gershon Ginsburg's art direction. Oscar-worthy Mortensen – barely recognizable as a wizened, dirt-caked, emaciated 'thing' more than 'man'; his haunted eyes the only glimmer of hope/life beneath all that horror – buoys the bleak storyline with his natural chemistry of his charge Smit-McPhee –one of the most amazing debuts of a young actor to date- is the real deal.

19,neil-476,Depressing and inconclusive,6,4 February 2010,"Isn't it typical? You wait for years for a post-apocalyptic nomad film, and then two come along at once. But The Road is completely different to The Book Of Eli (the two films have arrived in the UK barely minutes apart). Whereas The Book Of Eli was hot, dry, sepia and gloomy, The Road is cold, wet, grey and gloomy. Common features include ragged clothes, a lack of personal hygiene (addressed briefly in The Road), a tendency towards cannibalism, and an absence of law and order.But there are differences, also. Whereas The Book Of Eli took itself very seriously despite the fact that it was essentially a sci-fi romp, The Road takes itself very seriously because it is based on a Serious Book by a Serious Writer (which I must confess to not having read). And, while The Book Of Eli had a narrative thrust (the main character is driven by a need to complete a task), The Road has virtually no narrative at all, being a serious of vignettes about a father and son wandering apparently aimlessly around endless damp desolation.But I'm being sarcastic, and it is perhaps unfair to make comparisons, because there is some worthwhile stuff here. Top of the heap is the performance of Kodi Smit-McPhee as Viggo Mortensen's unnamed son. Mortensen, too, is good, in a part which was, I felt, not terribly well written, and Robert Duvall, almost unrecognisable, is excellent in a small character part.The film suffers from a lack of resolution. Ostensibly this appears to be untrue - following the death of the father, the son is ""adopted"" by a family - but the fact that there is no move towards anything which will prolong survival means that I left the cinema thinking that the boy's inevitable death had only been put off for a short while.So, while admiring the craft with which the post-apocalyptic world was constructed, and the acting ability of those in the film, I was never really engaged, and I ended up ultimately disappointed and unable to see quite why the film (and the book, if the film is faithful to it) should be regarded as Seriously as they appear to think they should be.",The Road
20,ferguson-6,Carry the Fire,7,28 November 2009,"Greetings again from the darkness. The most recent adaptation of a Cormac McCarthy novel brought us the fantastic No Country for Old Men (Coen Bros.). McCarthy's post-apocalyptic The Road did not seem to set up well as filmed entertainment. Director John Hillcoat proves otherwise.Make no mistake. This film is as bleak and filled with despair as any you have ever seen. This is not the SFX of fluff like 2012. This is the humanistic side of desperation and survival in a world where what little has survived seems grotesque and evil.It is a phenomenal movie from a technical aspect, yet a higher rating seems off the mark, as so very few movie goers will find the entertainment value of such an achievement. While viewing, one can't help but weigh the ever-present option of suicide. What would we do in this situation? Do you continue to carry the fire or do you ask, what's the point, and hit the eject trigger? If you thought Charlize Theron was unappealing in Monster, you will find her absolutely intolerable here. Her beauty is overridden by her angst and unwillingness to continue the fight for her survival. Is she the rational one or totally selfish? Really good question.The vast majority of the film is Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee on their quest for the coast ... their ultimate goal for survival. The gray and lifeless landscape would (and does)suck the hope and soul right out of most. Viggo keeps trudging while teaching his young, more sensitive son, who by the way, is a dead ringer for Charlize (were she a 12 year old boy). The grayness of the film is so intense, that the dream/flashback sequences couldn't help but make me wonder if life were black and white, would dreams be vivid and colorful? Fans of No Country for Old Men will catch a glimpse of Garret Dillahunt as the hillbilly gang member who stumbles upon the Father and Son - Dillahunt was Tommy Lee Jones' entertaining deputy. Robert Duvall and Guy Pearce also have brief, but welcome, supporting roles. Duvall actually does quite a bit with his limited lines.While it seems odd to release this one at Thanksgiving - it's not in the tradition of mass-appeal holiday fare, it is a must see for any true film lover or literature addict. To see the gray and stillness become as overwhelming as what is usually limited to one's imagination is worth the effort.",The Road
21,Wuchakk,"Grey, maudlin post-apocalyptic drama with some horrific thrills",5,20 June 2021,"After a mass extinction event, a man & his son (Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee) walk from western Pennsylvania to the Southeast coast trying to survive a life-or-death situation in a world without laws as people prey on each other. Charlize Theron, Robert Duvall, Guy Pearce and Molly Parker show up for small parts.Based on Cormac McCarthy's final novel, ""The Road"" (2009) is similar to ""Carriers,"" released almost three months earlier. Unlike semi-goofy post-apocalyptic films like the original Mad Max trilogy, ""The Road"" and ""Carriers"" are deadly serious from beginning to end with no comic book nonsense. This works in their favor because both films give us a window into what life would be like after a worldwide crisis destroys conventional society.Each film explores one's reaction to such a world-ending disaster: Do we forsake all sense of morality in an attempt to survive - lie, steal, forsake and murder - or do we hold on to our moral compass, come what may? Is life worth living if you must become an immoral, wicked savage to survive? Isn't it better to live with dignity at all costs - fight with nobility and die with dignity when and if we must?Some denounce both flicks on the grounds that they're too downbeat and depressing, but wouldn't a lawless world be a very dire situation? In other words, the downbeat vibe reflects the reality of the story.However, ""Carriers"" is the superior of the two by far. ""The Road"" is tediously one-dimensional and unrelentingly somber. Plus the dynamics of the father & son are boring with the annoying boy almost singlehandedly ruining the movie. They needed to find a girl or a woman to shake things up - anything to dispel the grey monotony.The film runs 1 hour, 51 minutes, and was shot mostly in western Pennsylvania & West Virginia (the towering bridge), plus Oregon and Spirit Lake near Mount St. Helens, Washington (the log-jammed lake).GRADE: C+",The Road
22,gradyharp,On Being Alone,9,29 November 2010,"THE ROAD, Cormac McCarthy's disturbing post-apocalyptic novel, created for the reader a brittle, cold, callous, terrifying place, almost without dialogue, relying on just word painting. In many ways Joe Penhall's adaptation for the screen obeys that impulse - the film is fairly quiet, allowing the horror to work its way into our minds. Unfortunately the film thinks we cannot sustain the tension of the impossibly bleak scenario, so there are flashback moments that actually contain color - moments that focus on Charlize Theron as the wife and mother of the main characters in an attempt to bring some visual relief. Otherwise director John Hillcoat seems to fully understand McCarthy's vision and does a fine job taking us through it. The story is simple; a man (Viggo Mortensen) and his son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) have been wandering the blighted surface of the planet earth after the near complete destruction of life. There are others whom they meet, some 'good guys' and some 'bad guys', but the overall force behind walking the barren planet is the need for food and warmth for survival and to avoid the possibility of cannibalism. The man and boy walk with 'fire' inside, always heading South where they hope to find warmth. Along the way they meet others, also without names: and old man (Robert Duvall), a thief (Michael Kenneth Williams), a gang member (Garret Dillahunt), and a family - Guy Pierce and Molly Parker. The story has an ending - or does it? We are left in medias res with the question of survival uncertain.Though given the fact that he has few lines of dialogue, Viggo Mortensen manages to create a credible father and committed survivor and his acting is astonishingly fine. Kodi Smit-McPhee likewise manages to make us believe in his character and may just become a fine actor as an adult. The audience for this film may be narrow: few, in today's tense world situation, may wish to see the possible outcome of our behavior as custodians of this planet. But this is a book that should have been written and a film that deserves to be seen to remind us of alternatives. Grady Harp",The Road
23,zetes,"About as good as the novel, which I honestly didn't think was any kind of masterpiece, either",7,7 February 2010,"A pretty good adaptation of a pretty good book. I'd rate the book slightly above the movie because, well, it is the source material. Not that it can't be improved upon. The film version just doesn't. It pretty faithfully recreates the novel, with only a few minor differences. The only things that really bothered me is that, first, it wasn't nearly dark enough; it's supposed to be almost a perpetual nighttime in the book, and, while I suppose that might be a little too difficult to take while watching a film, you can often see rays of sunlight. That shouldn't be. The second thing is the kid's too old. Really, the kid in the book, probably supposed to be around 6 or 7, seems too old, too (he's a baby in the flashbacks, which means the Man, as he is known in the novel, has survived half a decade in this post-Apocalyptic wasteland), but at around 10 or 11, he seems way too old (we see him born in the flashbacks here). Anyway, I actually think the film suffers from the same flaws as the novel in general. The biggest weakness in both media is that there never seems to be much of a point to this story. I love post-Apocalytpic fiction, but The Road always seems so vague, you're always trying to make it into an allegory (I mean, especially since the two main characters are the Man and the Boy - it just feels like it has to be an allegory, right?). But it just never really works. The whole genre started life out of fear of nuclear war, and, while that's the most likely scenario here, too, it's just never clear enough what McCarthy is going for. Just taken as post-Apocalyptic fiction, though, I like how it depicts the very end of humanity. It's all pretty hopeless, and, while it's not unique in its point of view, it seems to go farther than most anything else. Viggo Mortensen is quite good, and the production design/special effects are excellent. Overall, it's pretty decent.",The Road

That doesn't mean that it is a bad flick, you keep watching what is going on and how it will end.In fact, with all the big names on the cover of the Blu Ray it's only Viggo Mortensen and the boy Kodi Smit-McPhee (who later moved as lead in Let Me In (2010)) that carry this depressing flick. The don't have any name in The Road as they are wandering around a destroyed world, it's not explained what happened but it doesn't matter. There are gangs all around, some just out to kill everybody others are cannibals but don't think now that the blood is sputtering on your screen, in fact there's almost no blood. It's pure how to survive and the man making his boy ready in the case he dies. The overtone of The Road is grey and that doesn't give you an easy feeling. There are almost no effects except for the destroyed world of course. It's strange that I picked it up today to watch it as it is the day before the world ends for so many.Clocking in at almost 113 minutes it isn't that easy to watch, it's slow without real action like for example in that other apocalyptic flick Book Of Eli (2010).

So he takes the boy and goes south, pardon the pun.Not unlike Carriers, this movie follows the dissolution of society in times of crisis. However, the main characters keep to their humanity for as long as possible or, as is the case of the little boy, to ridiculous extremes.The bleak feel of the film may not be for the liking of everyone and also the slow pace, with nothing much happening throughout the movie except on a psychological level, may annoy a little.

30,Buddy-51,a visual masterpiece,9,13 October 2010,"It would be hard to imagine a bleaker or more depressing view of mankind's future than the one offered by ""The Road,"" scenarist Joe Penhall and director John Hillcoat's unsparing, visually stunning adaptation of Cormac MCarthy's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, a bitter tale set in a post-apocalyptic world that, paradoxically, comes to resemble what life must have been like for Homo sapiens in the early days of the species.A bearded Viggo Mortensen plays an unnamed man who wanders the world with his young son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) after some unspecified cataclysm has rendered the earth a vast, ash-covered wasteland, utterly devoid of animals and plants, where the sun and sky have become perpetually obscured by a shroud of smoke and clouds encircling the planet. The few remaining humans have been reduced to roving bands of armed survivors who often resort to eating one another to survive. The man and his son must constantly stay one step ahead of such people, becoming more and more isolated in a world where to trust someone or to extend the hand of friendship to a stranger could mean the end of one's own life.Yet, as much as possible, the protagonist attempts to rise above their dire circumstances, holding onto as much of what makes us human as he can without endangering himself and his son in the process. He still feels a need to instill a sense of hope and basic human decency into his child, values rooted in his own memories of a time before the catastrophe, just prior to the lad's birth. Thus, even as they are dying of starvation, Mortensen teaches his boy how to distinguish the ""good guys"" from the ""bad guys,"" and how to live by a code of ethics that may be as antiquated and useless as the dilapidated buildings and rusted-out vehicles that lay strewn across the landscape through which they travel. But can even he tell who the good guys and the bad guys are anymore? Or is he becoming as callous and inured to the suffering of others as those he fears and warns the boy against? Though ""The Road"" definitely doesn't sugarcoat its material, it does provide some moments of warmth and deep-seated emotion to help mitigate what would otherwise be unrelieved grimness. These come in the form of random acts of generosity and kindness doled out to strangers the two meet along the way (Robert Duvall being one) and in moments of extraordinary tenderness between a father, who fears for what will happen to his boy when he is no longer able to take care of him, and a son who can only imagine what life was like in the time before he was born and who has implicit faith in the man who has vowed to love, guide and protect him from the hardships of life.In addition to the three previously mentioned actors, the movie also features Charlize Theron and Guy Pearce in key minor roles.If nothing else, ""The Road"" is a masterpiece of production design, art direction and cinematography, one that perfectly creates a world almost totally denuded of color, where all we see comes in various shades of grey (principal filming was done in Oregon, Louisiana and Pennsylvania).This ineffably sad and haunting film may be just too bleak for some to stomach, but for those able to see beneath the surface gloom, it offers hope that one can retain one's humanity in even the most inhuman of worlds.",The Road
31,thesar-2,A Man and His Boy,3,5 July 2010,"The Road, or A Man and his Boy.I don't know how many times I've repeated myself on this Hollywood cliché: in life things are supposed to happen in threes, but in La-La land things happen in deuces. A Bug's Life, Antz. Dante's Peak, Volcano. Deep Impact, Armageddon. Mission to Mars, Red Planet. Infamous, Capote. Paul Blart: Mall Cop, Observe & Report. Killers, Knight & Day. And on and on, these VERY similar movies come out very close to the same release dates of each other. Now, I get to add The Book of Eli and The Road.Even though the above movies are very similar, there's always one better than the others. I will give you a list, just for fun, of which are the better of the two ending with The Book vs. Road.1. A Bug's Life surely stomps out the Antz. 2. Dante's Peak is bigger than that of a mere Volcano. 3. There was a Deep(er) Impact before the Armageddon. 4. I've seen neither the Red Planet nor any Mission to Mars training video. 5. Capote was great yet I have not viewed the Infamous version. 6. Paul Blart was the ideal Mall Cop who Observed & Reported Seth's terrible follow-up. 7. Knight & Day is King where as Killers remains, in my to-see list as unseen. 8. Take the back-Road. Eli's Book reigns.I'm sure I've left out a few (dozen) but this should give you an example of Hollywood's obsession with releasing ideas they think are so desired by the general public, they need two films to stretch out the American dollar. Unfortunately, in the case of The Book of Eli and The Road, audiences weren't that interested in the age-old post-apocalyptic genre. Neither were the Oscars.I honestly thought, seeing the early previews of The Road it surely will be nominated. Well, of course, that was my trailer-impression. I hadn't seen the movie, and afterwards, I'm glad it didn't get celebrated.Was it a terrible movie? By all means, no. Depressing, average and so little going on, it wasn't one I'll ever watch again. Mortensen plays a man who is heading South on, duh, the road, with his son to protect him, not only from all the post-apocalyptic cannibals but his own mother, seen in flashbacks. Literally, that's the entire movie, other than a few little things. We get a little father/son time, a little life-lessons, a little food found, a little interaction with ""the good guys"" and a little background what happened prior to the world becoming ash.I've heard the book, with the same name, it's based upon is much better. Unfortunately, since I barely had enough desire to spend two hours watching desolate and torn world, I have even less yearning to spend my average time of three weeks reading about it. (Slow reader, here.)I found the action was okay and the acting mediocre – I've seen both Mortensen and Duvall act circles around their performances here. (And speaking of which, oddly, coincidentally or from the book, Duvall's character's namedEli.) I'm sure someone else sees some depth in the movie, I missed. But I was just so..bored. The best parts were the flashbacks, but they didn't give me everything I wanted, such as the reason for the ""end of days.""Leading me into one of my great desireswhy not see an IMMEDIATE post-apocalyptic movie. Such as what Terminator 2: Judgment Day did in Sarah Connor's dream or in the wonderful opening of Reign of Fire? Meaning, why not show a nice day, some blast and the next few days to months. Heck, 28 Days Later, was in fact, 28 days later. Planet of the Apes was long after monkeymen took over. The Book of Eli is 30 years following some unexplained aftermath. Mad Max didn't take place 5 minutes later and The Boy & his Dog had already known each other for awhile. Heck, even the so called ""true"" Judgment Day/Terminator movie: Terminator: Salvation took place years following the events of Judgment Day. What's wrong with these people? Isn't there anyone else out there, other than me, who would like to see a full-length pre-to-immediately post-apocalyptic film and not just in flashbacks? I'm sure if I do some research, I could find one. In the meantime, I have to settle for people moping around, searching for both shelter and food/water.True, I did feel one great thing following this movie: be thankful for what we have – in a flash, it could all be gone. This film didn't necessarily teach me that lesson, but it reminded me how we truly live in excess as something like this truly could happen.Until it does, I'm going to enjoy life and forget movies, such as The Road, that make the world gray. If you must watch this, take from it I did and move onto happier topics, don't take things, anything, for granted, and help others as the spirit of a child would. No need to dwell on what ""could"" happen, but what we can do now.",The Road
32,Robert_duder,"Hauntingly sad, and beautifully powerful",8,12 September 2013,"Several years ago I read the book by Cormac McCarthy. It was a breathtaking, shocking and sad book. I was very excited for the film and wouldn't you know I waited four years to finally sit down and watch it. I even owned the film for most of those years and just kept putting it off. The film absolutely met my expectations. It was a beautiful and horribly sad post-apocalyptic film about survival and the human condition. They did an excellent job at capturing the gritty and depressing tone of the book. It has been long enough since I read the book that I can't really compare them fairly but the film stands on its own merits. I suspected that they would have to change the end of film because the book does anything but tie it up into a neat little bow. Unfortunately, by the film makers doing exactly that I felt like they really hurt their own film. For the mainstream audience, it is necessary to make everything have a happy little tidy ending but this film is better than that. It is so much smarter than you average post-apocalyptic film and a more diverse and enigmatic ending would have felt so much better on the end of this story.There are few roles that Viggo Mortensen hasn't impressed me in. He has a range and depth as an actor that is truly impressive. He is absolutely riveting as this father who is so desperate to protect his son. I often thought it almost felt like he was too pathetic but then looking back I realize that is the entire point. He has past the point of survival and strength and is just crawling along to protect the only thing he has left. Mortensen nails this role perfectly. Kodi Smit-McPhee is also very good in his role as the boy. Many reviewers noted that he was whiny and annoying and sometimes that is true but consider that this boy has been sheltered and protected by his father. He has known nothing but death and chaos and this barren wasteland and in that aspect he is perfect. The chemistry between him and Mortensen works but then at the same time I felt like it was very awkward at times which doesn't really for the tone of the film. Charlie Theron does alright in a small almost cameo as Mortensen's wife as he flashes back before the apocalypse. I don't believe there were any flashback scenes in the book and I didn't feel they were entirely necessary in the film. So in that regard Theron's character wasn't necessary and as much as the man loved her, she seemed rather cruel in most scenes. Robert Duvall has an excellent cameo as the old man. Its a small scene but very effective and really enjoyed his performance.As I was watching the film I thought...you know this is one exception where a director with experience in music videos might actually pull off a really great vision. Well, I'm smarter than I look because John Hillcoat's background is...music videos. His style (as shown again in the film Lawless) is grey scale, gritty, dark and works so well for this. The world he creates around these two characters is brilliant. I would watch this film again just to watch the set around them. It is so incredibly bleak and might be one of the best post apocalyptic worlds and creations I have ever seen. There were some stumbles in the film...the father son chemistry, the ending, Theron's character but this is anything but your run of the mill sci-fi film. It was a near-perfect rendition of McCarthy's book which was smart and savvy. This is an artistic look at the ending of the world and I really enjoyed it. I'm glad I finally got to see it! 8.5/10",The Road

34,paul2001sw-1,Empty Road,7,6 June 2010,"'The Road', which has won awards, tells the story of a father and son struggling to stay alive, and to stay human, after an apocalyptic tragedy. No scientific explanation is offered of what has killed all the animals and plants; while sociologically, the world has already moved beyond the interesting phase (how would people organise themselves when everything is running out) into the end game where a few last survivors trust nothing and no-one. The film is brilliantly shot but lacking in variety, not just in the cinematography, but also in the plot, which proceeds repetitively and without complete coherence (food seems very rare, so that a single tin of canned food represents riches; but if so, how do the characters survive the weeks that pass between discovering such delights?) - it's one of those movies where there's a lot of staring and sighing to prove how serious everything is. And the child is plain annoying, his father's conscience, whose requirement of his Dad is not just that they should survive but that they should remain ""the good guys"". This is both irritating (what would good mean in such a world?) and also unlikely (I suspect that a starving kid, who had only known the age of hunger, would have strong feral instincts instead of a Hollywood morality). There are lots of great stories (in various media) about worlds breaking down: I love 'Lamerica' (post-communist Albania), the Pianist (post-holocaust Berlin), 'Blood River' (contemporary Congo), and, entirely fictional, 'The Country of Last Things'. Compared with these rich tales, 'The Road' seems to have little to say.",The Road

The narrative is unconventional, in the sense that there's no traditional antagonist or even any driving goals, which leads to a sometimes meandering experience that definitely feels more like a novel than a movie. Yet, even for its slow pace and uncompromisingly sombre tone, there's something undeniably human underlying the story and several sequences are nail-bitingly tense. The piece explores the need for morals in a desolate world, as well as the struggles of trying to raise a son within it, and is a compelling watch. 7/10",The Road
36,bowmanblue,Bleak is beautiful,7,29 June 2014,"Let's get the obvious out the way first – 'The Road' is NOT a 'feel-good movie.' Anyone expecting anything more than a bleak and depressing movie should avoid this film like the plague. However, just because it's hardly 'laugh-a-minute' doesn't mean it's a bad film – you just have to be in the right frame of mind to appreciate it.Like the book it's based on, 'The Road' charts the story of a man and boy (never named) as they negotiate their new existence, trying to survive in a world after some disastrous apocalyptic event (also never named). It's not a perfect film, but it does have a lot going for it. First of all are the performances from 'man' and 'boy' – Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee – who clearly have an excellent rapport between them, making them a believable 'mini-family.' Then you have the settings. Everything looks depressingly perfect and suits the mood to a tee. Finally, you have the supporting cast. You have Robert Duvall, Charlize Theron and Guy Pearce. Although, some may consider their inclusion to be a little misleading, as all three are all little more than cameos to the major characters.Some people have criticised Kodi Smit-McPhee's performance, saying he's a little too helpless and comes across as annoying. I have to confess I did find him a little hard to take in his constant whining and neediness, but, as others have pointed out online, he has had a harsh upbringing and has spent his life being constantly hunted and sheltered by his father. Therefore, his 'uselessness' could be considered as some form of 'Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome.' As I said, The Road is an excellent film, just a bit of a downer in its tone. If you can put up with that, you'll enjoy it greatly. If you're not in the mood for that... stick with something happy-go-lucky like 'American Pie.'http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",The Road
37,dromasca,post-apocalyptic melodrama,5,23 April 2015,"I am afraid that am developing a slight phobia for post-apocalyptic films genre, and The Road directed by John Hillcoat pushed me one step ahead down this hill. Some of the movies that belong to this category are mostly action movies, while a few try to be different. Most of them are pessimistic about the short term chances of mankind but entertain a ray of hope on long term, of course after we have learned the lesson. Many of them try to provide dire warnings about what we do with our planet and with ourselves. Cinematography participates in creating the warning tones with rendition of how the deserted landscapes and destroyed cities of the planet will look the day after. Bible names and quotes are widely used. 'The Road' is a little bit of all these while trying to be more. While I appreciate the effort I did not enjoy the results of this try.About ten years after the Apocalypse what is left of mankind seems to be the only surviving species on Earth in the film inspired by a book by Cormac McCarthy. Neither did any vegetation survived, so looking for canned food (do not ask about the expiration date) seems to be the only alternative for the good guys other than the cannibalism adopted by the bad guys. A father and a son try to find their way to the ocean in order to survive another winter. I will not tell much more, and one of the reasons is that much more does not happen, at least action-wise.Sure, this is not meant to be an action film. Much of the intended value should be in the post-apocalyptic landscape (good camera work in more than 50 shades of real gray) and in the building of the characters. This is where in my opinion the film fails. Avoiding to romanticize is fine with me, but I cannot say that I knew much more at the end of the film than I knew after the first five minutes. Viggo Mortensen of 'Lord of the Rings' fame and the kid actor Kodi Smit-McPhee do both a fine job. Robert Duvall and Charlize Theron add their names to the credits but their fans will be disappointed about how little time they spend on screen. The film is not only dark but is also dull, seemed to me much longer than it really was and the ending - because any film has an ending - could not avoid the melodrama that the director tried to avoid in the making. I would recommend this film only to the post-apocalyptic genre aficionados.",The Road
38,ThomasDrufke,Devastatingly Beautiful,9,19 February 2016,"The Road is one of those films that forces you to put life in perspective. It forces you to think about the life you're living now, and imagine what life would be like without everything. That's The Road in a nutshell. Its dark and depressing view on a post- apocalyptic world is second to none. Although I don't think I would ever want to sit down and watch it again, I can appreciate the great story telling and performances by everyone involved. The best way to describe this film is that it is beautifully devastating from pretty much start to finish.The Road stars Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee as 'man' and 'boy' respectively. Sure, there are small but important roles for Robert Duvall, Guy Pearce, and Charlize Theron, but the strength of the film lies in the hands of Viggo and Kodi. It takes but one scene for the two of them to win you over and you're instantly rooting for them and hooked into this world. In some ways, their relationship can be paralleled with Rick and Carl Grimes in the early seasons of The Walking Dead. Both of them are forced to live in a dangerous and bleak world without much to live on but the strength of the love between them. We don't know exactly why the world is the way it is, but it doesn't matter. We just want the boy and man to survive as long as possible.The director, John Hillcoat, doesn't really pull any punches. He tugs on your emotions throughout the film and throws in some horrific and brutal images for us to keep in the backs of our memory. I appreciated that. The impressive production design paints the entire earth as grey but the story is endlessly colorful with a beautiful and sometimes devastating relationship between a man and his son at the core of it all. You don't really expect anything good to happen to the characters but the hope is always there. Perhaps that was the message Hillcoat was trying to send the audience.

I would think a mother's love would be stronger than that for someone to just abandoned their child.

41,secondtake,"Great depressing scenes and a linear, fairly dull plot",7,29 June 2011,"The Road (2009)If the point of a post-apocalyptic movie like this is to recreate what it would really be like, with all the pain, fear, dirt, loneliness, violence, and depression, good job everybody! Yay, let's be miserable!That's the one clear success here, and it's resounding. Life never looked so terrible, or so hopeless. It was shot mostly on one of the hopeless highway projects in U.S. history, a stretch of Pennsylvania Tnpk abandoned. Everything is endless cloudy and grey, covered with grime and ash, and therefore colorless, except for a few brief flashbacks to a sundrenched pre-disaster time.What does a person do when the world is filled with marauding gangs hoping to kill you and eat you? When your gun only has two bullets left? When there is no (zero zilch) food? When you are wet and tired all the time, and never get a good night's sleep? And when this goes on for years? Well, there is just survival, discovering little caches of food others have missed, and running from gangs of cannibals. It sometimes gets bloody and sensationalist, but not necessarily un reasonable, given the world we are in. What is most interesting is the handful of relationships that occur, mainly the father and son who are the centerpieces. That utter devotion of the father to the son, in part out of memory for the mother who walked away in her despair, is believable and beautiful. It isn't quite enough to make a two hour movie, however. The very brief encounters with other people throughout are generally superficial, including finding Robert Duvall as an old man. He too walks away into the grey.It's not that I don't like these end of the world experiences, on screen, as in ""Children of Men."" Or in books. I remember loving ""Ridley Walker,"" which made this kind of pop survival more interesting and complex. And of course ""The Lord of the Flies"" isn't half bad (the book outshines the film by miles). Cormac McCarthy's ""The Road"" is a widely admired novel in its own right, and I won't argue with the Pulitzer it received, but McCarthy uses lots of descriptive passages in his prose and it isn't quite my style, so I was happy to give the movie version a go. And the movie just needs more range, more emotional complexity to work. It might even need another point of view, something to get it out of its narrow track, however sensationally well done it might be otherwise.The improbable ending (spoiler here) is a perfect little stereotype of a nuclear family (white, American, and yet dirty, at least), complete with their dog (come on now!) as a kind of heaven on earth, a ray of hope. It must have seemed necessary to both the writer and the movie makers (it basically is like that in the book, I hear).

42,callanvass,This is what Best Picture making is all about.,10,12 October 2010,"|Credit. IMDb| A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind and water. It is cold enough to crack stones, and, when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the warmer south, although they don't know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing: just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless cannibalistic bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a rusting shopping cart of scavenged food--and each other.The Road terrified me, it depressed me, it made me smile, and completely had me glued to the screen. I have rarely ever been left feeling so drained, and destroyed after a movie was over. I felt complete anguish for Viggo and his son. The look of the movie is especially depressing. Nothing but dreary surroundings, everything looks dead, and it was just very grueling to get through. I'm really not sure if this a movie that is worth repeated viewings. It's certainly an amazing movie, and it is one of the best films I've ever seen. But it is just too hard to watch, and I'm not sure my emotions could handle it again. Forget the Hurt Locker, forget Avatar. This beats them both combined by a mile. The Road was clearly the best picture of 2009. Just my opinion though.Performances. Viggo Mortensen is Oscar worthy here. I was never a fan of his, but he officially made me be with his performance here. His chemistry with Kodi Smit-McPhee |The Boy| is excellent, and I adored them both to pieces. He wore nothing but the dirty, ragged clothes on his back. His heart-breaking, yet tender and caring performance, was the movie for me. Kodi Smit-McPhee Is fantastic as the son. It's very rare you see a Kid actor that is so endearing and talented. But he is just that. Robert Duvall plays the savvy veteran role well. Charlize Theron's cold performance saddened me, but she pulled it off extremely well. Her relationship with Viggo was great, and I loved the flashback scenes.Bottom line. I may not wanna watch it again, but I will undoubtedly end up doing so. It triggers your emotions like no other, and it's definitely not a date movie. Pick a selective day to watch this, and make sure your ready for it. Otherwise prepare for hell, and I mean that in a positive light, as strange as that sounds. An absolute must see at all costs.10/10",The Road

Determined to keep hope alive, the father instills optimism in his son along the way. Based on a Cormac McCarthy novel, The Road is a haunting study of a lawless wasteland that boasts a fine performance from Mortensen, who's under exceptional direction here.

45,ironhorse_iv,"Full of obstacles, the Road is very disturbing film. It's a really hard watch.",7,29 May 2015,"The Road feels as if driving, a dark hearse full on nightmare fuel, going over 100 mph, through the toughest terrain of a desert wasteland. That's the best, I can describe it. It's relentlessly grim. A haunting gray portrait of a dysfunctional future in which an unnamed disaster has wiped most living things from the Earth, food is scarce, and people have resorted to cannibalism. In other words, not a pleasure movie! Don't get me wrong, I have watch some really disturbing post-apocalypse films, before, but this movie directed by John Hillcoat, takes the cake! Based on the 2007 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Cormac McCarthy, with the same name, the movie tells the story of a man (Viggo Mortensen) and his 10-year-old son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) trying to make their way along the dangerous road toward the coast in the hopes of finding life. The emotional core of the movie is the same as the book, with the relationship between the man and his son, being the forefront driven theme. While, this theme seem uplifting, it's not. It's mostly full of depressing moments and sad disappointments. Its very cynicism in its tone. All of this pessimism, just makes the film way, overwhelming, miserable to watch. Still, the movie does change a few things to soften the tone. One of the biggest changes, was deleting the whole death baby being eaten, storyline. I guess, it was a little too harsh for audiences. While, the baby was cut out from the film; I'm glad, they kept most of the other symbolisms from the book, in the film version. A good example is the odd Coke product placement. At first, Coca Cola didn't want to have, their product place in an over-violent disturbing post-apocalypse, but after Viggo Mortensen explain to the company reps, why it was importation to the plot, they allowed it. The coke represent the disintegration of consumer-capitalist society and the old ways. Another great device that the movie, reused in the film, is the flare gun. The flare gun suggests the total abandonment of communication; both with other human beings and with God. A device once used for signaling, now becomes a deadly weapon used to kill. I have a fan theory on what the movie is really about. In my opinion, the story is truly about a man dying of cancer, while trying to repent for his sins, during Lent. Hear me out, before you criticize. The word, Road, is describe in the book, as desolate, transient thing, full of danger, yet full of hope. In fact, it's probably useful to think of the road as both an actual, physical setting and a mental state, where, life run both positive and negative changes. The unnamed disaster, represented the causes of cancer and Ash Wednesday. The cannibals that live on this road, represent the bourgeoisie corporations and churches that where the proletariat are quite literally being eaten for personal gain. When the beetle flew from a can of chewing tobacco, it's represent that even things that seem badly burn, could indeed heal back up. Still, the movie feels more like tragedy porn. The Road simultaneously advanced McCarthy's reputation for violent, brutality and blood, more than the powerful relationship, between the father and the son and its shows. The acting is very good, as both Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee, look and act like they went through mentally and physically type of a hell. They're both scary skinny to the point, that I was really scare, that they might had, overdone it. Viggo Mortensen really went to the extreme, for this role, by deliberately starve himself and forced himself to eat crickets. At one point, he was told to gain weight due to his unhealthy dieting. If you thought, that was disturbing. Kodi Smit-McPhee won the role, when Kobi's father showed the producer, a tape of them, re-enacting the scene where the father shows the boy how to kill himself by placing a pistol in his mouth. That's extremely crazy! While, Viggo and Kobi might have, put too much work on their characters. Charlize Theron didn't do much. She has some sense, not to overdo it. Despite, getting second billing, Charlize Theron is in the film for a short moment, before getting written off, in the most disturbing sacrifice type way. The movie does have some well-known supporting actors, such as Robert Duvall and Guy Pearce, but they are so unrealizable, that you can barely notice that they were in the film. In my opinion, all the characters are likewise flat, dull, and not well-delivered. The movie pacing is a bit slow, as scenes do really dragged on, for way too long. There isn't much action, thrills or suspense to make this movie seem entertaining. I really didn't like the marketing for this film. I can understand, why certain people, coming in, cold, would mistake this film for another Mad Max-type action movie. They kinda got screw over, when some ads, made it seem like post-apocalypse action movie. Overall: While, The New York Times named The Road, one of the best book of the 2000's. I have to disagree with most of the literary and movies critics that have lavished praise the novel and movie. In my opinion, I thought, the Road was often unsteady and repetitive. It felt ostentatious and diminutive. The best, that I can describe it, is if painting a canvas, entirely black. It doesn't matter, how many more black strokes, you layers on top: they will not stand out because there is no difference, there is no depth, no breach or building of tension, just a constant addition of featureless details to a drab whole. This is what I thought about the film. It wasn't as good as his previous novel, 2005's No Country for Old Men, which was later adapted in 2007, by the Coen Brothers with the same name. For a movie with so much complexity, it felt kinda simple, almost too-simple.",The Road
46,The-Sarkologist,Serious flaws undermine what could have been a very good movie,5,3 February 2013,"This could have been a good film, not one that you can watch multiple times as it is very difficult to watch even once, with the exception that I found that I could not actually believe that this world could exist. It is not that I don't believe that it is possible for civilisation to collapse, but we are talking about an apocalyptic event (most likely a meteor strike due to the lack of radiation poisoning) that occurred ten years previously (based on the fact that the boy is around that age and was born after the event) which resulted in the death of all plants and animals, yet humans are still alive. That one simple statement at the beginning of the film pretty much destroyed it for me simply because I could not possibly accept that humans would have been able to survive without anything to eat.Ignoring that one major flaw, this is a good film and it actually takes a movement away from the sword swinging, gun totling, post-apocalyptic samurai of the likes of Eli and Mad Max. Where as in other such films I have seen, the hero pretty much hacks the bad guys to pieces, in this film the protagonists spend most of their time hiding. In fact the Man (we are never given any names) only ever kills one person. It is not a question of survival, but it is a question of protection, and even then, by adding the element of the boy gives this film a whole new dimension.I suspect it has a lot to do with attempting to maintain a sense of morality in a world where civilisation has collapsed, and then questioning what morality actually is. Granted, they are distanced from the real brutes who will eat another human being without a second thought (and the fact that they do not show symptoms of Mad Cow Disease is another aspect that I did not like). However I would question his morality anyway since he seems to treat everybody as a potential threat, whether they are or not. In fact, it ends up being the boy who shows compassion and goodness while the man is willing to leave a man standing on the road naked.Being a film that is not driven by a plot but rather driven by a theme, I found that the ending was actually quite fulfilling in itself. You do actually get to the point where you come to wonder whether the man is actually any good for the boy. For all his talk of goodness, we do wonder whether he himself is actually good, or whether he is simply so concerned over the fact that he must protect the boy, that he either becomes over protective, or even is actually doing harm to the boy himself. Granted, while such a hostile world may suggest that everybody is a potential threat, and that one has to be on their guard always, one also needs to be prepared to risk one's self for the sake of another person, and even if it means trusting a stranger. I guess the fact that they were forever hiding and forever running, meant that they themselves were not doing all that much to attempt to make this world a better place.",The Road
47,sol-,Road Worrier,5,21 April 2017,"Food scarcity motivates a worried father and son to make a dangerous trek to the ocean in this post-apocalyptic drama set in a world where all known plant and animal life has died out. The possible futility of their quest is quite curious; unlikely as it is that something still lives in the ocean, they have run out of options and need to hedge their bets as they come across men who have resorted to cannibalism and looting during their journey. Intriguing as all this might sound, the first hour or so of 'The Road' is hard to get through with maudlin voice-over narration and sentimental flashbacks that frequently dissipate any tension in the air. The first half of the film also grows repetitive quite quickly with the father always asserting himself and the son merely passive and frail. Things improve though in the second half with the voice-over vanishing and the son getting some character growth as he comes to question and verbally challenge his father's actions. In turn, Viggo Mortensen, who initially seems like a loving and logically minded protective parent in the first half begins to seem more unhinged and paranoid. Whether the stronger second hour of 'The Road' is enough to atone for the fairly dull build-up to it is debatable, but this is arguably a film worth sitting through in the initial slow patches because the father/son struggle that eventually results from the story is pretty decent.",The Road
48,Dr_Coulardeau,This road so far does not lead to a stand,9,16 July 2010,"The novel behind the film is absolutely breathtaking. The film tries hard to be as good and it neglects the literary means of the book to concentrate on the visual means of the film. We are just after the end of the world due to some kind of big fire that burnt everything down, covered the whole world with a shroud of ashes, killed all natural life whatsoever or nearly and locked up the whole earth in an immense cloud of ashes that caused at once the cooling down of the temperature and then the cold. We are not even given any explanation. We are shown the results and they talk all by themselves. The situation is simple as for the few survivors. The main two characters are a father and a son. A flashback later on will speak of the delivery of the child, quite a few years before, and the mother's going out to die in the dark after the catastrophe as she was for some vague reason dying. That's not the most important element. What we are studying is the behavior of the father and the son as long as they are together, that is to say all along, and how this privileged relationship makes them different from the other survivors. Some get together in bands or gangs and they raid the world to get what they can and survive collectively no matter how, that is to say even with hunting other survivors and cannibalism. Then you have those who are more solitary, alone or in couples. We have a few examples of solitary ones who become scavengers, but of the living, hence thieves, looters, killers in a way or another. The contact with these solitary people pushes the father towards some defensive and even over-defensive attitudes. The son intervenes then to counterbalance this over-use of protectiveness and to maybe remind the father of the human duty of sharing. A difficult task. But the film wants to take that boy to the end of the road, to the death of the father, to his mourning and sadness, and at the same time the desire to survive, like the father had said, and that desire will turn the father into a recollection, a memory and let the son accept to be integrated in another wider family structure, still on the road. The visual character of this film seems to tell us even in the direst straits of a final catastrophe, there remains some hope in the mind of human beings and they can first imagine their survival and hence try to survive and second keep some humane principles that are of course the promise of a humane society later on. That's the question that should be asked: is the survival instinct collective or individual, is the survival instinct capable to follow some ethical line? The answer is not easy since the film, like the book, do not go beyond the mourning the boy is confronted to at the end of his road and at the beginning of a second road. This road will maybe never end but all along the way some spirituality will try to survive. That's a very optimistic film, at this ethical level, though I seem to remember the book was optimistic too but at the level of the ingenuity and the inventiveness of human beings in some situations when survival becomes an obligation. At the end of this film there is little knowledge about the future but yet a gleam of hope.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID",The Road
49,zkonedog,"More Emotional Depth Than ""Book of Eli""",7,11 March 2017,"For all time, ""The Road"" will be compared side-by-side with ""The Book of Eli"", as both were released around the same time and both dealt with a post-apocalyptic USA. However, whereas ""Eli"" took the action-adventure route, ""Road"" goes the sparse, emotional direction.For a basic plot summary, this movie focuses on the story of a man (Viggo Mortensen) and his son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic America. While following a road leading south to reach a warmer climate, the duo struggle to survive, are wary of cannibalism everywhere, and form a strong bond in the process.The stronghold of this film is its visceral realism. Whereas ""Eli"" was a wash of sepia tones and over-the-top action, ""The Road"" opts for starkness, with no special effects. It is a human drama through and through, and a very compelling one at that. By the end, you will truly care about the two main characters.Thus, if you are into gritty, real-life drama, then this is the film for you, as when the credits roll you'll feel like you WERE the characters, not just watching them.

A cross, if you will, between Ray Milland's excellent but oh-so-low budget PANIC IN YEAR ZERO! and THE MOTE IN GOD'S EYE by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle (with a dash of the ""reality"" teleseries THE COLONY thrown in for good measure), THE ROAD is at once both haunting and profoundly moving. Robert Duvall turns in (yet again) a very brief but heartfelt performance: in both its brevity and its poignancy, it reminded me of the performance of Chief Dan George in the KUNG FU episode, ""ANCIENT WARRIOR."" Duvall, like George, can say a whole lot with just a little. It's more than a little ironic that this movie was made in present-day (pre-British Petroleum oil spill) America (which, thanks to disasters Natural and Man-made, is now the ideal location for end-of-civilization-as-we-know-it movies). Must-see movie-making.",The Road
51,johnnyboyz,While surprisingly not as tough-a watch as his last film; director Hillcoat combines basic levels of tension and scares with a nicely observed character piece.,6,22 January 2010,"The skies that tower over the setting of The Road are grey, looming and ominous; the trees collapse around the characters in the dark as they sit at night around make-shift camp fires while talking and thinking of days of old. Below the skies and around the falling woodland lies America, indeed the would-be world, at the end of its life expectancy. The weather is freezing cold; most petrol driven methods of transport lie in ruin; homes and buildings house the decaying skeletons of the inhabitants or the ones whom have only recently killed themselves, while those that wonder the world as it is now each wear bin liners for socks, carry rough, unshaven faces and push around shopping trolleys in which they store their supplies. In short, they look as if they're homeless people whom have just stumbled out from beneath a bridge somewhere.But whilst most characters maintain a consistency in their physical appearance, The Road is more interested in how the inhabitants of this new society either resemble, or differ-from, one another by way of internal characteristics. In a 'survival of the fittest' scenario, in a world that has changed for the worse, how do good and evil co-exist?; What is right and wrong?; Do the same morals exist or, as a new dawn settles in, do humankind and the basic psychological understandings they have between one another evolve with them into something new? It's an interesting thesis, one that the film enjoys purveying by way of the smaller of the two central characters when constant talk of who the 'good' guys are and who the 'bad' guys are helps in the distilling of who to be wary of and in what manner. There are those in the film that feel the need to murder and kill others for sake of their own survival; others shy away from that particular practice and just thieve but each occurrence gives one of the two leads the experiences he requires.The two that drive the film have no names, but it is not the only thing they lack in the world in which The Road is set. In a film that sees few people have homes; enough supplies; much in the way of hope and a general goal, names seem arbitrary. The two leads are simply credited as 'Man' and 'Boy', with Viggo Mortensen playing 'Man' and an impressive turn from Australian newcomer Kodi Smit-McPhee assuming the role of 'Boy', his son. With a world typical for the genre established, plus the gradual revealing of Man's past tragedy in the death of his wife named 'Woman' (Theron); everyone is set for a roaming, somewhat sprawling, singular-line journey which travels the characters from A to Z for whatever reason.The Road is predominantly a character piece, a stark coming of age tale in a new world in which the very term 'coming of age' means new things, but it is purely this. This, as Boy observes and interacts with his surroundings and the people in it – all the while progressing and, to his father's great hope, learning. It is through the beautifully balanced character of Man that the gentle, more humble side is got across along with a more brutal, more instinctive on survival side in what is an impressive portrayal of someone, from Mortensen, that you really feel is never more than a heartbeat away from executing his son out of fear of what'll happen to him alone whilst systematically, a more loving and protecting individual whom is constantly looking out for him. Man is never too afraid to take the shot if required, while the victim of a flair gun shell does nothing to Man's conscience - nor does he bear much guilt in leaving behind victims of cannibalism, which in a brief sequence of near-horror evokes horrid imagery of latter-day, Central European-set death-camp iconography as those padlocked away in crude, dark places of death and disease are left to rot or, in this case, be fed on.Regarding Mortensen's character, the film's ability to pick up on the smaller things twinned with its ability to evoke the necessary emotions and feelings further onto us is impressive. Indeed, he is haunted more by dreams of happier times that are distorting through their lack of grey and sheer exuberance of colour, for both Man as an individual and man as a whole, than the guilt of anything that's happened in recent times, and all it takes is for an unpredicted unveiling of a piano in a disused country house to act as a trigger for Man to break down. The heart-felt breaks in play for sake of memory work well, as do the getting across of sensations of a really intricate nature, observed again as the camera encompasses Man's quivering hands at the presence of hunger and the lack of proper nutrition. His talk of memories of Christmas morning and Boy's confused reaction to what that is as well as his observing of a rainbow and the tasting of Coca-Cola for the first time blur the lines as to who we're supposed to relate to more as the lines between whose story it is vies for power.I think the very end is in a somewhat desperate need of a rewrite, when the entire journey is rendered that of a circular nature, and the same scenario Boy began the film in is the same he ends the film in; despite the constant talk of how he'll need to fend for himself one day and that everything he goes through with his father is a learning process. There are occasions dramatic set pieces exist to excite the crowd more than serve the purpose of this child learning the harsh realities of life in a new world. But director Hillcot does well with a wondering, seemingly aimless narrative non-event as these two people wonder through what's left on the world they know; worthy enough to recommend.",The Road
52,TheMovieDiorama,The Road is the very definition of depressing.,8,27 February 2018,"I literally did not smile once, my soul is drained and any happiness that resided in me has now been utterly decimated. Good lord this was bleak. In a post-apocalyptic future, mankind is on the brink of extinction where only a few fight for survival. A father and son are pushed to their limits but the love between them keeps the battle for survival strong. This is a story where hope is completely diminished. There is no rainbow at the end of the road, just misery and death. It explores themes of mortality and memories. Succumbing to the fear of death where you no longer wish to be alive. But the nostalgic memories of past happiness pushes the mind further and adds that little sense of hope that was once gone. Trust no one, do whatever it takes to survive. Heck, I've never wanted a tinned can of Del Monte peaches so much in all my life. It's a harsh environment, where scavenging for food is the only means of staying alive. Consistent earthquakes, cannibalism, forest fires...it's a torturous world. But what keeps the narrative flowing, is the tight relationship between father and son. Raising a child where there is no hope is a difficult task, particularly where solitude and loneliness plays a key role in this future. But the chemistry between Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee is sonphenomenally well portrayed that I was undertaking this perilous journey with them. A transformative performance for both of them. Director John Hillcoat embeds scenes that includes the father's past love (played beautifully by Charlize Theron) which reminds us that there is still humanity within him. It's absolutely resonating. The Road's weakness is its script which unfortunately was not particularly compelling for me. The visual narration conveyed the themes, so scenes filled with dialogue just felt uninteresting. At times the story does feel monotonous, going from one bad scenario to the other. However this is the brutal depiction of a post-apocalyptic future where there is no hope. An extremely depressing yet powerful cinematic piece.",The Road
53,Tweetienator,"Great Book, Great Movie",8,15 September 2017,"The Road is one of my favorite post-apocalyptic movies (besides Mad Max of course) and a very fine cinematic adaption of the original book by the same title written by Cormac McCarthy.Convincing actors (Viggo Mortensen!), spiced up with fine cinematography, and a fantastic dark and darker atmosphere with only some little rare moments of brightness. Mother Earth is now a living nightmare to live in, a place gone mad. The permanent hunt and fight for food and shelter, cannibals, paranoia, the fight of everyone against everyone, a world without much hope, all people living in this world are marked in one or another way. And in this madness, a man tries to teach his son all skills necessary for the time to come.The Road is less action-focused as e.g. The Book of Eli, Snowpiercer or The Day, but with moments of true dark poetry and because of this far more than the usual post-apocalyptic-action-movie.

The world the movie creates for us is wonderfully complete in its starkness, savagery and apparent lack of real hope as the 2 characters make their way across it looking for something better.The style is apt.The problem I had is, the movie (I think) does the right thing and avoids being sensationalist to tell its story, so I found it boring.

56,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Faithful and strong adaptation of a difficult novel that appeals to the emotions,8,26 November 2009,"The challenges awaiting Joe Penhall and John Hillcoat in adapting and directing (respectively) Cormac McCarthy's ""The Road"" had to be numerous. This post-apocalyptic father-and-son story about whether struggling to survive as long as possible is worth the pain is a bleak tale and one that grinds along much of the time. It doesn't have more than a handful of eventful or visually stimulating scenes. They manage, however, to not only be faithful to McCarthy's elegy, but also add great details to make it into a solid film.For starters, Penhall gives us more context than the novel provides in terms of what's happened to turn the world into a barren place. Fires, earthquakes and other natural disasters have devastated the landscape and although we don't experience what it was exactly that was horrible enough to drive people to kill themselves instead of endure it and drove many to looting and cannibalism, we still understand the gravity of the situation. In this way, ""The Road"" is more inviting to those who've never read the book and need help suspending disbelief.The script also stays true to the book's structure. The book is a series of brief paintings with candid dialogue between father (Viggo Mortensen) and son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) as they try to survive and reach the southern coast where they won't have to try and last through another brutal winter. The scenes are strung together without any traditional ""acts"" dividing up the story. The film delivers in this way, but it expands and breaks up this grinding structure with flashbacks/dreams which is helpful for the lesser attention spans of movie watchers.Most additions to the original story are to clarify context and also add emotional impact. The mother (Charlize Theron) is not part of the main story, but she's woven in through dreams and flashbacks. We see her give birth to the son in the midst of this apocalypse and how her regret bringing him into the world clashes with the father's steadfast belief in survival at all costs. We see brief moments of her and the father in love, too, and his character becomes much more emotionally complex. Instead of being just the brave, cunning hero, Mortensen also plays the widower and the emotional mentor to his son. He works all these facets to his character into a truly excellent performance that's believable in every way.Hillcoat tries to add where he can as well, focusing a lot on hands and finding really touching or moving shots that effectively echo McCarthy's narrative snapshots in the book. He also spares no detail. Great credit to the thorough realism in the make-up, props and costumes department; images of dirt caked in all the characters' fingernails linger as does the greasiness of their hair and beards and the dirt on their faces. When father and son find an empty home where they can shower, watching the dirt come off them has far more of an impact than it does in any other film. Wounds are also focused on for shock value -- there's a concerted effort to shake any viewer that might be too complacent and not realize the gravity of the characters' situation.Much of what made McCarthy's story award-winning is captured by this film. There isn't much of an effort to go beyond some of those basic concepts or really hammer them in deep, but on the flip-side it aims for emotional impact, something far more universally appreciated at the movie theater than a deep meditation on human nature or how much it's worth fighting to stay alive with grim chances of dying anything but a painful or reluctant death. Instead of leaving the film with deeper philosophical/ethical questions, we get a touching story of father and son doing anything to stay with each other as long as they can, which is a fair trade off. Ideally we get both, but a job well done considering the challenging nature of the source material.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",The Road
57,jzappa,An Immersive Experience,9,12 May 2010,"Civilization has been annihilated. All human habitat has been eradicated or deserted, vegetation is dying, crops are long gone, the foundation of society truly has vanished. The Boy and The Man make their way toward the sea, maybe for no better reason than that the sea has forever been the guide for dreams in this country. The remaining sporadic survivors have devolved into barbaric survivalists, making slaves of the weaker, apparently utilizing them as food. We've always done that, like using beef cattle to do the grazing on acres of pasture so we can absorb the amassed calories of their work. In a land where food is rare, vagabonds hunt for canned goods and fear their own bodies will serve this function for the cannibals.We know and hear of those who make preparations to survive the threat of natural catastrophe, nuclear war, or social collapse, and of course, weapon stores on the Road have died away with all else. The Man has a gun with two bullets; we're not sure if it's because he's used all but two or because two is all he ever had. He is a leery voyager, distrusting everyone he sees. He and The Boy are carrying a scant number of belongings in a grocery cart. He urges his son to keep walking, but has little optimism for the end of their voyage.The Road is an immersive experience so serene, sensorial and flowing that when we experience excruciatingly emotional, hair-raising or gut-wrenching moments, we haven't even seen them coming, and when we have, they've already crept up on us. With every trait of every department, the result is utter simplicity, utter docility, no fluctuation in the face of whatever brutality or emotional quakes, making them all that much more profoundly moving. The dialogue is so restrained, the story so elemental and straightforward, that all of the primal feelings it evokes transcend any limitations of characters and images.I can't conceive of how the characters could be played differently than by Viggo Mortensen, who depicts The Man as persistent and fixed, resolved to guard his Boy from all harm. Kodi Smit-McPhee is persuasive as a child overwhelmed by carnage, relying on his father in a world where it is always at the front of one's mind that any man can die at any moment. This hypnotic tableau refrains from any inclination to make the child adorable, or the two of them pleasant or heartfelt. Their experiences, some of them burned into my memory forever, summon all of one's capacity for emotional durability but it gratifies the audacious. It is merciless yet magnetic, traumatic yet sensitive.Flashback scenes star Charlize Theron as the wife and mother of the two in earlier, brighter times. These scenes suggest the marriage as diminishing, and these recollections plague The Man. A marriage blissful or bitter, what difference does it make in this new world? It is of enormous bearing, nevertheless, on The Man and The Boy. In times of absolute holocaust, memories are all one has to possess. Especially one consummately excruciating natural childbirth scene by Theron, which we feel may be what drives The Man so determinedly. Indeed, this poetic and devastating odyssey can be read as an elemental account of what it means to be a parent.The Road is poetic because its impact comes not so much from what occurs but from how it does, depicting the apocalypse as an irrevocably personal experience. John Hillcoat carefully fashions a low-key composite of location footage and seamless CGIs to form a mournful industrial desert, gently, ethereally escorting his film towards a subdued, dwindling vision of hope. You want them to make it, you want them to make it, you want them to make itand yet you do not want it, any of it, to end. You are mesmerized.",The Road
58,Chris Knipp,Apocalypse vs. post-apocalypse,9,19 December 2009,"Hollywood likes the world to end with a bang. In the Australian director John Hillcoat's The Road, adapted quite faithfully from Cormac McCarthy's 2006 novel, it's ending with a whimper. This is an authentically post-apocalyptic situation, an Endgame worthy of Beckett, but tinged less with irony than with sadness and constant gnawing fear. Somewhere on the eastern seaboard, the Man (Viggo Mortensen) and his son, the Boy (Kodi Smith-McPhee), are struggling to make their way south to the sea, years after universal cataclysm has wiped the slate clean, killed every living plant. Everything is gray, covered with sludge. The trees stand black, shorn, and dead, and are starting to crumble and crash down, large and small. The Boy has never seen a bug, or drunk soda pop. On their journey these things happen, and are great novelties. What people there are remaining along the way must be deemed dangerous. Everyone is desperate and starving.The Man has flashbacks to before, when he lived with a Woman (Charlize Theron). He sensed the disaster coming before she did. Apparently she had her baby after it happened, to her chagrin. Things were so hopeless she chose to wander off by herself. Some have committed suicide rather than starve to death or die at the hands of marauders. Cannibalism is being practiced by survivors. The Man promises the Boy they won't do that, that they're good guys and will always remain good guys, and carry the fire within them. (That promise is sorely tested.) Out there where the Man and the Boy are now, you have to assume anybody who turns up is a bad guy. And the problem is, the Man and the Boy have just one pistol with two remaining bullets, and they're meant for the two of them, in case.Cormac McCarthy's books are sort of stylized, apocalyptic westerns a lot of the time, and this could be some austere Clint Eastwood invention with a sci-fi twist. Hillcoat's previous film 'The Proposition' is an Aussie historical western about a desperate contract. The hard thing is to make 'The Road' seem like nothing else, when post-apocalyptic imagery is so familiar to moviegoers. Hillcoat does a good job.The Man's nostalgia for his past could be part of a Beckett play, but in a way this world is stripped even more bare than Beckett's, bare of discernible history or culture. It's never really clear why they're heading south, except that the Woman, when she was around, warned the Man he'd never survive another winter where they were.The book's power comes from the way it takes you into this world of desperate day to day survival. The Man and his son come across an unspeakable horror in a southern mansion. When they discover an underground store of preserved food it's heaven for them, and they're also able to wash up and trim their hair. This is the interval of happiness. But it's unsafe to remain anywhere. The story and film give the boy and the adult equal importance. There's a moment of epiphany when the man says he is the one who has to worry about them, and the boy says no, he is. The man is the stronger and more experienced and tougher, but the boy is an angel. When they meet an old codger (Robert Duvall, superb) he says he thought the boy was really an angel. The boy speaks for kindness and love. He still has some hope. The man has lost it and is just soldiering on. His cough gets worse; he's not going to make it.This is a book that's sufficiently powerful that what you want from a movie based on it is to bring it back to you, and Hillcoat does this. Mortensen and Smith-McPhee are wonderful, as is everyone, including Guy Pearce in a strong final cameo. The man and his son are all each other has, and the relationship is as heartrendingly pure. The difference is in the way the book, with its much greater number of words, speaks itself into your soul. However the movie can do that too if you give yourself to it; it's impossible to say what it feels like to see it without having read the book, if you have. Hillcoat gets the look of the world of 'The Road' very well, though a distraction not experienced with the book is to be wondering sometimes where he found such a lot of wrecked, desolate houses, buildings, cars, roads, and trees, so much gray landscape and so much rain. Somehow all this was simulated on locations in Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Louisiana. One objection is that sometimes there is a sepia tint to the scene that's too pretty; and sometimes there would have been flashes of light or color that the art directors did not allow. But this is a very worthy adaptation of a powerful book -- not McCarthy's greatest novel, but a more important and characteristic one for this very great contemporary American writer than his 2005 'No Country for Old Men.'McCarthy's oeuvre is full of apocalyptic journeys. But none other is so stripped to the bone and so melancholy as this one. Yes, it ends with hope. But that's just to say it's open-ended. ""Do not despair, one of the thieves was saved; do not presume, one of the thieves was damned."" 'The Road' is like that.©Chris Knipp 2009",The Road
59,billcr12,Mumble Fest,5,8 June 2012,"I haven't read the Pulitzer Prize winning book by Cormac McCarthy, so I can't make a comparison. The best apocalyptic themed film that I've seen is Children of Men. The Road is not anywhere near as good. I expected much better, considering Viggo Mortenson as the lead character. He was great in Eastern Promises and A History of Violence. The biggest problem with The Road is the audio, or more specifically, the constant mumbling in tones to hard to hear. In trying to be profound, the dialogue is indecipherable. The story is slow and plodding, with a silly flashback to the man's wife committing suicide shortly after giving birth to their son, as the collapse of civilization is too much for her to handle. The man and his young son travel throughout the wastelands, scrounging for food and survival. He carries a pistol with two bullets, in case they decide to give up and end their lives. The mood is dark, as expected, they encounter cannibals at a mansion but manage to escape and they find an underground bunker with plenty of food. After eating, the man hears a strange noise and they leave. A crusty old man(Robert Duvall) begs them for food and pontificates on the meaning of life in the same manner; marble mouthed, as Mortensen. At the coast, they find an abandoned ship on shore and scavenge what they can. A guy robs them and another shoots him in the leg with an arrow and the man with no name kills his attacker with a flare gun. The wound is serious and the man lectures his son about the importance of humanity and carrying on. I am doing something that I have never done; which is revise a review. I just finished the novel on which The Road is based, and I now can appreciate the film adaptation. The daunting cinematography matches the darkness of the story, with its stark and gray tone. Please read the novel first, and the audio problem can be forgiven.",The Road

61,freemantle_uk,It the end of the world,10,9 January 2010,"I have not read the novel The Road by Cormac McCarthy yet, so I can only just this film on it's own merit. But to me it also already a leading candidate for Best Director and Best Actor at the Academy Awards this year.The Road is set in a post-apocalyptic near future of America. All plant life had died, so have most animals, and civilization has collapsed. There is no food being produced, the sun is blocked and the world is nothing but cold, grey and ash. Admit all this devastation is a man (Viggo Mortensen) and his son only call the Boy (Kodi Smit-McPhee). They are on a course to the East Coast and then aim southwards. On the way they have to avoid gangs of thefts and cannibals which is pretty obvious what they are doing. They too have to take food, but they only take it from abandoned homes. The man carries a gun with two bullets in it, and the pair are prepared to kill themselves if there is no chance of survival. The man wants to prepare his young son to survive for when he is not around anymore. He keeps remind the Boy that they are the good guys. As the two travel in this grim world the Man becomes very distrustful of other survivors. His character and body start to deteriorate.This a powerfully acted film, well directed film. Viggo Mortensen is a terrific actor and his recent films are impressive: The Lord of the Rings trilogy, A History of Violence and Eastern Promise. Mortensen must be a shoe in to get an Oscars nomination, but I doubt he will win because Morgan Freeman got to play Nelson Mandela. Kodi Smit-McPhee is also a very good young actor and has a good native quality to his character. He rejected a role in X-Men Origins: Wolverine which was properly a wise idea. This is a film about the worst thing that could happen, the end of live as well know it. This is not action film like some writers and storytellers would go. This is a character piece about a father and son fighting for survival and against the odds. This is a grim colourless world where there is no hope. John Hillcoat is a talented director, he brings out the grimness of this world, showing a lifeless void were most of the survive devolve as social being. Life is cheap in this world. Hillcoat shows a realistic way the world could die, and his cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe does a very good job showing this colourless world. It is a sad and depressing film, but I like that sometimes in films. There are flashbacks that flesh things out a little bit, showing that the Man did love his wife (Charlize Theron), but she grew pessimistic about the event. Some clever things about the film is it never shows or expands what this event was, and not of the characters are given names, adding to the dehumanisation of what this event causes. As well as the main two character, there is also a good supporting cast, including Robert Duvall, Guy Pearce and the already mentioned Charlize Theron. They are all talented people and this is Theron best performance since Monster.If I had to nitpick there are a couple of issues with the film. First if all the plants in the world die, surely the world would run out of oxygen, and second, would infrastructure like water system stop working if there is no maintenance? But these are minor problems that should be overlooked because this is a beautiful, eerie film.A must see in an intimate environment.",The Road
62,dfranzen70,Desolation Road,6,19 June 2010,"Although bleak and depressing, The Road is still a good two-character study, about a man and his young son traveling south through a post-apocalyptic United States on the vague promise of a better place ahead. Viggo Mortensen is appropriately intense and grim, but the sense of utter hopelessness never goes away, even after the trite ending.The Man (Mortensen) and The Boy (Kodi Smit-McPhee) have survived a cataclysmic event that has wiped out nearly every living creature - man, animal, bird, insect, plant. They have a single handgun with which to defend themselves, with two bullets - one for each of them, should the need arise. Most of the remaining few humans on the planet seem to be crazy and cannibals, or both. The Boy fervently wishes to believe they are the Good Guys and that they'll find more Good Guys once they reach their final destination. The Man just wants to keep hope alive in The Boy for a little while longer, as he himself is dying.If you haven't read the Cormac McCarthy novel on which the film is based (and I haven't), you might find this all to be relentlessly downbeat. And it is, of course. But if we can look past the ash-covered landscape and the grayer and grayer attitudes, we see a compelling relationship dynamic between the two leads. Each depends so much on the other for physical and psychological survival, and to what end? There's no real promise of a better life anywhere, but The Man knows it's his job to make The Boy believe that will be the case. They scrounge whatever they can, pushing their belongings in an old shopping cart, and witness unspeakable, plausible atrocities along the way. The Man is stuck in a quandary; The Boy needs to believe they're doing the right thing, but sometimes they need to do wrong things (like kill cannibals in defense) in order to survive.Aside from all that hopelessness, what bothered me about this movie was The Boy himself. He was born just after the cataclysm occurred, several years ago, and he and The Man have been on the road ever since. And yet it seemed that whenever there was trouble, The Boy would cry out or whine and cry and yell and do things that you'd expect someone who had just that moment gone on the run would do, but not someone who'd been at it for a little while and who'd basically spent his entire life in that situation. You could tell that he was meant to be rebelling a little - i.e., losing some hope - but he seemed less petulant and more, you know, stupid.The ending itself probably plays out a lot better in the book. Certainly, I won't give it away here, but to me it seemed a little obvious and running against the grain of the rest of the film, almost to the point where it made their travels seem without a point.This is not a movie that will excite you. It's not funny, and although there are action scenes they're there merely to offset the existentialism of the main plot (the relationship of Boy and Man). There are mysteries - what caused this desolation? Who are the people they run into? - that are best left either minimally answered or entirely unsolved. (In fact, it's not important what the cataclysm was, so don't expect to find out a lot about it.) The Road is long and marked with the occasional pothole, but it can be rewarding if you're looking for a strong acting performance (by Mortensen) against a somber, stark backdrop.",The Road
63,ianlouisiana,the most nihilistic vision of human destiny I have yet encountered..,7,30 May 2012,"I have been watching and reading dystopian visions of the post - apocalyptic future since I was turned on to the great Ray Bradbury when I was 16 years old,but ""The Road"",both as a novel and a film,is the most nihilistic vision of human destiny I have yet encountered. The book is not ""enjoyable"",but it is admirable in its grindingly depressing way,in much the same way as you might admire the handiwork of a master butcher who has decapitated a pig with some style and panache but with little humanity. The film is merely more of the same,but with a few flashbacks giving some characters more flesh than Mr McCarthy chose to do originally. It is desperately pessimistic and reeks of death and unimaginable horrors just beneath the surface of the grey falling dust. We are not privy to how mankind has come to this pretty pass and it's frankly irrelevant,all we need to know is on the screen. I didn't ""enjoy"" the film of ""The Road"" any more than I enjoyed the book but I did respect the way the novel has moved between the two media without too much compromise. It's a harsh,disturbing film with a harsh,disturbing message.",The Road
64,injury-65447,Failed to engage me,5,29 January 2021,"I made it about halfway before giving up. It seemed that there was no chance I would start to care about any of these characters or their fates. To me, the actors just weren't satisfactorily conveying the intended emotions.Dialogue about ""being the good guys"" and ""carrying the fire"" might work in the context of the novel, but in the film it comes across as lame and corny. What person in that situation would actually talk like that?Dreary monologues, tired acting, boring flashbacks, dull scenes. What a slog.I hear that the book this film is based on is very good. I wish I'd read the book instead. Some of my favourite podcasters mentioned that this story is nothing without the unique writing of the author. Turning it into just another post apocalyptic thriller is doing a disservice to the novel I imagine.",The Road
65,MBunge,A desolate Road that no one needs to travel,5,20 October 2011,"Based on the book by Cormac McCarthy, The Road is lovingly crafted but intellectually indifferent. With no depth or heft or structure to its tale, it never rises above exploitative melodrama. Combined with a visual palette that makes Waterworld look like a psychedelic rainbow, this film's lack of significance renders it one of those ""artsy"" exhibitions that pretentious folk imbue with all kinds of undeserved meaning and unearned quality.In a post-apocalyptic world of ruined buildings and desolate wilderness, all beautifully filmed, an unnamed man (Viggo Mortensen) and equally unnamed son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) are walking south to the coast through some geographically incongruous territory. Somebody should have told a producer that Pennsylvania, Oregon and Louisiana really don't fit together. Anyway, our two main characters just walk. Every so often, something bad almost happens to them. Every so often, something good does happen to them. Every so often, the man has a dream/memory of his beautiful wife, first from during the early days of whatever disaster killed the Earth and later from before everything went to Hell. They make it to the coast. The man dies. The boy hooks up with a wandering family. Everything is dirty. The end.That description of the plot isn't as snarky as you think. The Road is less a motion picture and more a series of very sad wasteland portraits that pass by your eye fast enough to make them all bleed together. Who is the man? Eh. Who is the boy? Eh. Who are any of the people they meet? Eh. Why should you care about any of it? Eh. None of it is poorly acted, stupidly written or shabily directed, but no one involved ever apparently thought through exactly what story they were trying to tell or why it needed to be told.It's not about the apocalypse, which is never explained or detailed even though it's inescapably important because how the world ends defines what things are like after the ending. If civilization collapses because of resource depletion, that's going to produce a particular sort of post-apocalypse landscape. If society dies in nuclear fire, what's left behind will reflect that. If it's a virus, environmental catastrophe, aliens or boy bands run amuck, what causes Armageddon will determine what challenges people face after it's over. That reality goes right over The Road's head like a rocket on its way to Pluto. This movie doesn't care why the existence of the man and the boy is grindingly miserable, just that it is. But without form and logic, the misery has no relevance to the viewer.It's also not about the relationship between the man and his son. Very early on in the movie, it's established that the man might have to kill his son in order to save him from being raped or eaten by cannibals. By starting at such an extreme high point, the story has nowhere to go either dramatically or emotionally. It's like watching a porno where the first thing you see is the guy having his orgasm all over the woman's face, then all the sex follows in a purposeless jumble.Calling The Road a bad film would be unfair. Calling it good would be unwarranted. Viggo Mortensen fans might appreciate his work, Robert Duvall is always a pleasure and the story's setting does look as nice as any place trampled by at least 3 of the 4 Horsemen can look. But it's still a supposed ""thinking man's Mad Max"" where the narrative and the moral isn't as well developed as Mel Gibson's star-making vehicle. Most people probably wouldn't hate it. They'd just fall asleep in the middle of it.",The Road
66,MaxBorg89,A brutal journey,7,24 January 2010,"Before it premiered, The Road was a film project people discussed with equal doses of trepidation and fear: on the one hand, it's based on a Pulitzer-winning novel by Cormac McCarthy, whose minimalist prose had already been successfully adapted by the Coen brothers (see No Country for Old Men), stars one of the best actors in recent American cinema (Viggo Mortensen) and is directed by John Hillcoat, the man who gave us the acclaimed The Proposition; on the other, the decision to postpone the film's release (the excessively bleak tone being cited as the reason) for a year triggered inevitable rumors of a ""troubled"" production. Then, when it finally opened at the Venice Film Festival (in competition, on top of all things), reactions were mixed, to say the least. And not entirely without a good reason.In fairness to the producers and distributors, the plot is a bit of a downer: a father and son, credited only as Man (Mortensen) and Boy (Kodi Smit McPhee), are constantly on the move, searching for a safe place in a post-apocalyptic, devastated world where people have resorted to murder and cannibalism in order to survive. Their journey is inter-cut with flashbacks depicting Man's life with the boy's mother (Charlize Theron) right before the situation went down the drain.The Road is certainly an ambitious project, and the book's stark description of a dark future translates very well on the screen: Hillcoat's use of landscape and lighting is impeccable, and the combination of cut-to-the-bone dialogue and raw, desperate acting (at least on Mortensen's part) ensures that Man and Boy's harrowing quest for survival doesn't pass by unnoticed. And yet the film doesn't grip or convince all the way, be it because there are some pacing issues, or because the brief presence of famous film and TV actors (Robert Duvall and Michael K. Williams from The Wire among them), as well as Theron's extended flashback role, feel forced, as if those people were ""special guest stars"" rather than thespians playing fully formed characters. And that's without mentioning a pretty laughable ending (albeit faithful to the novel).The Road will be hailed as a masterpiece by some, derided by others. The truth, as is often the case, lies in the middle: it struggles in places, mostly when not focusing exclusively on the two leads, but as a portrait of a world gone horribly wrong it comes off as quite respectable.",The Road
67,iquine,Humanity or Lack Thereof,5,10 May 2017,"(Flash Review) In one of those ubiquitous post-apocalyptic worlds, humans, food and nature are scarce. Although, it appears to be fairly recently with the cause is undisclosed. A man and his son appear to have ended up in a colder northern climate. They hit 'the road' looking for a more hospitable climate. Encountering lone humans and unfriendly gangs all looking for food.from 'any source'. they must be clever to survive. Much of the movie is the two of them wandering through ravaged, bleak and dark lands almost ad nauseum. Mix in some happier flashbacks with green grass and family moments. I guess the movie was hitting on what is humanity and at what point do humans lose it. When do we not help others and fend for ourselves? At what point is life so horrible that we choose to leave this world? Many striking cinematic gloomy shots with at OK story of survival and family, the movie was well-produced and the acting was fine.

68,jimbo-53-186511,The Road To Hell,2,4 June 2015,"I've now seen three films which have been adapted from Cormac McCarthy's novels - No Country For Old Men, The Counsellor and this film and I can honestly say that I haven't liked any of these adaptations. Having not read any of the books, I can only conclude that either Cormac McCarthy's novels just aren't my cup of tea OR that his novels haven't been adapted well to the big screen. Let's just say that the jury is out on that at the moment and I'll just crack on with the review....One thing that's blatantly obvious with this film when watching it is that it suffers from a very weak narrative; we're thrust straight into the apocalypse with no real explanation; how long have father and son been enduring the apocalypse for? What actually caused the apocalypse? Stuff like this wouldn't bother me if a film engages me emotionally, but I just found it very hard to get involved with this film.Another issue I had with this film was the constant flashbacks; I assume that the point was to try and show the father's life pre-apocalypse and perhaps to get inside his head, but there is no insight here and I found I learnt nothing more about the father following these flashbacks. To me all the flashbacks did was pad out the running time. I also thought it was strange that his wife just randomly upped and left him completely out of the blue.I also found it incredibly contrived that father and son stumble across an underground area for storing food that just happened to be packed to the rafters with tins. I mean considering how sparse food was prior to this scene, it does require the viewer to perhaps suspend too much disbelief to find this believable. It looked like there was enough food down there for a Last Supper. It's also hard to believe that no-one would have found the food sooner.It also doesn't help that the father character is unlikeable; he's a very hard edged individual and whilst I understand that he needs to be like this to a certain extent in order to survive, I did still feel that there were many occasions when he was nasty just for the sake of being nasty. His death scene at the end was undoubtedly supposed to be moving, but due to how unlikeable the father character was I just felt rather unmoved by that scene if I'm honest. I'll admit I felt sorry for the kid because he was quite likable. I think the worst thing about this film though is how boring it is; it's basically a post apocalyptic 'survival of the fittest' type film so why not make it a bit more interesting? I expected there to be a bit more tension and conflict or just anything happening that would hold my interest. However, it just didn't play out like this and instead of that we just have father and son walking round trying to find food and seemingly only encountering trouble every 30 minutes or so. Robert Duvall is in the film for about 10 minutes in a pointless role that added nothing to the film. I could find my interest waning and the life being drained out of me as the film plodded along, but mercifully it's only 100 minutes long so at least it isn't intolerably long.The Road gets an extra star for the acting and the cinematography; Mortensen and Smit-McPhee were both excellent and the cinematography did give the film a bleak and cold feel to it. Despite this though, there are way too many things that didn't work for me and if I'm honest I just didn't think that it was a particularly good film.",The Road
69,yusufpiskin,"""We have to just... keep carrying the fire.""",9,26 January 2020,"Whisper-quiet and bathed in the sooty cinematography of its wrecked landscapes, ""The Road"" is a meditation on both survival and giving up the fight. With that tension as its thematic catalyst, the film moves slowly and poetically through the harrowing and heartbreaking journey of its protagonists. An ideally-cast Viggo Mortensen anchors the film, but it is Kodi Smit-McPhee who provides the film its conscience. ""The Road"" is an unexpectedly excellent and moving film.",The Road

72,dworldeater,Carry the fire,9,17 November 2016,"I have not read the book, but the film is a masterpiece and by far the most realistic post apocalyptic movie that I have ever seen. The Road is a story about bonding and survival of a father and son through a hopeless and barren wasteland. The film is bleak, depressing and somber in its tone and delivery. Food and other resources are scarce, those left must scavenge what they find in their travels to survive. Cannibalism is prevalent in this nightmare world where groups of miscreants prey upon the helpless. Viggo Mortenson and Kodi Smit McPhee do their best to survive in these most dire of circumstances and ""carry the fire"" while doing their best to maintain their humanity. Performances are incredible from Viggo and Kodi and are grueling, emotional and gritty. They also bring raw, brutal realism in the physical aspects of their performances and are absolutely convincing as filthy, starving, downtrodden people doing their best to survive in a world that has ended. They are also a sliver of hope, a light in the darkness in world that otherwise brings nothing but sorrow, discomfort and hardship. The support cast is also very impressive with Robert Duvall, Charlize Theron and Guy Pierce. The camera-work and score are excellent. The landscape is grey, desolate and barren. The film is a very harsh, bleak and unforgiving portrayal of this world and The Road is a very gripping, powerful and exceptional film.",The Road
73,Enchorde,Worthwhile walk,7,9 August 2010,"Recap: After a great apocalyptic event, civilization as we know it has ended. Only a few survivors remain in a harsh wasteland. Food is scarce and every day is a struggle to survive in a land where everyone is just looking out for themselves and not thinking twice about the horrors they commit to make it another day. In this land a father and his son walks along the roads, to get to the sea in hope of something better.Comments: Basically it is a two headed story that follows parallel tracks throughout the movie. It is the obvious one about the struggle to survive, and one about keeping one's humanity when it is lost along with all hope. Also the struggle to survive and holding up the ideals of humanity might be two opposites. That is what is keeping the movie interesting, and actually somewhat emotional at times.It is a slowly paced story, and if you're expecting action you'll find it almost as scarce as the strugglers find food. It's a bleak story, a dystopia, and the main event is the mental battle that is the struggle between the two goals mentioned above. But even if it is slow, I did found it interesting and almost strangely captivating. Viggo Mortensen gives another very good performance, he has a nack for these rugged character and casting him was a stellar choice. Kodi-Smit-McPhee is also quite good as the kid, albeit his character, in my opinion, suffers from the annoying kid syndrome at times.There is little to explain the cause of both the event or really why the Woman choose to die, but this uncertainty actually is good for the movie. Not knowing what or why makes it easier to identify and sympathize with the Father and Son. We as audience know as much as they do, and therefore walk along their side, not just watching them.A good movie, even if it is a little gloomy, it is something I can recommend.7/10",The Road
74,Jonny_Numb,Minimalist Apocalypse,8,4 June 2010,"When dealing with a subject like The End of the World in cinematic terms, the most natural inclination (by viewer and filmmaker alike) is an anticipation of something overblown, bombastic, and effects-smothered (think last year's ""2012"" or ""Armageddon""). One of the most impressive aspects of ""The Road"" is the quiet serenity with which it presents a world devoid of vegetation, animals, and humanity in general (with the few that remain reverting to cannibalism to survive). Director John Hillcoat (who helmed the superb sleeper Western ""The Proposition"") and screenwriter Joe Penhall understand that Cormac McCarthy's source novel is less about a post-apocalyptic, ash-covered landscape than it is the way that such extreme circumstances bring seemingly simplistic human emotions, motivations, and fears into sharp focus. None of the characters are christened with proper names, making their relativity more universal: Viggo Mortensen portrays a father ""carrying the fire"" of humanity alongside his inquisitive son (Kodi Smit-McPhee, in a standout performance), following a highway south to the coast. Along the way, they encounter roving tribes of scavengers, haunted old men, and similarly desperate types clinging to survival in a world where all else has ceased to matter. The film is punctuated with claustrophobic flashbacks to The Man's previous life, which are paradoxically as fraught with conflict as his current situation; in ""The Road,"" any potential reprieve dances precariously on the edge of potential disaster. Despite all this, the film captures the enduring hope of the human spirit evident in McCarthy's novel--the performances are impassioned and down-to-earth, the landscapes are a conflicting mix of painterly elegance within their understated horror, and the film tugs at the heartstrings with a gruffness that, when the stunning final frame rolls, has earned the viewer's tears in spades.",The Road

In actual fact, I found it to be less interesting than I thought I would. A lot of the emotions and events were just too obvious in my eyes. The cannibals, the escape from the house, watching helpless as others are hunted. It's all in apocalypse 101. Thank goodness for Mortensen's performance. He brings real gravity to the memorable moments, such as the father teaching his son how to kill himself, and the overprotective paranoia that soon sets in. Hillcoat, once again, captures his landscapes and subjects beautifully, but I felt as though the film dragged itself along, like some moody child.",The Road
76,Seraphion,Great emotion play depiction,7,7 February 2015,"The movie's story background of a post-nuclear apocalypse world is one of the most common used story base within the third tier SciFi movies, which usually are bad quality movies. So this movie sure carried its own risks in portraying such a story. Fortunately the movie didn't focus solely on the battle for survival, but instead emphasizes more on the different emotions in play within the settings, particularly in this case is added the element of having to teach conflicting moral values and survival principles to a kid who was born after the nuclear disaster. The emotion play and moral contradictions are very often displayed in contradiction, between the man's protective nature and the kid's innocence. The movie nicely ends its story after the man finishes his mission, by giving a good ending for the kid. The acting overall is just standard for me. Viggo Mortensen acted out well enough for his father role, although should say that his physical build doesn't really suit a father figure. Kodi Smit-McPhee did okay in portraying the innocent and confused kid.",The Road

He is a brilliant young actor, as has been shown in his subsequent films (he has also grown much taller). I really think he has a huge future. The only other film I compare this with is ""The Book of Eli"" released the year after this film. It stars Denzel Washington, Mila Kunis & Gary Oldma, & has a strong supporting cast.. It is not quite as cerebral as this film; however, it has many merits.

78,eric262003,"Not As Good As Eli, But Equally Poignant",8,7 April 2014,"After watching two extraordinary film centered during the post apocalypse, ""The Road"" and ""The Book of Eli"", one common theme is depicted both films and that is, life is not worth living for. Weather we just let ourselves wither and die or a giant asteroid does the favour for us, both of these movies indicate a not so pleasant world where cannibals run amuck and there's very little to no chance of hope or survival. I hope nothing like this happen in my time, but these two movies were just fascinating.I guess ""The Book of Eli"" was a bit better by this is just my bias opinion due mainly to my fascination for graphic-novel like movies. It felt like as though a graphic novel was performed right in front of my eyes as a nomadic person ventures out west to transport a book as he stumbles through a grim and dangerous atmosphere. But Eli is very prepared to what danger awaits him on his quest.In ""The Road"" the central character is an unnamed Man (Viggo Mortensen) searching for a safer place to escape from. The man ventures down south believing he'll be safe there. Like Eli the Man has come prepared as a means to protect and deliver which in this case is his Son (Kodie Smith-McPhee). Their travel is deserted and dreary and has the same obstacles that Eli encountered in ""The Book of Eli"". ""The Road's"" violence is much tamer and more family oriented as The Man teaches his son the rights and wrongs in life while protecting him from any dangers that manifests about.There might be subliminal connection between both movies as both focuses on a disaster struck United States, but ""The Book of Eli"" is clearly about a nuclear war and the extreme sunlight is burning up the planet due to the damage of the ozone layer. In ""The Road"", they don't explain what caused their foundations crumbling, but I'm lead to believe that a giant asteroid landed on Earth like it did with the dinosaurs which caused a massive cloud of dust blocking out the sun. No matter what doom is here to stay in both worlds.Both films feature a myriad of talented thespians and ever the lesser known actors turn in brilliant performances. No matter which movie you prefer better you will be haunted by the action, the emotions and the thrills as in the dystopia society the characters face, it is either to kill or be killed by the lowest denominator possible. So if you have A chance to see both films and you're in for a dreary good time.",The Road
79,pc95,Good Vision and Settings with a Few Drawbacks,7,15 January 2011,"Thought ""The Road"" was a well done, technically competent work although at times the dialog and certainly some of the character feelings lacked believability. Mortenson character is paranoid and yet on more than a few instances leaves his son away. In one of the less plausible scenes, the writers lose touch of the father character who in anger enacts the very cruelty against a thief he preaches to his son to be against. Worse, was the sheer whining we're setup to listen to on more than a few scenes. The movie is at it's best when the characters are bleakly photographed in abandon buildings, towns, or coming upon particularly gruesome or harrowing scenes. Settings are very well conceived. The director has done a great job showing us what hunger is like and painting the sentiment of taking food for granted. I would of liked more definition in the recounting of how the United Stated deteriorated; the fact that several years or so our protagonists have been surviving does not excuse an obviously purposeful hazy opening recounting of what actually took place to kill the animals and living things. One can hazard a good guess that it is a result of a nuclear winter, but the father not knowing seems preposterous in today's media-driven world. Anyway. Competent and stylish with a strong ending, this movie goes under the ""mixed"" category. I loved the settings, however some of the characterization and dialog sometimes grated.",The Road

This is one of the cases where I wish I had seen the movie before the book, instead of the other way round.Book-to-film adaptations are always tricky, because it's nearly impossible for a person who is familiar with the story to watch the movie with a completely open mind. The imagery in the film rarely equals or surpasses what the written words have conjured in your imagination. Especially in a novel that's as vivid and well-written as The Road.Not to say that The Road is a failure, as I think it can stand reasonably well on its own merits. The cast is solid, the story is one that anyone with a child, spouse, or loved one can relate to, and there's a profound bleakness to the settings and cinematography that stands out amongst a sea of less visually stark movies.But The Road reaches a little to hard at being emotional, at times, and it's hard to get the mood and atmosphere of the book - in a movie that's less than two hours. And as always, things from the book have been cut out of the movies. Usually, this isn't a big deal, but The Road didn't really have any unnecessary parts that could safely be excised. So I recommend this more for those who haven't read the book, than those who have. Sometimes, a it's better to read a story, than to see it.",The Road

The book is all the more extraordinary as it 300 pages with no names and very few events yet is riveting.The movie captures the tone, the grayness, the desperation, and the love as few adaptations of books have - this is superb film-making - though bleak and desperate - both the book and the film stress that no matter what, apocalyptic dystopia included, is an excuse to lay aside our moral or ethical judgment and give ourselves over to a baser nature.The story of the man and his boy walking the road in order to get to something (anything) better is honestly moving and wretched. Along the way they encounter moments of terror, and several other lost souls. Mostly though it's just them.If you like films that are unique and a real immersive experience The Road is worth your time - the trailer makes it almost into a horror film - though there are some intense scenes, there is nothing that blatant in the film - shot in a palette of gray this is a faithful and sincere adaptation that will reward the viewer willing to lose themselves in the film.",The Road
83,MartianOctocretr5,This Road is somewhat tedious,4,11 March 2012,"If you've ever driven across the Nevada desert on US Highway 50, the notorious ""Loneliest Road in America,"" then you have some idea what to expect from this Road. Both are hundreds of miles of sameness, seemingly without end.The notion for the film is worthy: post-Apocolyptic survival battle for a father and his young son. What sacrifices will the father make to protect his son from a savage, ruthless world? Will they have to betray their values and morality to survive? Who can they trust? (etc.) However, the film drives in neutral so much you wonder if there two survivalists will ever reach the end of the road. Or, if you will.The characters are not likable, nor or they very believable. The father looks like a retro hippy, his son a crybaby who never stops whining. Through flashbacks that are useless to the story, we see the deceased wife; she fails to impress the audience for (apparently intended) schmaltz. She was just a jerk, actually. We also occasionally meet other people that the lead characters encounter in a series of vignettes on their quest. Some good, some evil, each to represent different types of survival strategy. About the only one that is memorable is an old man played by Robert Duvall. The veteran actor delivers a very poignant speech with dignity and emotion; easily the movie's standout moment. Another strength of the movie is the cinematography of deep hues and darkness that not only augments the tone of despair the story is trying to relate, but fits the post-Apocolyptic premise.There aren't enough such moments as the Duvall scene. A pity, since it appears the director and cast really seem to be trying to offer us a touching picture of innocent victims of a chaotic world. Perhaps they tried too hard. Most characters become clichéd baboons filled with angst that the audience finds too annoying to care about. This story asks you to invest too much, and offers little pay-off. The deliberately dangling ending works, but most of the preceding portions of the film do not. I wouldn't go so negative on it as to say to detour away from ""The Road"" entirely, but be prepared with plenty of patience if you do see it.",The Road
84,sme_no_densetsu,A bleak post-apocalyptic tale of survival and kinship,7,17 September 2010,"John Hillcoat's ""The Road"" is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy. The story has a post-apocalyptic setting and focuses on a father & son struggling to survive and make their way south to (hopefully) warmer climes.Viggo Mortensen plays the father, identified only as 'Man' in the credits, while the son is played by Kodi Smit-McPhee, similarly identified only as 'Boy'. They work well together and both contribute impressive performances. The supporting cast is sparsely populated but there are notable appearances from Robert Duvall and Charlize Theron among others.The script is satisfying though the bleakness begins to seem unrelenting in the first half of the film. The story eventually shows some other sides, though there are likely some viewers who'll give up before then. Also, I think that never divulging the cause of the apocalypse was a poor choice that tests audience acceptance (even though it's the same way in the novel).I was unfamiliar with director John Hillcoat's work before seeing this film but I think that he turned in a workmanlike effort here. The cinematography also deserves mention for its systematically dreary look, which suits the film perfectly. The score by Nick Cave & Warren Ellis also contributes nicely to the atmosphere.Ultimately, I think that the film is worthwhile but the grim subject matter definitely won't appeal to everyone. I'd be interested to see how the film compares to its source material since I suspect that the relaxed pace of a novel better suits the story.",The Road
85,Screen_Blitz,Enthralling and authentic adaption to Cormac McCarthy's post-apocalyptic novel,8,3 November 2015,"John Hillcoat brings a genuine taste to the dark and gritty post-apocalyptic novel by Cormac McCarthy, a critically acclaimed author who's literary works are often deemed ""nearly impossible"" for a on screen adaptation due to his sophisticated style of pacing and brutal portrayal of violence (take his masterpiece novel Blood Meridian for example). Director John Boat however, takes the daunting task of translating one of McCarthy's most acclaimed novels and embraces the spirit with haunting visuals and visceral storytelling. Starring Viggo Mortesen and Kodi Smit-McPhee in what maybe one of their best performances of their careers, Morsten and Smit-McPhee play unnamed father and son respectively who sprawl across America after a cataclysmic event wipes out nearly the nation's entire population. Trudging in their grungy, old clothes through the ravaged landscape and the scattered debris, the two set out in search of food and resources. However, what stands in their way is the vast number of survivors to turn to cannibalism in means of surviving from the severe lack of food, with nothing but a pistol to defend themselves. The father and son's survival skills become increasingly tested as they face the threat of flesh-hungry survivors and the grim realities of the new world.The film exhibits one of the darkest and most authentic portrayal of post-apocalyptic settings put together in film, and it never shies away from the grim atmosphere the story conveys. Throughout the film, the sky is always dark and gray, never showing a single pinch of sunshine, and the environment is completely covered in flailing ash, along with demolished buildings and raggedy old cars stranded on the roads. The whole environment has very little color to give the setting a sad and depressing mood, much like the film's story. The film progress through a very depressing tone and meets no happy point, but is embraced through ingenious writing and narrative that keeps the story alive, even during the moments when it feels empty or slow-paced. Some scenes are unflinchingly suspenseful and will leave you biting your nails, especially during the scenes with the bandits who make their desperate attempts to kill the main character and his son, and make them their human happy meal. Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee showcase superb performances as the father and the son that make their characters' emotions palpable and strong. The Road is an enthralling film that deserves your attention. This film however, is recommended for mature audiences as the dark and grim atmosphere as well as its the themes of cannibalism can too much for younger audiences to handle. Overall, John Hillcoat earns a round of applause for his adaption to Cormac's McCarthy's novel.",The Road
86,Angelus2,A film about the bleak future...,7,18 January 2010,"A Father and Son try to make their way to the coast in hopes of finding something, in a world were everything else is slowly dieing. It's a different take on the Apocalypse genre, not relying on big explosions and shootouts, as well as scary monsters in the dark.....Actually it does have monsters...Us.Viggo Mortensen proves once again he is a brilliant actor by capturing the minds and hearts of his audience, playing the father who is trying to protect his son from getting raped or killed by the vile people who roam the roads. I genuinely felt scared, as the film went on, but I found the little boy very irritating mainly because he tried to be 'nice' to people....But then again, I'd be nice to strangers if I'd never met a single person in my life, before... The special effects were quite grim and didn't depict a good picture...the cannibalism is a threat that lurks in the back of your mind throughout the film, but I honestly felt that the film was slow at times....The narration was brilliantly done by Viggo...",The Road

Their bond is absolutely unbreakable and dominates (rather than Charlize Theron's performance) this superlative piece of film-making, which is terse, raw and unadorned, with no cheap tricks devaluing this story of unconditional love. On the whole a sense of strong, huge sadness haunts the story but the extraordinary film making offsets this happiness and sorrow.

90,jaredmobarak,I don't want to just survive  The Road,9,22 September 2009,"Despite a trailer that was cut to bring in disaster film audiences, Bobby was safe from my wrath because it appeared his brother and he let Hillcoat's vision stick, creating one of the best films of the year thus far. Please do not take the preview as gospel, because it does a terrible job marketing the movie. This is an independent production with very dark tones—one scene with a basement full of people held captive, thin and missing limbs, as food storage for the monsters living above is just one example—as well as a riveting story dealing with life, death, family, and sacrifice. The make of a father is tested when the world is at an end. If it is between putting a bullet into the head of your child rather than allow him to be eaten, one must come to grips with mortality and pride. If the world around you is disappearing, burning, becoming a land of criminals, is it good enough to just survive? When you get away from whatever trouble is in your backyard, is it enough when you just have to continue running with a new test awaiting you? There is no safe haven; no piece of earth hidden from the horrors that have taken over  to live is to run.Don't be surprised when the big names you heard were in the film don't appear until late or show up for very brief stints when they do. Some are seen only in flashbacks, others are blips on the radar as ""The Man"" and his ""Son"" journey, day by day, to live for the next. The Road is all about Viggo and young Kodi Smit-McPhee, (who is great—many are hailing him as a revelation, but I think time will tell on that one), as they come across allies as well as their share of villains too. Small roles notwithstanding, both Garret Dillahunt, as a hick trucker looking for red meat of any kind, and Robert Duvall, as an old vagabond trying to mind his own business in the wasteland, are outstanding. Especially Duvall, who I'll admit has been phoning in some performances of late with too much gravitas. His ""Old Man""—can you sense a theme with the character names—is subtle and real, wrinkles and crags making up his face, dirt and grime coating it all. Hillcoat knows how to let an environment consume his viewers, leaving nothing to be pretty for pretty's sake. Like his Australian western of two years ago, the lack of showers and clean, running water is noticeable throughout.There aren't any explosions or big time battles between good and evil; all those shots of news footage used in the trailer as though our central family watched them on television do not exist. One day a husband and his pregnant wife were enjoying their lives when disaster struck. It doesn't matter what the cause was or where it started, all we need to be aware of is that the destruction was all encompassing, worldwide, and unstoppable. The morality of letting a child be born into a life of fear and death becomes an early theme, the birth of Smit-McPhee's character a question mark in his first days. Going through so much for that son, Mortensen lives for nothing else, his own life expendable as long as when he goes he knows the boy has a chance. What chance that is, no one knows. The next day could bring the discovery of a hidden bunker full of non-perishables; it could bring a loner vagrant passing by while they sleep to steal all they have accumulated; or it could mean seeing the enemy over the hills, on the verge of discovering them, causing their lives' worth to be left in favor of a rapid getaway. The real beauty of the film is how it never lulls or takes a shortcut. You will be on the edge of your seat for the duration, waiting to see when the moment will come that they can't get away.A story of hope, it is also one of hardship and sacrifice. Some risk everything for another; some risk themselves in order to survive. When the choice becomes finding a man to eat or take from an unsuspecting child, sometimes you have to do the lesser of two evils no matter how much of your soul it takes with it. Mortensen embodies these sentiments, but so do others along the way. I must mention Michael K. Williams as ""The Thief"", a man so lost on his own journey of survival that he just can't help himself. You know that he is a man of honor and kindness that had no choice, but then you must think of the fact that he did, he could have allowed himself to die rather than take from innocents. But that's the rub, no one is innocent, not even ""The Boy"" as evidenced when Smit-McPhee yells at his father to say that he also must face what's going on each day. Viggo isn't shielding him from the terrors around every corner; just because he is young doesn't mean he hasn't grown up quick; it's all he could do to stay sane and move along with all the pains of his past and knowledge of those still to come. It's a tough watch, but well worth the time and effort to see a true masterpiece of tone and humanity—the good parts and the bad.",The Road
91,KnightsofNi11,Just waiting it out until the end of humanity,8,5 May 2011,"You may have missed The Road in the midst of 2009's holiday releases, and if you did I would definitely suggest returning to it, because you missed something very good. The Road is set in a post apocalyptic future where there are hardly any people left, and absolutely no animals left. A young boy and his father wander this wasteland in search of food and shelter, stumbling upon various survivors, some harmless and others not so much. Bleak is undoubtedly the best adjective to describe this movie. That, or grey. There is little life in this movie and it is this lack of grandeur and liveliness that really makes it a gripping and more emotional experience. Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee are practically the only focus of the film and it is their relationship which drives the film and it is the true core of the story. It is a very captivating simple-but-not survival story for father and son.This movie really captures a specific element and a particular atmosphere that carries throughout the film very well. It is very bleak and very somber from start to finish and every aspect of the film hearkens to that mood. The visuals are full of depressing grey landscapes. The music creates a very somber attitude towards the on screen visuals. The acting is quiet and reserved, making the film feel much more real and the emotional impact much more striking. This consistency makes up for any faults in the film along the way such as some dips in the story or some less than impressive moments. I love a movie with a good feel to it that really keeps you enthralled, and The Road has just that.It also has that magical little gem called uniqueness. This film really captures what one can only assume a post apocalyptic world would be like. So many post apocalyptic films focus on the idea of rebuilding and moving on after a global tragedy. In The Road, we are simply waiting it out until the end. There is no more hope for humanity. Everything is dead and the Earth's existence as we know it is coming to a close. This really makes the film much more depressing through any aspect you think about it in. But it is this dosage of non-sugarcoated emotion that we need in order to be treated to a truly gripping post apocalyptic film, and not something that glorifies the wasteland and lets us believe that there is hope in such a bleak setting. The Road is real and it makes its viewer feel all sorts of emotions that are often times absent where they need to be. It is bleak, yes, but it is triumphantly bleak.The Road is highly successful in its uniqueness and its consistency. This is really what makes it a very good film that is fascinating, albeit difficult, to watch at times. You can't hold out much hope for the characters in this film, and you simply have to take it for what it is. But when you consider these realities of the film then you realize just how smart and deep it is. Emotion runs this film and it fuels its core. Add on to that fact some great acting from Mortensen and Smit-McPhee and you have yourself a powerful experience. I can't use words like delightful, beautiful, or wonderful because that isn't what The Road is. It is bleak and it uses its own somber attitude to drive itself so well and really provide something captivating and unique.",The Road

93,carbuff,"This is not just deep, it's nonsensically deep.",1,12 May 2015,"I was really hoping for something here, but not sure exactly what.I'm generally really patient with films, but I gave up on this astonishingly depressing, tedious, illogical mess after a half hour or something. It has zero biological plausibility--what kills every living thing except human beings? No explanation given before I found better things to do with my time. There's no indication that some kind of supernatural event occurred. Human beings are not that special biologically--lots of other advanced multicellular organisms are really more durable in all kinds of ways (for instance, those squirrels I'm currently feeding out there at minus 30 below wind chill seem pretty tough to me). Human beings dominate the world because of intelligence and social organization--not due to any special physical or organic properties or anything like that. What were the father and son eating? It probably takes a decent amount of calories to sustain their rather active lifestyle, but I did not see them acquiring nearly enough to keep them alive and moving. (A can of coke is only 140 calories and hardly nutritious.) Maybe I did not watch it long enough and they ate another human being. When I combined all this apparent idiocy with the fact that this movie is grim beyond words, I figured that if this is what I was after, I should just cut to the chase and stream an outright horror flick. Yeah, I know, suspend disbelief and allow this drudgery to ennoble my mind with deeply considered revelations about humanity, morality and all that sort of good stuff and make me a better person, but I don't have to write a term paper on this unrelentingly dark, ill- thought-out, pseudo-intellectual nonsense, so no thanks.",The Road

Two of these people still alive:a man and his young son. They walk up and down a road and have various depressing adventures. In flashbacks we see that the man had a wife at one time and we learn a little about her. All the actors in the film are unpleasant or fake and not for one moment can I have any sympathy or empathy with any of them, especially the lead characters. The man looks like a junkie and a tramp. The son is whiny as is what we see of the wife who is also a moody cow. Most of the film is preposterous and laughable and the only reason I have given the picture above the lowest possible vote is that the scenery and outside photography is not bad albeit designed for manic depressives.3/10.",The Road

They have decided to head for the coast in a world that has been plunged into cold and dark. The cause of this is never really explained, but it's a world where it is an achievement to survive each day.I have considered this subject over the years and came to the conclusion that I could not survive in this type of world and would take the easy way out. I must say that the film will not change my view on this as (like most people) I could not survive under the changed circumstances. The only question is at what point would you realise that things were not going to change again for the better. That is pretty much the storyline of The Road ... Is the struggle worth it? Although I enjoyed the performance of Mortensen and the lighting (or the dark grey tones) throughout the film I was surprised that I didn't really feel more connected to the characters. It could be argued that the film may have worked better in black and white, but the lack of colour really worked for me. The film is not relentlessly depressing and does contain a few glimpses of optimism. It's not a film for the rom-com crowd though.",The Road
96,ajs-10,A great adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel...,9,12 December 2010,"Having recently read the novel on which this film is based by Cormac McCarthy I thought it was time to dust off the DVD and give it a spin. I wasn't disappointed; this is an excellent adaptation of the book. Yes there are bits missed out and there are bits added, but at the end of the day a direct translation of the book to the screen my just have been too much for some. But I digress, here's a very brief summary before I tell you more of my thoughts (summary haters please mind the cart while I write the next paragraph).A man and his boy are wandering an ash covered and devastated America. Some disaster has killed almost all life, leaving just a few people to get by as best they can. To some this means cannibalism and so the pair must be very wary of anyone they meet. The majority they come across along the road are not to be trusted, but there are still one or two ""good guys"" left. We are also told, in flashback, of how the boy was born into this world and what happened to his mother, but I'm not going to tell you that here. They are headed south to the coast where they hope it will be warmer and life will be easier. I really don't want to say any more, it's better if you watch it for yourselves.I'll admit that reading the book depressed me slightly, it's a harrowing tale at best and I was very interested to see how it would translate to the big screen. John Hillcoat did a great job, the sense of desolation came across perfectly and this was helped by the use of real locations rather than relying on CGI. Great performances all round, especially from; Viggo Mortensen as the man, Kodi Smit-McPhee as the boy, Robert Duvall as the Old Man, Guy Pearce as the Veteran, Michael K. Williams as the Thief and Charlize Theron as the woman.As I said at the beginning, some bits of the novel were left out and other bits were added. I felt that this enhanced the story, for instance, there is very little about the boy's mother in the book but a great deal in the film. This gives the audience a better understanding of the time-line and also a sense of the enormity of the catastrophe. I very much enjoyed this film and I feel it's one that will stay with me for some time. If you haven't read the book I can definitely recommend it to you, as I can highly recommend this film.My score: 8.6/10",The Road
97,itamarscomix,Depressingly bland,6,23 September 2011,"The Road is an excellent atmosphere film, and it delivers the feeling of bleakness and desperation incredibly well, and the cinematography and music compliment that atmosphere perfectly. Unfortunately, that runs out of gas halfway through the film when the viewer realizes that it's not going anywhere, and that the characters - though well-played - are just not interesting or sympathetic enough to really be cared for in any way. Ultimately the film lacks in both soul and story structure - worst of all, the ending, which is supposed to be bitter-sweet, is more likely to raise a very unfitting chuckle. The Road is not by any means a bad movie, but for the price it demands from the viewer in emotional exhaustion, it's just not worth it. I'd recommend it to film-students and cinematography enthusiasts only.",The Road
98,Maziun,There is not much humanity left,8,7 December 2013,"This movie is based on Pulitzer winning book by Cormac McCarthy – famous for ""No country for old men"". It's a drama about father and son trying to survive in post apocalyptic world. There is quite a western feel to this movie too , just like it was in ""No country for old men"" (despite that movie being a thriller).Let me start with the bad things first . The movie never bothers to give any kind of explanation what happened to the world. I understand that the drama of those people trying to survive is the key element to the movie. Yet , none explanation is given . I haven't read the book – maybe the movie doesn't offer any explanation , because the book doesn't too . Still , it's frustrating and takes a LOT of suspension of disbelief from the viewer to watch the movie. I also didn't liked Charlize Theron's performance as the wife . I completely couldn't understand her apathy and cold attitude. She was annoying character and I don't understand at all why Mortensen loved her.Now the good things . The movie has a gritty , dark and depressing atmosphere . Everything is grey and dirty here – colors rarely appear. Viggo Mortensen is really good as the main hero. There are also surprising and good episodes from Robert Duvall (Old man) and Guy Pearce (Veteran traveler). ""The road"" is a morality tale. What would you do to survive ? Should you become a beast to survive ? And does wanting to life can explain every behavior ? ""The road"" is also a philosophical tale . Does God exist ? Why keep moving if there is nothing out there ? If the world is going to end does my actions have any meaning ? Solid direction . Many moments of disturbing violence and depressing scenes.

You might have heard that description used on it before, but it's not just trite its accurate. Not only is the entire film very dim looking(this is one of the few times the under-lighting can be justified), but what it has to say is equally drab.While it has a few cameo roles and other small parts, the picture essentially has a cast of two. One of those is the underrated Viggo Mortensen; who is as good as you should expect and if you like this film, you're invested in it because of him. Whether you know it or not. However, the other, is that kid. And has there ever been a more dense and burdensome character than him?The Road is trying to be an extremely dark, real and impactful dystopian drama and in that sense I guess it succeeds. But it falls short of dealing the blow it aims and if entertainment means anything to you dont look here.",The Road
101,CountZero313,a reverential adaptation,8,10 March 2011,"It is very difficult to come to The Road purely as a movie fan. Maybe a minority do, but the majority come as fans of Cormack McCarthy's source novel. As moving and harrowing as that is, there is a sub-group within them - parents. I read the book, and as a parent of children the same age as The Boy, it terrified me. McCarthy's tale touches something very deep inside. Because of that fan base and their protective instincts towards the novel, the filmmakers were very restricted in the degree of digression they could display. Not since the adaptation of Harry Potter has such rigid limitations been imposed.Readers of the novel like me need fear not - Hillcoat proves himself one of us. The film is less an adaptation than a homage to the novel. As such, it is extremely challenging to write a film review. For the fans of the novel, nothing you can say will stop them from seeing it. For the uninitiated, I cannot undo my initiation and interpret the film purely as cinema. Wonderful performances from Viggo Mortensen as the Man, and Kodi Smit-McPhee as the Boy. Robert Duvall and Guy Pearce show up ('cameo' hardly fits in with the material) no doubt because they wanted the honour of being associated with this story. The post-apocalyptic world of pyroclastic ash and exploding trees is convincingly re-created. Despite that, the salient genre here is love story - the love of one man for his child in the most extreme of circumstances.I cried again, remembering the book. I thank the filmmakers for that.",The Road
102,Likes_Ninjas90,A fascinating journey for those who are willing to look deeper,7,15 October 2010,"This much anticipated adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel was directed by John Hillcoat, who previously made the Australian Western The Proposition. The decision to appoint Hillcoat as the director was a smart one because he thoroughly understands the concept of the frontier both visually and thematically. As with the Australian outback in The Proposition, The Road is set in a world that has been pillaged and decimated both physically and morally. Men, who are as rugged as the terrain they inhabit, have emerged and through the breakdown of law enforcement, rules and regulations, violence is now the only means of suitable justice. Both films are bounded by Darwinian principles of the 'survival of the fittest' and to kill or be killed. Given the similarities that Hillcoat's films share it surprising and thankful that the violence throughout The Road has been largely subdued. Where The Proposition was largely gratuitous, this film is more suggestive rather than explicit. The frequent visions of collapsed buildings, rubble and ominous grey skies, speaks volumes about the state of the world, without the need to show mindless acts of slaughter. The mere arrival of a group of armed scavengers or the dangling feet of strung up bodies, is both harrowing and suggestive in the same manner too. This is a film with a chilling and grim atmosphere, but it is within this darkness that a strange beauty emerges from The Road. Shot in Pennsylvania with a cold, lifeless and grey colour palette, Hillcoat and his cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe have resisted overusing CGI effects for the films art direction and instead they have relied mostly on real life industrial wastelands and poor weather conditions to define the look of the film. Aesthetically, this is a stunning piece of cinema that will really draw audiences in with its immersive atmosphere.Given the very nature of the story, in being set in a wasteland that has no seemingly no future and with two characters that don't really know where they are going, the film's narrative is rather loose and pondering at times. There is no explanation provided for the decline of the world and the exposition attributed to the previous lives of the man and his son is minimal. In the present, the actual journey taken is less significant than the film's underlining subtext and the ethics of the new world. Smartly, it is innocence of the boy that provides the film with its conscience. He asks his father whether they are still the good guys and whether they will have to succumb to cannibalism. His father naturally gives him the answers that he wants him to hear but it becomes clear that the boy will have to make these decisions himself one day. The way that the boys begins to rebel against his father's values, like the way he treats strangers, is suggestive of the formation of his own views and ideals. An Australian film that explored quite similar territory much more thoroughly was Last Ride, where a criminal took his son on a road trip with him. It raised questions not only about heritage and identity but also whether the son would succumb to the same poor life choices as his father. In that film one was able to see the rejection of this lifestyle. The boy in The Road is never shown to fend for himself. He is prepared to show kindness even when his father doesn't, but given the limitations of this film's narrative and its contrived, sentimental ending, we never see what sort of person he is independently and whether he would uphold his same innocent values when he is more aware of the world.Despite the misdirected narrative, the film is regularly energised by a number of nail biting and suspenseful action sequences, skilfully handled to impose maximum tension levels. The sporadic placement of these action scenes ensures that they are all the more impacting than if they were to occur more frequently. One scene where the man and his son sneak into a seemingly empty house and check out what's in the basement deserves to be called more than simply just disturbing. It is a really scary and suspenseful scene that becomes one of the film's highlights. Given that we know very little about both characters it is testimony to the fine performances of the actors that we care so much about them. Viggo Mortensen is superb in a highly complex role, one where he not only immerses himself into the physically rugged look of the character, but he is also required to contrast the touching affection for his son, with a much more savage and callous attitude to the strangers he meets. He is extremely skeptical of anyone he meets because of his experience with the dangers of the world. Kodi Smit-McPhee, from the Australian film Romulus My Father, is also particularly good, restrained and believable, particularly towards his innocence and the questions he asks. It is through these two performances that this very bleak and nihilistic film retains a level of humanity and strikes a powerful emotional cord.This is a film that really ponders at times and does not seem to have a completely developed arch for its youngest protagonist. Despite these issues with the narrative though, The Road is still worth seeing because it is such a visually and atmospherically defined experience, certain to be accentuated in quality on the silver screen. The richly suspenseful but infrequent action scenes, along with the smart performances, make this difficult and grim parable a fascinating journey for those who are willing to look deeper.",The Road
103,anselmdaniel,Beautiful and accurate adaptation,8,4 May 2019,"This review contains spoilers.The Road is a post-apocalyptic movie directed by John Hillcoat. The story is based on the novel 'The Road' written by Cormac McCarthy. The movie stars Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee as the father and the son. The man and his young son must navigate a dangerous post apocalyptic world that has suffered a global cataclysm. They must continue on to survival.'The Road' as a movie is an incredibly accurate adaptation to the book by Cormac McCarthy. The movie follows the same story events and portrays the events as they happen in the book. This absolutely works to the movie's benefit. The movie adapts the utterly bleak tone and themes from the book. This is greatly aided by the visuals that this movie provides. This movie reflects the dark tone of the book incredibly well and it really does show in the movie's direction.Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee portray their characters incredibly well. The two leads portray a wide range of emotion that is expected from dramas of this scale. This works to the movie's benefit as so much of it depended on the actor's delivery. This movie really tested the cast. The acting performances. In this mone are great.This movie's cinematography and direction are absolutely unrelenting.

104,ThurstonHunger,Child Custody...,4,12 June 2010,"I had read the book, and remain much more of a ""Blood Meridian"" man. McCarthy, always a macho writer...yet an amazing one, goes full-bore for gore, but the book had this odd kernel of hope in reaching the sea, that the film adopts more slowly/subtly.For what it's worth...http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4387419 Anyways, I'm glad I didn't go see this on the big screen, the CGI looked dated on arrival, and as magnetic as Mortenson is, the bond between father and son to me was stronger in the book. I don't really recall the wife much in the book, if at all.And having read the book, while watching the film I felt like I was pushing past tombstone milestones, tracing my steps through the gruesome trek again. Although the Coca Cola ad was not in the book.Suddenly about 2/3 of the way through, the movie came across as something else; something less grandiose and reeking of Armageddon. Instead I felt it was a more personal apocalypse, obviously in parable form, of a father who is divorced from his wife, and he desperately wants to retain custody of their only son. Like overhearing a confession of someone else...Is Duvall's character not a flash-forward to the Father's character himself, with typical mythical blind-can-see insight, seeing himself having lost the son. Pushed him away...destroyed him...we're note sure...but it is a story Duvall cannot tell, to himself, and most of all to his younger self Mortenson.Yeah, I know it's a stretch...But watching a child in jeopardy is hard enough for me at a busy intersection in the real world, much less throwing him to the mercenaries, cannibals, and maniacs in the reel one.So back to my pre-Father's day fantasy interpretation, Mortenson's character desperately wants to keep his son close to him and ""safe"" but gradually the world turns terminally unsafe, and even the ""good"" guys must be repulsed, until all the bitterness from the poisoned marriage finally takes the Father...and the son must be restored to a couple who have avoided divorce.Like I said, I know it's a stretch, I guess it was just my mind's self-preservation mechanism kicking in. To me, if you read this book, you don't need to see this movie...and if you didn't read the book, you can still skip this movie. Even if you are a Nick Cave and Warren Ellis (Dirty Three!!) fan, it's not really worth it...their contributions are quite subtle.Now Cave's movie ""The Proposition"" directed by the same man who directed this, that's a movie to see in the stead of this one in my opinion.",The Road
105,nathanmanson,"I hate that kid so much, oh my god!",4,10 December 2020,"I've never experienced i more annoying kid in a film before. I literally hate him, I know hate is a strong word but I absolutely HATE him. You think growing up in an apocalypse you'd be Abit more thick skinned. Why didn't they just stay in that shelter they found with all the food. Where was they planning on going, like they kept on going and going but what was the plan, they literally never said what the plan was. There was a lot of pointless scenes that weren't needed in the film. They also missed out key scenes, like why didn't they show what he got up to on the boat he swam to. How did they get away with it at the start when they were surrounded by all them guys with fire torches. It was literally the definition of a whole lot of nothing. Also at the end when that guy approached the kid am I the only one who would've shot that guy and took his gun. I would have never have trusted him. The entire film his dad taught him not to trust anyone then the first guy he sees, he befriends him. The only reason this gets a 4 is because the acting from Viggo was outstanding. Also it was very realistic, like If there was actually an apocalypse that's exactly what it would be like people eating eachother. I also found it quite funny how the kid is such a bad actor he couldn't even cry. I bet Viggo was getting well frustrated with him.",The Road
106,mfellipecampos,Nice,6,30 June 2021,"The film is good, not one of the thousand wonders, but it pleases the vast majority of people, and especially those who read the synopsis and already know what to expect from it, the story of a father and his son, and everything that the first one has to face to guarantee the life of the second. For some, the film has no plot, but they are, very much, wrong.The plot is precisely the change of characters, their evolution, the story is not based on how the world ""ended"" nor on a place where the world still ""is the same"" today. The plot is precisely the path itself, even the destination of the journey is simple, they don't want to go to paradise, they just want to go south looking for a less inhospitable climate.Anyway, a great movie with regards to showing how far a father can go to protect his child, and also demonstrates the relationship of the two with each other in circumstances of life and death in a splendid way. A great performance by Viggo Mortensen, who manages, in this film, to really move the viewer. As well as great direction and photography work.Film viewed on June 30, 2021.",The Road

108,asda-man,I would've liked more of a valley,6,29 August 2011,"I thought ""The Road"" was going to be a love it or hate it film, but in fact, I think it was just OK. It has strengths and a couple of weaknesses but is overall a very well-made film with characters who we can care about and admire. It's not a horror film but more of a horrific drama. Unfortunately there wasn't enough element of horror for me.It opens with Viggo (is that really a name?) giving us a Jo Brand style dead-pan narration of what's going on over shots of a completely barren land with a grey sky and dark saturated colours. This basically sums up ""The Road"". It does look beautiful (in the nicest possible way :S). The visuals are startling and very impressive, and some of the cinematography is really beautifully done. In fact, the whole film is directed very competently with an atmosphere drenched with dread but already running at a fairly long running time of 110mins I could've easily watched 30 minutes more, because it went very quickly and just didn't feel as epic as it could've been.I also think that it wasn't depressing enough, I know that might sound mental but it did seem quite hopeful in the way the father and son still loved each other. The moment where they find the stash of food is one of the happiest moments I've ever seen which is OK, but it should've been much more depressing. The synopsis says that they stay clear of cannibals. Obviously I wasn't expecting ""Wrong Turn"" or ""The Hills Have Eyes"" because otherwise the title for ""The Road"" would've been written in a bold typography, instead of a subtle times new roman, however, I would've liked to have seen more danger in there lives. I wanted to see them be captured by the cannibals and try to escape, it should've been more horrific and intense.Also just an after-thought here but why was Guy Pearce on the billing when he was in it for about 1 minute at the end? Yet, the person who played the boy doesn't even get a mention? Doesn't make sense to me but anyway, the performances from Viggo (sorry I just can't stop laughing at that name) and Kodi (not much better) were quite good and enjoyable. The film happily bobbles along at its own slow pace, which did suit it by the way, making it enjoyable but I didn't drool over it.I would probably watch ""The Road"" again if I was drunk enough, but I'm not going to watch it religiously. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't boring (it couldn't of been if I wanted more!) But it could've been more exciting. However ""The Road"" is a very sweet film with capable performances an impressive atmosphere and beautiful directing. It's worth a watch.",The Road
109,Rickting,Material which shouldn't have been adapted but it's well done,6,8 December 2014,"The Road is one powerful book, written brilliantly by Cormac McCarthy. It's about a father and son walking through post apocalyptic America and explores their bond when all else is lost. Due to the unconventional style of the prose, it's not a hugely filmable book but it still got adapted. This is a decent but boring adaptation. Starting with the positives, Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee are excellent as the two main characters. The father is a very interesting character, but Smit-McPhee steals the show as the boy, providing one of the best child actor performances of recent times. John Hillcoat's direction is suitably bleak and haunting, and the landscapes are atmospheric and haunting. It's got a decent and faithful script, and it goes into some of the darkness of the book. The Road is a deep story with many very powerful themes, and this adaptation brings some though not all of them to life.The truth is, The Road just doesn't work brilliantly as a film. It feels disconnected and incoherent as it simply jumps from scene to scene. It's also a fairly dull movie as nothing much is really happening most of the time. It is powerful in a certain way, but it's too drained and depressing to actually want to engage much in. It's just a big, monotonous slog through endless grey landscapes without a hint of warmth or hope. This was brought to life to great effect by McCarthy but as a film it just doesn't work. At the same time, the father and son relationship can feel a bit too warm and although this flaw is fixed in the second half it feels somewhat cowardly and an attempt to appeal to more audience members, although the film's commitment to the book is admirable. A big of a trudge through miserable post apocalyptic imagery overall. Quite moving and sad but just not enjoyable. Definitely not for everyone.6/10",The Road
110,dragokin,we're on a road to nowhere,1,24 August 2013,"I was amazed to learn that there was actually a book behind the script for The Road. How much effort must be invested to write something that can be transfered into two hours of idle running?As we follow Viggo Mortensen and his son there is not much to be noticed. Oh, i almost forgot, Charlize Theron was there briefly. However, it is not clear how long have these guys been on the road. I might have failed to notice this detail, but it seemed as if they've been wandering for years. But even with danger that lurks in post-apocalyptic world it shouldn't take more than a couple of months for the task.An interesting detail is the supermarket cart they are pushing around. How well built must it be, when it doesn't break although Viggo Mrotensen pushes it over all kind of terrain for months or even years.My issue with this movie is not it's corny post-apocalyptic vision but rather the praise it gets.",The Road
111,bregund,A film should stand on its own merit,5,7 September 2013,"Someone on the message board for this film chastised me about my negative reaction to The Road. I'm paraphrasing here: ""you have to read the book..blah blah blah."" I have no idea what the book is like since I've never read it, but a film should stand on its own without requiring someone to read the book it's based on. For example, all of the Harry Potter films are noisy, watchable nonsense that are somehow stitched into something resembling a story, but you have the feeling that you got what you paid for. I didn't feel this way about The Road, which borrows heavily from almost every post-apocalyptic film you've ever seen, with the added benefit of borrowing liberally from horror film standards. For example, if there is a long, placid scene where the characters are comfortable, laughing and talking, something awful suddenly happens. This standard horror film segue occurs about twenty times in this film. Like an idiot, I went into this film expecting an original story, but I suppose Viggo Mortensen caring for a mopey, androgynous child may qualify after all.A lot of things don't add up: in a world of cannibals, the old, blind man would never have survived that long. The androgynous kid sleeps so soundly that the thief is able to steal everything they own. A beetle somehow survives the apocalypse, when all of its food sources have been dead for years. The apocalypse itself is never shown or explained. The creepy hillbilly family suddenly pops up out of nowhere, and the mother hungrily eyes the androgynous kid and explains that they've been following him, I guess waiting for a moment when they could swoop in and harvest him/her. The people in the basement make no effort to escape when given the opportunity. The androgynous kid was just grazed by the bullet, but he/she is unable to walk, forcing Viggo to carry him/her through the woods, slowing them down. They could have stayed in the shelter for weeks, maybe months, where it would have been safe. The apparently retarded boy runs away instead of talking to the androgynous kid. Would it not have made more sense for both families to team up on the road if they were intent on survival? Nothing about this film makes any sense. On top of all that, we are treated to a cinematic first: terrifying falling trees, threatening to wipe out the last vestiges of humanity by falling on them.This film could have been so much better, and could have made an effective statement about environmental responsibility, but you can't have a willing suspension of disbelief when forced to accept bad acting (the androgynous kid) and a mountain of improbabilities. The only good things about this film are the performances of Viggo Mortensen and Robert Duvall.",The Road
112,osj2507,This is not a movie that lifts your spirits,7,25 December 2015,"It is the story and the acting that is brought out in this movie and in a big way. The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, where survival is hard and it's more or less every man for himself.I'm not sure what the big scheme is or what the producer wanted to say with this flick, but it's a very interesting view of a decaying world. The lack of food, sleep and human contact makes everyone paranoid, are they being followed, is someone trying to steal there food and supplies and will they be able to survive for months, weeks or only days.It's a dark movie on a dark path or road, not a lot of happy moments, but they do feel happy about the small things in life. They learn to survive and take care of themselves, the road is long, dark and not very pleasant,The father role played by Viggo Mortensen is very good and the acting of Kodi Smit- McPhee as the son is also very compelling. Actually all the roles played by the actors are good, Robert Duvall, Charlize Theron and Guy Pearce have some of the more significant roles, but all have their special ways and all are very into their roles and thereby giving the characters the right look and feel.",The Road
113,ClaytonDavis,Viggo Walks a Mean Road...,6,4 December 2009,"In the wake of the collapse of humanity and the world's treacherous state, John Hillcoat directs Cormac McCarthy's post-apocalyptic novel, The Road starring Academy Award Nominee Viggo Mortensen and newcomer Kodi Smit-McPhee.The film tells the story of ""Man"" and ""Boy,"" a father and son traveling southward to the coast in hopes of finding refuge from the dangerous, crumbling society that has become our planet.While the film inhabits a sort of originality with the silver tone and dark nature, The Road provides no ""fire"" for hope, which can be off-putting to some, and leaves a vacancy that is extremely discomforting. Cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe provides stunning work here. The suspense and anticipation succeeds because of Aguirresarobe's first person-like view. The viewer feels as if we're living in hell on earth. Hillcoat's direction and artistic choices are bold, but lacks certain concentration. The film focuses on despair for the near entirety of the picture which leaves the viewer merciless and callous, two feelings that are both uneasy.Viggo Mortensen as ""Man"" gives an astonishing performance, in other words, his best performance to date. Mortensen deserves real Oscar attention as he has never given more of himself to a role or pack more tenderness in his words. Mortensen is vulnerable and will render you speechless. Kodi Smit-McPhee as ""Boy"" gives a conventional performance but lacks an unevenness that allows him to soar. Not every child actor can hit out of the park the first time out. Mortensen looks to swallow him and overshadow any attempts at a viewer connection. Oscar Winner Charlize Theron as ""Woman"" is brief but allows for an exceptional and devastating performance. Theron remains to impress Hollywood as she ventures out in different and more difficult roles. Oscar Winner Robert Duvall, besides Mortensen, is the most memorable and tender performance. Duvall in five minutes gives a master-class on acting.The narrative, in terms of adaptation, is merely invisible. It's Mortensen that elevates the material but with a disappointing finale, The Road only remains average as a film. Nick Cave and Warren Ellis provide a brilliant score in same realm as their work in Sean Penn's Into the Wild.Depending on your outlook of humanity at this point, The Road's haunting portrayal is a bit bleak but passable.**½/****",The Road
114,Al_The_Strange,"""We have to just...keep carrying the fire.""",8,29 June 2013,"When the end of the world comes, it won't be a pretty or happy affair. Most films generally harp on the violence and brutality of the apocalypse, but The Road should stand as one of the most delicate and disquieting apocalypse films to date. There isn't much action to this; it's all about a man struggling to protect his son, while they trek across an ash-laden wasteland. There are occasional moments of suspense and thrills, following a few bad run-ins with cannibalistic gangs, but most of the film is about the journey and the everyday hardships.This film is a faithful adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's influential novel; the plot and characters are generally spot-on, but the film definitely excels with the novel's tone, for it is appropriately dark, grim, emotional, and delicate. I felt the book was a grade more disquieting, especially with the chemistry between the characters (something that's probably better achieved in writing than in film). The overall portrayal of the apocalypse is a uniquely depressing vision, showing a world completely drenched in ashes and grayness. The plot can be rather random, as it goes from one random encounter to another, and with occasional flashbacks thrown in. Conflict is never consistent, making some scenes more gripping or interesting than others. Characters are full of life and easy to relate to.This film uses good and steady photography, and decent editing. Much of the film is captured with a drab, gray color scheme, making it appropriately dark and murky. Acting is not bad: Viggo Mortensen does his best to give his character heart and soul. Writing is good. All the film's sets, props, costumes, and special effects are good without being overblown. Music is really elegant too.Even though this film isn't as exciting as most other films of the genre, it is easily the most earnest and heartfelt of the post-apocalypse genre. It is a decent adaptation of a decent novel.Recommended.4/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Good)",The Road

Again, bleak sound to match the story. Still an interesting and dynamic mix. This reminded me so much of the video game series Fallout. It has similar themes and reminiscent ideas. It is a sad movie and sometimes quite brutal. It doesn't have the same impact as some other post-nuclear attack movies but this is the best focused human story. Sometimes I didn't believe the world they were in but overall it was very good. It is not a plot but more a series of characters and locations. A tough film to watch but it is quite rewarding.",The Road
116,moviemanMA,Out of desperation comes inspiration,8,31 December 2009,"What happens if the human race doesn't survive?This is the situation presented by John Hillcoat in his adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel The Road. We follow Viggo Mortensen as a wandering man looking after his boy. They go from town to town hiding from ""the bad guys"" and trying to scavenge what little food is left. The world is nearly dead. The skies are grey, the air is cold, and virtually all life has become extinct with the exception of humans. This has driven people into two societies: those who scavenge and wander, and those who eat the other people. It's like a zombie movie where the zombies are real people.Mortensen, whose characters bares no name, is a man haunted by the memory of his wife while struggling to keep both him and his son safe from roaming gangs of cannibals. Their lives are filled with fear, not knowing whether of not they will be captured. Mortensen carries with him a revolver with two shots. To those he encounters it is a reminder that he will do whatever it takes to survive. To himself it is a reminder that he cannot let any harm come to the boy, even if it means taking their lives before others do.This was an interesting film to watch just a few days after Christmas. This is really a depressing film with a bleak look at what the world would be without law and order. Still, through the bleak and dreary story come some powerful images and fantastic storytelling from Hillcoat, whose previous film The Proposition had a similar gritty and dreary look to it. He makes his characters in both films dirty and weary, enough to make you almost uncomfortable, but there is a certain dignity about them. They carry themselves with confidence, whether real or just a facade, that turn them into heroes.Helping out Hillcoat tell this story are Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, two music composers who scored The Proposition as well as a brilliant score for The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. They create somber tones that echo the mood of the story. Their scores are simple, elegant, and help set up and shape each scene.I wasn't sure what exactly to expect going into this one. I knew that this wouldn't be the feel good movie of the year, but I wasn't sure if I would feel anything at all. It's good to be wrong some times. The father/son relationship between Mortensen and his boy played by Kodi Smit-McPhee is very strong. They feed off of each other nicely and neither tries to outdo the other. It's obvious Mortensen is the focus for most of the action, but a lot of the in between moments I was focused on McPhee.The Road was a pleasant (though depressing) surprise. I enjoyed the small roles by Robert Duvall, Guy Pierce, and Charlize Theron. Although this movie will most likely get overlooked during award season, I would not be surprised to see a few technical award nominations handed out for music, cinematography (Javier Aguirresarobe was recognized for his photography by the San Diego Critics Circle already), makeup, and art/production design.

Viggo Mortensen was absolutely fantastic as the protective father who would do anything to save his son in the midst of the most horrific downfall of man. An apocalyptic event which renders all animals and other natural levels nearly extinct, albeit for man who wanders the landscapes searching for food or other means of survival. If there was a series other than SURVIVOR based on this film, not one person would actually be able to do it. This had real grit, and raw naked violence to some who fell to the cannibals. This does show how far man is willing to go to keep on living no matter the consequences in the process. Robert Duvall had a great role as the Old Man, who had an invitation by Viggo's character. To show that some still had the moralistic value to offer a hand in the face of imminent death. And his Son, (Kodi Mcphee) the real hero who saw in specific people, true honesty. His ability to observe and discern an outcome even though his father was adamant about not helping others. This is a really good film about value, about friendship, and about family. In this day and age, most of this has become lost in one way or the other. Yet it is the kids who can see it more through the distrust of adults, and oblivious ignorance for survival.

In an apocalyptic world, a father would do anything to make sure his son survive. It's a story of hardships and love. With that said, it's really depressing, slow and pointless. The whole point of survival is to get into safety. We don't know what caused the world to end nor do we know where or even if there's a safe place out there. The idea is to go as south as possible. During the entire movie their goal was to reach the sea but once they got there, there was nothing. So what's the point? If you can't stay with your loved ones and you can't get to a safe place then there's just meaningless hope for an unknown something. Seems like the mother was right. What's the point of all the suffering if you eventually going to die either by starvation, bad people or disease? The movie ends with some hope but it seems unlikely that anyone can have a happy ending in whatever was left of the world.I love survival movies but if there's no safe place to reach to (or at least a reunion with someone you love) then it kinda defeats the point, doesn't it? I watched and loved survival movies in which no one survived at the end, but at least they tried, they had a goal.

What would happen if we were subject to something as horrendous as post-nuclear devastation? It is never really spelled out in this movie that that is the circumstance though a lot points to it. That is the way I interpret it and for that I am sincerely in awe at its ability to convince.My wife could not watch it. And I had to take a break in the middle of it but in the end I was more than happy to have been seen it.

122,TwistedContent,Worthy and Beautiful Adaptation,8,16 April 2020,"The last time I watched ""The Road"" was, perhaps, back in 2013. Due for a re-watch, right? The real reason though for this re-watch is the novel it's based on. In these strange times of quarantine the cup of free time is continuously overflowing, so I figured it's a great time to get back to reading, and my first choice happened to be Cormac McCarthy's ""The Road"". I'm glad to say there's enjoyment to be had in both.Cormac McCarthy, also known for ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""Blood Meridian"", presents a tale of true gloom, despair, harsh humanism and survival. The world is burnt, the sun never shines, nights are nothing but impenetrable darkness, everything's in smoke and ashes, animals, plants and most of humanity are all dead. In these lands nobody trusts nobody. We join in for a gripping journey with Man and Boy, a father and son, making their way to the coast in search of hope. On their way, Man and Boy encounter fear, hunger, sickness, empty shells of human beings, cannibals, but also some goodness, hope and love amongst them. Story and atmosphere wise, naturally, the novel is broader, more atmospheric, heavy on heart and gloomy as it is often the best at what it does in moments when and where nothing really happens. It's a poetic and dirty journey alright. The movie, on the other hand, remains faithful to a great extent - all the pivotal points, all the action has been kept intact albeit mixed up in sequence a little bit. While that's important and commendable, in comparison with the book it now feels a little choppier and almost too fast, despite it being an actual slow-burner. From this viewpoint, I think they could've easiily went with 2 hour runtime. Both book and movie has one great thing in common though - both are so silent and subtle yet harrowing depictions of apocalypse in its full, dreadful glory - both, in a little varied degrees, have managed to not miss on that which is one of their main powers.Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee transition the characters of Man and Boy just beautifully, the performances are fully invested and are of the crown jewels of this screen adaptation. The rest of roles are much smaller, by a huge margin actually, yet they have filled them with familiar faces and great portrayals, even if they are just momentary. Props also go out to the cinematographer and everyone who stood behind the production design, because, in my opinion, they've done a great job in depicting the ashen lands, the incredibly gray and gloomy landscapes, and the absence of all living things. Many compliment ""The Road"" on being on the level of such bleakness that Hollywood rarely dares for, I agree, it's a dark journey that can get depressive, but it does offer a portion of ultimate redemption, in both the book and the movie. Eleven years later, I'd like to believe that Hollywood has dared to step in that mud we all like and left one leg in there, although I'd say it's not enough yet.Whenever the combination of words like post-apocalyptic come up, I'm sure I'll remember ""The Road"", both of them. As far as screen adaptations go, this is a great one, which redeems what it loses in transition with other elements, like Viggo Mortensen's raw performance. My rating: 8/10.",The Road
123,avik-basu1889,A father's love for his son in the face of hopeless adversity !!!!,8,11 May 2015,"I have always been a sucker for artistic works dealing with a post- apocalyptic world. The whole aspect of living being replaced by surviving is something that has always fascinated me. Many films have been made staged in a post-apocalyptic environment and when they are done well, they can be breathtakingly good(does anyone remember Children of Men?).The Road is another one of those films that take place in a post- apocalyptic world, but we are never really informed or given any sort of hints about what exactly happened that destroyed the world as we know it now and killed all animals and crops and brought about the apocalypse. The film starts off very quickly. We see some beautiful,bright shots of trees and flowers and then the symbolic door gets shut and the next scene dives right into the start of the apocalypse and then we see the current world with Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee's company. We see how desolate, grim, scary and barren the post-apocalyptic world looks. This quick sequence to show the contrasting nature of the environment and the surroundings between the pre-apocalyptic and the post-apocalyptic worlds reminded me a great deal of the initial scenes in Tarkovsky's classic ""Ivan's Childhood"". The production design of the film is quite good. I know that a major portion of the surroundings are created through green screens, but it is still convincing. The screenplay written by Joe Penhall which is based on the novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy is well written and has multiple themes running through it. There is a consistent dilemma of having to choose between a life which involves nothing but relentless struggle with the prospect of being eaten alive due to rising cannibalism and the prospect of suicide. The director uses quieter, relatively uneventful scenes to develop the characters of the ""Father"" and the ""Son"". The son I think holds the moral compass of the storyline. During their infinite struggles and their journeys, the mature pragmatism of the father which at times becomes inhuman and quite understandably so gets beautifully balanced by the innocent optimism of the son. The son ensures that the father doesn't completely forget his humane and ethical responsibilities. Viewers familiar with Hindu mythology might also be able to find certain similarities in the storyline with the birth of Lord Krishna and Krishna's father Vasudeva's sacrifices in the face of great calamities to ensure Krishna survived.The style of storytelling is good and reminded me of ""The Walking Dead"". The acting is good too. Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee pretty much carry the movie on their shoulders. Charlize Theron has a guest role as the mother during the flashback sequences (which are in bright colours while the cinematography in all other scenes is very grim and dark). I also loved the performance of Robert Duvall who also has a guest role.The film's ending is a bit cheesy from a storyline point of view, although it still works in a thematic sense. The Road uses a barren, desolate post-apocalyptic world to symbolically portray the fears many of us have of the future that might await all of us after pollution and global warming takes full effect. The film also artistically raises the sad prospect of bringing kids to a world where they have to grow up under harsh, inhuman conditions.",The Road
124,TheEmulator23,Absolutely beautiful cinematography.,6,23 July 2010,"I didn't love this film, but it sure as heck deserved more Box Office than the $8 million it did in North America. What I loved more than anything was how absolutely beautiful it was to watch. The dark Palette that is the film really added to a pretty decent story. Viggo Mortensen (as always) helped elevate an OK film to a little better than OK. I'm always saddened when a quality film does such little Box Office, when such other garbage like the ""Step-Up"" movies & ""You Got Served"" just to name a couple examples, does 5-10 times that number. I thought the little kid did a pretty good job as well. What this reminded my somewhat of was the plot of the mediocre at best ""The Book of Eli."" Although this had less than a third of the budget of ""Eli,"" this was the better looking film. If you enjoy post-apocalyptic type movies, then you are sure to enjoy this film. If that is not your cup of tea, you'll probably still enjoy it, but maybe not quite as much.",The Road

127,markgorman,So near and yet so far.,8,21 January 2010,"The (London) Times' critics voted this the greatest novel of the 21st century, so far. I, personally, would go back considerably further because in my opinion there is not a word out of place in Cormac McCarthy's paean to fatherly love.The book is defined by the relationship between the unnamed father and son who take to the road upon losing their wife and mother in the wake of an unnamed global catastrophe. (war or environmental catastrophe? You decide, although director, John Hillcoat, strongly leans us in the direction of the latter in his movie.In fact the movie is also a paean. This time to the novel itself with great tracts of dialogue lifted straight off the page and into the screenplay. This is not laziness. It is common sense.In most respects I loved this movie; partly because of its stance and conviction in retaining the integrity of a bleak and harrowing novel; so it's no surprise that the Weinstein's are behind it.I won't remind you of the story, if you don't know it you're probably not in the market to see it. If you are and you've read the book you have a very difficult decision to make. To fore go it on that basis that perfection in prose cannot be matched on screen or to approach with an open mind assuming that it will fall short of the novel's greatness but tell a wonderfully simple tale affectingly.Well, if, like me, you take the latter view you will be in for a treat but one that does indeed fail to reach the novel's great heights? Why is that? I think it can be explained in one respect. The relationship between father (Viggo Mortenson) and son (Kodi-Smitt McPhee) falls some way short of what was needed to make the film sparkle. and interestingly it's Mortnenson's fault, not the boy's. Actually it's Hillcoat's. He makes an inexplicable decisions to omit a scene from the book that defined the relationship. When the son runs off to find a little boy he spots in a disused building the father is frantic with fear. Not so in the movie. And actually, although structurally this is a missing link it's actually in the performance of Mortensson that I felt the whole film fell short.In the book he is a much more caring and vulnerable soul. On screen Mortenson makes him cold, calculated, hard and emotionally elusive.It creates a barrier that means the whole movie goes the same way, so much so that I was unmoved at the climax.There is an astonishing performance in this movie; it's by Robert Duvall as an aged wanderer that the father and son chance upon. and McPhee is remarkable too. It's not that Mortenson is not a great actor and fails§ to deliver, it's just that the direction he receives moves him away from the level of sympathy that I expected and consequently it leaves an emotional hole at the heart of the movie.I suspect that is why it has failed to garner the critical awards one might expect for such an excellent piece of work overall.The cinematography is quite beautiful, albeit bleak and Nick Cave and Warren Ellis's score never intrudes. Hats off to them for reigning it in.I just wish Mortenson had not followed suit.",The Road
128,Ramascreen,A Faithful Adaptation,10,26 November 2009,"-- Rama's SCREEN --THE ROAD is a faithful adaptation. As a hardcore fan of the great book by author Cormac McCarthy, I am satisfied. But even if I didn't read the book, I'd still say director John Hillcoat's adaptation is a chilling and beautiful journey filled with anguish and strength of the human spirit and love of a father. The gray dusty skies and the ugly desolate wasteland that Hillcoat visualizes are pitch-perfect. Viggo Mortensen is riveting, another Oscar worthy performance by an actor who can disappear in his character. The same outstanding praise can be said for Kodi Smit McPhee, Robert Duvall, even Michael K. WilliamsI entered the cinema with an open mind, like I've never read the book before and I was not disappointed. The CG visual of the post-apocalyptic world itself would leave you in awe. There are no zombies or mutants, this is not a Roland Emmerich's film where everything literally goes into epileptic shock. With THE ROAD, director Hillcoat wants you to feel the despair all around you just by looking at the bleak littered environment of a dying planet where animals can't survive, even trees are falling down all by themselves like a balding head. It's father and son, or as the book says, a man and a boy, walking on what seems to be an endless road, from one abandoned place to another in search of food and shelter. The man wants them to reach South, to reach the coast, but it's not because there's a safe haven there, I think it's more because he understands that one of the keys to survival is to have something to look forward to, in this case, a destination. But even after that point, he knows they'd have to keep on going again.Great music by composers Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, the same team behind the score for The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford. I'd just like to take the time to point that out because even if THE ROAD doesn't have a specific catchy theme music that stands out and sticks with you, each tune carries a fateful harmony to the harrowing, vehement travel that the father and son have to endure. When danger is upon them, the heart starts pumping, the beat is rushing and when it's time to behold the wonder and hypnotic beauty that strangely appear out of the harsh conditions, the solemn tunes offer solitude and assurance.Director Hillcoat may seem to put too much emphasis on the flashbacks, the background story of the wife, the mother of the boy. But I think it's an essential part only because the movie gives you different types of people and their reactions when they're cornered, the choice to give in, give up or survive and the different ways they'd do just to survive.Some would strive, some would steal, some put their trust on strangers and some would resort to cannibalism. It's not showing us how the end of the world happens, it's about what happens after and all the effect, whether it's good or bad, that it has on the remainder. But this isn't The Postman or Waterworld, there's no one man trying to topple a dictator.Can we be helpful to others when we don't have much to give? When the only thing we got left is our only chance for living? When it comes down to it, is it an eye for an eye or is there room left for compassion? Those are some of the questions THE ROAD tries to tackle as the kid starts to see that his father can't seem to tell the difference anymore but little does he know that the father is insistent on preparing the kid to survive on his own after he's dead.I can't say enough about Viggo Mortensen, there's something about Mortensen's face or presence in this movie that indicates a man willing to do whatever it takes to protect his son. There's a certain intensity that radiates from Mortensen, the kind that catches your attention and doesn't let go. His dedication to his character, even losing drastic weight and looking like a complete hobo will earn your respect but his final moments at the beach is what will not only break your hear but place Mortensen as one of the most deeply affecting actors of our time. The caliber Robert Duvall gives an equally great performance, which is to be expected when you're dealing with a master of the art of acting like Duvall. Michael K. Williams who plays The Thief leaves a haunting, heart-wrenching impression, for just those few minutes, he manages to go straight for the jugular.THE ROAD is a must-see film not only because it stays true to the original material. I'm glad director Hillcoat doesn't tone down the gore, the fright and the heartless natural conditions. But THE ROAD is a must-see film also because its message of the meaningless of materialism speaks louder than words or actions. Seeing two people scraping every last bit of food they can find and scavenging through metals sheets and garbage while other people being hunted down for their flesh will give you an appreciation for what you already have in life especially your relationships. It's so easy to half wish Mortensen would just be putting a bullet in his son's head so he can be traveling alone with pressure or anything holding him back but his son is his only reason for traveling. As the story progresses, you see him able to sometimes let go of the cart full of food or let go of his past and the memory of his wife, in order to ensure the safety of his son. Life doesn't get more significant the one depicted in THE ROAD.-- Rama's SCREEN --",The Road
129,coldwaterpdh,In a word- depressing.,4,9 October 2010,"Watched ""The Road"" the other night on-demand. I heard a lot about this film and the book which it is based on, written by the same guy who wrote ""No Country For Old Men."" I was surprised at how 'well' this movie was done, production-wise; appears from the outside to be indie greatness, but upon further inspection, is a big budget Hollywood garbage flick. It leaves a lot to the viewers' imagination in terms of 'how did we get to this point,' but it does manage to answer a few questions (even if said answers make no sense) via these little flashbacks.The tale is quite grim and definitely not for children. I'd classify this as a realistic horror flick of the gloomiest kind. It shows the dark and evil nature of humanity the same way ""No Country"" did but with sort of an action-like spin on things.Viggo Mortensen shines as usual in a starring role that will make your heart melt. The kid was great and the cameos by Duvall and Pearce are fantastic.Set in a world which is imaginable, but hopefully not coming our way EVER, ""The Road"" is a scary, thrilling romp but ultimately a little too nihilistic in it's approach to the human spirit.Now that I've pointed out some good things, here comes the bad. The writing. The writing. The writing. The father, a whiny, sappy, wuss does everything he can to shelter his son from this evil world which the boy has been brought into, and we can't help but want to kill this man for doing so, as he is doing this kid the largest disservice he could possibly do. Even later, when he attempts to 'teach his son a hard lesson,' he makes the wrong decision by disrobing a man and leaving him to die because he is a thief. At least the kid still has a heart. When father and son stumble upon a miraculously untouched bomb shelter stocked full of food and supplies, they LEAVE within a few days. Why? Instead of leaving their cabin in the woods, the family stayed for what appears to be years until the mother commits suicide and the father and son are basically FORCED to take to the road. Why didn't they leave sooner?Too many questions, too much Hollywood typicality, too much weeping and crying, too many holes, and most of all not enough balls for a movie of this type. 4 out of 10, kids.",The Road
130,gary-444,Arty Tedium,3,24 January 2010,"I have not read the eponymous book ,and approached the film wanting to like it, but was left desperately disappointed. The one hour 51 minute running time contains a handful of dramatic events, and a morass of maudlin, cod- pretentious musings which become increasingly preposterous as the tale wears on. The Coen's cinematic realisation of author McCarthey's ""No Country for Old Men"" was portentous, elegiac ,and had a brooding grandeur. This simply finds a groove, and stays there. There is literally no light and shade , with Director John Hillcoat failing to find more than one gear throughout. The Coen's like people and dialogue, Hillcoat doesn't.Played as largely a father and son two hander ,starring Vigo Mortensen and Kodi Smith- McPhee respectively, some worthwhile themes are well explored. The post apocalyptic physical landscape is realistically presented, and the agonies of a father trying to teach and maintain humanity in a brutal landscape starkly depicted.Some of the trailers for this movie tried to tap into the ""Survivor"" genre explored in the ""Mad Max"" series, ""Omega man / I am Legend"", ""28 days Later"" etc. But in truth it does not belong there. Intriguingly, last years ""Carriers"" covered similar ground, with a less august story and much smaller budget, and was more satisfying.Although there is much that is worthy here , it is totally undone by a truly awful ending. After 110 minutes of unremitting gloom we have a happy surrogate family to make everything better.I was hoping that they would eat the boy! Although all this pretty much flies in the face of the Critics gushing praise I can only call it as I saw it. Tellingly, the cinema I saw it in,eleven days into the run, had only seven people in it for a Sunday afternoon showing, the viewing public appear to be voting with their feet.",The Road

A father & his nine year old son (names are never given here)are trying to survive what seems to be a post Apocalyptic dystopia of sorts (war?,natural disaster?),and have taken to traveling South to what could be a better chance of a life there. Problem is,they have to deal with scavengers,disease,roving bands of cannibals,and other horrors that no nine year old should ever be subjected to,never mind a full grown adult. Viggo Mortensen (the Lord of the Rings trilogy)is simply known as 'The Man',and new comer Kodi Smid McPhee is 'The Boy'. The cast is rounded out with some familiar faces (although not so recognizable under pounds of make up),(Robert Duvall as 'The Old Man',Australia's Guy Pearce as 'The Veteran',and Charleze Theron,as 'The Woman'). John Hillcoat directs from a script written by Joe Penhall,adapted (faithfully)by Cormac McCarthy. Major kudos to cinematographer,Javier Aguirresarobe for conveying the bleak, nearly colourless look to the ruined countryside (although flash backs are in full colour,with nice use of pastels). The film's rather sparse music score is by Nick Cave (of The Birthday Party & Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,fame)& Warren Ellis. This is a film that is NOT the feel good movie of the year (nor is it a contender for a successful date movie),but is a very well written,directed & acted one that should be seen by adults who prefer something to leave them thinking as they exit the cinema.

I was deeply moved by this little film about a boy and his father trying to survive in the post apocalyptic world, dealing with the problems which they encounter when they encounter other people (which can be enemies or friends). No other film better conveyed the feeling of hopeless present in a post-apocalyptic world than this one. A truly moving and powerful post apocalyptic film.Interesting that there aren't many true post-apocalyptic films.

2. Viggo Mortensen (Man), Charlize Theron (Woman) and Kodi Smit-McPhee (Boy) deliver terrific performances.
3. The sound-mixing is beautifully crisp which heightens the tension and suspense.
4. The costume and set design are incredible and they do an amazing job at creating a post-apocalyptic nightmare.
5. The violence and gore is unforgiving as well as encapsulating the ruthlessness and despondency of the new world.
6. The make-up is fantastic as the characters looked genuinely sick and wasting away.
7. The death of Man is handled deftly which allows for his death to be really emotional and impactful.
8. The score, when used appropriately, helped to paint a hopeless setting.Cons:
1. The score, on a few occasions, is overbearing and overused. It accidentally ends up cheapening the intimate moments.
2. The conclusion feels cheaply inserted to promote a light-hearted and hopeful ending, but it makes little sense and falls flat.
3. The back-drop of the green-screen is sometimes a bit obvious.",The Road
134,Ryan_MYeah,MYeah's review: The Road,6,30 May 2010,"Based on the book by Cormac McCarthy, the film centers on a Man (Played by Viggo Mortenson), and his son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) in a ravaged post-apocalyptic world, where trees burn, the air is cold, and snow turns to ash. The landscape is devastatingly gray and hopeless. The two must journey across a treacherous path to travel to the warmer South. All along the way facing dangers with only a pistol for protection, facing dangers such as mad, and frightening groups of cannibals.I don't know, It just went all over the place, but it's still alright.The story is probably one of the bigger problems. Don't get me wrong, it has potential, that first half of the film was breathtaking, but the second half really made the movie suffer a little. The pacing is another little problem. Sometimes it's great, sometimes it feels draggy. But the movie still isn't bad, it could have been better, but then again, it could have been A LOT worse.The performances are wonderful. Viggo Mortenson is great as the male lead (Although the sound mixer could've done a little better, as a lot of his lines are spoken in whispers). Kodi Smit-McPhee played a great role alongside him. And they are helped out by great cameos from Charlize Theron, Robert Duvall, and Guy Pearce.So, now I'm gonna talk about the techs of the film. I have to give major praise to DP Javier Aguirresarobe, and Production Designer Chris Kennedy, for making a harsh, bleak, and desolate wasteland almost devoid of Blues and Greens. Also praise to Makeup heads Toni G, and Geordie Sheffer for their work.So the film's story isn't really the strongest, but it has great lead performances, and amazing technical design.I give The Road **1/2 out of ****",The Road
135,Quebec_Dragon,The anti-Mad Max/2012: a very atypical apocalypse story,9,15 May 2011,"As you doubtless know, The Road is based on a Pullitzer-prize winning novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy. There's been some kind of apocalypse, causes unknown, and a father and young son try to survive on the road to an hypothetical better place. The movie is relentlessly grim, dour, somber, depressing and, well, add your favourite dark adjective. However, it's also quite good and fascinating provided you watch it not expecting spectacular action scenes. There are a few intense action scenes based on survival but they're quick, unheroic and unglamourous. Actually, it seemed often better to avoid or flee the dangers in this world. The Road didn't have any of that somewhat cool post-apocalyptic chic like the Mad Max movies for example. That being said, there are a few tiny glimmers of hope and we come to care about our father and son duo. It's one of the best father and son relationships I've seen on film.Viggo Mortensen as the father was simply amazing. This (probably) method actor went so far as to starve himself and dress up as a homeless man in public places to prepare for his role. I thought that when he removed his clothes and was so skinny, it was some kind of special digital effect trickery but apparently it was not. I thought at first the kid was too ""absent"" acting-wise but his restrained acting grew on me eventually. Someway, somehow, following the father and son in their normal daily life was pretty interesting. It was also quite interesting to see how the father dealt with each unforeseen problem in often unexpected yet logical fashion. The main threat comes from cannibalism (as the father tells us) and as a viewer I felt that omnipresent danger even though it was represented in sometimes subtle ways. It also made me think as to how most people would react in such extreme conditions. Who would cling to standard humanistic ideals? Deep down, who are we really? Is it even worth surviving in such a hopeless world?My only real criticism might come in the ending that seemed a bit too convenient. However, in hindsight, it brings the whole issue of trust to the foreground and if the father had acted differently before, listening to his son, perhaps things might have been different. The movie had some visions of times pre-apocalypse. The bright vivid colours in those made the current grim surroundings seem even more grey, brown and white than they already are. There were a few striking and static devastation ""tableaux"" but they were few and far between, and basically avoided action-wise. Don't watch the Road for action or spectacle, watch it for the simple yet troubling relationship story. I don't understand why this movie didn't get nominated for more awards although I understand quite well why it wasn't a box office success. It was just too grim and unconventional for mainstream audiences.Rating: 9 out of 10 (Great)",The Road
136,tburke85,The Road An Effective Apocalyptic Drama With Some Flaws,7,26 May 2010,"The Road is an effective apocalyptic drama with some flaws which I'll get into later from director John Hillcoat whose admirable in making this movie thats for the most part with a few exceptions CGI free. In the film everything is gray, destroyed, and decaying because of an unknown global cataclysm that changed the face of the world forever. Viggo Mortensen turns in a solid performance as The Man who goes on the road with his son trying desperately to survive by any means necessary. Mortensen brings a lot to his role and gives audiences a man who is willing to do anything even kill to protect his son. Kodi Smit-McPhee is equally impressive as The Son who must learn how to live in a world where everyday is a struggle to survive. I haven't seen him in anything prior to this but Kodi turns in a good performance none the less. Smit-McPhee and Mortensen also have great chemistry with each other making their father/son relationship very believable on the screen. Which I'm sure to the filmmakers was very important because most of their scenes are together. Well done. Charlize Theron has what amounts to a few extended appearances in flashbacks but she does what her role requires continuing to prove her talent as an actress. Robert DuVuall, Guy Pearce, Michael K. Williams, and Garret Dillahunt are effective in their roles that border on cameos but they aren't really developed because they're only on screen for a few minutes or less. I was actually kind of surprised at how little they were in the movie. Dillahunt shows up early on as a survivor only to be written out as quickly as he appeared. Duvuall makes an appearance in the second half as an old man who has dinner with the man and his son while on their journey south. Michael K. Smith arrives late in the second half as a crazed loner with a knife and he (like Duvuall, Pearce, and Theron) does what his role requires. Guy Pearce's role is like his part in The Hurt Locker except it's the exact opposite. He arrives very late into the third act instead of the beginning like The Hurt Locker and despite having little screen time Pearce still gives a good performance. The rest of the cast including the people who turned to cannibalism are decent in their small roles even with little to no dialog because most of the focus is on Mortensen and Smit-McPhee. The locations they chose for the movie were perfect because it really did look like the end of the world. The people involved in making this film did a great job of bringing this apocalyptic world to life. I thought choosing atmosphere and scenery over CGI was a wise choice because it made the situation the characters were in very real. There wasn't too much I didn't like about The Road. A slow pace at times and characters underused( Duvuall and Pearce to name a few) weighed the movie down a bit but the good outweighed the bad. So overall The Road despite having some flaws is a decent apocalyptic drama about the bond between a father and his son who try to survive in a desolate wasteland. If you're a big fan of the genre, than chances are you'll enjoy this movie. The Road has a compelling story, drama, and solid performances by the cast (Mortensen and Smit-McPhee) who make this depressing but well made film worth the time to watch.",The Road
137,ferdinand1932,Mad Max with a shopping cart,4,9 September 2010,"This movie missed its opportunities and it may stem from the book if the comments that it is faithful to the source material are accurate.The story has been told many times and its features are all well known: privations, marauding gangs, a fall and loss from everything that was good: family, love, warmth. In this space its possible to tell a story of two people on the road and suffering and also use metaphor to add a parallel level of meaning about humanity, existence, whatever. Probably the best instance of such a piece is ""Waiting for Godot"" and the reason it frustrates people who only understand what they are seeing; but the power of the play is the metaphor, the poetry, the humor which is another level to the work and the reason it endures although ""nothing happens twice"".Unfortunately ""The Road"" lacks that dimension and so it plays at one obvious level throughout, very simple and direct but progressively more clichés are added - things we know all too well from this genre - including the overly orange flashbacks to a happier time.Its lack of tonality and dullness plods footfall after footfall predictably. The actors are fine, given what they have, though the Boy's voice is still too suburban and well fed. Street children in Brazil and India are already worldly wise.",The Road

It seems that everything living has died due to some catastrophe except for some unfortunate human beings who wander the land and cities in search of the last can of coke or anything else that will pass for food. Even humans will do. Our two protagonists are making their way to the coast, why? No one knows or seems to care to tell the audience. Dad and the annoying little brat, who looks far too healthy to pass for an undernourished lad, sleep in abandoned cars and houses while they try to steer clear from fellow human survivors. This strategy oddly fails to work at all as they seem to be running into those fellow humans with almost clockwork precision. This despite the fact that almost everyone on the planet died. Between these scenes where they go to some place and then get scared away from it, the boy asks the father questions like: ""Are we the good guys daddy?"" at which point the father explains that they are, ad nauseam. And that's basically it. That is really all that will be repeated throughout the entirety of the film. No deeper thoughts on the meaning of life, no interesting philosophies, no mentionable plot turns, just this same vacuous scene over and over again until they make it to the coast. The father dies and the kid is taken in by a surviving family who very conveniently wandered by at that very moment. The End.I really don't know, but shouldn't there be some entertainment value to a film? Some sense of momentum or an interesting point to make.

139,paudie,How would the human race live after an apocalypse?,8,10 February 2010,"That is the premise of this movie. It looks at that question through the eyes of a man and his son, trying to survive in this desolate, dying world, created by an unspecified catastrophic event. The father and son are as close to good guys you can get in this world. The father tells the son about holding on to ""the fire"", presumably humanity and decency. We are left in no doubt that many humans have abandoned civilisation completely in order to survive. Murder and cannibalism are starkly portrayed. The child's mother was unable to cope with even the thought of what might happen to her in this awful new world. The man is only too aware of what is likely to happen to them in the end. He always tries to ensure they have two bullets in their gun, for when they have no other means of escape. Even this decent man is worn down by the immense difficulty of trying to keep them alive when there is little or no food available. He starts to lose the sense of right and wrong that he was so anxious to pass on to his son. However we are left with the impression that his son has learned how to be a decent man from his father.I haven't read Cormac McCarthy's book. It is possible that someone who had might get more from the movie. However I would definitely recommend seeing this film, whether you have read the book or not. Viggo Mortenson is excellent as the father, portraying the dignity the character tries so hard to hang on to for the sake of his son. Kodi Smit McPhee does well as the son, trying to reconcile the awful world that he sees around him with the humanity his father speaks to him about. The film also brilliantly shows the bleak world left after the disaster. There are some amazing visuals, such as a huge forest fire.Not easy viewing but a very rewarding movie experience.",The Road
140,harrylosborne,"Depressing, dark, dire - excellent",8,29 January 2021,"This adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel of dismay is translated to the screen very well.Too often these post-apocalyptic films have a hope element to prevent them from being too dark (a paradox when considering the end of the world if you ask me). This is not the case here: hope is not much of a concept, the colour is completely desaturated and lifeless, and there is no such thing as a friend.Viggo Mortensen is, as always, right on line with the tone. He is a cynical father, but understands that avoiding the bleak reality of life is sometimes necessary for the sake of his son. Still, he takes no chances - a concept that his insanely naïve son does not seem to understand, even more staggering given he was raised in a world composed mostly of cannibals. Musically, the minimalist tone also fits the surroundings - everything is scarce, even the score.Throughout The Road, I was constantly asking myself what I would do in their situation (a premise Viggo's character also struggles with), and I think this is the ultimate aim of any film. If it has succeeded in making you feel, then it has already eclipsed 90% of what is produced today.",The Road

Most everything has perished, no animals, no crops, trees are dead and only a moderate number of humans are around. The novel was awarded the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction in 2006. The book was adapted to a film of the same name in 2009, directed by John Hillcoat.The tale is of survival, the methodology behind the film is the fire we carry inside as human beings, AND the lengths they will go to survive. Viggo Mortenson's character slips us back in narration through the film. The story is bleak, the characters lost souls searching for the triumph of survival. Desolate, cringe worthy scenery and strong direction. The film may move rather slowly but it keeps you entertained by thought and visual cinematography. 9/10",The Road
142,anthonyjlangford,Realism rather than Spectacle.,8,3 February 2010,"The Road has been a long time coming. It was shot in 2007. I don't know the reason for the delay, perhaps executives got tetchy when they realized there was no Mad Max style battle scenes. Saying that The Road is bleak, is like saying Grease is a musical. Of course it is. Did you think the end of the world wouldn't be?. The film, conscientiously based on Cormac McCarthy's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, doesn't pull any punches. It drags us back, almost to the Dark Ages, back to the basics. Without adequate food and clothing, most people will resort to anything to survive. While others will simply give up.The father and his son walk the freeways and forest trails, searching, always searching for food and perhaps a little bit of hope. But there are no options anymore. Gradually the old world falls away. For the boy, that old world is a distant, foreign place. Survival is not merely a battle, its a curse. He struggles to understand it. The father is caught between wanting to shield his son against the cruelty he knows exists and giving him the knowledge he needs to survive. His son is now his world, yet try as he might, he cannot escape his memories. Viggo Mortenson holds this film together with an astounding performance, understated, minimalistic, but always captivating. The boy, Kodi Smit-McPhee also shines. His innocence is our link to this frightening universe as he struggles to understand what is happening around him. John Hillcoat (The Proposition) proves once again, that he is a dynamic director, keeping faithful to the novel by concentrating on the relationship between father and son and not on the devastated moon like landscape and broken highways. As depressing as it is, there is a tenderness, which makes those personal moments all the more poignant. There are some wonderful cameos too, particularly by veteran Robert Duvall. The only aspect that lets The Road down, and I never thought I would say this, is the music score of Nick Cave and Warren Ellis. The two collaborated brilliantly on Hillcoat's last film, and both have had outstanding careers, but here they go for the obvious heartstrings in true Hollywood form. It's like being whacked over the head with a piano. At times the score does help to elevate a particular mood and is at its best when its subtle, but when that mood is predominately a downbeat one, we don't need to be so clearly prompted.Aside from this, The Road is a film of intense detail. It is a difficult film to watch but unlike any other post apocalyptic films before it, concentrates on humanity rather than plot, realism rather than spectacle. It was an oversight, if not shameful, not to acknowledge it at this year's Oscars.",The Road
143,mrcibubur,Another apocalypse movie with a half story and Vigo Mortensen,7,12 January 2010,"I saw the preview for this movie and had high expectations, something more worthwhile than 2012. The film is quite short and perhaps very predictable but nevertheless, as critical as I am of the film, it is a faultless production in terms of screenplay cinematography and all that kind of stuff, the story is only HALF because - what was the apocalypse here and why only these survivors? was it worldwide or once again only concentrated on USA? what was Charlie Therons role in this film anyway/ Wash she the wife/gf or just someone Mr Mortenson was helping out/ Okay, there is the opening scene with Mr Mortensen getting out of bed, but none of this adds up for me.Yes, a depressing film overall but still enjoyable and like so many recent films, the ending was extremely flat - but why would I expect more/ The story had reached the end of 'the road'.One of those films they put all the best bits in the preview and then you endure the whole movie to think - ah yes, I remember that bit while sifting through the popcorn (when its still full, early on) Great father and son drama though and the cameo by robert duvall was good also but I feel an opportunity has been missed. Loved no Country for Old Men but have never read either book.Soemtimes must choose between reading a book and watrching a movie! Glad I saw the movie but its not a first date movie by any chalk!",The Road
144,TuesdayThe17th,"""But she died somewhere in the dark....and there's no other tale to tell""",10,22 November 2020,"Quentin Tarantino has said that 2013's ""The Rover"" is the best post apocalyptic movie since the original ""Mad Max"". This couldn't be further from the truth because ""The Road"" is hands down the very best adaptation of post apocalypse ever put to screen. It's better than ""The Rover"" and it's better than ""Mad Max""(though both of those are great movies). Virgo Mortensen turns in one of the most incredible performances I've seen by an actor in this truly haunting and moving film. Yes ""The Road"" is an apocalyptic film but it is also so much more. There is a smorgasbord of genres and scenarios. When i saw this film for the first time at age 23, I thought one scene in particular was easily one of the scariest scenes I've ever seen in a movie and now, seven years later, it still creeps me out big time. This is obviously the whole scene with ""boy"" and ""man"" in the strangers' house, especially the basement scene but also, the following scene while they are hiding in the grass after escaping. Sound is the most effective way to scare and this part utilizes that to its max as we hear an axe hit a wood block coming from inside.. The thought of what is actually happening along with the crisp, clean chops accompanies with the yelps and cries....is terrifying... And definitely not suitable for younger viewers.
So besides being extremely raw and haunting, this movie offers a deep emotional pull in its storyline. ""Man"" is so brave and wise but he also has a cracked heart that is heavy with sadness and loss. There are very sad parts in this movie. I cry every time and it is very rare that a movie makes me cry. This film also holds some of the better lines of dialogue ever in a movie like this. Bleak and depressing, tender and sweet, scary and dreadful, somber and strong. This film has a lot going for it. If you really liked this movie, check out its newer, sister film ""Light of my Life"" from actor/director Casey Affleck. It's not as good by any means but it is still ome of the better post apocalyptic movies and it is im the same vein as ""The Road""",The Road
145,RichardSRussell-1,So Well Done I Wanted To Kill Myself,8,18 December 2009,"The Road (1:50, R) — Science Fiction, 3rd string, originalAmong the first words spoken in The Road (adapted from Cormac McCarthy's novel) are ""It's just another earthquake."". That's supposed to be reassuring.It's a bleak, devastated, post-apocalyptic world leached of everything: color, sounds, names, sunshine, warmth, joy, hope. Thru it trudge The Man (Viggo Mortenson) and The Boy (Kodi Smit-McPhee), slowly and painfully making their way to ""the coast"", where maybe things will be marginally better. Who can say? But what else is there?Along the way they encounter The Gang Member (Garret Dillahunt, still as creepy and frightening as he was in The Sarah Connor Chronicles and The Last House on the Left), The Road Gang Leader (Brenna Roth), The Old Man (Robert Duvall), The Thief (Michael K. Williams), and The Veteran (Guy Pearce) and his woman (Molly Parker). In flashbacks to an achingly lost former life, we see The Wife (Charlize Theron).And really, once you've named the names, you've pretty well covered the movie. The name of the game is Survival, tho none can say what the point of it is. The food is gone, and clearly no more will be growing. Humans are apparently the only animals to survive the unnamed global disaster, so they represent the sole remaining, rapidly dwindling source of protein. The voices you hear approaching are not the Red Cross.Some choose not to play. The Wife, after some low-energy soul-searching, goes the ancient-Eskimo route. ""She was gone,"" The Man remembers, ""and the coldness of it was her final gift.""Others persevere for no cogent reason. ""DId you ever wish you would die?"", The Man asks. ""No,"" The Old Man replies, ""it's foolish to ask for luxuries in times like these.""The Man and The Boy have 1 gun with 2 bullets left; they are not being reserved for potential assailants. In some of the movie's most agonizing scenes, we see The Man explain not only what must be done but why.I walked into this movie 10 hours after leaving the theater where Avatar splashed the screen with color, motion, activity, purpose, a 3rd dimension, and a superb sound track. It is difficult to imagine 2 more disparate films in terms of tone and atmosphere. But both are extremely effective at making their respective worlds seem completely real.The movie is unremittingly grim and completely believable. It doesn't pull its punches or sell out. It will haunt you. It's unlikely that anyone else will ever make another movie that treats the end of the world so realistically, so if you want to see the standard against which all others will be compared, this is your chance.Stay away if you're depressed or prone to it, and avoid razor blades for 12 hours afterward.",The Road
146,colinrgeorge,"""The Road""",7,6 April 2010,"There's ""2012"" and there's ""The Road;"" apocalypse and post apocalypse respectively. The unnamed event that leaves the world of the latter film under eternally windswept gray skies and the last dregs of humanity in utter desperation for sustenance is never seen nor explained. All the special effects happened ten years ago. The film stars a skeletal Viggo Mortensen as a father (like in Lars Von Trier's ""Antichrist,"" his role is simply credited, Man) and Kodi Smit-McPhee (rolls right off the tongue) as Boy. The dynamic between the two: Mortensen as provider, partner, and teacher, proves a compelling emotional ballast to the horrific acts of violence that permeate the film's less tender moments. 'Cannibalism. That's the big fear,' Mortensen muses in voice-over. ""The Road"" is a bleak, somber film, often poignant and effective in the moment, but somewhat disappointing for its greater thematic ineloquence.Perhaps by necessity, ""The Road"" seems broken down into distinct encounters, strung together on the loosest narrative thread, which lends the film a natural feeling of lawless wandering, but undermines the potential strength of the plot. The protagonists have an ultimate destination charted, to make it to the coast, but in general, a character or group of characters will interact with them for ten minutes and part ways. The screenplay by Joe Penhall, an adaptation of the novel by Cormac McCarthy, keeps this potentially redundant scene structure from growing stale with a usually fascinating and diverse array of character types, from bloodthirsty cannibals to a hobbling hobo (Robert Duvall) or a roving pack of bandits.The other premise weaving these sequences together is Mortensen's deteriorating health. He wakes from dreams of his previous life, filled with the unfamiliar greens and blues of the living world, to uncontrollable coughing fits. It quickly becomes clear he must impart his worldly knowledge to the boy before his time comes. In doing so, he is presented with several morally compromising scenarios, involving the trust of a stranger or the punishment of a thief, and his cold calculation and instinct for self-preservation clash with the ideological selflessness of his son. We can hardly blame Mortensen's character for preaching distrust in the world the film depicts, but the sequences themselves inevitably prove the son correct, treating many of the encounters more as parables than legitimate ideological debate.This premise, without spoiling it, comes to an underwhelming zenith in ""The Road's"" final moments. It's not that the ending is sappy, though alright, it's a little sappy. Smit-McPhee's character must crucially weigh the application of his trust, in a scene that should carry the emotional weight of the entire film on its shoulders. Instead, director John Hillcoat plays the moment merely for tension, which is displayed to great effect already in half a dozen previous scenes. Resultantly, the conclusion drawn is acceptable but largely unsatisfying. The audience is left to just sort of shrug it off.Like ""Children of Men,"" ""The Road"" posits a bleak future that doesn't feel stagey or pretentious. Both films are visually powerful, if in opposite ways, with Hillcoat's film favoring subtle, moody cinematography over the frenetic energy of its contemporary. Despite my issues with the structure of the film, I have no reservations using adjectives like 'powerful' or 'effective' to describe it, though I can't quite bring myself to call ""The Road"" 'great.' The distinction for me lies in that the piece doesn't speak as a whole so much as it does a series of interesting scenes that come very close to complementing one another.Entirely watchable, and by no means worth avoiding, ""The Road"" offers uncompromising performances, and an unusually intimate take on the disaster film. After all, anyone can blow up the world, but not everyone can make us care.",The Road
147,thekyles99,Gotta read the book now!,4,27 November 2010,"Bleak, dismal and definitely depressing adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's book of the same title that apparently has won a Pulitzer prize as i just found out writing this review. Being an avid reader that I am leaves me already checking the local libraries's online catalogue to see if they carry it. The book is always 10 times better then the film in my mind. Anyhoo back to the movie, Viggo Mortensen portrays a father who after the suicide of his wife during the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust is left solely in charge of taking care of his 10 yr old son as they trek across a vast wasteland that was once civilization in order to reach the west coast in hope to find some form of human existence. As you read this review u will see this is the type of film that you shouldn't expect the sun to shine through in any scenes, however that being said what you can expect to see and most probably feel is a strong sense of survival, and what a father will in fact do to ensure his offspring's safety. Another thing this film is strong in is acting. Viggo Mortensen is one of the best actors out there these days and the rest of the cast, even a very short part played by a very un recognizable Robert Duvall all do a fantastic job showing all the emotions that make this a believable flick. Even though the content as i described is very much on the dismal side it was a good story of survival to say the least.",The Road
148,Mivas_Greece,One of the best post-apocalyptic survival films but with dramatic rather than adventure element. Definitely among the top recommended ones!,7,7 November 2021,"Survival movie / drama. A post-apocalyptic film, where a sudden flash of the sun triggered the end of life on the planet. A few years later, the few survivors are trying to survive as best they can, as few animals are left, mostly some insects, and the vegetation has also been largely destroyed, many unfortunately become cannibals. A father and his son are also wanderers, but he has promised his son that they will remain ""good"" and will never become cannibals. A long journey of survival in a gray and desolate landscape throughout the film, where there are moral messages and ethical dilemmas about what one would do for survival and what limits one could keep. A very good and serious film, without silly elements or immoralities like others of the genre, tends to the dramatic element more and not to adventure like e.g. I am Legend. The excellent performances and the impeccable direction also give a realism. It is one of the best films in the category and definitely among the recommended ones of the genre.",The Road
149,axlrhodes,The Road made me want to call all my loved ones and tell them how much they meant to me. Brilliant film.,9,28 May 2010,"The Road is a film that i would find hard to recommend to anyone as piece of escapist entertainment because it is truly not. It is so much more than that. It is a powerful piece of work that explores the depths of which people will go to preserve their humanity when all humanity has gone to hell around them. The film features another outstanding performance from Viggo Mortensen who's realisation of this character is moving and beautifully delivered. Of all the would be Oscar winners in Hollywood, i can think of nobody that deserves one more. The boy in the film is also really good. I don't often enjoy children's performances in film but this young lad really worked well with Viggo and they are a powerful force on screen together. Charlize Theron also supplies a strong supporting performance. So, hats of to director John Hillcoat for this compelling and moving story of survival and the human spirit. It is both brilliant and devastating. It made me want to ring all my loved ones and tell them i loved them.",The Road
150,honorhorror,"The most terrifying portrait of apocalyptic future ever, period.",9,13 December 2009,"The Road sells a simple idea and image, that a father and a son struggle to survive the wasteland of USA, searching for anything they can eat and dodging cannibals.The whole experience is a powerful redefinition about several keywords mentioned above, including ""wasteland"" ""survive"" ""cannibals"". I didn't read the acclaimed original novel, but I could tell this is not a blockbuster. So, if you expect to see cannibals from Pirates of Caribbean, Wasteland from Fallout games and survival from The Pianist, you should be ready to be blown away.The movie is not about a lot of dramatic twists, nor is it about apocalyptic disasters like what you've seen in 2012. There are barely any direct illustrations of disastrous impacts like tsunami, earthquakes or tornadoes. Ratherly, this movie shows you the after-wards, like the deteriorating atmospheric layer, the forests, the seas and most importantly, the men. If The Day After Tomorrow, 2012 and such movies were all about hope, The Road can be said to be about Desperate. It tells you the doomsday might not be short and quick, like ""close your eyes and wait for the end"" type. Sometimes, it can be as long as it's torturing. Yet, it's so terrifying because it's so realistic.To talk about cannibals......By the way, have you ever imagined that you might become a cannibal yourself? The Road may give you a lot of ideas because it drew you into its extremely bleak and famished world, that you may begin to calculate how to preserve people as live-stocks. Scared? People who don't like it called it ""too bleak"". You know, it's supposed to be like that, that's also why it's not a blockbuster. But I do recommend everyone to see it, not for entertainment, but for a chance to re-examine your daily life and give thanks to what you have. If you want entertainment, you can go for 2012 instead. But, if you care about the genuine messages, go to see The Road.",The Road

Maybe he was expecting fresh water and deep-fried cod? I really had to fast-forward this snooze-fest to see if there was any point to it, but come the ending, there is not a message to justify the film existing or a sign of hope to make it in some way worthwhile, just the possibility of wandering some more until everyone in the film eventually dies.

It would turn to ego of a monster. Someone said once something very clever about Western ""Civilization"": 'Our Civilization functions smoothly when our police and justice system function properly. Just wait to see what would happen when that disappear ...' I think that this movie gives a very smart comment on that ... As for my objections they mostly apply to composition: we got two heroes going from spot A to spot B without any plot whatsoever. Trying to survive is not a plot (maybe it is in the book), otherwise we can go to any place of the world disaster and follow the survivors with the camera to make a nice feature-film. All in all, it is a nice try from Hollywood to make something different.",The Road
154,joestank15,Mortensen is strong but this suffers from tired problems of the genre.,6,28 December 2009,"The Road - Viggo Mortensen stars in the role of ""Man"" who contends with cannibals and earthquakes all for the safety of ""Boy"" (Kodi Smit-McPhee). Flashbacks to the start of the not-explained apocalyptic situation show us ""Man""s relations with now dead ""Wife"" (Charlize Theron).I eagerly awaited this film as soon as I saw the trailer, in spite of my growing impatience with the litany of apocalypse films now on the market. Viggo Mortensen has, with the exception of ""Appaloosa"", been in a series of exceptional films in this decade and created several unforgettable characters. His portrayal of ""Man"" is, if not unique, certainly convincing as a man on the edge of defeat in a harsh and impossible situation. If anything can bring him over the edge, it is his incessantly whining hindrance of a son.In the genres of horror and survival, writers feel that no situation is too barren and terrible that a defenseless sidekick cannot be added on to make it even more unbearable. It's one of the things that needs to be dropped from the mix because when it doesn't work, a film risks being plain unenjoyable. In this case, Kodi Smit-Mcphee says ""Papa!"" enough times with enough incessant pleading to give all but the most maternal viewer a headache. When Man gives Boy a revolver with one bullet to commit suicide, I immediately think that with those big gloves and that sad sniffle, the Boy will likely botch the job. This is a child with no born survival instinct. Every decision Boy demands (loudly) is almost certainly the wrong one. Can we invite scary looking Robert Duvall over to dinner? Can we follow the possibly cannibalistic boy back to his tribe? Can I shout loudly whenever something might be around, thereby directing it to my location? If Boy is supposed to be a gift from God, I'd say God truly has screwed the world over.It transformed quickly from being an eagerly awaited film to one that demands nit-picking concerning logic in character choices, especially since survival is so pertinent. If you have a small gun with two bullets, do you a) teach your son how to commit suicide (for over the top dramatic effect) or b) use one of said two bullets to kill an armed man and take his gun? Alas, director John Hillcoat and writer Joe Penhall are less interested in logistics and specifics (what exactly happened to bring us to this state?) than in loose Bible associations and simple Western ideas of ""good"" and ""bad"". ""We're the good guys, right?"" Struggling for that nobility in a world ripped apart is as futile as it is tacky and simple. The only thing that seems to be in shades of gray is the scenery.The atmosphere of The Road is bleak and suitably depressing. The film provides some thrills and chills but they are few and far between. It loses steam about two thirds of the way through, where I lost concern for the safety of the characters. It's not bad, but a long shot from Mortensen's usual. The Road gets a B-",The Road
155,quinimdb,The Road,9,31 July 2016,"""The Road"" is a very dreary film for sure, but I find it to be more hopeful than most do. I often see this cited as a endlessly depressing and hopeless film and even occasionally as the most depressing ever, but I see something different.The film consists of a father and his son walking through a post-apocalyptic wasteland that is never truly explained exactly why it's come to this, mostly because the focus here is the people and human nature. There are long, slow, somber moments, flashbacks, and occasionally extremely intense and terrifying, literal nail biting, encounters. One of the strengths of the film is the constant sense of danger and threat of death contained in every moment, even the slow and quiet ones, which is then subverted at the end to show us our false paranoia in many situations. The music, visuals, color palette, make up, costume design, and of course the terrific performances by the impressive cast (many of whom I didn't recognize due to make up) are all utterly fantastic, and contribute to one of the most amazing and absorbing atmospheres I've ever seen, although decidedly bleak and oppressive.All of the animals are dead. The film is populated by mostly dull grays and browns save for a few hopeful moments, such as the discovery of a waterfall, the discovery of a bunker filled with food, and the father's memories. The kid colors random scribbles with crayons on paper simply to be able to see color. We learn his son has known nothing but this wasteland for his entire life, and the mother killed herself once things got really bad. In fact, early in the film, we see the father teaching the son how to kill himself if things got that bad, as he describes that they have two bullets. One for each of them. The characters know that death is probably better than the hell they are surviving in now, but the fathers love for the naive boy, who represents love, hope, and moral goodness in the face of hell, keeps him alive. They know that they will die, and both of them even want to die to a certain extent. Most people have resorted to murder, raiding, and, most disturbingly, cannibalism, and for what? Our inexplicable urge to survive even where there is no hope, is one of the enigmas of human nature the film confronts, but what is clear is that there will always be a force of good in this world, even if it's overshadowed by the evil. Just like the father and his son, the only thing that keeps the purity and goodness in this world is the innocence of a child, and it's the only thing keeping the father from being just like all of the others. It's the only thing that keeps him from being entirely selfish like all of the others. When humanity is stripped bare, only then do we realize the capacity for evil we all have inside us, therefore a child who hasn't learned of the selfishness that most people possess is the only hope. Even though they all have the common goal of surviving, demonstrated by the scared man who stole their supplies, our selfishness and paranoia of others selfishness only isolates us and keeps us from finding hope, hence the father being afraid of people following them and the people walking above the food storage only for the kid to find out after his father dies that the people following them above the food storage were good. When the father dies, the boy is confronted by a man, whom he doesn't trust at first, but turns out to be good, probably since they have two children. Even in the worst of times, love, morality, selflessness, and innocence prevail, no matter how oppressed and small it is compared to everything around them.",The Road
156,deacon_blues-3,A Masterpiece of acting and directing,10,5 January 2010,"If you haven't read the book, see the film. The film is a completely faithful adaptation. Viggo Mortensen is so perfect as the desperate father. Robert Duvall is his usual genius self. How he can put forth so much power with such a small cameo. But the tour de force is between Mortensen and Smit-McPhee. As far as I'm concerned, Mortensen must get a best actor nod for this year. Director John Hillcoat has captured the atmosphere of the novel. If you look closely, there is never a hint of anything alive in the world around the man and the boy. Not a leaf, not a bug. Not even a worm or a maggot on a corpse. Never have I seen such bleakness rendered so perfectly. The 2 hints of renewal are carefully placed; the beetle in the tin, which flies away free, and the pet dog of the veteran's family. One symbolizes the re-emergence of wildlife, dormant for so long, and the other symbolizes the return of animal domestication, not for food, but for friendship and service. But to see this film as merely apocalyptic sci-fi misses the point. The film is actually a metaphor of everyday life. As loving, caring parents, we all struggle in a hostile world to protect and provide for our children, the hope of future civilization. If we care about what kind of people they will grow up to be, we are ""carrying the fire"" and trying to pass it on by instilling it in them. The world will seek to devour and absorb them as food, rather than value them as people. Or, they will join the rabble who live merely for the exploitation of everything around them for selfish gratification and self destruction. The challenge is always to live with dignity and integrity, even when it happens to be at great personal cost. All we can do is take them as far as God allows us to, and pray that they will develop into people who can stand on their own, and that they find others to nurture and support them when we are gone.",The Road

There is no future other than the realisation of the end of humanity and the planet itself. There is love, the love between the father and son and there is hope, hope that good will prevail.Great performance from all the principle actors, the film is a wonderfully directed film John Hillcoat with an essential score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis.Overall I would say that the film itself is painful and difficult to watch and this is what makes it utterly compelling and having watched the film 3 times now and read the book which was also ""unputdownable"" essential for anyone who wants / needs to see where we are heading as a species- which is a frightening thought.",The Road

The movie, (nor the book I believe), goes into any detail on what the event was. Also in keeping with the book, there are no names, so the father, son, mother and secondary characters, are known only as ""the man"", ""the boy"", ""the woman"" and so on. The son, is all of 10 years old and by way of flashback scenes we learn that he was born soon after the event, so from that we can assume that it's approximately 10 years since the world as we know it came to an end.The father and son are venturing towards the southern east coast of the U.S, pushing a shopping trolley with all they have left, in the hope that it'll be warmer and they can somehow be safer. On their way, there are run-ins with various characters, while maintaining their distrust of anyone and avoiding large groups who are predominantly cannibalistic. There is a scene in an old country mansion where barely alive people are being kept in the basement as food for later. The man however, unlocks the hatch to the basement allowing the starving prisoners to turn the tables on their cannibal jailers. The man and boy take shelter in any abandoned building they find, old banks, houses, churches etc. Even a forgotten underground bunker, completely stocked with food. Things like money & jewels etc no longer have any value as food, clothing & shelter now take priority.We learn through more flashbacks, that the woman ended up abandoning her family either because she lost all hope or to give her husband and son a fighting chance, but she ventures out into the wild, never to be seen again. This makes the man all the more desperate to do what he can to ensure his son's survival before he eventually dies.After reaching the coast, the father dies, probably due to a combination of general ill health, malnutrition and sheer exhaustion and the boy encounters a family who they admit have been following them. They allow the boy to become part of their family and the film ends.The Road is a deliberately bleak and hopeless kind of film. There's no hidden valley overflowing with milk and honey where everybody lives happily ever after. The Road presents us with the distinct possibility that despite all the best efforts & intentions, there is no happily ever after; it's only prolonging the inevitable. The movie is fairly faithful to the book and there appears to have been a lot of work done to find locations appropriate to film, so many of the abandoned buildings and ruined areas are actually real places that have been left to decay over time.My main concern with this is the unlikeliness of it all and the glaring inconsistencies with what would realistically happen if there was a global catastrophic event that wipes out most of the human race. While no one can say with 100% certainty on what would happen, in a world with no animals, no insects and no plant life; human life would be more than likely extinct within the 10 year time-frame of such an event occurring. The ground is unstable and we learn that there is literally no life left in the forests as trees often fall under their own weight and crumble on impact. If this were the case, every tree would have fallen by now and the land would be flat. There would be no fields of dried out grass, and no dead leaves still on trees. Bands of humans subsisting on human meat for the last 10 years would unlikely still have all their teeth or full use of their limbs or be strong enough to chase people, operate firearms, drive trucks etc. If they haven't already succumbed to the various infections that comes along with eating the ""wrong"" human parts, eating humans that are already half-dying simply won't give you the calories required for continued existence. It was a nice touch for the man to locate a can of Coke in an old vending machine, but the idea of it still being audibly carbonated or even being bubbly, is ridiculous. A can left at room temperature for years would not even be drinkable, it'd most likely be rancid, if it hadn't all leaked out already.Another thing that irritates me with practically ALL post apocalyptic movies is the number of people that are encountered. If events were taking place only months after global devastation, then one could accept the large numbers of people still hunting for food and trying to hold on to survival, but taking into account the number of years that has passed, the man and boy would virtually see no one, given that they are deliberately avoiding large cities and towns. This would see them on their own for nearly the entire journey. The family the boy meets up with at the end makes even less sense. There's a man, woman, 2 kids and a dog! What the hell have these remarkably healthy looking people been eating all this time and what have they been feeding the dog? It just doesn't add up. It might make for an almost hopeful ending, but unless they have a never-ending supply of concealed food, then their very existence is questionable. A little more attention to detail & this would've been great.",The Road
161,RickHarvey,The Road,7,16 June 2010,"This is no intellectual film, this a a film in which the story was written by a imaginative writer. It doesn't send out a strong message and there nothing between the lines. It just simple, good story telling. It not a film which keeps you thinking but instead , a film that always makes you wonder ""what would i'll do in this situation"". For me, these are the best type of films. Anything can happen in this post apocalyptic world and that the whole thrill of this film.The story is simple, Man and Boy must travel South for warmth and in hope for a more civilised area. All there is too it. The setting and the scenery hooked me in right away. When the two characters were rooting for food, I felt like i was right beside them, wiping the dirt of my forehead. The atmosphere is perfect, creating the sense of uncertainty at every second. Not once did I get bored, you just have to grab onto their coats and join the ride ( rather depressing one ). For the next two hours, you will be en counting many strange and frightening things. It is not only the rough conditions of the rural surrounding that hold a threat to their survival, but also the cannibals that roam the roads. The film is filled with many suspense moments.If there was any negatives , then it would have to be the characters. I just couldn't emotionally engaged myself with the man and the boy. I still felt for them but something was lacking. The mother was weak and extremely selfish. there no error for the acting. everyone gave great performances. Duvall gave a worthy short performance and Pearce also.Another thing that bothered me was the family at the end. The director didn't make it clear if they were god or bad. Their body language was always suspicious and i couldn't make my mind up if they were tempting to eat him. even their kids looked afraid if them. Overall, a bleak surrounding never looked so beautiful. There are many sad, chilling, terrifying and suspenseful moments.",The Road

The movie had a real dead feel to it, in a good way, no gun blazing hero's in this flick. I loved the decor, the feeling of society being done for years ago. The only thing that drove me nut's was the kid saying ''Papa'' all the time, come on if this kid was born into this world then he would have been street smart, and not act like a dummy.

163,Rino_Bortone,DYSTOPY AT ITS FINEST,8,30 December 2019,"John Hillcoat's vision is a pure, surreal and dystopic vision of a frighteningly likely world. Everything moves in harmony from start to finish, with a few important changes here and there in the plot that make us understand the bare and raw reality of the facts of the characters treated and not only. Environments that enhance the story as well as the interpretations of Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee, especially the hands of the latter who always move with an innate finesse in the various scenes in prominence of the film, exalting even more the relationship father-son.

165,chucknorrisfacts,Yawn!,1,2 December 2011,"""The Road"" is not a very good movie. In fact, it was extremely boring. If you're going to try to watch it...do so during the day. It's almost guaranteed to put you to sleep if you try watching it at night.I understand what the movie was trying to do. I think it wanted to be a more ""realistic"" survival movie than most others in the post-apocalyptic genre are. However, there's just not enough going on to keep the viewer interested....And don't even get me started about the ending. It made me feel like I'd completely wasted my time in watching the whole damn movie. I foolishly hoped that something interesting or redeeming would happen, but alas...it most certainly did not.I highly recommend skipping this ""snoozer"" of a movie. If you want to watch something in the post-apocalyptic genre, I suggest watching something that's actually entertaining like ""Escape from New York"" or something.",The Road
166,janyeap,Never losing hope even in a post-apocalyptic environment!,10,3 November 2009,"Adapted from Cormac McCarthy's Pulitzer Prize novel of the same title, John Hillcoat's film is as much a virtually grabbing masterpiece as McCarthy's elegantly worded and sensuous masterpiece that transcends, at oft times, into prose and repetitions. Like in the beginning of McCarthy's novel, the viewers are plunged into the film's dark and ash-filtered environment in which the story's unnamed protagonist is witnessed as protecting his son. Indeed. he is taking charge to get himself and his eleven-year old son out of the grim, barren, non-redeeming, silent and godless world. Examine the bleak post-apocalyptic topography that could very possibly be the resulting impact from disasters of nuclear wars or from global warming! Indeed, with everything they can salvage onto a grocery cart or into their knapsacks, they must hit the empty road ahead to find a safe place. And thus begins our gradual discovery of how the man and his son hold on to their souls, knowing nothing is guaranteed as apocalypse impacts the world. Can our protagonist keep up his hope and optimism when the worst of humanity does take over the souls of desperate survivors? Ha, will there be a possibility of civilization? In an apocalyptic world, we can expect humans to sacrifice their humanity as their price of survival.This is an apocalypse thriller that's so phenomenally dark, and yet the persisting and unconditional love and bond, between the film's protagonist and his son, never cease to deliver the whispers of hope throughout their journey. It is their untarnished strengths, despite the appalling challenges, that are so terrific to behold. Indeed, Director Hillgoat has captured a beautiful father-son love story and their rise above the grim imaginings. Indeed, he has wonderfully delivered his lively characterizations of both as their humanly earnest defense against everything that could go wrong. I was truly awed by what I observed.Mortensen is incredibly wonderful to follow. Watch out for that very precious moment when the son first felt his connection to his father! I'm indeed grateful to see Charize Theron's character being given more depth and weight in the film version. Oh yes, one of the most memorable scenes revolve around Robert Duvall's Old Man, and in a very meaningful way as well. The Boy connects with humanism, yet we see his father as being too afraid to really let his son get his way. Yet, it's the point in which the trainee becomes the trainer; the pupil becomes the teacher! And it's the first time we see both father and son in disagreement. And their encounter with Michael K. Williams' Thief doesn't help to cool down their temperament either. Spanish Cinematographer, Javier Aguirresarobe has delivered apocalyptic landscape and atmosphere in amazing forms that are totally mesmerizing. Observe how nature can no longer provide refuge to prevent human destruction, and scavengers hunt for food, including human flesh! And when Guy Pearce as the Veteran and Molly Parker's character as his wife appear in the scenes, it's debatable if the Boy has found 'the good guys' and whether they would be 'carrying the fire'!Indeed, Director Hillcoat has terrifically captured the love story between parent and child, leaving the audience with increasing hope and optimism. Yep, the parent-child interactions emancipate an incredibly enormous and redeeming appeal... even when things get worse and far from being better. ""We are not gonna quit. We are gonna survive this,"" the Man had said to the Boy at the most dreaded moment in the film. The Man in the story, indeed, is perpetually faced with his last chance of parenting, teaching, training and preparing his son for the worst scenario to come, in a world, so deprived of life, hope and optimism. And it's truly interesting to observe the Boy's extraordinary and constant inner battle between his mortal fear and his basic goodness. The father understands that the Boy is his warrant, and that 'if he's not the word of God, God never spoke.' Yep, the film's plot and sub-plots stay pretty faithful to McCarthy's novel. And I love Hilcot's changed version of the Man's wife, fabulously performed by Chalize Theron. And his treatment to the ultimate decision made by Charlize Theron's character gets my high approval over the troubling and traumatic decision she took in the book. Yes, indeed, Charlize Theron's character realizes the lack of food supplies as well as the existence of only two bullets left for the family of three, and like any good mother, she makes the toughest choice in leaving her husband and child to fend for one another's survival. And that brings me to think of the idiom: Two's a company; three's a crowd! However, Hillcoat did admit at the Q&A session, I attend, that the changed treatment was a hell of a decision for him to make. Having read the book, I'm happy for the change. Also, I love this film's flashbacks of the good memories shared by the Man and his wife. The Director did mention that the love story, between father and son, should also take consideration of the mother's influences, and that good things tend to be taken too much for granted. The persistence of love between a father and a son against the ugly backdrop of the world is so magnificently portrayed by Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee. I would be frankly disappointed if Mortensen doesn't garner an Oscar nomination for his role in this film. Definitely, this is a powerful and remarkably crafted film not to be missed by the indie-film buffs looking for a great state-of-the art film with enough metaphors, symbols, and references to decipher!",The Road
167,basilisksamuk,"Good film, not great, annoying musical score",6,30 May 2012,"I had read the book so I had a good idea what to expect. Even so I was thinking of bailing out of the film after the first 15 minutes because I wasn't particularly in the mood for being depressed. However, something kept me watching and I was glad I did. I found the film marginally more optimistic than the book and I was particularly impressed with the cinematography which gave everything the right post-apocalyptic look. The flashbacks, with their different colour palate, also worked well. Unlike some others I don't have a strong feeling that this was either a great film or a terrible film. It certainly isn't fun to watch but it is a well-made film that gives you plenty to think about and is different both from the run-of-the-mill product and other post-apocalypse offerings. It was weak in the section where they decide to abandon the bunker and press on to the coast. Many have commented this doesn't make sense but in the book it does. The director should have found a better way to make the decision look like the right one. I suspect part of the problem was a desire to restrict the running time of the film and I entirely understand this. The thing I liked least was the music which I hated with a passion. It was just so monotonous and repetitive that instead of complementing the sombre tone of the film it broke my connection with the viewing experience because I became so aware of it that I just wanted it to stop droning on and annoying me. The film would have been better without a musical score.",The Road
168,drpakmanrains,Some Aspects Commendable; Others Not,6,18 June 2011,"After reading about 150 of the 360 reviews to date, and having just watched the film on Netflix, I wish to put some perspective on this apocalyptic film version of Cormac McCarthy's book. First, I find that critics and readers have decided McCarthy is almost a God today. I unfortunately do not share this view, at least based on the films I have seen. ""No Country For Old Men"" was OK, but it apparently was about a different idea than what was involving me as a viewer, and it felt like the last chapter was missing. ""The Road"" was bleak and depressing for the most part, which I guess is to be expected in this genre without looking silly.The commendable aspects include the cast and the bleak cinematography. Many have commented on Kody Smit McPhee's whining and crying as annoying, because after so many years he should have been toughened up. But this was the only tender human emotion in the film, and it was, I believe, intended to show that he had not lost his humanity. The ending, which, like ""No Country"", came abruptly, though none too soon, gave a slight feeling of hope, though almost no closure. This too is criticized by many as Hollywoodish, but do you absolute realists want a bleak film to be unrelenting from start to finish? Even funerals try to add some joy.The down sides of this film are its length, too long, with very little happening or changing, and the flaw that has them leave the fallout shelter on the flimsiest of reasons when they had enough food and supplies to last a very long time there. Some people watch movies for flaws, and if you are one of those, then I suppose there were plenty, but I try to accept the film as it is, and see to what extent it involves me emotionally and with full attention. This film was so-so at best. I concur with reviewers who liked ""The Road Warrior"" better, for it was very entertaining, but not very realistic. It was like a WWE show in an apocalyptic setting.I didn't bother to review the overall plot here, as with over 350 reviews, it has been covered thoroughly. My point was to negate the hyperbole that so many reviewers reported. The film was mostly well done, but not very entertaining, and as such did not do very well at the box office, despite glowing reviews by critics and a widespread release. I gave it a 6, because it wasn't awful, and it wasn't great. I'm glad I rented it, rather than paid to see it in a theater, and I won't watch it again, for at my age (70) I don't want to invest 2 hours repeatedly on a movie that has so little joy, hope, or anything clever or funny, no matter how well done it may be.",The Road
169,kylehodgdon,Decent Post Apocalyptic Film From A different Point Of View,6,25 November 2009,"I would say that I liked this movie ""alright"". The beginning was very intense. The kind of edge-of-your-seat feeling reminded me of that in ""Deliverance"". The story was neat and had a very real feeling. It is interesting to see a post apocalyptic movie from the view of everything being so terrible and depleted. All too often you get one where the main characters are having a ball, running rampant in malls and such; that does not happen here.The problem that I had with this is how people turn into such monsters. It was reminiscent of how people acted in ""Blindness"". When things turned bad, their first instinct is to fend for themselves with no care for others. I know that not everyone in this film was, as the boy would say, ""one of the bad guys"", but a vast majority were. I think, for the most part, people would try to help one another survive. I also really hated how the kid kept calling his dad ""Papa"". I know it is just a minor complaint, but it felt like every other word out of his mouth was ""Papa"". It was annoying. In this day in age I don't think any kids refer to their dad as ""papa"". It sounded whiny and very childish.Aside from that, ""The Road"" was a descent film. The acting was good and the colors used looked very good. It is worth a watch, but far from a must-see.",The Road
170,axismladen,An emotional voyage between father and son that has to be seen carefully and under any cost!!!,10,1 February 2010,"It's been quite long since i read the book! Ever since i'm waiting for a movie to be made. Even though my hopes for this movie were high, my expectations were still low. I was a bit skeptical about how they're gonna manage to adopt a book that's mostly based on peoples feelings. I was afraid that they wont be able to show them in a movie. Luckily, i was wrong. If i wasn't i'd hate the movie for what it would be because the book is like an emotional voyage of a father and son. Such a strong book. It really seals into your memory. And i'm extremely glad the movie does too.A very big praise for it should be given to John Hillcoat. His depressive and monotone, book faithful and emotional directing gave the movie just what it needed to stay as close to the book as possible. I also have to mention Viggo who is at his finest in this movie and Robert Duvall who, even though i always thought of him as a great actor, still managed to surprise me. Oh yeah, and Kodi Smit-McPhee who was also good, just a bit away from great. In some scenes i found him a bit naive and young as he is. I guess that's the main problem with his performance. But all in all, he was good. And one more thing i have to mention is Joe Penhall's very good adaptation. He managed to throw in most of the things that where in the book and not to change it too much! Good job!!!You know, i really look forward to the Oscars and i expect The Road to take a couple of statues home.At least two. Best Leading Actor for Viggo and Best Supporting Actor for Robert Duvall. I didn't mention those for Best Picture and Directingbecause i believe that the Academy would never award a movie as this one with those. Even though if you ask me it should! Anyway, The Road is brilliantly adapted movie, as good as the book it self. An the book is simply amazing. And that, i think, says a lot for it self. Watch it under any cost. Just watch it carefully. This is not the kind of movie you'd watch just to spend a couple of entertaining hours of your life on a film. No! This is a movie you have to pay your full attention to while watching it!

A splendid palette and a haunting soundtrack made it feel very real, but what would I know.Unfortunately, nerd that I am, I was looking for faults in what I have said is a very flat film. Were those leaves on the trees? I quibble. There were some fabulous locations. (If they were CGI – well done!) However, I felt there was too little detail of how Viggo Mortensen and his annoyingly whining son, Kodi Smit-McPheed, survived, (ate), for what we are led to believe had been years, whilst there was almost too much detail on how others coped.Strange that.

Those survivors had plenty of resources to choose from so even though life was complicated...It wasn't that dire of a situation for survival for those left. This movie is the exact opposite. In this world practically everything has been destroyed and what is left is in high demand by those who still live. Starvation is to the point where even cannibalism has become a source for certain packs of hunters. This is an extremely harsh and miserable existence. So bad that it's a wonder anyone would still feel a strong need to stay alive.The acting was done well, and there were a few bit parts for some big time actors. So the movie is worth watching, but it's just so damn depressing. It didn't help that most of it was shot in an almost black and white tone to make the cold and cloudy nuke winter seem every bit as dismal as I imagine it would be.I made the mistake of watching this late at night prior to going to bed.

I know I struggled to make it to the end because i just felt so much helplessness. The acting and the directing were so good that I did watch to the end, but there's no way I could watch it again.I saw a review that mentioned the original story was one of those story line comic books like ""The Walking Dead.""

The thing is, I don't believe that that country is that bad, so devoid of solidarity, decency, humanity and whatnot that the FBI is all that keep its population from cooking and devouring each other.Yet another idiot comes along with his message of life being a competition, ignoring the fact that he, and I, and most of you are alive. In his world, societies do not arise naturally to form governments. People will not group and associate to improve their lives. They won't even talk. I wonder which planet the author of The Road comes from; a shitty hole for sure, as Larry Niven wouldn't call it.Even according to his pathetic stinky twisted vision of the world, the author couldn't do it right:* Anthropophagy is not sustainable an agriculture.* More obviously, the last place where people starve is the countryside. Villages of civilised rednecks would be preyed upon by starving, cannibalistic and solitary urbanites. Not the opposite.* The father is so incompetent at survival that he wouldn't last 5 minutes in a serious movie. Yes, a serious movie, which The Road is absolutely not, preventing us from feeling anything (except boredom) for anyone.* Nobody washes, probably because hygiene is bad for health and survival. Or perhaps because the author sees water as a 20th century invention that only a sophisticate elite would know how to use properly.* And here I am wasting time at enumerating stupidities once again.

177,darin-wissbaum,OK so we reached the ocean...now what?,6,31 May 2010,"This was a very dark, gloomy and depressing film in which you wished in just one scene that the darn sun would shine. I spent a lot of my time squinting at the screen trying to make sense of what was going on. The story centers around two characters. Viggo Mortenson as the Father and Kodi Smit-McPhee as the Son who are forced into survival in a Earth now destroyed by man's greed and global warming has killed most life except for as it is explained in the film two different types of peoples....The good people and the bad ones which do nothing but resort to cannibalism. After we see flash backs of the Mother telling the father that he needs to see to it that he gets their son to the sea in the South because she has no more of a desire to go on living, and in a very moving scene we see The Father pleading with her to just spend one more night with him before she walks off and dies. She does not and walks off into the darkness. The rest of the film has the Father and Son fighting their way through burned out cities and across a barren landscape in which it rains almost every day. They fight for survival from what appears to be red-necks who eat human flesh and keep warm humans locked up in basements to be eaten later. The Father Manages to escape death several times and save his son with nothing more than his wits and a pistol with only 2 rounds in which only 1 is ever used.They finally do reach the sea, which was the point that was pressed throughout the film but nothing happens once they are there. The last 20 minutes The Son spends on the beach watching The Father die. Before his death he tells The Son to keep going south. After The Fathers death The Son finds a good family while on the beach, which included a man, woman, little boy, girl and a dog. So was this the meaning for The Father to get his little boy to the ocean? To find a nice family living on the beach? This all seemed too simple an ending for a story that was pretty complex about survival in a world in which survival was everything. But as with all Hollywood films the ending had to be happy seeing how gloomy it was up to that point. It just seemed too good an ending....",The Road

The obsessive father son relationship is well realised with the son displaying more humanity than that displayed by his father while all the time the son is being taught how to be ""one of the good guys"". As the story meanders on Mortensens character shows us his greed and vindictiveness. This may be understandable in the post apocalyptic world and its easy to understand how quickly mankind could revert back to primordial instincts as depicted in the movie. The scenes of devastation are well presented and i appreciated some aspects of the story being left to your imagination.On the down side as others have commented the experience is somewhat depressing. Even the relatively upbeat ending fails to enthuse. It along with the laughable beetle seem just to be there to whisper in our ears that every thing is going to be OK. There are other plot contrivances too,the worst being them finding the bunker full of canned food just after the child has been complaining of feeling hungry.By no means is it the worst movie ever made however The Road really is forgettable watch once only fare.",The Road

Why south? We're not entirely sure, other than it is towards the coast. What will they do when they arrive? Not even they know. ""The Road"", however, is not about answering those questions. In a world where man has turned cannibal and everybody is a threat, and a father's life lessons to his son are on how best to shoot yourself correctly if the time comes, it is purely about the journey, their survival, and at its heart, their tormented relationship.There are some who might ask what the appeal is of a story set in a post-apocalypse world, in which every scene is soul-crushingly depressive. It is a question they could ask Viggo Mortensen, an actor whose praises I have been singing rather highly just recently, for he plays ""Man"" in this new film. Perhaps part of the draw was the author of the book from which it is adapted, Cormac McCarthy, responsible for ""No Country For Old Men"". Perhaps it was the opportunity to work with the great Robert Duvall. Maybe it was the chance to grow a terrific beard. Whatever it was, Mortensen gives a performance that once again proves that he deserves every accolade bestowed upon him. He is an actor with the ability to move you with very little physical effort; an actor who ensures the trials they have suffered, and the force of will it is taking him to go another day, are etched deep into every look. The aforementioned moment where he encourages his child, his ""word of God"", to shoot himself in order to save him worse pain than a quick death, and the scene in which he pleads for his wife to stay with him, are just two truly heartbreaking moment of quite a few! This isn't even mentioning the voice-over he has, not so much narrating the story as commenting on it as it moves along. A new venture for Mortensen, even this element of his performance is note-worthy. Cody Smit-McPhee does well as ""Boy"", and whilst his role in the film is, for the most part, rather unremarkable, and it is Mortensen who carries the relationship in this piece, Smit-McPhee shows enough potential as a young actor for me to say he might be one to watch out for in future (and of course we now know he went on to be part of the remake of ""Let The Right One In""). You know you have a master actor when their cameo role can almost steal the film, which is exactly what happens when Robert Duvall appears as ""Old Man"". Barely recognisable at first, and only on screen for 10 minutes or so, he is astonishing and delivers 100% Working well as an allegory on parenthood, the story doesn't offer names for the characters, proposing that these people represent us all. The idea of the father passing on his knowledge to his son is well stated. The moments of polarising opinions over who to trust; the father wanting to protect against everything, the son wanting to believe they are not the only ""good guys"" and to let others in, is a nice metaphor for the divide that occurs when a child rebels, and it resonates well.The score is appropriately uncomfortable and jarring at times, and the whole thing ratchets up the tension at points, far more than you were expecting it to when you walked in. It maybe gets a little mawkish and a bit overly-sentimental at a couple of points, but not so much to be a major complaint; it's just you simply don't need to be told what to feel quite so heavily in a film like this.Due to the narrative not being very cinematic if told in a straight-forward format, the wise decision is taken to make the occasional cut, showing us some of their time prior to this awful disaster, giving rise to well-performed, dialogue-driven scenes.The true star of this film is the cinematography. The whole film is stunning to look at, with the feeling of the environment really getting under your skin; if the world suffered a nuclear war, this is how it would feel.I enjoyed this film, as much as you can enjoy a film like this. If downbeat, depressing, dark stories aren't your thing, please stay clear; this one definitely competes with ""Children Of Men"" on the bleakness front. Look closer though, and see great performances, a well-told allegory, and a stunning-looking film. Maybe even a hint of Eco drama, if that's up your alley. Not perfect, and certainly not a cheery affair, but as long as you know what you're getting into, you should find yourself wrapped up in the drama of it all",The Road
180,blurnieghey,Great But Hopelessly Flawed,8,11 July 2021,"The whole end of the world / post-apocalyptic vehicle for films has always been one of my favorites and The Road is easily one of the best made in that regard. Realistic? Somewhat, depending on how you look at it. Perfect? Hardly, and the more times you watch it, the more you start to question it. The primary flaw of The Road is what gives it the license to do what it does: it lets you know that the world suffered some sort of major catastrophe but makes no attempt to explain specifically what that catastrophe was. This is all well and good, as it allows the story play out in the manner it does and one is simply forced to assume there is a reason why things got to the level of chaos the protagonists find themselves in. However, it simultaneously shoots itself in the foot as there are a ton of questions any thinking person can't help but ask.There is no nuclear power? No one utilized the seed banks all major nations have stored throughout the world? No one ever heard of a process called ""hydroponics"" that would allow one to grow such seeds? No natural gas generators anywhere? Arguably, there would be mass death, but we have the technology that would allow a certain percent of the population to have electricity and the ability to feed themselves, and these people would be able to arm themselves and carve out small outposts of relatively normal life, one would think. And what about insects? If this presumed catastrophe killed off all the bugs (another potential food source), then how did humans survive? No fish anywhere, even in freshwater ponds? Fish can also be farmed. And why in the world would they be carrying all their stuff in a shopping cart in the first part of the movie? Those things are a pain in the ass to push even in the grocery store. And so on. The Road is a great flick, with a tense, unnerving atmosphere that gives one a sinking feeling throughout. It's an enjoyable ride to be sure, but fundamentally flawed in a way that some people will find annoying.",The Road

Title sequence, world ends, life sucks, father and boy wander through desolation, father dies, boy is adopted by new family, end credits. There you go, I have saved you the trouble of spending an hour and forty-five minutes with that single sentence. No need to thank me, I'm here to watch bad movies so you don't have to.It's not that The Road is entirely bad, it's just boring, and rather pointless. I have no doubt that life after the world ends (we're not sure why in this film) would really, really suck. This could have been conveyed with a few scenes but the movie just keeps them coming. Example after example of how hard life is with little to no plot other than the characters heading south. When they finally reach their destination, it sucks there too. Yay, we've gone from life sucking in one place to life sucking in another! And it only took an hour and a half to accomplish! Perhaps if you really try hard you can find a metaphor for life in this film or some such artsy nonsense, but all I think that will accomplish is providing you with a headache.

If you know that his greatest blockbusters is Lord of the Rings:Return of the King you can say that he is very popular . In his recent movies I saw The Road . I read good things and critics about him and I decided to watch it . In trailer I saw big thrills . First impressions during watching this movie were quite good . I think that this movie in some stages is really thrilling . When whole my impressions sort in one I can say that it is nice movie . Sometimes movie failed because of its sad atmosphere .Viggo Mortensen definitely was great but sometimes he was out of pace . His acting is really impressive . There are so many parts when movie is good but sometimes they are screwed with some jumbled dark scenes . There are few gripping scenes but I can say that they are missing me . Appearance of Robert Duvall was maybe too bad . Charlize Theron was completely invisible . I think that it could be better . Maybe ending with death of father is really sad and that is what is making this movie good . Real sadness and excitements made this movie good but sometimes they aren't properly used .,The Road
183,Michael-70,This Road Is Long And Leads Nowhere!,2,25 November 2009,"I was looking forward to seeing The Road. I have not read the book by Cormac McCarthy, but then, I have never read The Wizard Of Oz, Gone With The Wind or Twilight and that has not stopped me from enjoying those films.What really interested me in seeing The Road was the fact it was an ""End Of The World"" movie. I have always loved movies that threaten, depict, portend, demonstrate or are either pre or post apocalyptic. One of the most joyous experiences I ever had at the movies was at the end of Michael Tolkin's 1991 film The Rapture when the biblical prophecies alluded to throughout the film actually came true in very imaginative ways to my great delight and this is praise coming from an atheist who finds the Bible patently ridiculous.The Road has an interesting if not very unique look and I certainly liked the bleak music score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, but it wasn't long before The Road began to go down hill. The main reason for my disappointment was the fact the film never addresses what kind of disaster it was that destroyed the Earth.I understand why that information was not necessary in the book. From what I gather, the book was less a sci-fi story about a post-apocalyptic world and more an allegory about humanity surviving, hopefully with its morals and ethics intact. In many ways, the type of disaster that has befallen the Earth is unimportant, its just the ""Maguffin"", the thing that gets the story moving and involves all the characters.But film is a very literal medium and The Road would have benefited by having had someone think a little bit more about what kind of disaster it was that has befallen the Earth.I've been criticized for focusing on this one point and I am being told by people that the actual type of disaster doesn't matter. Doesn't matter? Perhaps that's true for the book, but the entire look of the film from its physical staging, to the costumes, the make-up and production design all grow organically from whatever kind of disaster it was. Believe me, the remnants of a nuclear holocaust would look very different from say, an environmental disaster or a disease epidemic.Would it have been so difficult for the filmmakers to have selected one kind of disaster and then have focused their energies into making that reality consistent?What am I to think about the numerous conflicting visuals presented in The Road? We see huge ships, their keels broken, laying on inland highways quite far from the ocean. How did they get there? Was their massive worldwide flooding?And yes, we do know what that kind of disaster looks like. Check out photos of New Orleans post-Katrina or the coastal towns of Indonesia after the tsunami in 2004. Talk about a worldwide disaster, the massive undersea quake on December 26, 2004 caused the entire Earth to wobble about 1"" and shortened the length of the day by almost 3 micro-seconds.Much of The Road is spent wandering around in formerly tree rich areas (the film was partly shot in my home state of Pennsylvania, which believe me, North, South, East and West, we have lots of trees here), but the trees shown in this film are all dead, dried out, rotted and prone to collapse, leading to several tense scenes as Papa Viggo and Kiddie Kodi have to dodge falling timber.These massive piles of kindling are also prone to bursting into flames, in fact, many times in the film we see the characters walking through what initially appears to be snow, but actually turns out to be falling ash from those burning trees.And yet, there is an almost constant cover of dark grey clouds and copious rainfall everywhere they travel. Huh? How can the trees and the ground be so dry as to spontaneously combust, yet barely a day goes by without a drenching rainfall? I accept the fact I may be the only person who cares about this inconsistency, but I can't believe I'm the only one who's noticed it.It's because I do love ""End Of The World"" movies that I don't allow filmmakers to simply retreat into vague notions of unnamed calamity as catch-all explanation for their attempts at heightened drama and forced action. This is a cop-out in the same way bad sci-fi films use the vagueness of ""time travel"" to cover over their creators lack of even trying to make their stories plausible.Come on filmmakers, you're the ones spending millions of dollars here, you're the ones asking me to spend two hours of my life here, it is your job to make the best film you can and if you slack off on the hard stuff, like making a film that makes sense, even within the limited frame of reference and reality you are creating, then I have every right to call you out on it.I have had some friends of mine tell me that I should simply view The Road as a tense story of survival between a father and his young son. This is the wrong way to approach me. I am not a person who is automatically concerned simply because a character in jeopardy happens to be a child. My general attitude is ""F**K"" the children. Far from being the key to our future, I have seen too many contemporary adult lives ruined by kids.Am I being unnecessarily hard on the filmmakers? Perhaps, but film-making is a hard job and if you are not up to the task, well, they always have room on the night shift at McDonalds.But don't travel down this road, unless you like being disappointed.",The Road
184,GethinVanH,Survivor men,8,7 December 2009,"There's dark days ahead in The Road when a man and his son are one of a few scattered number of people left on the continent after a major natural disaster. For the past half century writers have been obsessed with the idea of humanity's ultimate demise. It's a nightmare that perhaps came to light with the development of the nuclear bomb and Nagasaki and Hiroshima.With more environmental disasters on the horizon and memories of Hurricane Katrina and the 2009 typhoon season which killed 2500 people in Asia, this movie is especially timely. Movies like The Road are more terrifying than any disaster-fest Roland Emmerich can dream up because of their realism.The Road is based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy who also wrote ""No Country For Old Men"". His books seem to feature few female characters and are mostly about men among men in the darkest situations. This is definitely a dick flick. When the women go to see Twilight, the guys can always sneak off and see The Road.The movie itself is very good. Utterly suspenseful and very grim to look at. It's a unique post-apocalyptic world that makes me think of images seen after the explosion of Mount St. Helen's in the US or maybe just Ottawa, Ontario in the winter. Everything is very grey, desolate and sepia toned. The adds brilliantly to the tenseness and bleakness of the movie.Viggo Mortensen is very good as the father ""Papa"" who will do anything to help his son survive as he's the last thing he has in this world. His love extends to even giving his son a gun with two bullets so he can kill himself rather than fall in the hands of cannibals roaming the countryside. Yes, it's pretty bleak but the movie actually leaves out some of the darker elements of the book which couldn't be shown on film.Viggo's on screen son is played by Kodi Smit-McPhee and he's very capable as the only point of hope in the whole movie. While the father is resolved to do anything to help his son survive, the son frequently has empathy for every person they meet along the road. He's a little Jesus figure among a world full of cannibals and thieves. It's something the movie definitely needs.This is one of the better movies of the year. Charlize Theron also appears in flashbacks as a troubled mother who doesn't want to exist or survive in the post-apocalyptic world. Yes, she's kind of the stereotypical ""weak woman"" but I understand the underlying point, this movie is primarily about the love between father and son. It's based on the relationship McCarthy had with his own son.The setting is pretty bleak and so are those creepy redneck cannibals but the characters show a lot of hope and the spirit of human survival against all adversities. The movie has the tone of something like a holocaust movie but it also has the spirit of humans doing what they can to see the light at the end of the tunnel.",The Road
185,the_rattlesnake25,"""Night's dark beyond darkness and the days more gray each one than what had gone before.""",8,24 January 2010,"In the post-apocalyptic wasteland of America, a Man (Viggo Mortensen) and his Boy (Kodi Smit-McPhee) travel the road hoping to avoid the 'bad' people, and ultimately stay alive as along as humanly possible. Based on Cormac McCarthy's (Blood Meridian, No Country For Old Men) 2006 acclaimed novel 'The Road', the film is more about how we and our loved ones cope after a devastating event as much as it is about survival in the harshest environments left on Earth. John Hillcoat treats McCarthy's original novel with the utmost respect and admiration. Almost never deviating from the original story, to create an almost perfect adaptation from page-to-screen, the film itself will certainly leave an impression upon you.There was a flash, and then civilization collapsed. Whether it was nuclear war, global warming or something entirely different, neither the film nor the novel actually confirms what was happened. Many have speculated that the event in question may have been a global nuclear war; however in the context of the story, what almost destroyed all civilization on Earth, is irrelevant. Instead the story spends its time looking at the aftermath. The Boy is born into a post-apocalyptic life where he may never know the wonders that went before him. The Man's Wife becomes a painful distant memory of how only those strong in the mind survive such atrocities. And the Man himself takes on the various jobs from being an educator and carer to the most important job of most adults lives: a parent.This is where 'The Road' decides to spend its time, looking, admiring, scrutinizing and acknowledging the relationship between father (Man) and son (Boy). The most important aspect of any parent's life is the wellbeing of their child. While the Man must strive to keep his son healthy, fed and ultimately alive, he must also induct him into the world of adulthood at the earliest possible time. The Man acknowledges that he won't be around forever, and that he must provide his Boy with all the help he can offer, to allow him to continue to survive, live and prosper for an the longest period of time after his own inevitably passing. And this father and son relationship is exemplified beautifully by both Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee, who both give fantastic performances that keep the film ticking over until the heart-wrenching climax.Despite only being thirteen years of age at the time of filming, Kodi Smit-McPhee at times eclipses Mortensen's on-screen performance and shows that just like his character, that he is mature beyond his age. When his father offers him a can of Coca-Cola (possibly one of the very few left in existence), the Boy is hesitant to gulp it down quickly and selfishly like most dehydrated children would. Instead he offers the drink to his father, who is clearly ill, and this shows the audience that he has already started on his transition to the responsibilities of adulthood. While this 'ascension', also creates a personal crisis within Mortensen's character. He understands that his Boy must more self-sufficient as he will not be alive forever, however at the same time he wishes, as any parent would, for his son keep some of the childhood innocence and in a sense, the protection of a father.Aside from the astounding central performances, the direction of Hillcoat, cinematography of Javier Aguirresarobe and the editing of Jon Gregory combine together to create the post-apocalyptic wasteland in which the Man and his Boy walk among daily. This bleak landscape is coated in ash, darkness and destruction to draw the audience into an environment where everything is dying. And this is accompanied by the fact we are never shown the world before the 'apocalyptic event' or during, we are only ever introduced to the outside world in the aftermath, after all there is no point dwelling on the past. Beautifully shot, carefully adapted and brilliantly acted, 'The Road' should certainly be on the edge of the cinematic community's lips come the awards season.",The Road
186,EchoMaRinE,a better job could have been done,7,28 February 2010,"The darkest movie I have seen for a long time. Honestly, what were they thinking. The darker we make, the more post-apocalyptic the movie is or what. OK, this is one of these movies if you say something bad, people tells you didn't get the point. You will be told this is an adaptation from a brilliant book and how can a low life like you can criticize it. First of all, there is no new idea in the movie (if there is an idea at all). There are dozens of post-apocalyptic movies, something (usually a nuclear war) happens, everything dies, the survivors units to save the mankind. What ever you add to this algorithm is your post-apocalyptic movie. The problem is there is nothing extraordinary happening in this movie. People brutally suffer and wait for their death. I must give some credits to the performance of Mortensen but for the overall movie, a better job could have been done.",The Road
187,J_Trex,Outstanding Adaptation,10,25 November 2009,"I read Cormac McCarthy's novel a few years ago & figured it would be made into a movie (this was when ""No Country for Old Men"" was playing) but I wondered how they could make this extremely grim tale into something that people would want to see.This film was every bit as grim as the novel and it seemed to be a faithful adaptation of it. The characters seemed more believable in the film than in the novel. This is probably due to the medium but Viggio Mortenson did a fabulous job as the Protagonist (the unnamed father) and his son was also great. They both were tremendous and brought a lot of character development and engagement to an otherwise totally bleak story.I loved Robert Duvall's turn as the grizzled survivor. It was a supporting role sure to win an Oscar nomination. I think this will win more than its share of Oscar nominations, for Viggio at the very least.Great film, go check it out.",The Road

Then again you could say this is part of the problem. The movie is flat grey and lifeless in itself. I found it hard to maintain an interest, and was not helped by much of the dialogue being inaudible. The characters are pitchforked into a dire hopeless situation without anything happening in advance of this for the viewer to develop any sympathy with them. They keep talking about shooting themselves and honestly you wish they would to put themselves out of their misery. About the only good thing that happens is that they find a shelter full of supplies and gain momentary relief. So what then? .. they up and leave it! You know that everything on the road is BAD and is going to get WORSE. With this understood, somehow any suspense is lacking, you're just waiting for the inevitable. Then at the end it's depicted that some good people appear with helpful intent. And we're supposed to believe this? Watch out kid - they must be feeding that dog MEAT.",The Road
189,cwbellor,The most heartwarming road movie you will ever watch!,9,31 August 2012,"The Road is the most powerful dedication to the color grey that has ever been committed to film. Or is it the color brown? Whatever the case, your memory of this movie certainly won't be vibrant. And that is why it is so beautiful. After all, the only real truth is that which you can find in tragedy and despair or in a basement filled with naked gloom and guts. And amidst all this is the ever present question, how far would a father go for his son? Would he save the tastiest bug for him? Would he provide him the gun to off himself as the cannibals close in? The answer to both questions is a heartfelt yes. The Road is a truly heartwarming road movie about a father and son trying to make their way through a weary wasteland. Unfortunately that wasteland is the American heartland which has become less about ""home-is-where-the-heart-is"" and more about eating hearts. Viggo and son try their best not to interrupt any cannibal clan's morbid mealtime as they make their way to the beach. Keep the Kleenex and barf bags handy.",The Road

192,rpvanderlinden,The Apocalypse Just Isn't Any Fun Anymore!,1,4 February 2011,"There's a line in a Talking Heads song: ""Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens."" Apparently, so is Hell, at least the hell-on-Earth depicted in this movie. Yes, events do occur sporadically, but they seem pointless and don't advance the story in any meaningful way. A few minutes into the movie I thought, ""Is this just going to be a grim and depressing ordeal?"" It was. It's an apocalyptic road movie, like ""The Book of Eli"", but without the latter's ideas, drive and exuberance. It's about a father and son, both so grimy that you can't see any flesh tones (you wouldn't anyway, because of the grimy photography), trekking aimlessly through a grimy wasteland toward an ocean. Some may find art in this, but I'm predisposed to wanting a STORY. I'm not a picky person - I can overlook many incongruities in a movie if it's got something going for it - but I have to agree with other reviewers who are aghast that the characters would simply abandon a hidden bomb shelter loaded with food. And the father's swim to a damaged ship through surging ocean waves in sub-zero temperatures, without a hint of hypothermia, had me crying in disbelief. (It rivals the scene in ""Independence Day"" when Will Smith's wife escapes the inferno in the tunnel by ducking into a tiny room without bothering to close the door and emerges - have I got this right? - without even a single hair singed, or a nail chipped, and with no depletion of the oxygen supply). What did he salvage from the ship? Some flares, one of which, after being fired, lights up a man like a Chinese lantern (Hollywood movie-makers just love to play with flares).I was touched by the relationship between the father and son. It seemed real. The thing with the gun and the father instructing the son how to use it for suicide was such a heavy moment that I thought it was going to lead somewhere, but it fizzled out. The kid kept asking if they were the good guys, which was the right question to ask, but the movie pounded that theme to death. But here's the big jaw-dropper in the movie, for me: The father dies and the kid is left alone. We don't really want that, do we? Especially in a world inhabited almost exclusively by murderous riffraff. So what does the kid encounter on the beach? Out of nowhere? A nuclear family. That's right. A dad, a mom, a little girl, a little boy and a cute puppy dog. I was craning my neck looking for the SUV. It couldn't have been more incongruous had the Simpsons shown up on the beach. (If only! Can you imagine Marge's bad hair days?). Now I haven't read the Cormac McCarthy novel, but if it ends the same way it must have been presented, via the written word, in a context that the movie was not able to duplicate without making it ridiculous. Maybe the novel should have been left alone. It sure seems that way.",The Road

194,dfwforeignbuff,Road of Despair. So Much Despair you would think Bergman made this film,7,2 March 2010,"Opening of movie On screen: NOTICE: THE FAINT OF HEART SHOULD TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAVE NOW & GET REFUND. A father & his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind & water. It is cold enough to crack stones, &, when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the warmer south, although they don't know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing: just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless cannibalistic bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a rusting shopping cart of scavenged food-& each other. The last adaptation of a Cormac McCarthy novel won the Best Picture Oscar. Though nihilistic & violent, the Coen Brothers' No Country for Old Men conveyed the poetry of McCarthy's spare prose. This bummer about a father (Mortensen) & son (K Smit-McPhee) in a post-apocalyptic world does not convey any sense of poetry or lyricism, either visually or through the dialogue & narration. We're meant to be touched by the will-to-live the man tries to instill in his progeny as they evade cannibals & battle the elements. But it's clear the movie has been heavily reedited; the ending rings false; & the music is overbearingly & sentimental. At a running time of 2 hours, The Road manages to be tedious, dull & anticlimactic despite decent performances & exquisite cinematography filled with bleak images. It's ultimately an underwhelming experience that lacks emotional resonance. The Road is still one of the year's most rewarding experiences. Despair has been the cornerstone of many a great motion picture, yet ""The Road"" never transcends misery. Challenging for sure, but gratifying nonetheless. John Hillcoat's depiction of the dying world is unrelenting & at times almost too much to bear but we're always calmed by the powerful love displayed between a father & son. The Road will represent different things to different viewers. It defies typical brand classification. However it is still A Powerful film.",The Road
195,Jona1988,Chilling post apocalyptic experience !,8,27 September 2016,"First let me state that I have not read the book and I knew nothing about it or this film before seeing it. This is one of the most disturbing films I've seen in a while, not in a scary kind of way but it is so sad and gloomy and absolutely thought-provoking. It is a film that in a way wants to deliver an experience as much as tell a story. Since one doesn't get much of a background it is often left to the viewer to make your own assumptions of several parts of the film. In some movies this might feel frustrating and thin writing. Not so here it is totally to the advantage. There are some glimpses of the background which intrigues one even more. They have really succeeded in using a visual spectacle to create the post-apocalyptic atmosphere unlike much I have seen before. The plot might be pretty straight forward but like I indicated here earlier it's not the point of the film. The acting is phenomenal. Viggo Mortensen is great, his performance and character is just like the overall feel of the film. The direction is also just great, perfectly balancing all aspects to create such a strong experience. Heavy, strong, depressing and sad. This is one that you really should watch, it's so well done I will actually claim that it has a message to give. Amazing movie. Just as good as it is disturbing. And that is very.",The Road
196,idonotexist,The nothing,4,14 March 2010,"I haven't read the novel to judge the interpretation in the movie, but the movie left a lot to be desired.The boy's character was utterly annoying. I realize he is supposed to be raised in post world and socially and emotionally neutered but he comes off as a retarded pacifist that learned nothing about survival from his father who was teaching him that every day. Perhaps they tried to portray another side of society, as in the future isn't all savage. however that does NOT work and it fights the rest of the script up until the end.The flashbacks serve nothing more but explain why the father takes the routes and visits the places he does; he is chasing his memories of pre end world hoping for some normality. Fine. But we get it there is no world left so they serve as time fillers - The movie is low budget, lacks spatial variety and might as well have been filmed in my backyard. So they used no CGI, give you some credit. But how exactly do you expect to pull the end of the world without it? For 2 hours? And immerse the viewer into it? Simple, you fail to do that.Boring. That is subjective and i know what the movie was trying to do. It is a relationship drama with some ""here is how bad people are"" moments thrown in so that it wouldn't be completely pointless. Maybe that works in a book where you can use your imagination but here, when you are shown and told things, the road plays like a lullaby.There is no excuse for making 2 hours of nothing, 90% of which was headshots of bad acting with very badly applied black cream as dirt. It lacks energy, it lacks substance, it lacks viewer interaction. At the end i couldn't care who lived or died. in fact, i wanted to see somebody get shot in the face only because i was longing for something, ANYTHING to happen.This and the book of eli... who approved them?

197,LaurieMann,Uneven Road But Worthwhile,8,25 November 2009,"I managed to stay up for the 12:01 premiere in Pittsburgh late last night with about 50 other Pittsburghers. I'm glad the movie started with some establishing shots of what life was like ""before."" It's almost idyllic; almost Eden-like. These brief and dreamlike passages helped provide a vivid contrast to everything that happens later. About ten years after a global catastrophe, a ragged Father and Boy travel across a wasted countryside. They see few people, and most of them are as dirty and hungry as they are. And, frankly, the only word for this situation is bleak. If you make a movie about the end of the world with a very muted palette, there's no other word for it! It took a while for the movie to get rolling. One thing Cormac McCarthy did very well in the book was to give a good sense of real geography. In the movie, Father and Boy go through random parts of the country, as if they were just wandering. Mountains became plains, and clearly ocean-going boats appeared on a dry riverbed when they were still very far away from the ocean. There wasn't even a single sign for ""See Rock City."" ;-> You never had the sense as you did in the book of the painful slog up and down the mountains. The most damaged countryside is seen extremely early in the movie, which probably wasn't the best choice. At one point near the end, Father and Boy spend a few days next to the ""ocean"" and there's no tide. Another odd choice by the filmmakers were the constant extreme close-ups, so you could see every bit of grime on the characters. In some scenes, the cameras were so close to the actors that the actors looked very flat. The two times when the close-ups were very effective were the ones of Eli and towards the end of the movie. Despite these criticisms, the movie looks right. The art direction and most of the photography was absolutely spot-on. The locations selected generally worked very well (my criticism about the traveling was more of the director's, editor's and maybe the writer's choices). There was certainly enough grime to go around even if the ash situation was generally played down. And what about the acting? Viggo Mortensen gave one of the best performances of recent years. Kodi Smit-McPhee deserves very high praise for playing one of the trickiest roles for a kid actor in years and pulling off an American accent flawlessly. A few people have criticized Smit-McPhee's performance, but I think he matched Mortensen point-for-point. And I would actually have liked to see a little more Charlize Theron. While Mother appeared in a few more scenes in the movie than she had in the book, much of her long fight with Father wasn't included. Robert Duvall and Michael K. Williams were great in small parts. I had mixed feelings about Guy Pearce, just because he felt ""a little evil."" Another controversial area in this movie has been its music. I think the criticism was partially justified. The use of the slightly-out-of-tune piano for the keyboard was an excellent choice. But, particularly in the ""tension"" scenes, the music was too much. And it got overly Disnified at the very end, along with the movie itself for about a minute. It's not a perfect movie, but it is a worthwhile one, and I recommend seeing it. 7.5 out of 10.

198,CaptRon-2,What happened to the Planet,9,26 November 2009,"Several of m y friends and co-workers have seen the movie and/or recently read the book and wondered what happened to the planet. While neither the book nor movie provides any specifics, I will share my thoughts based on the data available in both sources of material. The most likely explanation is a Mantle Eruption. We know of one such event on the planet approximately 750 million years ago. As a result, Earth became a solid ball of ice with oceans freezing to over a mile in thickness. The story does little to explain what happened but we do pick up bits and pieces along the way. We are led to believe the event happened quickly with little time to prepare. The sky was completely obscured and the planet's temperature is rapidly dropping. The earth is generally covered in ash and there are continual earthquakes suggesting heavy shifting of the tectonic plates. The event occurred within 10 years of the man and boy's journey. During that time, all wildlife was destroyed which indicates something occurred on a global scale larger than any mankind can produce (neither of the source material refers to any radiation hazards eliminating a nuclear strike). Along the way the boy questions what is on the other side of the ocean. While it is pure speculation, the father's answer of ""nothing"" might indicate such event occurred on the other side of the planet and thus nothing survived. However, one supporting statement in the movie refers to a brilliant flash a light followed by two smaller ones. While this may support the other two theories as well, it is possible the eruptions and subsequent follow-up events could have been witnessed by some individuals and reported from far away. The next most likely possibility is an impact from a massive space object. Such an event would support the three flashes of brilliant light. This would align with the entrance into our atmosphere and, if large enough, could have shifted the earth causing earthquakes, volcanoes and explain the ash. This would also support the ""nothing"" statement in the movie (although the father's later story about another father and son sitting on the opposite shore was likely just something to keep his son going) as the impact may have struck the opposite of the planet destroying most things at the point of impact. Both the mantel eruption and impact of a space object are equally plausible. The last likely scenario would be a mass corneal ejection (nothing to do with the recent movies dealing with this subject). While it would explain many of the events and the general lifelessness of the planet, there are a few holes in that theory such as why the planet is rapidly growing colder, the experiencing of earthquakes, and the general level of the ocean remaining constant. While it really isn't important to the storyline of an overall solid book and above average movie, those that are curious have something to think about. As for the possibility of a military event, it is highly unlikely. None of the source material ever refers to the military, and the fairly accurate movie doesn't depict any military vehicles, civil defense, and the aforementioned radiation areas. In essence, the earth suffered a natural event (internally or earth bound objects) and life will eventually die out. Because of man's ability to think and reason as well as the availability of limited tools and technology, he will likely last longer than most mammals but ultimately suffer the same fate.",The Road
199,shiannedog,Are we there yet?,5,15 June 2021,"Alright then... after watching this movie I've decided that I don't want to experience post apocalyptic existence on earth. Mainly because no one is allowed to wash their hands and you can't know who are the good guys. This movie has so many holes that It's impossible to critique. It appears the film makers wanted to present a narrow story rather than a well rounded one. That's ok but then make the trip a little shorter and you'll have fewer holes to fill.

200,Jules45,"Lack of scenery, characters or diverse plot and yet The Road proves to be a powerful post-apocalyptic movie.",8,28 January 2010,"It's very tough to make some films sound appealing to someone who you want to watch it with without making them look at you like you have escaped rehab or just plain miserable to see such a sombre film. For example when you are trying to convince someone to go and see this with you by saying: ""It's a journey in post-apocalyptic America of a dad and son as they try to make their way south through the deserted wasteland"" it's unlikely to have a massive appeal at first glance, but the expression 'Never judge a book (or in this case film) by it's cover (or trailer)' couldn't be more true for The Road.Though we never know the cause of the devastation (which makes a nice change to leave it up to the viewer to decide) we are shown a series of flashbacks which cleverly depict the sort of ordeal it has had upon the world and the family which the story follows.A simple basis which is fantastically acted by Viggo and Kodi whose relationship really makes the movie so enjoyable and such a powerful drama. Few other characters are seen, other than people they meet upon travelling or else Charlize Theron in flashbacks (though don't expect to see her much in this gents). But the lack of characters gives the father-son relationship a lot more room to grow and it's easier to appreciate the few luxuries they do experience (it's amazing how watching two starved tramps eat some fresh food is such a rewarding experience).So yes The Road is inevitably lacking in a lot of things which almost any successful film depends on. But it's uniquely different and actually makes you genuinely sympathise with the lead characters which is a definite worthwhile visit.",The Road

202,rupert-ian,"Not bad, but a few annoying points",7,11 February 2018,"Ok, this movie isn't bad. It entertains me when I'm on a post-apocalyptic movie kick. The camera work and settings are well done. The acting is good. The story is decent overall, besides a few parts that always annoy me. I'll go over those:1. The kid. He's way too old to be such a absolute sissy. I know he's had a rougher life than any of us can imagine, but wouldn't that more likely make him a tough little dude? He constantly cries and whines. It would have been a much more effective movie if he were a) younger, b) a girl, or c) tougher2. The cache of food and supplies they find. I guess that was put there by the only anti-gun survivalists in the USA? All that stuff and no weapons of any kind. Nope. What good are all the supplies in the world when someone with a BB gun can take it all from you? Any survivalist knows you have to be able to defend your stash because 99.9% of people don't prepare for as much as a week long ice storm, and they will take what is yours in order to survive. Also, the reasoning for leaving it was really stupid. They heard a noise...and left their best bet to survive since the day the ""event"" happened. If it was someone hanging around to hurt them, wouldn't they have been attacked when they left? They didn't even leave in the dark. WUT?3. No good reason for going south. With no sunlight penetrating anywhere, it probably wouldn't be much warmer and there certainly wouldn't be anything growing there...Without sunlight, the ocean is as dead as the land. They could have said ""We heard there was a call for people to go there and start a community"" or something. 4. Stereotypical bad guys....another reviewer put it perfectly as ""NASCAR cannibals"" Deplorables, right? 5. A wimpy marine flare killing a guy from 50 yards away by hitting him in the chest. Nope, not gonna happen. It's an Estes rocket engine with some added metal/chemical powder to make it bright. It is no more powerful than one of the large bottle rockets you launch on the 4th.

204,puttputtk,one of the years best,10,26 May 2010,"The Road5 word Summary Family tries to survive disaster Everything is long gone. Animals, plants, people, almost everything is has died in some sort of disaster. A man and his son are trying to go south in hopes it will be better there, or at least warmer. They walk along roads that are covered with cracks, trees, and cars, hoping to find food and anything else that can help them survive. However food is not the only thing they have to worry about. Some other people have been able to survive as long as they have but have resorted to cannibalism. The man occasionally has flashbacks to their old life before the disaster and after. He remembers his wife and how much they loved each other before and how she slowly became hateful afterwards. They two have a pistol, however they only have two bullets left. Which he says are for the two of them. Through flashbacks we learn they are saving the bullets to kill themselves if they are to be captured. The two continue walking toward the coast, with both good and bad luck following them, they try to survive. The film is one of my favorites of 2009, I had a hard time deciding if this or Up in the Air would have my vote for Picture of the Year. However the Academy robbed this movie of all the awards and/or nominations it deserved. With 10 nominees for best picture it is wrong to not have picked The Road. Also the performances were great, from leading roles played by Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-Mcphee to the supporting roles of Charlize Theron, Guy Pearce and Robert Duval, everyone did fantastic. The main place where this film was robbed by award shows was Cinematography. It is easily some of my favorite Cinematography work. Everything looks so dark, and gray and dead, yet has such good contrast. The visuals are amazing, every scene where you see them walking, the background looks so bleak yet beautiful and balanced. its hard to imagine it didn't get nominated. When I originally read the plot of the film I was worried. The whole thing about cannibalism made me think it was going to be ridiculous and zombie like, with people eating people raw or whatever. The film however was nothing like that. It was much more tastefully done than I had expected, and very realistic. This movie also has, in my opinion, one of the tensest scenes I've seen. But I don't want to tell you which one. My only problem with the film is the ending which I find to be a bit of a cop out, or too easy. Not the end I was hoping for, but it didn't really ruin if for me. I'd suggest this film to pretty much anyone. Though the Pulitzer Prize winning book is written by the same guy as No Country for Old Men, I wouldn't say you have to like one to like the other, or will hate one if you hate the other. They're not alike at all (but I love both)10/10",The Road
205,Klickberg,Hollywood doing what Hollywood does,3,30 November 2009,"For those of you who have read this marvelous book and are fans of Cormac McCarthy, the answer to your question is YES, Hollywood DID IT AGAIN. They did what they do to great books, they made it completely accessible to the American IDOL crowd who only read books found on the grocery store checkout aisle. Those who keep talking about this movie as ""intellectual"" clearly aren't themselves. Plain and simple. The problem here is that this movie wasn't ""boring"" or ""slow"" ENOUGH. There's never a real moment of sincere tension fraught with a feeling of hopelessness and the dark void within. Instead, it's just choppy moments and explosions. With all that manipulative music and distracting melodrama in every moment of cloying acting, this one feels like a soap opera made by Roland Emmerich. Ironic that 2012 has also just come out with a similar story... Frankly, I continually felt Emmerich's hand in this one throughout. That they would give such an important and beloved novel to a relative novice filmmaker is beyond me and probably will be beyond you too after watching about five minutes of this made-for-TV trash. And no kudos even for the effects and background panoramas that were just as unrealistic as the tepid bond between the two main characters.What made the book--and most of McCarthy's oeuvre--so astounding and gripping is the very sparse and simple, nearly nihilistic approach the author takes in his prose. This was translated perfectly into NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (an example of what happens when the urtext is put in the hands of professionals). That movie is as deftly stark--even in the moments of great humor--as the book on which it is based. THE ROAD is, again, simply less-than-mediocre prime time television. The true shame is that a movie as ""simple"" and as earnest as the book COULD have easily been made and still would have been ""accessible"" and buzz-worthy even for the Academy Award crazed masses. Look at David Lynch's THE STRAIGHT STORY, for example. Or, for that matter, if you're truly interested in seeing what would happen if THE ROAD were adapted WELL to the big screen, check out Michael Haneke's epochal and beautifully funereal TIME OF THE WOLF (in fact, while reading THE ROAD originally, all I could think about was this fantastic movie from a true artist).

His expressions and dialogue delivery were perfect and I really hope he gets a few nominations come awards season. Also, McPhee does a fine job playing a boy born and brought up in a post-apocalyptic world; one looking for the good in people despite the odds.Overall, though this depressing movie is not for everyone, it is heartfelt and a must watch for fans of Cormac McCarthy's novel at least.",The Road

No I'm kidding, I've not read the book it's adapted from and it can't have had great advertisement as never saw it advertised. But it's one of those rare films that manages to hit you in the feels. That manages to leave you completely engrossed in it, due to it's saturated desperation and sense of urgency it tensely portrays. And only at one point in the movie is there respite from this, which you know will be brief.The film is about an apocalypse, and a mother, father and son surviving, and who's names we aren't told (and yet you still manage to feel a sense of attachment to or rooting for these characters as you watch everything unfold). The apocalypse is more one that's destroyed all wildlife and flora, leaving the planet grey, bleak and ravaged by earthquakes, the cause could be nuclear war but isn't made entirely clear. The movie reminds me of the Metro novels/games in it's setting above ground minus creatures, the movie remains very grounded.If you want a film that'll make you laugh, watch Deadpool 2, if you want a film that'll encapsulate you from start to finish and make you question things, watch this.

208,Gin-ster,Well done but did not connect,6,30 June 2013,"This film, on a familiar theme of attempting to cope in a post-apocalyptic world, had some positives. It had very good cinematography, not shying away from a consistently drab palette to the point where you were given to wonder, at times, if it had been shot in black and white. The acting was also very good, including the child who was sufficiently child-like but never cutesy, and the stolid Viggo Mortensen. However, there were a lot of problems with it that kept interfering with feeling moved by the characters and their dire plight. One was the time line. Normally I can ""suspend disbelief"" if asked to envision a fantasy situation if it is sufficiently well-realized. However, I could not understand how the nice little family shown pre-apocalypse could have survived long enough to make it to the point where SPOILER the wife dies but apparently the child is already many years old. Why were they not driven out of the house before that by the barbarous bands? I kept asking myself, if the nuclear (or whatever) attack was Day 1, Year 1, how is it that the family was able to survive intact until, say, Year 5 or 6. I realize the film wasn't about that early stage, but a later one. However, credibility was an issue all along in part because of that. Another negative was the ending which SPOILER seemed slipped in from another movie from ""happy ending land."" It didn't fit with the rest of the film that SPOILER the child who has just lost his father falls in with a kindly family, complete with dog. But the key problem all along was a lack of emotional connection, as a viewer. I cannot identify the reason for it as all actors were excellent, from the two main protagonists to the thief (played by Michael Kenneth Williams, seen in Boardwalk Empire and The Wire.).",The Road

210,trevor-mcinsley,Most Miserable Film Ever?,1,7 June 2013,"I'm struggling to think of a film more depressing and pointless than this one. Certainly it wins the prize for the film which utilises the colour grey the most, it being the thing to occupy most of the screen, most of the time. I mean if that was the overwhelming theme they were going for then so be it, well done... but as something to sit back and watch... a hanging would be cheerier.There are various bleak and apocalyptic films that pull off the darkness well by contrasting it with a glimmer of hope for the future. Children of Men for instance. In such stories it is the almost unobtainable nature of that glimmer which hammers home the darkness. Such films rely on strong plots and 'The Road' really doesn't have much of one. It is just darkness full stop and after a while your eyes get accustomed to it and you see it for what it really is. Ridiculous.Here is a brief plot synopsis: anonymous apocalypse, contemplate suicide, contemplate suicide, contemplate suicide, contemplate suicide, contemplate suicide, contemplate suicide, cannibalism, cannibalism, cannibalism, contemplate suicide, contemplate suicide, cannibalism, oh look now we have food, yummy! Cannibalism, cannibalism, cannibalism, contemplate suicide, oh no the trees are exploding again, cough up blood, contemplate suicide, where has the sea gone? Nudity, nudity, nudity, archery, ow my leg. End.Ultimately I guess the most annoying thing about this film is the ludicrously over the top apocalypse in which it is set. They clearly decided to keep it ambiguous and give no hint as to what actually happened but personally I just found this frustrating as the nature of the event is rather important to the nature of surviving it. Without an explanation for why any of these things are happening the entire film may as well be an extended dream sequence... I was about as invested in it as one.Then there are the rather forced plot devices. The gun with only two bullets... when repeatedly they come across people with rifles galore. I'm fairly sure the United States has enough guns and ammunition to well outlast the entire human race. The one brief moment of the film which isn't overly bleak is when they find the bunker full of food. Now it is clear that this bounty has to end or the film cannot progress. For a moment I thought it might flash forward five years to show the kid grown up before they have to hit the road again having eaten the last can of peaches... but no. The slightest hint of noise outside and they leave. Immediately.Virtually every moment until that point had been spent looking for food, planning to kill themselves when they failed to find any and making bizarre attempts to seemingly seek out and then flee from cannibals. Yet they willingly went right back out into that world rather than making any effort to properly conceal or defend their safe haven? A plausible reason for leaving the bunker, failing to find as much heavy weaponry as every single other person and the entire apocalypse to begin with would be nice.As I said, some films are bleak and miserable for a reason or to make a point. The Road has no point. The lead character just seems to be going out of his way to seek out these horrific situations for no explanation other than wanting to rub them in the face of the audience. This film has been called 'important', 'agonising' and 'poignant'. It is none of these things due to the inexplicable and unexplained nature of the entire apocalypse setting and the mind numbing ineptitude of the lead character.I have a theory about this film. A theory which states that the apocalypse the writer had in mind was that of overpopulation... overpopulation which caused all the trees to burst into flames for some reason. In order to avoid this very serious threat in the real world he decided to make a film designed to make as many people as possible want to kill themselves.",The Road

I haven't seen a post apocalyptic movie so grim as this one. This movie defines what can people turn in to if something like were to happen on earth. From the very start you follow the harrowing tale of a father and his son in a world literally turned to hell. And although we see how cruel and savage mankind has become, the story focuses on how the main characters can keep their humanity and compassion throughout the movie. At a point The Man (Viggo Mortensen) has to show a little cruelty to survive, but the boy (Kodi Smit-McPhee) reminds him that they are the good guys and they have to carry the fire. Among all the horrors shown in the film, the relationship between the boy and the father is heartwarming and touching as a representation of love and a compassion long forgotten.

Compared to this, ""Shindler's List"" is about as dark as ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.""I am impressed at the consistency and thoroughness of the direction, however. The unrelentingly tedious, dark, dreary, dragging storyline is in perfect sync with the unrelentingly tedious, dark, dreary, dragging performances, cinematography, music, etc. Now, a lot of people who have not been happy with this movie and wonder what the purpose of it is need to use their imaginations a little. Reaching down deep for a sub-atomic particle of optimism, I think I may have found it. I can see this film being quite successfully employed by psychiatrists trying to help out those who are clinically suicidal. The way it would work is like this: the patient would be required to sit through this film without interruption, and then at the end, the psychiatrist turns to the patient and says ""See, things could always be worse!""However, one could argue that this film is about the perseverance to survive in spite of enormous odds against, the dedicated love between father and son amidst very difficult circumstances. The trouble is, that movie has already been made. It's called ""The Pursuit of Happiness."" And the big difference between that film and this one is that ""Pursuit"" actually has a practical, highly inspirational message that doesn't have you lunging for the razor blades or the jar of sleeping pills by the end.",The Road

They easily escape from the red necks and spending the rest of the film waiting for some kind of repercussion they're nothing , we don't see them again.Another pointless, stupid part of the movie is when they find a bunker , full of food and supplies , and leave it because they hear a noise , even though it hasn't been touched for ten years , they leave the safe sealed bunker and venture off back into the wilderness.The boy is annoying , whining all the time , falling over all the time and the movie would have been a lot more entertaining if he was just left to the cannibals . I didn't feel any gripping moment in the movie at all, it just didn't deliver and I was bored the whole time .",The Road
214,flickernatic,A road not worth travelling,2,20 January 2010,"I read recently that the monster hit movie, Avatar, is inducing in some moviegoers feelings of severe depression and even suicide. These people, who in yesteryear were referred to as 'those of a nervous disposition' and advised to stay away from disturbing films, should on no account settle in for a viewing of The Road. Not only is its subject-matter depressing - the wanderings of lost souls in a 'post-apocalyptic' world where cannibalism is rife due to food shortages, everything is dead or dying, the sea has turned grey and there is no prospect of the situation improving - but this gruesome tale is not convincingly told.As other reviewers have pointed out,there are are number of obviously implausible scenes, but the feature that struck me as most jarring was that despite supposedly starving,everyone looks far too well-fleshed. Not much sign of suffering for one's art here.Even as a morality tale - in an evil world, there are still those who remain good - it fails to meet its portentous aspirations. It's just all too clunky. And as for the kid - too cute by far.So there's nothing uplifting here. The depressives who watch Avatar are at least being entertained along the way.",The Road

Also one of the most emotional and at the same time most disturbing movies, and surprisingly it trough in the mix few laughs. A movie that made the meal I had after seeing it one of the best. The director was obviously very focused finding a perfect balance between the hard and soft side. The emotional side was heartbreaking and touching, but He didn't let to become pathetic, not even for a single second, which is a great danger for this kind of stories.",The Road
216,PippinInOz,Bravely Bleak,9,9 May 2011,"Watched this several hours ago now and still going back to it in my mind. While an interested viewer and reader of dystopian end of the world stories - WELL!Agree with some other contributors here, when they say, this is a tough view. In fact, it has taken me several glasses of red wine and a good dinner before I can comment. So please forgive the emotional response.The only other film I have seen directed by John Hillcoat is 'The Proposition' which I also love. Sent me and my husband out of the cinema in Perth, Western Australia out of the dark into a blazing hot sunshine day in Leederville. Stunned into silence. Same with this film. Stunningly realised. Almost unwatchable at times (in a good way if you know what I mean - and if you do - then go see it) and also incredibly, surprisingly deeply moving. If you ever wondered 'What would I do with a young child and what would I teach them?' if the world went to bits - then this really is for you. There are no easy 'nice communes' here.My favourite piece of the film is half way through - when the little boy holds the old man's hand. Try watching without the hairs standing up on the back on of your neck and maybe a tear. Sorry to be emotional, but really this is about 'us' right now. Do you become a cannibal or do you reach out and hold someone's hand? Perhaps it is a question in this time of internet 'footage' we need to ask ourselves? Yes, me as well.Deep, sad, horrifying and bleak, with an oddly optimistic finish. My daughter said it gave her nightmares - I know why. While this film might talk about 'good guys' it also says so much about the contemporary world. What do YOU / ME become? A cannibal? Or keep hold of your humanity? Let us hope it is the latter. Thank you Mr. Hillcoats for another stunningly chilling glimpse of just what humanity is and can be. It's up to you and me really. xxxxx EVEN IF YOU ONLY WATCH IT ONCE, WATCH IT.

And people who are gold bugs tend to believe in the end of the world and how they will be the only ones that will survive. Yet I always think in the back of the mind that when the world collapses it will not be romantic like fight club. It will be like this movie.This movie is hard to watch, much like Blood Diamonds, but it is good. Yes it is slow, and not constant action. That is the point of the movie to illustrate how when the world ends it is not constant action. Many reviews talk about how dark and bleak the scenery is. I think the scenery is a nice back drop on the fact that life in the world has boiled down to basics and essentials. It is not about reading books, playing games, or listening to music. It is a never ending constant fight for survival and sanity.Throughout the movie I was just shocked and riveted by the actions, and it was not until the end of the movie where I felt like crying. Not because of sadness, but because of the mixed emotions of the situation. A sort of relief valve mechanism. I write this as I am ripping my movies from DVD to a personal online iTunes media server, and can't get the thought out of mind that it has been a long time since I watched a movie with this amount of emotion.Good job all around...",The Road
218,JoaoPovoaMarinheiro,Human Cannibalism,8,13 April 2010,"I have few words to describe this precious piece of work. It made me feel in a way I haven't felt for ages. To be honest, I've never seen Hilcoat's 'The Proposition' and so I went in without knowing anything about this director's style. However, this man achieved to maintain a really strong balance between disturbing and touching, crude and sensibility. The plot is, as it looks like, faithful to Cormac Mcarthy's book and focus on the story of a father and his son's survival in a disturbingly close apocalyptic world were human cannibalism reigns, here shown in a graphic and psychological way. The movie's intensity really made me uncomfortable, but the anonymous father and son pair petrified and touched me, specially due to the two main actors' performances, with an always incredible Viggo Mortensen and a surprisingly powerful Kodi Smit-McPhee (a serious case to follow for the future). Charlize Theron was the only critical point this film had. As to me, the flashbacks and her presence little or nothing add to 'The Road'. Finishing up, I still remain septic by the fact that this wasn't nominated for the Academy Awards, as it could had gone far and is undoubtedly, one of 2009's best movies - 9/10.",The Road

The film involves very little action. For the most part it's grim, dark, dreary, and depressing. It trudges along at the same pace as the starving, freezing, desperate characters, which is, as you might expect, not too fast.Okay...so it's grim dark, dreary and depressing, you say...could be fascinating just the same! No, it's not...there's no explanation as to why the landscape is so desolate. I guess one night everything just died. Or caught on fire. Or something. Nobody can explain.

220,Hint523,Above Expectations,9,26 November 2009,"I really have got to get used to reviewing adaptations of books, because they come out all the time. But reviewing them is so much different it almost doesn't seem fair. A movie like Watchmen would have seemed completely different had I not read the book. It just changes the playing field completely and usually not in a good way. However, it's not going away anytime soon.Let me start by saying how I came across the book ""The Road"", by Cormac McCarthy. It was about two years ago this time, and I was talking to my dorm parent about Children of Men, a movie that was so clearly well made and excellent, but I was left frustrated with it. Without giving too much away, Children of Men left me with no closure because the entire purpose of the movie seemed to be finding the cure, and the movie ends before they find it. In other words, it left too much unsaid, and for that, storyline alone, I gave it a 4/10. My dorm parent mentioned that if I didn't like Children of Men I probably wouldn't like The Road, because it gives you absolutely no information about what happened, it just tells you a story of a father and a son traveling in a post-apocalyptic world. Intrigued, and being a fan of Cormac McCarthy, I bought the book at the airport and on my way home for Thanksgiving, read the entire book. I really couldn't have imagined reading it any other way. Because the book has no chapters, and because it is so engaging, you have to read it in one sitting.A movie was inevitable from such a great story, especially hot off of No Country For Old Men's success. And the road (haha) to this movie's release has been long and slow. It got delayed a whole year, which made me apprehensive as to how good a film it was. So as I entered the movie theater last night, almost two years to the date since I read the book, I was nervous. Would this be another I Am Legend? Or would this capture the greatness of the book?The plot of the film and the movie are the same: a father and a son are some of the last remaining people on earth after an unexplained tragedy has happened. The two are just trying to survive, by heading south. Along the way they encounter many problems, but the heart of the story is in the relationship between the two characters, and the plot is minimal.Director John Hillcoat's last film, The Proposition, was an attempt to revive the dead genre of the Western. And it was brilliant in so many ways, but I especially liked how the setting was displayed in the film. You can taste the nasty feeling of 1850 Australia in The Proposition. And that's why he's a great fit for The Road, because he brings us into a setting very well. And in The Road he does this again, maybe not as well, but considering he has no source material other than the novel, he does a very good job at conveying this dead world. I enjoyed seeing all of the eclectic images of destruction he brought to this film. Images from the Yellowstone fire, Mount Saint Helens, and Hurricane Katrina were compiled together to create this world, as well as some decent special effects. My favorite image from the film is when the go on an overpass. The overpass stuck with me.The acting of the two leads is superb. Viggo Mortensen continues to impress me as a fantastic actor. When I was reading the book I imagined him as Djimon Hounsou, but Mortensen encompasses the character extremely well. Newcomer Kodi Smit-McPhee is just as good, and together they carry the entire film on their shoulders, and they do it effortlessly. My only complaint with the film is that because there is no driving plot, my guess is it could become tedious and hard to follow if you didn't read the book. Overall the fear and the relationship moved the story enough to keep me interested, but I can see how a lack of structure could be tedious to some. The tone and art direction are spot on, the acting is excellent, the story is a perfect adaptation of the book, but it isn't a groundbreaking film. The Road is as good as adaptations get, one of the best I have ever seen. It wasn't a white-knuckle film the way No Country was, nor was it nearly as well directed. But, it's a riveting and engaging film, and it's a fantastic story of two characters. In the end, that's enough of a reason for it to be a great movie. As for my expectations: it blew me away. Despite a delay and a bad trailer, The Road is an impressive film. My Rating: 9/10",The Road

There is a great focus on cannibalism and the lack of food, because everything is basically dead. I don't buy that basically everybody is driven to cannibalism. In the real world even in times of great need, the cases of cannibalism is very few. I don't think people give up and end it with suicide that often either. People tend to stick together in groups because that increases the chance of survival.

223,willwoodmill,A bleak hopeless adaptation of a bleak hopeless novel,7,25 April 2016,"The Road seems to be trying to win the ""least fun movie of all-time award."" It's definitely up there with films like The Turin Horse, Bad Lieutenant, and Irréversible. And you know what, there's nothing wrong with that. Several of the films, (like the ones previously mentioned and several others.) that try to be depressing and miserable end up being really great. However many films that try to do the same thing, end up being dull and just not worth watching. But Where does The Road lie? Well I'm happy to say that it's for sure on the good side. The Road was directed by John Hillcoat and is based off of a Cormac McCarthy Novel of the same name. Both the film and the novel are about a post-apocalyptic world, where there are nearly no survivors and most of the people who are still alive have became savage killers and have resorted to cannibalism to survive. In this desolate wasteland, a boy (played by Kodi Smit-McPhee.) and his father (played by the wonderful Viggo Mortensen.) desperately move down the road, trying to reach the coast before winter hits. We never learn the names of the boy and his father, (or the boy and the man as there called in McCarthy's novel.) which adds to the films miserable tone. We follow their journey though abandoned towns and houses, as they try to avoid roaming bandits and killers. Since it's an adaptation of a McCarthy novel, you can expect it to be bleak and violent. And the film really does a good job of capturing the absolute bleakness of a Cormac McCarthy novel. The cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe is absolutely perfect even though it mainly consents of two colors gray and black. (which is okay since that's how the world is described in the book.) No matter where our protagonists go, they are almost always surrounded by dark clouds, dead trees, and faded houses. The cinematography really does a great job of putting the audience in the right mindset. The actors also do a really good job of putting the audience in the right mindset. It's a shame none of them were nominated for any major awards because all of the main actors deserved to be. Viggo Mortensen lives up to the standard he's set for himself, and Kodi Smit-McPhee gives one of the better child actor performances out there. Charlize Theron plays the man's wife/the boy's father, and even though she's only in flashback scenes, she's able to give a lasting and memorable performance. Robert Duvall plays another small role in the film. And again it's great. I'm not sure what direction John Hillcoat gave the actors in the film, but whatever it was it sure worked. In nearly every scene they all look like they just want to give up and end their lives, but they just keep trudging down the road.The Road is unfortunately not a perfect movie, it still has several flaws despite its many achievements. The biggest of which is the product placement. This only happens twice in the movie, and while the first time is only moderately annoying, the second time is unforgivable. I won't spoil the scene, but they go as far as flat out saying the name of the product. That one scene, which is located roughly half way through the film, completely derails the entire movie. Destroying the tone and atmosphere that the film was trying so very hard to reach. Another problem I have with the film is a scene later on involving a chase in an open field. The scene is just sloppily handled, not to mention that it's over the top and does not fit with the rest of the film. There are some other minor things that didn't work. But I don't wanna nitpick every single bad thing in The Road, because overall it's a really solid film, that I would recommend to anyone that wants to feel like crap.7.6/10",The Road
224,mingsphinx,"Unrealistic premise, but a good effort by Viggo",6,22 October 2018,"Anyone who has ever been in a survival situation will know how difficult it can be to get the calories you need to stay alive. Without reliable access to food, the physiological changes in your body will basically make it impossible for you to move around like the protagonists in this film did. In order to keep the brain functioning, your body will start breaking itself down to provide essential nutrients to that vital organ. It is actually shocking how quickly you lose weight when that happens. As you go into starvation mode, any kind of physical effort becomes much more difficult and the **only** thing you are going to think about is food and finding food will become an all consuming obsession. Basically, it would be impossible for a man and a young boy to make the trek that the characters in the film did.Once you find food, you would defend that food with your life because not eating is the same as dying. So the scene where the two of them abandons the bunker because they fear that someone may be on to them is essentially ridiculous. Only the well fed would prioritize escaping from potential enemies over a large stockpile of food. Anyone who has known starvation would never do that. Even if your intent is to move on, you would eat and rest and recover before doing so. This decision will be made by your body and not the frontal lobe of your brain.The film was marred by the performance of the boy. Children who have known harsh privations are never whiny. Their sense of right and wrong are also radically different from kids who are raised with all the comforts and security of modernity. Under no circumstance would a child who has known hunger seek to share canned fruits which contain (in the scenario presented by the film) almost impossible to obtain sugars with a stranger because he wants to be one of the good guys. The boy carried much of the moral dialogue and it is here that I find the movie to be disappointingly lacking. How could a boy whose mother committed suicide and who has lived through long periods of starvation and witnessed the horrors of the kinds of violence that man can inflict on man continue to believe and espouse the sort of 'goodness' that a coddled kid from the fancy suburbs would? Some say this film is stark, but I find it simply too unrealistic.The reason I gave this my two hours was because of Viggo and he did not disappoint. I only wish he had given the script more thought. But perhaps Viggo is himself a product of modern comforts and does not really understand what it means to fight to survive. If he had put himself into a survival situation with nothing but a few implements he could carry to find the food he needed for even just a week, I doubt if he would have agreed to this film.",The Road
225,thesubstream,The feel good movie of the year... NOT.,9,8 December 2009,"John Hillcoat's adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's The Road matches that book's bleakness at every step, worming out slowly the same hard-won, gritty sense of hope in the face of utter ruin.Set 10 or so years after an unspecified apocalypse darkened the skies and turned the weather and tipped America's survivors into vicious, dirty, perpetual conflict over dwindling resources – even shoes are priceless, let alone bullets or canned food – The Road follows a father, the Man (Viggo Mortenson) and his son, the Boy (Kodi Smit-McPhee), as they struggle to make their way to the mythical ""coast"".McCarthy and Hillcoat's vision of life after the fall of civilization is horrifying, unvarnished and grey, two frozen, silent sentinels trudging through blasted, hostile woods under a dead sky. There is no Mad Max, no swashbuckling on the last of the V8 Interceptors, no heroism, just death and disease and some few moments of respite. The man teaches the boy how to shoot himself, rather than be taken by the cannibals. The Road is not light fare.It's atypical, it's original and different, and not everyone will or should enjoy it. As a film, complete and done, it's extremely, extremely good at achieving its goals; it is perhaps the most authentic-seeming apocalypse movie ever (knowing, of course, that that's just conjecture). It's beautiful, in its way, a gift, offering up a small joy to see a film so carefully, traditionally crafted in these days of CGI domination. The film feels crafted and whole, the work of a team all reading from the same bible and understanding it, and doing things the hard way. Aging props and muddying actors' faces and teeth and finding black dead sets and locations rather than building it in a computer later. It's a film that tears at its audience. At its heart is the bond between a man and his son, a pair that must face unending horror and depression sprinkled here and there with flashes of hope and joy – the boy tasting a can of cola for the first time – that are literally just blips, just moments in a relationship that decay has made untenable. It is not about the power of love or hope, about heroism or bravery, it is about the need to endure, to last through. It's a stunning, powerful film, an elegy for us all and a hymn to the power of faith, not in any higher power but faith in the idea that things will go on, some how, if we can go on. It's not going to be for everyone, but for those that can endure its bleakness, it offers a new kind of gray, sooty human beauty. 8.8/10",The Road
226,woinaroschy_1979,Viggo Mortensen in one of his most dramatic roles,8,17 August 2010,"I'm one of those that read the book before watching the movie. The book is phenomenal and I would advise anyone to read it, I haven't read anything that good in a long while. It made me cry a lot at the end, but it was a good type of crying,a cathartic thing. The book gave me hope and yes, I found the message very optimistic in spite the bleakness of the situation, in spite of the world falling apart and people becoming beasts. The movie catches this atmosphere perfectly well,there is no color,no light,no warmth.No vegetation, no animals, just ruins. Death everywhere. It's a very depressive post-apocalyptic world, exactly as I imagined it from the book. In contrast to this the director presents you images full of color and life before the apocalypse happened, and they do make a powerful impression on you.Viggo Mortensen is impressive as a father trying to survive and protect his small son, and in the same type keep a last shred of humanity inside of him. There is a particular scene with him and a piano that will probably move everyone. Personally I think that scene itself deserves an Oscar. Very good acting also from the young boy, representing the innocence and purity, the last sanctuary of a dying race. This movie will not make you laugh or feel happy, and it's not a movie for a nice comfortable evening. It's a deep movie, cruel and sad, and I cried a lot watching it, especially the end. But it will touch your heart. I'm just afraid that people who have not read the book will not understand the message as easily, I watched it with my husband and I had to explain him some bits here and there. There are a few things I missed from the book: they do a lot of fires in the movie, whereas in the book they could do that rarely because all the wood was wet from the continuous rain; the father is sick and coughs a lot from the beginning, not like all of a sudden; they wear face masks because there is ash in the air (well here I can understand that we would not have seen their faces anymore if they would have had them..) and last they did not put into the movie the line that impressed me the most in the whole book which is when the father is dying and the boy asks ""Who will find the little boy if he's lost?"" and he answers ""Goodness will find him. It always has. It will again."" I know that many people criticize The Road because they believe it's about religion and Christianity...well I am not religious, but if having an ounce of good heart in this cruel and cold world we live in is ridiculous then put me in the club of ridiculous people. I prefer that to being cynical.To conclude, The Road is a good heart wrenching movie.

The world is atmospheric, but much of the ruble doesn't make sense, like boats on a highway. And how could only, and only, humans survive this cataclysm, and suddenly give up on civilization? What happened to the armies, police, governments, marshal law? This is America and they run around low on ammo with basic hunting guns. And what happened to all the manually rechargeable flashlights? Many nowadays have them around just for novelty sake. They should rename this movie hoboworld.The father fanatically clings to his pacifist religion, depraving his son of the skills he will need to survive. He doesn't believe in other normal survivors so much that he doesn't even go around a corner to check if his son was right. He chops up the family piano when there is an abandons of dry would in the world. He goes skinny-dipping in a lake with his son in October. He starts exploring dark basements only armed with a lighter and keeps saying everything is going to be OK. He doesn't even try to get rid of his lice infested beard given the many chances he comes upon. Read a book! And this is the most likable main character in the movie.The briefly seen mother is the worst mother in the world by complaining ""Everybody jumped of a bridge, we should too"" and then goes Christopher McCandless on her only son.To summarize the child without any profanities is a challenge. In the end, if the dues ex family didn't appear, that joke of a man wouldn't have lasted a day. In my opinion, such an ending would have justified the entire movie.I think this would be a grate teenage punishment movie. Making them sit through this atrocity from beginning to the end to teach them a thing or two. To hear ""what is wrong with you?!"" would be a sign of learning about failing at life.

There aren't a lot of movies that have made me cry, however- Legends of the Fall, Forrest Gump, Letters from Iwo Jima, Predator II...Oh wait, that last one was a different kind of crying.

As far as the kid goes, as soon as the movie was over, I had to rush home to see if he was actually Charlize Theron's son - the resemblance is uncanny. But, there was more. We don't learn faith in good times, we learn it in the most bleak. I'm glad the movie touched on this theme, particularly as it relates to the young son reacting to his disillusioned father.

The cause of the apocalypse is never specified but if I had to guess it would probably be a nuclear war or if you look at it from a biblical sense it could be after Judgement Day. But that's what I like about this movie, it's up to the viewer to as how they interpret it. Be warned this movie is sad and intense at times. The movie is haunting in a way with it's bleak and depressing atmosphere and themes of cannibalism,starvation, and suicide. Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit McPhee are fantastic leads and even though Robert Duvall, Charlize Theron, and Guy Pearce only have a little screen time, they still shine.

As you read in the synopses and have seen in the ads, the atmosphere is cold, dreary, and seems to be endlessly wet, probably due to whatever ended the world and started the story upsetting weather patterns. We can all just assume it was ""the bomb"". There is much to be said for the story itself, I have not yet read the book, but, I see the human spirit, ""the fire within"" that burns. I am not sure I would have the spirit needed to go on, to wander aimlessly looking for food, other people, etc. What other people are around, will they try to kill me for my shoes, will they welcome me to their fire and a meal, I imagine all kinds of people will be met on such a journey. I read that Viggo wanted to take a break from film-making before this movie, I honestly don't think anybody could have done a better job as the man. He seems to fit right in. There is not much action, no explosions, just sometimes heart wrenching human drama. It is sad to imagine what the world would come to after such an event.

When Armageddon becomes a reality, the few survivors must not only fight to find food and shelter, they must also battle their own will to give up.There is no joy in this film, and it poses the question of whether we would want to live in the remnants of a once beautiful planet. Its a depressing film and will leave everyone who watches it with a feeling of utter emptiness.The acting is fantastic and this only helps make this film believable.My rating is 9 out of 10",The Road

Viggo Mortensen and 12 year old Kodi Smit-McPhee (where do the Australians get all of these great young actors?) both deserve Oscar nods, IMO. In fact, I'd also give an Oscar nod to Robert Duvall for his brief but powerful performance as 'the old man'. The cinematography is outstanding and the environment that they created is devastatingly realistic.This is an important film that deserves to be nominated for Best Picture of the year. If this film doesn't inspire both politicians and citizens to do whatever is necessary to protect our planet's precious environment in order to enhance human survival and the rest of the species on our world-- then I just don't know what will!Marcel F.

234,glennwalsh44,Better than I could have wished for,9,22 January 2010,"I've read 'The Road' about five times and consider it a modern classic and well-deserving of its Pulitzer Prize. When I heard that it was to be adapted into a film I had mixed feelings, but when I saw the cast and heard about the time being spent on the production I was prepared to give it the benefit of the doubt.My wife and I went to see the film last week and I'm not embarrassed to say we both came out of the cinema in tears. It has been many years since I have watched something so emotionally engaging and at the same time draining on screen and although it is hard to say it, in some respects the film is actually better than the book. Kodi Smit-McPhee's performance is incredible and all through the film I kept thinking of my own son and how I would acquit myself in the same situation. My wife said that she would not have behaved the way Charlize's character did (she's a country girl and a bit of a survivor), but she fully understood why the mother did what she felt she had to do and in its own way it was part of the survival story.The characters were rounded and more realistic when brought to life on screen, a little less inward-looking and I felt I was travelling the road with them. My only criticism of the film was that I felt it had been cut for length reasons and perhaps certification and hope that somewhere out there exists a full-length cut that might make its way to a DVD some day.There are some scenes that will live with me for a long time and one in particular that moved me possibly more than anything I have seen on screen in years. This is finely-crafted story-telling of a sort that Hollywood seemed to have all but forgotten about.For those looking for a post-apocalyptic sci-fi yarn, stay at home. This film is not 'The Road Warrior' or even 'A Boy And His Dog,' but only uses the setting to tell a deeper tale of the love between a father and son, loss, humanity and redemption. The setting is an extreme version of the western world (the US), but this is a story that could have realistically come from Bosnia, Iraq, Rwanda or anywhere else where people have been forced to flee for their very lives. For something comparable, but less accessible, consider 'The Time Of The Wolf' by Michael Haneke, set in a post-apocalyptic France.",The Road
235,kdavidbushnell,Simply one of the best of the decade!,10,26 December 2009,"The Road is one of the most unique films of the decade. Having an innovative and original approach to a long used post-apocalyptic (maybe the one to end all post-apocalyptic stories). Another Cormac McCarthy adaptation to Hollywood, will it hold a flame to the literature? YES. Far more than your average Hollywood flick. The story focuses the observers attention on relationships and society. DON'T GO SEE IT IF YOU WANT A 2012 DISASTER or SYFI FILM. It's poetic drama (maybe more in the book) in a very dark fashion. Mortenson without any doubt deserves many lead role awards this year. I have seen all the big films of the year and no one came close to male lead role performance like Viggo's. He plays the father spot on, Viggo is just astounding! Duvall and Theron are a treat as well! A real treat. Possibly the darkest movie I've ever seen. Its tone, dialogue, cinematography, art direction and superb acting are amazingly captivating in a grim way. The book prepared me for what to expect on screen (book is even darker and grimmer).There has never been a film like this one. It felt fresh and very real, Something the post- apocalyptic genre hasn't ever accomplished. Throughly entertaining from start to finish, and it felt too short! Did I mention it was very powerful and moving, in an unconventional way. Powerful like a deep war story and moving like a dramatic romance but transcends both. The Road makes you feel for the father so deeply and you can empathize with the boy with youthful innocence and ignorance that most people have experienced. They accomplished something with this adaptation I thought they couldn't.Great film, it deserves 9 or 10/10",The Road
236,Ben_Horror,A riveting story set during what may be the Earth's last days,10,17 January 2010,"If this were a Michael Bay film, chances are a committee of about fifteen hacks would have written it; the cannibals and the action of the story would be thrust to the forefront, and maybe a few huge brawling robots would be thrown in for good measure. In director John Hillcoat's hands, however, this becomes a more subtle and human exercise that does quite the opposite: while there is an omnipresent threat of fear and danger, the movie primarily focuses on the relationship between a father and son, and specifically the father's attempts to protect his child at all costs from rampaging remnants of humanity, who in their desperation – and evidently because there is no other source of food at their disposal - have resorted to cannibalism on the eve of the Earth's final gasp.This movie is aptly named as most of the action takes place along the desolate road of the title. The father and son make their way through a scarily hellish, post apocalyptic landscape on an evidently dying planet. It's an effective and brutal depiction of what mankind's last years would be like if things ever did go pear shaped, and paints an evocative, distressing and realistic picture as such. There is no real plot here; the story is essentially that of the man and his son trying to survive while encountering various odd, potentially threatening characters along the way.The film has a very chaptered, episodic structure, i.e., father and son meet old man father and son discover a house etc., but it's the central relationship that keeps you watching throughout. There is also no real villain of the piece in the traditional sense. Yes, the aforementioned cannibals are certainly grotesquely realistic and scary, but we never believe they are typical movie villains. We know that they were once ordinary people who were driven to these horrific and ruthless measures by that primeval urge to survive by all means necessary - no matter what the costs. One shocking sequence set at a dilapidated house further emphasizes this notion. It's a case of every man for himself – even if it's at the expense of others.Throughout the movie the child constantly wonders if he and his father are the 'good guys'. The father always insists they are. Yet on many occasions, it is the child's humanity and not the father's that shines through. While the father sees everyone as a potential danger – someone to mistrust - the child yearns for a sense of normalcy. This is aptly proved in the scene when they meet the old man: the child takes him by the hand – almost as if out walking with his Grandfather - but the father tells him to let it go. Also while the father's unwavering devotion to protect his child is evident throughout the movie, it is sometimes to the detriment of others, even to the point where he will turn a blind eye to those who clearly needs help – just so that he and his son can carry on. And that's the nagging unbearable e question this movie asks: just what is acceptable when the world goes to hell and you have no other choice? The concept of right and wrong doesn't exist when the thin line between civilized and savage is broken.The Road is a very ambiguous film. The father and son are unnamed, as is every character they encounter. The mysterious catastrophic incident, which plunged the Earth into such turmoil in the first place, is left deliberately vague, substituted to the background where we hear little mention of it, though Mortensen's character's utterance of a 'bright light' and 'concussions' leads one to suspect it may have been some sort of nuclear or biological incident. While it's ultimately left up to the viewer to surmise what might have happened, this does not detract from the story in any way. In reality, by dwelling so little on the cause, the filmmakers gives so much more power to the overwhelming effects.This movie paints one of the most vivid and realistic portraits of a post apocalyptic world ever put to film. There is no question it will become a benchmark that will be drawn upon and imitated by future filmmakers the way current filmmakers are inspired by futuristic movies such as Bladerunner. The exterior settings are stunning and convincingly done. The mood here is one of death and corrosion. Even the trees can't remain upright. The place is under a constant veil of mist. Even the color scheme of the film is deliberately desaturated to add to the already overwhelmingly bleak feeling of decay. Set dressing in the form of abandoned vehicles, lob-sided electricity poles or ramshackle houses, add to what is already a provocative environment. In one stunning shot that most people will assume to be CGI, we see large boats sitting on abandoned freeways. This is not an effect, but the violent aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, which the filmmakers have put to incredibly effective use.The Road has been accused in some quarters of a being bleak and depressing experience. Yes, the landscape is cruel and horribly realistic and tone is grimy and unsettling, but is it a depressing film? Not really. It's certainly dark, but due to level of detail on display, this film will actually stand up to repeat viewing. It's also a very exciting and suspenseful movie. Plus the acting is first rate and flawless. The central relationship between the father and son is actually very uplifting. Their dedication to each other in the face of so many obstacles and setbacks is very inspiring. Besides, any movie that can make you walk out glad to see the daylight and smell the fresh air can only be classed as a positive experience. Now what can be more uplifting than that?",The Road
237,Tiny T,pointless,5,25 April 2011,"Spoiler Spoiler. What a pointless movie. There is no story what so ever not to mention no plot. What are movie makers thinking, if we put a few respectable actors and actresses to gather then we have a good movie? NOT. No explanation about the Apocalypse, flurry flashbacks which give no answers tot the rose questions by the mean story line. All animals are dead (except the dog at the end???) and no plants survived although the rivers are still filled with clean water (which is the source of live as we know it). The ocean isn't clean so how did the Apocalypse has different effect on these same substance? maybe it was a long time ago that people are scared of the apocalypse and some Christian organization is behind this flick to bring the fear for god back in our lives?

The cinematography and locations were good. The acting, direction, story, and dialog was not.Despite the big names attached to this movie, it really goes no where. I think the only reason this book and movie were 'successful' is because Oprah for some reason called it one of her favorite books. Once that happened the Sheeple lined up to get this movie made. Too bad too, because I had really high hopes.There were some hints at themes like desperation, starvation, cannibalism, but no real action.

It was one of the greatest, if not the greatest, post-apocalyptic film ever made! That being said, I have my doubts if I will ever watch it again. It was so realistic and horribly bleak that I might just have to seek therapy. The reaction that this film got out of me is probably precisely what the film-makers intended. I think that everyone who worked on this film deserves the awards that it was nominated and more (not to mention a couple sessions with the best psychiatrist money can buy). The acting was unbelievably perfect, I felt like I was there, suffering with these people. When I saw the box, I thought to myself ""Here they go again, taking a great concept and putting it into the wrong hands... Viggo Moertensen... tisk!"" I will admit I was proved wrong.

241,Kelchubordnor,Loved this movie,10,9 January 2010,"Where to start with this superb story. I have never read the book but am getting very tempted now. First thing, I have seen quite a few movies over the years where the survivors are expert in martial arts are expert with weapons including firearms and always look absolutely cut and well fed. I can see people out there nodding. You love them as do I pure escapism.Well forget all that, picture a guy travelling with his son by foot to try and reach the ocean in the hope of better life. At the same time educating him and trying to keep him alive. That is the spoiler basically and is the story. The man can barely stand as can the boy and they are walking over terrain that quite frankly proves what the human spirit can be.He carries a gun with 3 rounds only, a knife and that is about it really. They come across gun totting cannibals and also suicide. The survive on what I can only describe as less than starvation rations for pretty much the entire film. In fact when they find the people locked in the cellar and they realise what it going on I think I stopped breathing for a few seconds. Then you hear the ""meal"" being prepared.......... Believe me I have seen every horror going and that scene where you see nothing but hear a lot made me cringe. This movie is basically average Joe nobody and son travelling across country. The flashbacks to the wife are moving and brilliantly done and Robert Duvalls cameo is brilliant if not short. Take some advice and see this movie you will feel as guilty as I did when I was trying to drink a pepsi whilst watching and they had nothing. Hope I didn't give too much away.",The Road
242,mgoldhamer,The Road: The First Step looking back on a new beginning,9,1 January 2010,"For some unknown reason the Earth has become a lifeless globe. The majority of plants and animals are dead. Yet a few determined souls scratch out a daily living, constantly moving forward, such is the case; of a Man and his Boy. The Man (Viggo Mortensen) and The Boy (Kodi Smit-McPhee) play their parts with an incredible amount of realism and love. I read in an article that the two bonded during the film by eating grass hoppers together. A diet of dead insects as the mainstay of a pair of survivalists would most certainly make comrades of most anyone. The film, directed by John Hillcoat, is shot in color but Mr. Hillcoat's directorial use of the camera has the stark appearance of bleak black and white moments of despair. The title, The Road, might refer to the constant walking and reference to the map The Man uses as a guide to the sea. This of course is not the only interpretation of The Road, one must remember that The Man and The Boy are scavengers, seeking out food, water, and shelter for each day to survive. Along their journey their are many pitfalls and surprises. The Man instills upon The Boy, that his son must carry ""The Fire"" inside him. Yes, ""The Fire,"" is also a physical necessity but ""The Fire"" kept inside might be the spirit of man, and what is wholesome and good. The Man also dreams of his life before the change and his wife and family. His wife (Molly Parker) has a very strong motherly influence and as a life partner. Hillcoat interweaves the now and the past all through the film. This use of flashbacks keeps a sense of continuity, in the film. The use of sound and visual stimuli throughout the film is very unexpected and director Hillcoat keeps his audience 's attention constantly. Remember, this film is rated ""R"" because of realism, blood, and mature content. The film score also works very well with the constant changes of scenery and action. The Road is showing in limited theaters because it is not a family film especially being released during the holidays. See The Road and feel the step by step journey for your self, it is most definitely worth the trip.",The Road
243,jcdugger,Tremendous...,9,27 November 2009,"I strolled into ""The Road"" on opening day in Detroit, Thanksgiving Day 2009. I had been waiting a full year to see the screen adaptation of my favorite book of all-time...The Road by Cormac McCarthy. And let me say...it did not disappoint one bit. ""The Road"" instantly turned into one of my all-time favorite movies as well.One thing that post-apocalyptic movies tend to miss or leave untouched is the toll on the human mind and body. And that toll is on full display here. You feel the terrible hunger and pain, you feel the grime on everyone's skin and clothes, the depression, the never-ending cloudiness...and especially, you feel the loneliness. The memories of a time that once was and never will be again. Long days and endless nights of a bleakness that cannot be described. It is beyond frightening and heartbreaking to see the difficulty of trying to raise a child in this environment, much less keep yourself sane. And you are there every difficult step of the way. This is not a story about cool CGI and a post-apocalyptic Earth...it's a story about human behavior and human emotions.The little things are not missed either...the production team sure did their homework. How would a 8-year-old boy who has never even seen a soda can before approach drinking from it? (Hesitantly was the answer here). How would attempt to filter and drink brown water filled with ash? Nothing grows or swims anymore...so would you resort to eating people? What would you do to a baby in this world...try to somehow raise it, or put it out of it's misery, along with filling your empty stomach, by killing and eating it? What would you do about your family? Risk them getting raped and eaten by savages...or suicide? Rivers flowed what looked like rusty anti-freeze. Rain had an ash tint to it. Trees were dead or dying, a few falling over here and there as the pair walked. It had the feel of what was intended...a complete environmental disaster without a shred of hope for the future.Onto the cast. Viggo Mortensen is at the top of his game here. You can feel the emotion in his eyes and voice...he gives a truly memorable performance. And how about a big thumbs-up for young Kodi Smit-McPhee?! He was sensational as well. The Boy's first ever can of Coca-Cola (a product as essential to my life nearly as much as electricity) brought tears to my eyes in both the book and the movie. ""It's bubbly!"" The Boy exclaimed while his father gushed...great moment. And I'd be mistaken not to mention the work of Charlize Theron. Though her screen-time was very limited, she nailed her character in a tremendous performance. Great work by one of the very best actresses Hollywood has ever seen.It's difficult for a movie to be both utterly bleak and good entertainment at the same time. Schindler's List is one of the few successes that come to mind. But ""The Road"" will also scrawl it's name on that short list...it's that special.Along with ""Inglourious Basterds"", ""The Road"" is one of the best movies of 2009. For the intellectual mind, I cannot recommend a movie more. 10 out of 10.Thank you for reading! JD",The Road
244,regular8,Horrible,1,24 December 2010,"The movie The Road is horrible, because it is cold, depressing, sad, violent, grim, full of death. After seeing this film one feels alienated, alone and distraught, hoping to regain any sense of joy at all. This movie is one of those post-catastrophe-earth presentations but this one hangs in ones mind like a lifeless tumor. It has almost no plot or story, but instead it tranquilizes the mind with dirty and deathly imaginings of a destroyed Mother Earth and a nearly destroyed human race who have been reduced to minimal existence. I suppose the fine actors in this film accepted their roles for either artistic challenge or money. I also suppose that McCarthy, the original writer, is either a ghoul or only in it for the money himself. (I have heard that his other stories are similar.) The Road is no family fun film. Not a first date movie. If you want to feel like nearly all your spirit has been killed, go see The Road. If you want to feel that human history is probably doomed, likewise go see it. I certainly wish I had not seen it.",The Road
245,cl777,"A beautiful, stirring and emotional tale but be ready for bleak and dark!!!!!",7,17 January 2010,"You have to know if you are preparing to see The Road to expect a very, very, very (did I already say very?) dark and bleak film. If you have read Cormac McCarthy's book of the same name you will already know to expect this but I prefer to warn nevertheless.The Road (the book) was actually the first present Fabio ever gave me. I invited him over for dinner and he brought me a copy of it. Strange gift but let's try not to analyze it too much... I of course read it, eager to find some clues as to why he gave it to me. I did not find any, but instead read a stirring, eloquent, and magnificent tale of a father and a son, alone in the world after an untold apocalyptic event wipes out all of civilization as we know it.Viggo Mortensen stars in this film and as usual gives himself 100% in his deep, rapt and physical portrayal of a desperately in love father who will do anything to protect his boy. The new world is littered with ""bad guys"" who will pillage, rape, torture and kill anything and anybody they find. There is no more light in this world, no more color, no more animals, no more normal people. Nobody can be trusted and one must keep moving to survive. Viggo and his son are trying to reach the shore where they hope to find what they are looking for- life.The art direction of the film is superb, portraying this desolate and grim world as I had imagined it from the book- gray, harsh, burned, austere and cold. Charlize Theron makes a few appearances as the boy's mother but only brief, as she gave up on this so called ""life"" and on a survival which she deemed futile.There are scenes of great sadness, fear, and tragedy, but also of love and of hope. That is an outstanding feat to accomplish and this film does it in a very understated way. I would recommend to anyone to read the book (it's not very long) before seeing the movie in order to better understand it and gain more depth from the experience. While not as strong and gripping as the book, this is an excellent attempt at putting it on the screen and it will nonetheless terrify, overcome and impress you.And why did Fabio give me a copy of The Road? Perhaps he could see into the future and wanted to tell me that he will be a really good dad to our yet to be born, and at the time yet to be conceived, son. I already know that he is right about that, but hopefully neither us nor him will ever know a world as sad as this one.My rating: 6.5 Fabio's: 5.5 Total score: 12 For more reviews please become a follower at http://paulinasmovies.blogspot.com",The Road
246,kzintichmee,No Hope....or Crosby either...in this 'Road' movie...,8,15 November 2010,"'The Road' is bleak. There, I said it. Excellent film that can bring down the happiest person in the room. Yet another post apocalypse film in the vein of 'The Book of Eli'. Based on Cormac McCarthy's book, it makes 'No Country for Old Men' look like a rollicking laugh fest. Seriously, folks, this film had me bumming out ten minutes in, waiting for that shining ray of sunshine/hope, that never came. It was never boring and I actually found myself caring for Papa and the Boy. None of the few characters have names except for the half blind old man who gives his name as ""Eli"". Maybe he saw the Denzel Washington movie and liked a good inside joke? After an unnamed disaster,(I vote for an asteroid strike), wipes out...well, pretty much everything, what's left of humanity hits 'The Road' to see what they can find to eat. More often than not it turns out to be each other. Part of this was filmed on Mt. St. Helens which is still barren and eerie after all these years. I didn't care for the 'Mom' character because she just seemed too bitchy for some reason. Plus she was worthless and weak. I am not going to bother to name the actors(4 big namers) but boy did they disappear into their roles. As I said, never boring but unremittingly grim. The high point for Papa and the Boy comes when they discover a cache of chow that looks like it could last them for a year and decent shelter to boot! Pop hears a dog bark so, off they go, into the great unknown. All because a f*****g dog barks? All that Dinty Moore beef stew, left behind. The movie ends on a slightly up-beat note in that the Boy doesn't die and meets up with an actual family that takes him in. Several of the characters are missing thumbs too. Weird. If you come across this movie,watch it, then watch School of Rock (or the comedy of your choice) to cheer you up again.",The Road
247,rupcousens,Ruined by an intrusive score,6,19 October 2009,"I was expecting this to be a highlight of the London Film Festival, but I found it a little disappointing.The production design can't be faulted - just about every scene looks as I imagined when reading the book, blasted CGI cityscapes used sparingly to situate real, local desolation redolent of '28 Days Later'. The performances were fine, the use of flashback effective, and the storytelling faithful. Why then did I find it strangely unmoving? Perhaps if I'd come without knowledge of the novel, I wouldn't have found the film too often an exercise in 'box-ticking' of major scenes, lacking real directorial vision. But I think I would still have found Joe Penhall's script rather reductive in its focus on the 'good guys'/'bad guys' dichotomy, as articulated by the boy - throughout, I always wanted to hear more of Viggo's voice-over instead. And I was irritated by the persistently intrusive music, so keen to tell me what to feel about each scene that my emotions rebelled into numbness. When a musical instrument is one of the key motifs dividing idyllic past from bleak present, it's all the more inappropriate to have an orchestra swelling with indiscriminate plangency over everything.A visual triumph, then, and a passable précis for those who haven't read the book - but if you were hoping for a bold re-imagining of McCarthy's novel, you may find the film wanting.",The Road

I think if there was at least some mention on what caused the apocalypse it could have taken my interest in the story even deeper. However that isn't what this movie was set out to do but I also think that's what lead to its problems.Since this was a strictly character driven movie the performances had to be top-notch and they were from top to bottom.As for the ending, I can sum it up in one world... blah.P.S.

249,piverba,McCarthy loves his very late begotten son but why is it our fault?,3,18 January 2010,"For those of you who did not read ""The Road"" and are not familiar with the work of Cormac McCarthy this must be tedious, pointless and boring film. You will be robbed of McCarthy's magnificent vocabulary and mastery of dialog - film does not communicate any of these qualities. Aside from these (and I am not trying to diminish them), the book is also pointless. The book expounds on McCarthy's fatherly love of his son, John Francis, to whom the book was dedicated, who he begot in his late sixties. His privacy and direct involvement with his son required that he would destroy the entire humanity to isolate his involvement with the child, so that he can personally influence and instruct him the way he believes it should be done. He even kills (in the plot, through suicide) his wife to achieve this ultimate control. This is an act of 'emotional cannibalism' - the cannibalism which McCarthy abhors as an ultimate evil. He's like oblivious vampire stages circumstances to suck out his son's unconditional love, effectively leaving him no alternative person to interact with but himself, as the only man alive, who does not want to kill him.If you read horrifying ""Child of God"", the naive cowboy retro ""All The Pretty Horses"" or ""No Country for Old Men"" you may feel that the ""The Road"" is a logical progression. McCarthy is not comfortable with 21st century, neither with the second part of 20th, but having nothing to offer in a way of social change, he simply states: no country, anywhere on Earth, for guys with the old mentality like his. Now, having this young boy, he's painfully aware of his inability to be a good parent, while not trusting anyone else to come in contact with the child. Ultimately he kills himself, perhaps for his lack of faith, more likely for his failure as a parent, and lets another 'good and god fearing' family, which carries a fire inside, the notion he never explains, to care for his son. These are some of the critique of the book - film has much less merit. Please understand, I enjoy McCarthy's work as a master of English letters, but as a philosopher and moralist, in my opinion, he's as inchoate as a child. His Texan chivalric notions of self-reliance, uprightness, horses, guns, etc. belong to 19th-early 20th century. However, the man is a master writer and this is what we should celebrate. His work is poetic, his dialog is simple and direct, he invents vocabulary which feels natural, his punctuation simple and unapologetic. His poetry is its own microcosm which I do not dare to define, musical and precise. Hollywood is on the constant prowl for the Pulitzer Prize winners, as an insurance policy that, at least, secure them a return on their original investment, riding the title-wave of the academic acclaim and mass media status already achieved - this alone costs very dearly. Select famous actors, beat advertisement drums so that everyone goes deaf from the noise - the formula have been proved economically viable. We are conditioned to be 'positive' - just count how many 'useful' responses gets positive review of a mediocre film and compare to the number of 'read-but-found-not-useful' gets a critical response. The bleating herd of 'positive' thinkers enable art to become profit-driven, mass-media conditioned, repetitive and boring.In the film ""The Road"" you will find neither entertainment, nor deep philosophy, nor inspiration, nor lessons for your life. You will neither laugh, nor cry. Neither you will feel the power of McCarthy's written word. My recommendation: read the book to enjoy McCarthy's style and eloquence, avoid the film.I gave this film an embarrassing 3 - in my opinion it is not even good enough to get an angry 1.",The Road

Moreover, there is plenty of movie time in this turkey where there is no dialog at all, just the very predictable gloom of slogging through a devastated landscape, or running endlessly from the ""bad guys""--as the younger of our two protagonists terms the cannibalistic refugees of this film. So you can even raise the forwarding speed a bit and still miss nothing.However, let me say, I did watch probably 80% of this movie at normal speed, so this is a legitimate review.But I digress. ""The Road"" is a particularly silly example of the already silly sci-fi genre of post-apocalyptic adventure. Cormack McCarthy, who is responsible for the story behind this dull movie adaptation, apparently thinks that by giving us the standard sci-fi ""what-if"" premise of ""never mind that none of the plot makes any scientific sense just take it as read that somehow in some unexplained fashion the earth has come down to this"" that he can then give us a story with plausible actions and emotions from a particular set of characters--in this case, a father-son pair of refugees.I won't say this type of narrative set up never works, but what you have with this particular film is just another ""remaining-humans versus a lot of flesh-eating zombies"" plot. OK, so the zombies are not biologically different from the humans--and they don't shuffle along, decomposing as they walk--but they are essentially the same, and the horror thereby created is tediously familiar.McCarthy gives us only these two kinds of characters: those who prey on others, and those who live in fear of them.No great moral questions get answered. I'm not sure any even get asked. The boy is constantly trying to temper his father's ethos of self-protective, survivalist ""do-unto-others-before-they-do-unto-you"" behavior with a sense of charity, sharing, and trust. And...well, that's it.The cinematography amounts to little more than familiar depictions of a post-apocalyptic wasteland, and the plot is mainly a series of close encounters with the ""bad guys."" The film tries to establish some sort of character for the father with flashbacks to his former life, both before and after the unexplained disaster. And, as a thoughtful viewer, you ask yourself in response: ""Would I (or another person) react like that?"" But you are forced to answer: ""Who cares?"" Indeed, children often pester their parents with similar sorts of hypothetical questions. Such as: ""If a great white shark were about to eat me, mommy, and brother, and you could only save one, who would you save?"" Your kids expect to learn something from your answer, and parents, do their best to answer thoughtfully. But the only answer to questions like this is: ""No one knows for certain how he will act in a given situation; but there is no such situation as the one you propose, nor is one such even remotely plausible. So what is the point of trying to answer it? More importantly, there is much great narrative art based on placing characters in realistic situations. Moral quandaries abound in every-day life. Why attempt to ponder unimaginable ones?",The Road
251,WLRSky,Carrying the fire within ourselves,8,8 July 2021,"This story of father and son, (yes, the characters don't have names!) might be viewed depressing and hopeless, but there are a lot of moments that put a smile on your face, and the movie ends with a hopeful and positive note! (Notice how the ending scene has more color & warm feeling compared to the rest of the movie)The cinematography captures the desolate, lonely and dark place the world has become. Most of the film, there are barely any colors besides black, white and grey. This world LOOKS like dust, and it adds the depressing vibe to the story. The flashback scenes of The man and the wife are very colorful- in contrast with the grim, grey reality. The world used to be a place filled with color, now it isn't.Little boy must learn how to kill himself and watch people die(and dead bodies). This boy never experienced the world before the apocalypse. He never saw a blue ocean, never got to play with friends(you can tell from his reaction when he saw another boy) and never experienced normal, everyday stuff(Cheetos, cigarettes, and alcohol). But his father told him important messages, that we should be a good guy/ meet a good guy, and carry a fire within ourselves.So, I'd say it feels like a depressing story of losing loved ones(the man loses wife, the child loses his father) but at its core, the movie gives us a hopeful message.Other good scenes : the scene of the man letting go of his wife; throwing away her picture and removing the ring. The campfire scene with the old man.",The Road
252,revelinchaos,Post apocalyptic parental love.,6,15 February 2010,"It's 'moving' and has a nice photography, but that is all. The story doesn't really make sense... it's not the usual sequence of events with a goal, but just a sequence of events. In this respect you could consider it more like a documentary than a movie. Or at least I saw no message behind it all, just an hypothetical and acritical view of a developing personal story set in an hypothetical post-apocalyptic future. Interesting for its 'realist' approach to an unreal setting, but disappointing for the lack of a real plot and twists in the story. As I said, those 'faults' are probably inherent to the story itself and the way it is told, being therefore part of the work, but nonetheless, my reason for seeing a movie is entertainment, which differs from my reason for seeing a documentary, that is both entertainment and furthering of knowledge. This movie, being fictional, obviously lacks the latter and only partially succeeds at the first. I guess that is only to be expected from a movie that ultimately tries to combine basic human feelings with wild speculation about the future.Sad movie, technically nicely executed. If you don't care about action, plot or special effects, but like some cheap, old fashioned tear-shedding in an unusual setting, this one's definitely for you.My score is a 6.5/10. Original but definitely not a masterpiece.p.s. As a side note, given the respective release dates and settings, and being a Sci-Fi fan (and this ain't no real Sci-Fi movie), I have to say it beats the crap out of the book of Eli, hands down.",The Road
253,themightyservo,"Tolkien was right, The Road goes ever on... and on... and on... and on...",1,25 July 2010,"CONTAINS LOTS OF SPOILERS. But it's difficult to spoil a movie that's already rotten.I picked up The Road hoping for some kind of bleak, postapocalyptic examination of the human condition. Maybe some kind of depth.What did I get? A couple of whiny crybabies who never should've survived the doomsday even to begin with. I got a movie that masquerades as deep, and even convinces some people it is. And it's looooooooooong and by failures that disengage you from the characters, also boring.Since it was post-apocalyptic, it delivered on the bleak, but to the point of disbelief. And it had Deliverance-style cannibals, complete with trucker hats. Why? Because it's a cheap way to make people dislike the villains. No, these aren't savage people who've resorted to cannibalism, in Hollywood's opinion, that's pretty much what everyone with a southern accent is like already. So they're just hicks with a big diesel truck who eat people. But Hollywood wasn't content with just ripping on poor white folks, as THE black guy in the movie is a thief whose dialog sounds positively antebellum. Our ""hero"" is a whiny man child who plays the piano and couldn't run his own household.The main characters have random, unexplained motivations. Charlize Theron walks out ""because she has to"", the kid goes chasing down a boy he maybe sees ""because he has to"", and characters frequently do things for no apparent reason, with no rational motivation. And Viggo, intent on living, lets Charlize go running off to die why? Uh... because he has to?Why shoot someone who's obviously a fellow traveler and not a cannibal? No reason. Why run away from a sealed, hidden bunker that's escaped detection for 10 years? No reason. Why always take the main roads and make yourself a target? No reason.Why do the main characters, being chased by NASCAR cannibals, decide to light a bonfire everywhere they stop? With the sun and stars and moon obscured by bleak clouds 24/7, what would possess them to light a huge, highly visible fire every night? When they stumble on the cannibal captives, do they release the victims so as to make cover for their own escape, or possibly stop the cannibals? Nope. They seal 'em back up in the basement, and hang around outside to listen to them being eaten.The kid falls over more than a bimbo in a horror flick, and has to be carried more than the luggage does (which looks a lot like Princess Vespa's luggage from Spaceballs). Despite an abundance of water, everyone's forgotten how to bathe, groom, or clothe themselves. Why? Meanwhile Viggo goes swimming like it's a Bond film. The film says it's gotten so cold out, yet the characters repeatedly expose themselves to hypothermia via swimming. Why again? Does the movie make any sense? Sure, if you're pretentious and can lie to yourself. Do the characters' motivations make any sense. No.Why did they spend years in the cabin rather than go south to begin with? Not explained. Why does Charlize wander off to die? Because. Despite the lack of fuel, there seems to be forests of it standing around - did humans just forget how the steam engine works? Apparently.The visuals are suitably bleak, but grow tiresome and obnoxious. There's just no point. For all the weak attempts at moralizing random things, it's as pretentious as the Matrix sequels, but there's no enjoyment to be had here.The nonspecific doomsday isn't a big hangup. It just sets the stage for the morality play. But there isn't one to be found here. It really is a dull, plodding, slow, pointless film. The numerous bonehead moves the characters make - almost all due to bad writing - separate the audience from the characters and rather quickly, and thus there's no reason to care. There's only hope that the next scene offers something of interest in the setting. Even with a lot of use of fastforward, it still drags.You'd be better off watching The Postman, Mad Max, or A Boy And His Dog. Waterworld is gills and shoulders above this pretentious turkey. Heck, even Robot Holocaust and Defcon 4 were better than The Road.Or better yet, go read Orson Scott Card's ""The Folk of the Fringe"", for a good postapocalyptic journey/pilgrimage book.",The Road
254,HagenSteele,Too depressing for my taste........,5,27 September 2012,"Spoilers below!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You have been warned..........................This film was well made, and well acted, however...........I did not like this film, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.Here's why.It's too depressing. Period.IF you are asking me to watch some horrid, depressing film, there BETTER be reason behind all that misery. Some hope. Some valuable lesson, or insight. I didn't get that with this film.At all.It was like watching somebody get tortured, which I would not choose to do. Why would I want to watch that? Why would anyone? I watch movies to feel GOOD, not MISERABLE, and this film left me feeling miserable.Life's too short to deliberately bring yourself down.Here's the essence of this film:1. Good man lives a decent life. 2. Good mans' life is ruined by disaster. 3. Watch him slowly die as he and his son struggle to survive in their awful new existence.That's about it. Not much hope in this film at all, or anything else that could be considered ""bright"". Plain doom and gloom, which I'm not into at all.8 of 10 stars for acting, however, the movie as a whole gets 5 of 10 for having such a hopeless and gloomy story.",The Road
255,LostInFilmUK,Story of love and courage,8,21 February 2013,"Story/Plot - At first I was very sceptical about this film due to reviews written about it (yes even I read reviews). A lot of what I read was negative feedback and how the story was really sad etc. I am not one to be put of by bad reviews so I endeavoured to watch this film via a legal online rental website.Right onto the film, The Road is a tale set in the aftermath of an apocalyptic America. The world is now virtually deserted save for a young boy and his father. Together they cross America, foraging for what little food they can find, searching through abandoned homes and shops. They sleep rough and bathe in waterfalls and lakes, living on the rough of mother earth.The are soon to discover that they are not the only ones left, living to survive in this desolate land. The encounter hunters who are intent on killing anyone and anything. They are faced by cannibals wanting to eat who ever they can lay their hands on just to feed. Most of all the come across an old man and a crook, the boy trying to get his father to help these two men.Through out the journey the father has flashbacks of the good and bad times with his now lost wife. He is slowly but surely losing his mind and his health is deteriorating rapidly. They have a revolver with two bullets, one for each of them, unfortunately they use one whilst escaping the hunters. Reaching the beach the father is now dying and his little boy is faced with a dilemma.My verdict - Yes this is a sad story but it is a story of courage, togetherness and most of all true love. The tension and suspense of the duo not knowing who they will encounter, where they will sleep and what they will each ads to the raw courage portrayed in this film.Viggo Mortensen who plays the father is a wonderful actor and he plays his role with sheer dignity and love. The story itself is one of pure brilliance and the screenplay is to the highest standard needed.Based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, the screenplay was written by Joe Penhall and directed by John Hillcoat.This film is a definite watch for anyone, especially those who want to see what courage and love really means.",The Road
256,DanielKing,Faithful adaptation that still offers something new,7,19 October 2009,"Just got back from seeing THE ROAD.I had been very impressed by the novel and was concerned about how it would be adapted. The tone of the novel is almost unremittingly bleak and a 100% faithful adaptation would be very difficult to watch.I'm happy to report that the film is very good indeed. It solves the problem of being unendurably depressing by concentrating on the emotional impact of the unspecified Armageddon, rather than the day to day fight for food, shelter and so on. So while at times it remains very upsetting it is shot through with hope rather than despair. I always felt the end of the novel was somewhat out of kilter with the rest of it but in the film it seems quite appropriate.I think the film is more about the collapse of civility rather than civilization: for a film that shows the last remnants of mankind struggling to eke out an existence it is remarkably concerned with relationships. That's probably why the exact cause of the catastrophe is left blank: the film isn't really about the end of the world so much as the end of society. It's an interesting companion piece to NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN in which an ageing man sees nothing but horror in the modern world. In THE ROAD a man convinces himself, for the sake of his son, that humanity will abide even in the face of appalling conditions.",The Road
257,samuellickiss,An unromantic look at our dystopian future...just don't think too hard,7,3 May 2018,"I enjoy the Fallout series of games. In these games, you play a person who's survived a nuclear apocalypse and explore the wasteland of America completing quests and missions. Being computer games, they're designed to be fun and entertaining.Dystopia is popular right now. From the unending surge of zombies (World War Z, Walking Dead, etc.) to YA (Hunger Games, Maze Runner) to more series, adult media (Automata, Blade Runner 2049). For all their attempts at making the future look grim, I personally find them quite appealing. I loathe paperwork, you see. It's the bane of my existence. I'm someone who does. I enjoy my job, for the most part, but mention 'stakeholders', 'APR percentage' and 'audits' and my brain switches off. I honestly don't care, and it stresses the hell out of me. It does more than that. It makes me miserable - depressed, even. I can't cope with it. I can't cope with the intricacies of the bureaucratic system. It confuses me, it gets me into trouble when I don't even know why, I hate it. I hate it with a passion. I have anarchic tendencies. I believe that our biology is designed to help us survive against nature. We're intelligent beings, and we've evolved to cope with the adversities thrown at us by nature. The thing is, I believe I would stand a better-than-average chance of surviving the apocalypse. I'm intelligent, and I'm tough as old boots. Ask me to do a tax rebate and I'm utterly useless, but I don't care about the cold or the heat or noise while I sleep. I'll deal with that no problem. And that's the thing with dystopian fiction - it appeals to me. They show us worlds where people like me would actually be quite successful when the vast majority of people would flounder. But not The Road. I've read the book, and it's bleak. Utterly, utterly bleak. I'm under no illusion that our usual media diet romanticises the apocalypse - makes it strangely appealing, despite everything. The Road does not. From start to finish, it's cynical, miserable, depressing, extremely grey (like, it might as well be in black and white) and raw. There's no attempt as making the apocalypse look positive - adding some glamour into it like the Fallout games do. This is not really science fiction. If you address it rationally by questioning the character motivations you'll be disappointed. This is not really sci fi in the traditional sense. This isn't a strict narrative. Characters act irrationally, even stupidly, and the whole cause of the apocalypse is unexplained. This, instead, is a drama with an apocalyptic backdrop. It's completely non-political. It doesn't care about the causes of the trouble, but rather how people react to it. It's a psychological examination of the question: 'How do you retain your sense of morality when everyone else has forsaken theirs?'. That's a difficult question to answer. Does the film do it satisfactorily? In my view, no. It's a big topic, and I wonder if the film has felt too conflicted by its commercial needs to make some money and its desire to tell a more cerebral narrative than your average blockbuster. Certain aspects are glossed over. Other things are ignored completely and logic falls by the wayside more than once. It moved me, however. To tears. And it really did get me thinking. Hey, life's pretty good. I may not be brilliant at coping with the unending form-filling and I'm never going to care much about the petty conflicts that dominate local politics, but I have money, food and shelter...and friends...and family. That's what storytelling is about. If you go into The Road expecting a zombie-style action-fest you'll be disappointed. It's slow-paced and repetitive and never gives any character any glory, No one's a hero. Go into it, right now, at this time when the media is fixated on the Middle East conflict(s), Russia, North Korea, Cambridge Analytica, nationalism, #metoo, Brexit, Trump, Iran, whatever and everyone is losing their s*** and you might find yourself approaching it very differently.",The Road
258,stephen-scott83,Too many ridiculous scenes this dreary story,5,21 September 2013,"I had high hopes at the beginning of ""The Road."" I was less than thrilled by the end. This post- apocalyptic journey of a man and his young son is rife with non-sensical decisions and stereotyped insertions, it ruins what could have been a dreary but thought provoking masterpiece. Viggo Mortensen is an amazing actor and he shines, Charlize Theron is wasted as a self centered bitch. The cameo by Robert Duval is really interesting and cool. I wish there was at least 5 minutes of back story as to how the Earth was turned into a gray wasteland - this was my early indicator of dissatisfaction to come. Wow, was I right. Where are the ""meaning of life"" conversations between father and son? Who is their right mind leaves a bomb/Tornado shelter stocked with non-perishable food just because someone or something walks around it? That is the most ridiculous scene in the movie - absolutely ridiculous. The stereotypes include the ""trucker"" gang that is obviously a slant on southerners, and why, oh why is the ""thief"" a black man? Are are kidding? I think I would have eaten the kid - for his whining. He was way to healthy looking to pass a sick malnourished little kid. the road to boredom.",The Road
259,The-Kissable-Writer,Bleak apocalyptic moral tale that investigates humanity itself.,8,22 May 2010,"Bleak apocalyptic moral tale that investigates humanity itself.THE ROAD is absolutely breathtaking and almost unbearably moving, not in the least through the merits of the child actor Kodi McPhee. He really does a swell job in representing the moral core in a rotten apple of a world, and Viggo Mortensen hasn't looked so miserable since he was being cornered by an army of orcs in LOTR. The casting of Charlize Theron as an object of desire and beauty from a lost world of light and flowers is inspired and she nails her part once again as we see her slowly losing hope and coming to the only conclusion left to draw namely that living isn't possible any more, only surviving, and that it isn't good enough. We also see Robert Duvall do what he does best, he's still a beacon of good-natured wisdom, gentlemenry and old-fashioned kindness.The only complaint is that it takes so very long for a shimmer of light to appear through the thick gray clouds, that you feel so miserable half-way through the film you hardly have energy left to watch the last act. The ray of sunshine I speak of is the discovery of the bomb shelter with the food reserve. I guess many bleak, dark drama's have sluggish paces, one of my other all-time favorite films AMORES PERROS can be accused of that sin too. And I don't love it any less for it.If you're looking for a movie with lots of chills, thrills and action scenes, this is not the movie for you. Watch THE BOOK OF ELI instead, the premise of which is almost completely identical, but turns into a religious action fable rather than a moralistic drama. If you're looking for a deep, slow burner of a drama that may keep you up at night, this is it. McCarthy who won a Pulitzer for this novel and unlike similar brilliant novels by Nobel prize of literature winners such as BLINDNESS, this one's message doesn't get lost in the adaptation to film, and you never feel the wagging finger of elitism, the easy kick in the gut of misanthropy, nor is the meaning behind it all spoon-fed or the moral black and white. The brilliance is easy to miss. Take for instance the simple fact that the cannibals are represented as vicious but above-all go about their activities very carelessly. They come home from a day of hunting humans and make small talk about the weather, they've been doing this for years and don't think twice about it. They keep their ""cattle"" like people nowadays would keep sheep or chickens and cut off an arm or a leg now and then, never more than they need to eat for that day. That's horrifying b/c I bet that's what I'd be like if there ever was a disaster which killed all fauna and flora. They wouldn't bite people's necks like vampires, they wouldn't turn them on a spit like so many caught rabbits or pheasants, or do any of the other things previous portrayals in Hollywood movies suggested. I'm sorry if I shocked anyone but if I have, a word of advice: don't see the movie b/c there are two scenes that near holocaust-degree of horror, the highest level of horror as far as I'm concerned.The father-son relationship is expertly fleshed out and will be relatable for the audience even if the circumstances are extreme, there's still the same special bond that exists between some fathers and sons; the problem with many of these post-apocalyptic movies is they choose to pair up side-kicks who just met in order to have their protagonist tell all about themselves. A useful enough narrative tool, but following two characters who've been through thick and thin together and have no social awkwardness (which some screenwriters find so charming and disarming) interests me infinitely more. If you're not skilled at reading between the lines, you can always read the lines. In other words the dialog is superb. The author has a knack for laying painful questions on you straight and direct. Here's an excerpt copy-pasted from the script.BOY ""I wish I was with my mom."" MAN You mean you wish you were dead. BOY ""Yeah."" MAN You musn't say that. It's a bad thing to say. BOY ""I can't help it."" MAN I know but you have to. You have to stop thinking about her. We both do. BOY ""How do I do that?"" There's no answer to that question. And McCarthy knows it. And the readers know it too.Stunning film.8/10",The Road

261,prateak09,A beautiful movie about a father and a son relationship...,7,23 May 2011,"If you don't know, The Road is based on a Pullitzer-prize winning novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy. There's been some kind of apocalypse, causes unknown, and a father and young son try to survive on the road to an hypothetical better place.The movie is relentlessly grim, dour, somber, depressing and, well, add your favourite dark adjective. However, it's also quite good and fascinating provided you watch it not expecting spectacular action scenes. There are a few intense action scenes based on survival but they're quick, unheroic and unglamorous. Actually, it seemed often better to avoid or flee the dangers in this world. The Road didn't have any of that somewhat cool post-apocalyptic stuffs that other movies of the same genre had. That being said, there are a few tiny glimmers of hope and we come to care about our father and son duo. It's one of the best father and son relationships shown on film.Someway, somehow, following the father and son in their normal daily life was pretty interesting. It was also quite interesting to see how the father dealt with each unforeseen problem in often unexpected yet logical fashion. The main threat comes from cannibalism (as the father tells us) and as a viewer I felt that omnipresent danger even though it was represented in sometimes subtle ways. It also made me think as to how most people would react in such extreme conditions. Who would cling to standard humanistic ideals? Deep down, who are we really? Is it even worth surviving in such a hopeless world? The movie is deep, sad, horrifying and bleak, with an oddly optimistic finish. While this film might talk about 'good guys' it also says so much about the contemporary world. What do YOU / ME become? A cannibal? Or keep hold of your humanity? Let us hope it is the latter.The ""lighter"" moments of the movie in which the man dreams of his woman are nothing short of brilliant yet underplayed, with the one with piano is one the finest cinematic pieces of recent times. There are ample tear-jerking moments in the movie for the weak and the tough of heart, but anyone with a heart will find it skip a few beats in the sequence where Viggo Mortensen lets go of his love.Viggo Mortensen as the father was simply amazing. This (probably) method actor went so far as to starve himself and dress up as a homeless man in public places to prepare for his role. Cody Smit-McPhee does well as ""Boy"", and whilst his role in the film is, for the most part, rather unremarkable, and it is Mortensen who carries the relationship in this piece, Smit-McPhee shows enough potential as a young actor for me to say he might be one to watch out for in future. You know you have a master actor when their cameo role can almost steal the film, which is exactly what happens when Robert Duvall appears as ""Old Man"". Barely recognizable at first, and only on screen for 10 minutes or so, he is astonishing and delivers 100%. Charlize Theron is brilliant as always in short role as the mother.Cinematography was at its best. The movie was beautifully filmed, highlighting the colours grey and white to show a world that died long ago. It is very depressing, and brilliantly engages the audience into the world and suffering of the protagonists. Literally everything is dying. The trees are all falling down, the sky and the sea are constantly grey, and even the land itself has lost it's colour. This may make it sound boring, but it will shock you.This is one of those rare movies that has acting, emotion, and realism rolled into one. There is gore and blood, but not to make the movie look cool for theaters. It seems realistic, such as when he pulls out the arrow he was shot with. Though being of the post-apocalypse genre, this actually is a love story between a man and his son. It also is a story about what makes us human.After all these said, I don't recommend this to everyone. Some may find this movie very slow and boring. Just don't expect anything glamorous or some great action sequences. So give it a watch for its beauty. I rate it 7 out of 10.",The Road
262,leoocampo,"Grim, Bleak, Dark, and Everything One Might ACTUALLY Expect from a Post-Apocalyptic Film",7,17 September 2018,"Finally, a film that takes every Hollywood convention and, refreshingly, ignores it. This is not the glamorized, action-packed, fantastical vision of a post-apocalyptic world with which we are all so accustomed. Expect no pulled punches, no feeling of forced narrative logic, and a plot that is feels less driven toward a meaningful end and is more about the journey. Oh... also, don't expect much hope. You're not going to leave this film feeling good and satisfied... it will leave you depressed, if not haunted. As it should.What you will get is the not-entirely-rational actions of what feel like authentic human characters put into extraordinary circumstances. Or, maybe not so extraordinary. Perhaps what this film does best is take a cold hard look at what we really are when the edifice of all the artificial social constructs around us crumble away. We find pain, hopelessness, and yet the yearning desire to survive and continue on despite the hardships we must endure. You'll find a lot of humanity in this story, but it won't seem at all humane. Yet, the most intimate moments are not just gritty, but brutally honest. There's plenty to chew on, and enough depth and metaphor for it to endure several viewings, but you're first viewing will find you being confronted with a reality we'd often like to pretend isn't lurking beneath the surface. The drama seems undramatized, the tension isn't limited to the moments of action, and the emotion is full-spectrum and emanates not so much from the film itself, but from the genuine actions and motivations of fully believable characters and actions.",The Road
263,crooked_spoons,"A Mapless Journey Down a Long, Lonely Road...",4,14 February 2010,"Before I begin, I feel I must say that I did in fact read the book before one set of this movie was built, so this review isn't coming from some angry idiot who merely jumped into this expecting a full-throttle action packed apocalypto thriller. And it has to be said, I didn't dislike this movie because I just ""didn't get it"" because I didn't care for the book either and it's hard to believe that I simply misunderstood a story translated into two different mediums, both times. This directionless movie insists up itself so much that it's hard to find a discernible plot or point other than McCarthy's immense fear of his own mortality. As well as his own suffocating love for his youngest son in real life. You're beaten over the head with how much The Man loves The Boy to the point that you just don't care any more. And then you ask yourself, if this man truly loves his son so much, why not just put him out of his misery? Why prolong his suffering and his inevitable, early death? Wouldn't any parent who loves their child do anything to prevent their child from the horrors of a 'dying earth?'I honestly can't understand where all this praise is coming from. I've heard people use terms like ""enthralling, incredible, awestruck, heartbreaking"" etc. My only question is, 'What are you smoking...and where can I get some?"" The Road is about as bleak and desolate as an abandoned highway, and about as interesting as one too. Nothing of note happens, not once. I didn't care about any of the characters. McCarthy never tells us what this cataclysm was, what will happen or why. We don't even get hints. Someone earlier told me that even if I didn't like it, it probably at the very least changed the way I think. Think about what? Long, drawn out, solemn, ""contemplative"" movies? Or life altogether? Although I can say one thing, after seeing this, I was depressed for weeks. So there was a change in my mood for sure.Again, we're never told what this ""event"" was so what we're left with is a story about a boy and his father. And that's it. But then, why in a post-apocalyptic world? This could've happened anywhere. Why not have them get stuck in the wilderness, or on an island after a plane crash? I suppose to enjoy this movie, you have to be satisfied with the father/son storyline with little concern for the ""How did we get here?"" But then, the whole concept is still just as contrived and unbelievable as anything ever was because then all the plot boils down to is bleak, emptiness devoid without reason. A man cared for his son - what else is new? He didn't do anything more than any dad would do - what's so special about that? I've also been told that to really understand it, you have to have children. I call bs on both excuses, that's the same as saying you can't enjoy/understand ""Schindler's List"" unless you're Jewish. Simply untrue.Perhaps it's my already overly pessimistic outlook on life, however there was no reason to keep going, 'The Man' already called it a ""dying earth."" I'm sorry but, 'carrying the fire inside you' is just not enough motivation for me, nor is it enough to make me believe that a man would subject the child he so dearly loves (or himself for that matter) to all that horror instead of ending their lives.This movie makes no sense whatsoever and absolutely should not have been made. For so very many reasons, but at least stay away from it for its disingenuous, implausible Deus Ex Machina ending.",The Road

265,movieguysla,It's the end of the world as we know it. HAPPY THANKSGIVING!,7,29 November 2009,"At one point in ""The Road"", John Hillcoat's adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, Viggo Mortensen's voice narrates a section from the book, about trying to dream as a child would and trying to lose oneself in the imaginings of a child's mind. It's an understandable exercise and desire, as Viggo's character is a father who is caught in nothing short of a nightmare; a post-apocalyptic world where he must try to care for himself and his young son in the face of cannibals and a treacherous, dying world. The more complicated and unforgiving the circumstances of a person's life and environment, the more often a person will attempt to simplify matters and fill in what seems insurmountably awful with hope and indeed, delusion. A lack of full awareness of one's terrible circumstances and bleak future can be a tool of survival, just as it can be a hindrance. Nobody cares to spend time thinking about the likelihood of being raped and eaten (as well as seeing that done to one's progeny) and if those things are in fact possibilities, a child's naiveté can prove valuable, at least for one's sanity.At another point, the father tells his son that as long as the boy is dreaming of terrible things, that means he is still fighting; once he starts dreaming of good, then he will have given up. It's a pointed contrast to the earlier rumination, and it helps define the conflict that the father feels at trying to make his son aware of the dangers of their world, while still letting the boy have some freedom to dream and hope of better things. The father knows what faces the two of them, but cannot expect the boy to fully understand it nor does he want his son to. At the same time, he knows he must instill the boy with a clear understanding of the seriousness of the world's treachery.Various flashback scenes show the brief history of the two travelers. The boy was born shortly after an undetermined cataclysm (in the book, it is perhaps less ambiguous). The world has been dying, with little to sustain those people who remain. The father's wife the boy's mother (Charlize Theron, doing her best with a small part) becomes aware that there is little left in the way of hope. She cannot bear to live in a world where she will likely be raped and killed, just as her son may be.In the book, the wife's despair is a bleak and powerfully persuasive voice. She is not weak. She has not given up, so much as she has merely understood the reality that she and her men live in. She understands herself as a liability. She knows her husband cannot protect both her and their son — if he can protect anyone at all. She soberly explains the situation to him, and it is the most convincing single argument that Cormac McCarthy makes in his novel: If this woman, this mother, is so deeply aware of the situation that she is driven to suicide, then the world must indeed be as dead as she feels. She determinedly destroys herself ""with a flake of obsidian sharper than steel the edge an atom thick"".In the movie, while Charlize Theron does convey a certain resigned quality, there is not the same stark, defiant truth to her decision. Moreover, to demonstrate her death, Hillcoat has her merely walk off into the night. It suggests the filmmaker or the producers of ""The Road"" thought audiences could not forgive a mother leaving her child, but it is a poor choice. It is their job to convey the character's feelings and her situation, and they fail in this case.Kodi Smit-McPhee plays the young boy with a wide-eyed disbelief, as his father attempts to deflect the world's harshness. Smit-McPhee is well-cast as an innocent, and it is not hard to believe him as he seems to be able to keep his head fairly clear of the nightmares around him. Viggo Mortensen is excellent as usual, delivering a well-toned performance as a man who cannot hope to accomplish what he wants the eternal protection of his beloved son, as they ""carry the fire"" together. The father gives in to his own impending death while giving his son all he can, and somehow keeping the boy from being consumed by fear and hatred. It is clear that these two characters share the same soul, as one exits this terrible world and another just begins in it.It is that beginning, at the end of the film, that also deserves scrutinization. The tone of the end of McCarthy's book is much different than the film's finish. Again, it seems the filmmakers felt it necessary to rescue the viewers from the bleakness of the world that these characters live in. Whether a nuclear bomb or some other equivalent destructive force created this world is not of absolute importance to know, but apparently a nuclear family is what will carry the boy through it. It's what a child might imagine as salvation a Mommy who hadn't copped out. A Daddy with a bigger gun. A couple of brothers and sisters to play with. Heck, even a dog. The boy is left in about as good hands as he possibly could be, and that's somehow not quite satisfying.The Road is a great novel, but it is only a good film. Since this site is called The Movie Guys, and not The Book Guys, we'll have to settle for the latter. There is real suspense, tension, sadness, despair, trauma and hope in this film. But John Hillcoat gave in to the imaginings of a child's mind, and therefore stopped fighting for something a little scarier, a little more real, a little less innocent. It could have made for a great film.",The Road
266,eph007-304-665351,Good Adaptation...Some great moments,7,5 April 2012,"The movie does a really good job of truthfully and faithfully adapting the excellent book by Cormac Mcarthy, though the fabulous descriptions and images in the book are hard to translate without the medium of language and the use of wordplay.One of the highlights for me was Robert Duvall's performance particularly when he alludes to his own family experience. Watch for it. I rewound only that moment in the film while watching on DVD to see it twice. Viggo Mortensen (of whom i'm a fan) gave a great, honest performance. The kid was good but there were moments that i felt his acting facade cracked and i could see the inner workings and machinery of him trying to behave a certain way. In a word, I lost my belief for a moment here and there. Charlize theron was hauntingly beautiful and well acted in her brief appearances.All in all, its a good movie- if you can stomach it, because its as grim as the damned reaper.",The Road

268,tsheridan94,"So bleak, but amazingly well crafted",9,1 February 2010,"This may just be the most bleak and depressing movies I've ever seen. I love it. Not for the fact that it's depressing, but how well made the picture itself is. Director John Hillcoat is extremely faithful to Cormac McCarthy's novel, arguably one of the most bleak and depressing novels ever written.Although the movie is incredibly dark, dealing with concepts such as death and cannibalism, it is also chock full emotion. These characters, especially the man, played by Viggo Mortenson, tug at the heart. These characters are real, and I am never in any doubt of that fact.The landscape matches the tone of the movie. Skulls line the sides of the road. Trees stand leafless and forlorn. The fields lie dead and barren with the lifeless hulks of plants cracked and dry. A deserted highway stretches miles across the empty world, with the nothingness only broken by the horizon. No animals stir in the bushes. The buzz of insects is completely gone. The houses are in disrepair, trash and dirt littered throughout. This is what made the movie so great and unforgettable. This paints a picture of a post apocalyptic world in the way so few others have succeeded in making.Now, granted to call this movie entertaining is completely mis-guided. If this desolation entertains you, something is not right. This is not to say I regret seeing the film. The Road is one of the must see movies of the year. This picture is deeply moving. It left me enjoying the world we have while it lasts, in the way Pandora in the movie Avatar made me long for it's representations of Eden.Apocalyptic movies are a dime a dozen these days. Movies like Legion and the Book of Eli clutter the multiplexes. It takes a movie like the Road to make someone realize what these movies really should be. Rather than littering the gray landscape with stylized violence, the Road creates a touching image of survival. This picture should have received much more acclaim than it was given. If you can even find it in a theater near you, I can not recommend this more highly.",The Road

270,Otterman_MK2,Beyond Realistic,7,7 April 2011,"I haven't read the book myself but have only ever heard plenty of positive things about 'The Road'. And on the whole, I felt it was a worthwhile film.'The Road' is a very realistic interpretation of a post-apocalyptic world that a father and his son are forced to cross in order to head south. Themes such as cannibalism, suicide and loneliness are all heavily used themes in this film and remain a strong driving force of the story throughout the film. There were parts that were so well acted, a memorable part of the film is when the father seriously considers killing his son in order to save him from the cannibals who rape, beat and eat humans to survive. It is emotionally very straining, disturbing and in parts extremely upsetting. I was very shocked to see what humans are truly capable of when we have nothing left. There are some sections of the film strictly not for the faint-hearted, including a shocking scene in which humans that are barely alive are kept suffering in a cellar by a group of cannibals. Certainly one of the darkest films I have ever seen.The story itself is simple, revolving around a father and a son heading south. However there were a few problems I had with the story. Firstly the fact that they have no real reason to head south, or at least it is not fully explained. We can only assume there is either food, shelter or survivors, or possibly all of these things. Heading south is the film's main driving force, but with no reason to head there other than a last piece of hope, this is not the reason to keep watching the film. Another problem I had was the fact that throughout the movie the death of the father's wife and the son's mother is a recurring theme, but the climax of the film does not build on this at all. It felt necessary to have in the film, but was treated like a major part of the story that was never resolved. Also, the ending itself was a little disappointing and left me unsatisfied.The movie was beautifully filmed, highlighting the colours grey and white to show a world that died long ago. It is very depressing, and brilliantly engages the audience into the world and suffering of the protagonists. Literally everything is dying. The trees are all falling down, the sky and the sea are constantly grey, and even the land itself has lost it's colour. This may make it sound boring, but it will shock you.The acting is very well performed, these roles no doubt being very challenging. I will say, considering the boy's age, he did behave a bit too young at times.On the whole, this film will shock and upset you, which is clearly it's purpose as well as engage you with the characters which it succeeds at. The story may feel a bit flat, but this film has definitely earned a place on my shelf.",The Road

The Road is the most depressing film I'll ever see, but also one of the best.Having read the book over Christmas I was touched by the beauty of the writing and how the relationship between the father and son was portrayed. So I was really hoping the movie would do the book justice, and I wasn't disappointed. Everything about this film worked perfectly.Mortensen's voice over is haunting. It fits so well with whats going on, lines like 'I think its October' really strike you to the situation the desperate pair are in. The cinematography is some of the best I've ever seen, and the settings were really similar to how I pictured them in my head when reading the book. Along with a terrific score, the movie is filled with some of the most painful and frightening scenes I've ever seen.The performances are great all round, but Mortensen is the stand out by quite a way. Surely a best actor Oscar nomination is on the way. If this film was to sweep all awards in fact, it would be deservedly so.Final thought, as I was leaving the theatre, the only thought I had was a scary one.

273,Eternalkid,Gut wrenching and thought provoking,9,8 February 2010,"I'm now becoming increasingly fond of reading harsh reviews of films I think are outstanding before throwing in my own tuppence into the pot. Anyway, I'll address that issue later.First of all though, THIS FILM GETS YOU, RIGHT IN THE GUTS. I advise anyone with a low threshold to humanity-on-its-edge scenes, ie. the constant threat of cannibalism, to stay away from this.ON THE OTHER HAND, if you ever really wondered what might happen if some cataclysm hit our planet and there were only a handful of people trying to scrape a living, I strongly recommend this - in my view no other film depicts that struggle so well and so vividly.Most of it is unutterably dark, but the few moments of light in it within the constant struggle for safety and shelter and food are so uplifting I heard laughter in the cinema.Who the hell cares why the world we knew went away!? It did! And this is the story of what happens AFTER it goes away, after there is no more fast food or coke or anything.You're a dad with a ten year old kid - what on Earth do you do? Which lessons can you teach him in this new reality? And almost as important, what can an adult learn from a child in those circumstances.A gem of a film, if you can stomach the pain in it. But there's a lot of hope in it too. I never read the novella, I want to now. And I think I know it won't have the answers to the quibbling pedants (what went bang? where does the boy go from there?) - but so what!? It isn't about the destination, but all about the journey.Now, for those - I must say, utterly ignorant - reviewers who see two or three stars' names (in this case, Viggo, Charlize, Duvall and Guy Pearce) and expect a flashy flick, wake up!! There's far, far more to great cinema than bombs, monsters and cops! There's something called acting.Do you not read even ONE review before going in blind to a film expecting a blockbuster because X or Y actors are in it, only to then trash it in such simplistic and infantile wrath here?!? Excuse my ire, but such great acting, and story, and tension, and visceral cinematography should be recompensed, and not snubbed.If we ruin this planet, the way it certainly seems we are doing, this film will give you a glimpse of what will surely come after that.

This filmic essay of a hope-driven journey of a father and son through a horrific, dying world cuts very close to the fiber of real-life, survival ordeals in Darfur, Rwanda, the Balkans, Katrina/New Orleans, Indonesia, Gaza and Haiti. For millions now dead, there was horror and surely hope, but no way out. That is the sobering, monochromatic dilemma for the man and boy in ""The Road"" - a theme that does not sell tickets and in the real world is trivialized through the filters of CNN and celebrity reportage and reaction.The writing, directing, production and sound design, casting, acting, editing, music, costuming, makeup artistry, on-location staging, lighting, CG effects and cinema photography exhibit the highest level of collaborative, book-inspired, auteur-directed achievement.

276,pturner1010,"Father and son travel a long, long road, battling the elements, cannibals, starvation and the temptation for suicide in post-apocalyptic America.",8,12 June 2011,"According to Hollywood the world's going to end very soon. Not sure how, not sure why all that's clear is that civilization will crumble and only a few survivors will be left. As if the idea of the decimation of most of the world's population isn't depressing enough, John Hillcoat's The Road plunges the viewer into the desperate, hopeless struggle of a father and son to survive against misery, despair and the degenerate remnants of humanity. For much of its run time, the film is unrelentingly bleak, pessimistic and difficult to enjoy. Sadness and hopelessness bleeds from every frame. Still, for fans of drama, this film is a real tearjerker. Stick with its slow pace for a rewarding ending that may surprise with its glimmer of hope after all the preceding misery.The Road is unlikely to appeal to fans of other recent post-apocalyptic cinema such as I am Legend, The Book of Eli and Terminator Salvation, but if viewers are willing to succumb to its mounting sense of despair and forget about action set-pieces, there is plenty here to, perhaps enjoy is not the right word but appreciate.The plot is barren like the landscape the protagonists are traveling. Like Lord of the Rings, there is a great deal of walking to be done (only this time Aragorn does a hell of a lot less fighting along the way). This is road trip without the girls, drugs, good times with great friends or even a sodding car. So much of the film is just the man and his son (Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee) walking, occasionally talking and grimacing at the cold, the hunger and the fear of strangers on the titular road. The two leads carry the film, helped only briefly by interludes of flashbacks/dreams that add to the overwhelming sense of despair coursing through the veins of the film. In these flashbacks Charlize Theron has a thankless but memorable role as suicidal wife and mother that adds to the hopelessness of it all. The flashback structure adds to the poignancy of the central relationship between the father and son and reminds the viewer of the determination of the pair to survive. Cameos from Robert Duvall, Guy Pearce and other assorted traveling folk (some friends, some foes) add interest to what could become a stale, repetitive and unbearably slow and depressing slog.Duvall is fantastic in a brief role, but Mortensen and Smit-McPhee shoulder the burden of the entire film. Rarely off screen, Mortensen's performance is haunting; gaunt, caring, determined and half-broken. It is an incredible performance. Smit-McPhee is equally good with a whinier role but some heart-wrenching scenes that he pulls off convincingly. With scenes that require the father to put a gun to the head of his son in moments of desperation and despair, the pair are outstanding and believable throughout.While the pace is slow, the film feels a hell of a lot faster than the book which is a difficult read, despite its prize-winning popularity. The cinematography is excellent, particularly with the strangely beautiful shots of decimated landscapes. The never ending grey adds to the relentlessly bleak tone. Grey skies, grey trees, grey buildings and grey sea. Life has left this planet and it shows in every frame. Moments of colour are only glimpsed in reminders of what the world used to be; the opening flashback, the solitary coke can. Nick Cave and Warren Ellis' score complements the tone and gets under your skin with its sad, unrelenting piano.This film is far from the crowd pleasing post-apocalyptic scenarios of films like I am Legend. Cannibalism, starvation, rape and suicide are all very real threats to the protagonists. The film seems to be dealing with notions of morality with the father constantly teaching his son right from wrong. The boy must learn to be a good guy, not a bad guy. But the film questions the father and his moral codes, as the son does. What is bad in this new world? Is stealing wrong? Is suicide wrong? Is cannibalism wrong? It could also be argued the film also implicitly deals with contemporary America. The idea of fear and isolation and shutting oneself off from the 'bad guys' is crushingly foregrounded in the closing moments of the film. The idea that so many of these apocalyptic films have been made recently is because of American fears of civilizations imminent collapse rings true. The use of the gun as the last hope a man can have of protecting his family feels very right-wing and familiar from so many other American films. But the gun is almost used on many occasions in the film to prematurely end life, not just as protector of the family. The cause of the apocalypse is never explicitly stated but the original book has been praised by environmentalists for taking the potential outcomes of the human races current actions as a serious threat.The Road is undoubtedly a tough watch. It's not a popcorn/multiplex kind of movie and fans of 2012 and I am Legend may possibly want to give this a miss. It is a slow, grey and depressing film. There is very little action but many moments of suspense; heartbreaking, unbearably tense in places and carried by a pair of grim but inspiring protagonists, played with conviction by a couple of bright stars.",The Road

I thought that this is a very disturbing, as well as implausible flick.{15 years after the catastrophe??? } From an earlier scene where Charlize Theron's character gave birth to a child and flashbacks to a ""Normal"" past, to the main time-frame of the movie, it would seem that at least 12-15 years had elapsed since the unimaginable ""Castastrophe"".{ Why no army guys or aborigines running around ?} Being a realist by nature, I would have predicted the survivors to be a post apocalyptic melange of survivalists and / or military folks sprinkled in with those accustomed to live outside of technology (Think tribesman from the Amazon Rainforest, Aborigines from Northern Australia, etc. We only were given glimpses at cannibals and those being pursued / eaten by cannibals. There were NO military or natives running around.{ How can cannibals survive for more than a couple years? }I challenge anybody without major food supplies to live more than a few months, even with cannibalism. You gotta think if everybody survived past the point of no food, they would have to start eating somebody to survive. { Follow my reasoning here }* I am thinking the human body requires 2000 calories a day over time. Its probably double this if one is living outside and walking big distances or being chased. * An average adult person including both sexes, average about 150 pounds * Approximately 90 percent of a human's body is water. * This means that there is about 15 pounds of edible mass per person. * If a pound of flesh yields 3500 calories, a dead person will only yield about 18-24 days worth of food for 1 person. * Doing the math, a single person would need to eat about 15 - 20 people a year to survive.

It really does help that central casting sent an androgynous looking kid with anime-sized eyes.

284,walion,Breathtaking movie that retains the spirit of the masterpiece novel.,10,14 December 2015,"No doubt that John Hillcoat brought us the best possible adaptation to Cormack McCarthy's ""The Road"" - one of the most breathtaking and phenomenal books ever written, a book, so darkly toned that intertwines apocalypse, survival, hope and father-son love - a story that penetrates into the human's soul and reveals its both dark and light sides. The despair-stricken moments of the Man are mingled with a strong will and determination not to let his son down and also to protect-him-at-any-cost demeanor.Post-apocalyptic America, the nature is dead, all animals have perished, most of the human world as we know it is laid in ruins and ashes, just a little percentage of the human population is still alive, thirsty, hungry, scavenging , cannibalizing. No cause of the apocalypse is ever mentioned neither in the book nor in the film.It's the thrilling survival story of a father - The Man (Vigo Mortensen) and his son - The Boy (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who are traveling towards the US East Coast, with the hope that they will find other people like them, good people, carrying The Fire. It's a movie with a dark and unlit tone, which deeply affects the viewer, who can feel and touch the main characters' undying will and hope to survive and live for each other.",The Road
285,kennyevans,"Grim, sparse yet totally engaging-A film about being a Father, A Man and a Husband.",7,26 December 2010,"Being a fan of Mortensen's solid acting and dedication to his characters, I thought this film would be worth a shot. Knew it was a post apocalypse movie with very little in the way of much else and based on the Pulitzer prize winning book by Cormac McCarthy. I should say I haven't read the book.What I liked about this film was that it was true, at least as true as how I see the world - post some nasty population devastating event. Yes you wouldn't trust a soul, yes food would be scarce and once the animals and tinned food was gone, humans would be next on the menu. You don't really see much of that but there is a scene where a house has a 'larder' full of people ready to be cooked, run by some nasty looking types.Throughout the film as it progressed I was really hoping this wouldn't have some sugary happy ending, but once they left the safety of their newly discovered bunker, I think I was hoping something nice would happen amongst the bleakness of it all at least for the kid's sake! It was obvious Mortensens character wouldn't make it and only a matter of time before the kid would have to go it alone. He didn't have to in the end but that is one of my hang ups about the film. Although the kid was good at acting with nothing particularly demanding of a 'performance' - it did come across that despite his time out on the road living like he did, he would at least have been at bit tougher. Maybe they were following the book, maybe it was direction, maybe Viggo's character wasn't doing a great job of telling him that any person walking around was a potential assassin. He didn't seem to make any progress either and was still pleading with his Dad to give the black man his clothes back and give him a tin of food too. He showed a little bit of guts at the end but it was still weak and as a result I thought the entire character was a bit weak since he never really went anywhere or did anything of note. Not quite your John Connor from T2.However that was my only gripe with the film. I thought all other scenarios were true to the situation and a potential direction you may take given the same circumstances. The suicide pact seemed plausible given that you may be boiled in a pot by some nasty desperado like person at any moment.The cinematography was nice, in fact it was classy. Not much in the way of your usual Hollywood style look, very much natural light with some lift here and there to enhance practicals. There were obviously much in the way of FX shots for skies and stuff but it was seamless. I did think the CGI shot with the boats was a bit gimmicky, maybe not such an iconic, epic scene would have fitted the film better bearing in mind that no reason for the apocalypse was given. Other wide establishing shots were more tasteful I felt. I expected a lot more hand held work but most of the film was rock solid with also not much in the way of moving camera work. Nice to be able to just sit and watch something play out without the need to get a steadicam or dolly out in every shot.What this film is really about is being a parent. I'm not sure that if you haven't got children whether this film would resonate at all. I put myself in Dad's position and the boy as my own young son and just felt the whole thing. I think Hillcoat got the vibe of the story absolutely right. There's nothing much else here apart from a man's love for his son and what he would do to preserve it. Yes he had a perfectly good bunker stocked with food but the safety of his kid was paramount and he took a gamble to stay alive. It paid off. He held him and kissed him and bathed him and nurtured him, tried to teach him (see above) it was all about the relationship but moreover the role of Dad, Man and Husband. The whole thing hung on Mortensen's shoulders and I think he pulled it off admirably. The scene with the piano and it's significance was stunningly simple but so emotionally evocative. This is a director with a good handle on storytelling.Lots of people missed the point here. No there was no big explosions, an explanation, some kind of killer virus or hoards of zombies with a thirst for blood. Compare it to War of the Worlds (which I love but for other reasons) It was a bit more cerebral and a beautiful study of a relationship between Father and Son against the most bleak background you could imagine.",The Road

When it does there will be plenty of pretentious people giving reviews that tell us how brilliant it is.I wish I could understand why ANYONE would want to watch a movie like this. As many have already mentioned, there is zero entertainment value here. Is it possible that I'm just not high minded enough to understand that a movie is a form of escape, and should have some entertainment value? I bet some of the people giving this movie 9 or 10 scores are the same crowd who play video games and think that video games don't need to be entertaining. I guess we just need to experience misery and then talk about how it makes us feel. Surprise, surprise! It makes you feel miserable!I guess I should say something about the movie. Thankfully, it won't take long. There's an apocalypse of some sort and the movie protagonists are a surviving father and son. They travel along a road to get to the coast because, apparently, that's where all of the good people live so that's where the good survivors must be. Along the road that's in between the coasts are nothing but hillbilly cannibals because that's who normally lives in between the coasts. The goal is to avoid and or escape the endless stream of survivors while trying to encounter as many of them as possible. When you reach the coast the game.......sorry, I mean movie, is over.Just in case you are wondering, in addition to no entertainment value, there are ZERO likable characters. Now you could watch this movie for two hours, but I recommend watching that scene from deliverance over and over again instead. (You know the scene I'm talking about.) That scene kind of encapsulates the essence of this movie and you won't have to waste two hours.",The Road
290,smiley_pat77,"They are each ""the other's world entire""",7,17 July 2010,"This is a difficult experience. It's a disturbing disaster film because you don't actually see the disaster. This brilliantly focuses the story into a character-driven experience. What haunts you is the unknown, but what consumes you is the hope and love the two main characters share. All this is attributable to Cormac McCarthy, but to have it actually translated onto the screen requires some skill, particularly from the cast.The performances are what sell it. Viggo Mortensen as ""Man"" and Kodi Smit-McPhee as ""Boy"" avoid all of the clichés that could have cheapened the experience. Mortensen gives off a hint of determination while drowning in desperation that is at its peak in flashback scenes with his wife, ""Woman"" (played by Charlize Theron). Smit-McPhee plays a boy that is unlike any child in any other film. While he is open and optimistic to everything unfamiliar, he is also skeptical and fearful, because this man is all he has ever known. He is of another world because he knows nothing of our world.What ruins the experience is the pacing. Anything based on work from McCarthy must be given time to be absorbed. McCarthy writes in prose and avoids certain punctuation for the purpose of being more direct and using ""simple declarative sentences."" He believes in not ""blocking the page up with weird little marks."" So why block this film up with more cuts than what it needs? To be simple is to be real and to be real requires as few edits as possible.Director John Hillcoat and editor John Gregory should have learned a lesson from the Coen brothers (a.k.a. Roderick Jaynes) and slowed the tempo for this movie down. It might not be fair of me to hold the same standards for ""The Road"" as ""No Country for Old Men,"" but the attitude and rhythm of the books (or at least the pieces I have read of them) are very much similar. The Coen brothers were successful because they submitted completely to McCarthy's narrative tone. Hillcoat and Gregory, on the other hand, are a bit more traditional in their approach and it clashes with their story.Nevertheless, the visuals, the writing, and the acting all come together and manage to bring this collaborative struggle between a father and son to the screen and truly give a sense of each being ""the other's world entire."" I have not read the book, but after seeing this film I am now inspired to and know that I must. Given that, I render the film a success.",The Road
291,bee-17,Acting and story: great. Direction and editing: not so much.,6,18 January 2010,"I was very excited to see this movie, but came away disappointed. Most of the individual dialog scenes are well-crafted and agonizingly well-acted, but the interstitial editing and bridge scenes are so clumsy and distracting that they undermined the power of the story. There seem to be numerous lapses in time and continuity that the director makes no attempt to smooth over. It's almost like the film is missing 10-15 minutes.While writing this review, I read some more about the director and found that he cut his teeth in music videos. It shows. Each episode is a work-of-art on its own, with beautiful and horrific imagery right out of a graphic novel. But the director is in too much of a hurry to get from one scene to the next that he sacrifices any sense of pacing. As a result, there is no rhythmic structure to the film. It's erratic, but not in a way that serves the story.Another beef... One of the delights of science fiction movies is to get a sense of the backstory from casual dialogue/actions and background visuals. ""Regional governors"" in Star Wars, ads for suicide pills in Children of Men, the sushi shortage in Blade Runner, etc.This movie has little of such exposition, and what it does have is handled in an awkward, ""hey look at this"" manner. The film also goes on to break its own rules. E.g., it shows how emaciated the man and his son are, but it makes no attempt to explain why Robert Duvall is such a porker (the Thief also looks like pretty well fed).It's too bad, because it's clear that everyone involved in the film gave 110% to it. Maybe there'll be a director's cut that can make more sense of this mess.",The Road

Unlike the book being beautifully written, in an almost poetic prose, which distracted the reader from the subject, the movie is not beautifully shot.

Fine, the performances are good and Charlize, as always, is an inspiration, but man oh man, give me some story...give me some drama...give me something to latch on to. If you were able to get through the book not once having second thoughts about putting it down and finding something else to read, you'll probably enjoy the movie version.

Their main concern is a band of Hills Have Eyes style hillbilly cannibals that have resorted to eating people because of a massive food shortage and they will kill women and children with out a second thought.The film was touted as an Oscar contender before its release but fell a bit flat at the box office and got forgotten about and I can see why, the scenes with just the father and son can feel overly long at times, but not that its a slow film it just could have been a bit more entertaining.I give this film 3 out of 5.",The Road

And it's Magnificent!,9,20 December 2009,"There are post-apocalyptic movies where homosexual biker gangs fight over the last of the gasoline in vehicles that get 12 mpg. There are post-apocalyptic movies where delivering the mail takes on supreme importance. There are post-apocalyptic movies where (choose one: aliens/comets/weather) have destroyed everything in sight, and it's up to a small group of photogenic lead actors with perfect teeth and 4 days' worth of stubble to take a stand.Refreshingly, ""The Road"" takes a detour from these tired clichés, and portrays the End Of Life As We Know It in an entirely believable way: scrawny, filthy, homeless people scavenge the wasteland for their next meal, trying not to become food themselves. The reason for their predicament is only loosely hinted at, and it's unclear the characters themselves even know what happened. This vagueness only elevates the movie.One of the credits at the end of this movie was for ""Proesthetic Teeth,"" so you know attention has been paid to detail, and the movie is about 55% more enjoyable as a result. The characters look as if dentists haven't been around for 10 years. Beards are long and scraggly. Grime is ever-present. In the age of CGI backgrounds, it is also noteworthy that this movie used real disasters as backdrops for the scenes: Charred stands of timber on Mt. St. Helens in Washington, two actual shipwrecks off the Oregon coast, (one boat is definitely the Peter Iredale, the other one looks a lot like the New Carissa) and what had to be sections of New Orleans never rebuilt after Hurricane Katrina.The adaption is faithful to the book. Unlike McCarthy's previous big screen adaptation ""No Country For Old Men,"" The changes in the sequence are minor and the omissions seem purely to keep the running time manageable and probably to avoid an NC-17 rating. (I agree that the movie didn't need to include the scene in the book when the father and son come upon the abandoned campfire... ) ""The Road"" belongs in the same family of movies as ""Million Dollar Baby,"" ""Boys Don't Cry,"" and a similar-in-many-ways post-apocalyptic movie ""Testament"" because they are certainly depressing to watch, but they are also incredibly well-made movies that are worth seeing, if you enjoy that sort of thing. It isn't for everyone. It might be one of the worst movies to take a date to.My suggestion: see ""The Road"" when you are already in a bad mood or feeling sad about something. You won't necessarily feel happy afterward, but you'll feel slightly better by appreciating things you have previously taken for granted, like ""food"" and ""shoes"" and ""not being cannibalized.""",The Road

297,vortex007,Road to the void,8,4 June 2010,"Pretty extraordinary post-apocalyptic vein, all the main peculiar features were dropped away from the film. Talking about peculiar features, I mean action of course, most of the post-apocalyptic styled movies always have plenty of entertaining action. In «The Road» it is opposite; here we got kind of art-house, where particular attention focused on relationships, humankind nature and animal instincts of desperately trying to survive people.Above all, it's a movie about instincts, for instance, against the all odds, father tries to protect his only one sun, disregarding that the mankind already doomed. Other types of the instincts implemented here in the way of the animal cruelty such as cannibalism, murders, inflexibility etc, etc. In a hope to survive in this ruined and sinister world the main heroes are wandering and searching around all that might be useful for sustainable life, escaping from cannibals, rogues and thieves. During their journey and discovering travels in this desolated world, we see a lot of landscapes and views of the devastated towns and villages which is looks really staggering and stunning especially when you watch it in the movie theater. «The Road» imbued by the menacing cruelty of people yet it omits all appalling and disgusting scenes, creating just an atmosphere without a total immersion of the spectator into all bloody details.Viggo Mortenson played rather good, but I noticed that sometimes he and other actors overacted too much. I love touching scenes, but I believe less of them would made the film not so boring in some cases. Regardless to this disadvantage «The Road» looks almost perfect, I'd say perfect in the art-house frameworks, don't expect here spectacular action which you could see in one's sleep. «The Road» created for comprehensive viewers with a flexible mind who are not estimate cinema only as a relaxation and fun. I won't exaggerate if I'd say that it's one of the best post- apocalyptic movies.

The Road has to be one of the most depressing, pointless, excruciating movies you could ever see. It will make you want to go home and stick your head in the oven.The first 7 hours of the movie contain an endless slog through a desolate landscape bereft of plant and animal life. Only bugs and humans remain, somehow. Everything else on Earth has been burnt or smashed by some unacknowledged Doomsday Event. The director leaves it up to the audience to somehow figure out what kind of reasonable scientific explanation could account for anyone surviving for any amount of time after all the oxygen-producing plant life plus everything else in the food chain between bugs and people bit the dust. Apparently it happens through the magic of Dole Pineapple Chunks, the search for which takes up another 4 hours of movie.Once you get inured to this laugh riot, you eventually start to disassociate from the main characters. The Boy in the book is supposed to be 6 or 7. In the movie, though, he looks to be about 10 or 11, but seems to still act 6 or 7. He comes across as a total feeb and you start to wonder how a kid born on the cusp of a complete apocalypse manages to have such poor coping skills. The Kid was supposed to have been running into dead bodies and cannibals practically every day of his life so you'd think he'd be over it after 9-10 years, but no, he manages to seem traumatized at every instance.Dad doesn't help things out much as he spends his days talking to the kid like he's three and tucking him in and carrying him around every chance he gets. I'm sure that'll help grow hair on his chest, Dad! It's nice to see that no matter how shitty the world gets, there's always a parent willing to overshelter their kid from the reality of their situation.Dad also seems to make poor survival decisions. The poorest decision comes when the two find a friggin' BOMB SHELTER FILLED WITH FOOD AND WARM BEDS, but after a couple days they need to abandon it because they heard somebody walking around up top. Apparently this is the only bomb shelter in existence that didn't come with a lock on the hatch, and everyone knows how easy it is for a starving bum to breach a cement bunker with a steel trap door on it. It's much easier to pile a bunch of crap in an old push wagon and hit the road again to defend it in the open air against every marauder and sneak thief that walks by, while you slowly die from exposure.But one can't point fingers at such glaring plot holes, because This Is Such A Serious, Award-Winning Oscar Contender! You can tell this movie is an Oscar contender because the kid cries real tears and there are at least a couple scenes where the audience gets treated to a rear view of Viggo's naked ass and nutsack. Everyone knows that if Viggo is letting you see his junk, he's very much into his role and you should respect his process by taking his nuts very seriously like he does.There's a scene somewhere in the middle where The Mom (Charlize Theron) decides to end it by walking out into the freezing winter in her sleep shirt to die in the woods, because she can't take it anymore. By the end of the movie, you'll be wishing you'd walked out in the middle too.",The Road
307,Retrochamber,A ten for the strip to basic fatherhood,10,9 January 2019,"This is a pure and affectful story about fatherfood; take away everything that you know about the world (as McCarthy did with this), and this is it. No more, no less. This is the basic fatherhood in the flesh.The fact that we never get to know what did cause the deadshot killing of the world is in line with the narrative surrounding the basic message. As all the grey and the dead. It is meant to keep a close eye on the dynamics between a father and son. It has been a long time since I really cried to a movie. Think Con Air was the last. But this. Sobbing my face soaked.I did know that Viggo Mortensen was about to take a long break before this pic, and I knew that he did take a break after the film, so I was looking for a sign of lacking motivation in his acting, which I found in a few places. But I don't know; could be cause I was specifically looking for it.My eyes opened to Cormac McCarthys stories when I heard why the Coen brother chose to do No Country For Old Men (big fan of the Coens by the way). I liked No Country For Old Men. Now I am a big fan of McCarthy too.",The Road
308,sc_taylor,What a disappointment!,3,19 January 2010,"Just went to see ""The Road"" (I had been really looking forward to it as I am a fan of Mr Mortensen).What a disappointment! From the first minutes I thought to myself 'with all this bleakness it's going to be jolly hard to keep the interest going'. Well, quite! I was bored after half an hour. I found that try as I might, I just couldn't seem to care for either of them, or what happened to them. But the worst of it is that it has more holes than a colander! Indulge me while I list but a few;How on earth does the boy manage to look so healthy and perfect when all they have to live on is a couple of locusts a week? His skin would be sallow, his teeth would be brown, his hair lank etc etc.How come the height marks on the door in Viggo's childhood home are still there 40 years later? Has no one ever decorated the place since?How do they manage to find a bomb shelter, unlocked and barely concealed which just happens to be stock full of food and nice clean bedding when there have been gangs of violent men on the prowl for years taking every last crumb?Why on Earth do they leave the aforementioned well stocked bomb shelter heading right out into the danger they believe they hear outside, instead of battening down the hatches and staying in the comfort and plentiful food? Absolutely crazy!How on earth when they suddenly binge on all the goodies do they not vomit it straight back up? After all they are presumably suffering from moderate to severe starvation! But how on Earth have they survived that long, on practically nothing? The boy was born when the apocalypse had already started and is about 8 or 9 years old!When the boy catches an infection and gets a fever, how does he ""just recover"" from it? He would be badly malnourished and could well die of such an illness. At the very least he would be seriously ill for a long time.The whole thing is just a series of badly thought through, lazy vignettes and set pieces on which to hang some semi-profound cloth-eared metaphysics and father-son bonding, survival through love, blah di blah. And that ending is just cheese city! Not only is it absurdly 'convenient' that at the very moment his dad dies, the only decent people in the entire film suddenly turn up, as if by magic, to rescue him. But the final shot virtually has the bloody dog smiling! It's like some happy families, Kodak moment.Deary me! I just couldn't wait for it to end!",The Road
309,frankopy-2,An engaging little dessert,7,8 December 2010,"I like the small ambition of this movie, its focus on atmosphere, its total lack of any audacious aspiration.I've read that Norah Jones is too amateurish to play the lead and has lots to learn from others in the well-stocked cast; true, that. But her naiveté leads to the film's feel of innocent wonderment, and she is perfect for the role in just that way. I had never heard of the director, being an older movie watcher, so any responses to or mention of his other work won't be focused upon here. Jones' bus trip to self-exploration is a little gem, in these eyes, and the work of Rachel Weitz, Natalie Portman, Frankie Faison, Jude Law and, particularly, David Strathairn, who -- within the same character --provides us with two distinct people, almost. Not moods, personalities, but people. A brilliant performance that had me, for a fleeting, moving moment, think he was playing twins -- that I had missed something crucial. Overall, a nice little slice of good-looking dessert. It's not trying to say anything world-altering, just inviting us in for a look at some good-to-ogle people worth our time.",The Road

311,stg213,As real as it ever got on screen,10,31 January 2010,"First I'd like to mention that I didn't read the book, so I evaluated the movie without any previous expectations. Through what I've read from people who had read the book I can understand their frustration when important aspects get watered down, or simply changed to make movies more accessible to a wider audience. What I am wondering though is: have the changes altered the message ? have they changed the story so completely that the movie ends up telling a different story with a different meaning ? The first part of this review is aimed at people who haven't seen the movie yet so no spoilers here, just a viewing guide.The story is fairly simple and not the main focus of the movie: Father and son navigate a post-apocalyptic landscape trying to survive. If you're looking for plot twists and lots of action scenes then this movie will disappoint you. The whole action of the movie is actually a psychological drama that unfolds through the characters.If you've ever wondered how life would be like for you, as a personal experience, after such an event, then you've got the key to understanding and getting something out of the movie. The point is for you to imagine yourself taking the journey with the characters, to place yourself in their shoes, to wonder: what would I have done ? The movie does all it can to help you feel, to help you be there and experience.SLIGHT SPOILERS BELOWThis second part is more a comment of the movie as a whole and aimed at people who have seen the movie.Comparing it to any other post-apocalyptic movies, this one surely delivers. Could it have been better ? For sure! Could it have been even more brutal and bleak, probably, but probably for an unprepared audience this one was bleak enough, it's by far one of the movies which inspires desperation far more than any I can remember seeing lately, regardless of the genre or setting.The movie is mainly a wake-up call at the human condition, a question of both morality and sanity asked at the naked man. No civilization around to make things easy, no police, no institutions, just harsh survival and the question if there is any morality worth holding on to. The deeper question is also to see where and how morality has any validity at all, all done without much lecture and more through actions letting you feel your way through rather than think your way through.Now to the ""bad"": Call me old fashioned but I like some logic in my movies: first of all the whole apocalyptic plot doesn't really hold together. A nuclear winter would not look like what's portrayed, and an ecological collapse doesn't fit the ""culprit"" either. We're asked to accept the situation as given, and I have no problem with that, but I can't shake the feeling that rather than portraying realistic events, the background apocalypse is a gimmick to justify the actions, or in other words: the world complies to the narrative instead of the narrative complying to realistic events. Where do the earthquakes come from ? Why did all animals die but humans survive ? If it's a nuclear winter, why is there no radiation ? Why aren't cities leveled ? This leaves a big chunk of realism out and was a bit disappointing. Not a deal-breaker, but certainly something that could have been better.Other logic issues: why where they so desperate to go south ? What's south ? Why would the ""good guys"" be south ? What is their future anyway ? If the world is dying, what are they fighting for ? Just to survive another day ? Another thing I both liked and disliked was the portrayal of cannibals. I liked that they where not demonized, which made them all the more frightening, portrayed as real people, not mindless zombies, they become truly frightening. On the other hand they are treated very superficially, and only through the eyes of the self-proclaimed ""good guys"". I would have liked to see the other side also, the justifications, the objectification, the denial, how ""bad guys"" view ""good guys"". There are some aspects sprinkled here and there, like the conversation with the ""peeing man"" or the lines by the cannibals with the cellar: ""you don't feel the smell anymore ?"" or ~ ""I'm going to take a bath"" which portrays them in a human way. The cellar scene being one of the most shocking and powerful scenes of the whole movie.The last bit that seemed wrong was the ending. It felt forced. I understand that it's different from the book, and I also understand it's supposed to give at least some hope... but on the other hand it makes no sense and fails to deliver even what it's trying to deliver, meaning hope and relief. The world is dying, the kid probably won't make it into adulthood or much beyond it as hidden food stashes will become uneatable in 10 or 20 years and cannibalism will be all that's left. The whole ""hope theme"" fails, as it fails to deliver any viable hope in the context it presents.All in all I give it 9 out of 10 mainly because of the reference group. There isn't much to compare it with, and the ""competition"" is so weak that ""The Road"" truly stands out. It convinced me to read the book and find out more, and also delivered a moving and deep experience. For these reasons I applaud the effort, and hope that it won't take another 20 years for the idea to be taken to the next level.",The Road
312,KaDaWe,"Solid, But Nothing You Have To Watch More Than Once",6,21 August 2013,"Cormac McCarthy is in my opinion one of the best writers of the last century. ""Blood Meridian"" and ""No Country For Old Men"" are both amazing and he has a very special writing style. Because of that I had high expectations for ""The Road"". Though I didn't read it, I was sure that the film would be great. My expectations sadly weren't fulfilled. Don't get me wrong, it's still a nice movie, very depressing, shocking, but nonetheless good. It just doesn't reach the standard I'm used to from McCarthy's books and adapted films. The reason I'm not completely sold on is that I really didn't like any of the characters besides an old man who's in the picture for about five minutes. The father is very rude. He may not kill, but he lets people die without mercy. I understand that it's really hard to live in this world, but he said once at the beginning that there are not many good people left ... So why does he let the few of them die?The boy is not really better. Always friendly and calm, he is the exact opposite of his dad. When the dad is attacked and defends himself by shooting the assailant, the child resists the action of his father. For me that doesn't make any sense. And at last: the mother. I think it's pretty clear that she's unsympathetic. She's so emotionless. It's really sad ...I could go on with all the other characters, because no one's really sensitive, but it would take too long. Overall, it's a good story, just nothing really special -> six out of ten points.",The Road

You don't know how all ended so messed up and you don't care, you are here to see the consequences.A father and his boy are traveling south in America, they must avoid contact with anyone, since that everyone is trying to survive, that means throwing away the little human decency that you could have left.Earth is now hell, a place where other humans are just flesh to be consumed.",The Road
314,eleagece,Carry the fire,10,14 January 2018,"This movie is an essay on humanity: why we are the way we are. Why some give up, why some fight against everything, why some are good, why some are evil.Why love is not immutable, why the time chooses you and you don't choose the time. Why life is not what you expect, but what you can do with what you get. Why purpose is the engine of life. Why carrying the fire is the most important thing.Based on the namesake novel by Cormac McCarthy, The Road translates perfectly the thrill and reflection of the book. The acting by Viggo Mortensen, Kodi Smit-McPhee and Charlize Theron conveys every emotion without the need of any ornament. The art direction with the contrast between the dreams from the past and the desolation in the present is perfect. The photography and the art direction are a punch in your stomach. And finally, the edit and direction are masterful. John Hillcoat makes the story crawl the way the life does in that apocalyptic world: slow and with determination.For me, this is with Children of Men on of the best films about what happens when society as we know gets destroyed and humanity shows what is really all about",The Road

316,Slim_Jack_Rabbit,An unimaginative and pointless fair.,1,29 May 2010,"I have no idea what it is I just saw. But considering the praise it has gotten, this sure was a big disappointment.The movie tries to be bleak and depressing but really only succeeds in being dull, plodding and repetitive. And you can add unimaginative and implausible to that list as well. The Biblical references are needlessly tacky and emotionally manipulative to the point of being crass. The character of the boy is, apart from being terribly overacted, appalling and the way he acts is completely out of tune considering the circumstance of an entire life of survival. Another minor complaint is that he looks far too healthy, but that can be forgiven if the movie offers some interesting ideas to sink our teeth in. Of course, it never does. The movie mostly fails, as is so often the case within this genre film, to offer the viewer protagonists we can care about. The father is an obsessive paranoid and the boy a whiny wimp with apparently no survival instinct at all. To add insult to injury, most of dad's decisions make absolutely no sense and only help to further the alienation of the viewer. Already Half way through the film, I wished for the kid to be slaughtered by one of the cannibals so dad could finally commit suicide. Why is it so hard to think up some interesting and realistic ideas when exploring the post-apocalyptic Earth? Why do we once again have to suffer through two hours of poor decision making, bleak and boring visuals with, in the end, no resolution? I'm all for independent movie making, but if this is the crap that keeps getting made, I'd rather prefer the overproduced War of the Worlds or I am Legend. At least these films have enough entertainment value that you can see passed the obvious plot holes, contrivances and silliness. They are also better casted. I mean, what the hell was Robert Duvall doing in this movie? That useless bit could just as well have been played by Ed O'Neill..Despite the high ranking, not recommended at all.",The Road

Predictable characters and story line (did you expect a happy ending?) wrecked buildings, abandoned cars and rogue vigilantes. I walked out after the fifth flash back as did a number of other people who were seen at the box office clamoring for a refund. This should have been released for Halloween, not for Thanksgiving. Having read some of the pontifications and adulation of this redundant and mundane cinematic event, I am amazed at the perspective some reviewers brought to this movie and at the posting above.

318,Kevin_turner_5,The fire inside,10,2 February 2010,"The Road is probably the best movie of its genre, that has ever been made. Its unique in every aspect, the mood, the story telling, and the direction of the film. In fact the movie is so powerful that you actually believe you are living with the two characters and you feel what they feel. I have rarely seen movies that actually put you there in the story, its like reading a book but your not imagining it. Your actually there.The acting is soooo good that you actually believe and maybe they did, subject themselves to what happens in the film. Its insane, its a must watch movie that'll make you think of it for ever.

319,Internist,Decent but could have been so much better,7,2 December 2009,"There's always a risk in seeing the film adaptation of a book you love. When you're head over heals about the book, it's very rare, indeed, for the movie not to disappoint. But there's another risk, too. When sharing your opinion about such a film, your audience is almost guaranteed to think you're a snob. I promise - I am not a snob! Hear me out. Please.The movie is visually stunning in its bleak, hopeless, decay-ridden vistas. Interiors are full of terror, some suggested and much explicit. Visually, then, the movie gives total allegiance to the book. Likewise, the characters and their dreams, and their nightmares, are compelling - just as they were in the text. As has been stated by many other reviewers, the acting is superb. Viggo is a genius (the lack of general appreciation for his performance in Eastern Promises is sad and inexplicable). Newcomer Kodi Smit-McPhee avoids overacting (a fault of so many young actors) and touches our hearts repeatedly, while Charleze Theron is magnificent at conveying the mother who's run out of hope but not love.So, why only seven stars? Although the book soars by its brilliant and often novel use of dialogue, sentence fragments, expressive phrases and power words, it is the meaning and content of those words and sentences which underlie its greatness. Why does the film omit so many of those treasures? In possibly the most moving scene in the book, the father admonishes his son to always talk to him after he (the father) dies. Papa reassures the boy that he will surely answer. In what are, in my opinion at least, the most important few sentences of the book, he heartens the boy by explaining that ""goodness"" will find him. ""It always does"". In addition to these wonderful but sadly omitted father/son conversations, the movie also leaves out much of the clever and provocative dialogue spoken by the old man, ""Ely"". For example, we never hear, ""There is no God and we are his prophets"". Why were these, and so many other, magnificent portions of the text not included in the film? It defies explanation. In going from book to movie, of all things it is easiest to be faithful to the original dialogue. There was simply no reason to purge the text as was done, especially when it was so remarkable and extraordinary. The movie is so much the less for having done so.Finally, I'll acknowledge that it is often impossible to translate and transform from one medium to another. And that is even more the case for a work by the unique Cormac McCarthy. There can be no filming of prose, no visualization of ambiguous or provocative dialogue. It often becomes necessary to substitute a new plot device, or simply a new plot development to try to make up for those unfilmable entities. And, indeed, in this movie it seemed that the missing speech was to be offset by introducing more action sequences, more chases, more horror. Alas, in doing so, more than McCarthy's words were lost. We lost, too, their often sublime subtlety, their ability to move us and to make us think. We lost what made the book brilliant.",The Road

There is very little light in this movie both literally and figuratively. Almost everyone that the heroes encounter on their journey are awful, horrible people.

322,Bart_OP,Loved the book... Loved the Movie,8,1 December 2009,"""It's not as good as the book."" seems to be one of the most common sentences in discussions about movies. I have certainly uttered it many times. I try to judge a film on it's own merits as a separate art form, but cannot help the comparison, especially when elements that I love in a book are sacrificed in the translation to the screen (especially if I felt the changes were made in service of some 2 hour ""time limit""). I can only remember one time that I thought a movie improved on a book (The Godfather and the Godfather Part 2.) There are certainly many times I felt that a mediocre book served as the basis for a mediocre movie (The DaVinci Code). Cormac McCarthy's works have generally translated well to the screen, especially No Country for Old Men. The Road was one of the most wonderful books that I can remember - to create a sense of hope against an overwhelmingly dismal post-apocalyptic backdrop is no small feat. As I read it I found myself sympathizing with the fears and frustrations for the man and, at the same time, completely drawn into the innocence and wisdom of the boy. I could not put the book down - I had to know the ending of this story.As I sat watching the movie, I was right back in the book. John Hillcoat and Joe Penhall's collaboration made for a marvelous adaptation of this compelling story. Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee were outstanding. The film editing and art direction in this picture really contribute to the overall post-apocalyptic feel. The use of color in the otherwise gray backdrop was pure film-making genius. I was dragged to the height and depths of emotions and felt every anguish and small triumph experienced by the on-screen duo. In the end, I experienced both the triumph and the uncertainty of the human condition. And felt that I had seen a movie that was as good as the book.",The Road
323,coco200066,Powerfully Emotional.,10,23 December 2009,"I just got back from seeing this movie and I can tell you that I left the movie with more than a tear in my eyes. This movie was so powerful and emotionally challenging throughout, that you would have to be very hard hearted not to be effected.There wasn't one moment in the movie where I was bored, there where lots of moments that did however make you think and wonder what you would do, how you would react, indeed, question your moral center.*SPOILER ALERT* Actors where excellently picked for their roles. Charlize Theron made me so mad although at the same time I could totally relate to her suffering. Robert Duvall as always was top notch, leaving me genuinely interested in his story.As for Viggo Mortensen, what can I say. His acting was gut wrenching and his story heroic. He brilliantly captured the pain and anguish of a Father whose only reason for living was the safety of his son. Adding to that, he so clearly portrayed the workings of the human animal in these situations, the fear, the mistrust and the real threat of losings ones own humanity.Kodi Smit-McPhee, the boy, couldn't have done a better job. He totally captured the purity of an innocent. Helping his Father complete their journey with dignity and heroism. Truly a masterpiece. So much so I intend to read the book as with most movies, so much detail is left out. If the movie was this good, I can only expect wonderful things from the novel.Two thumbs up, a must see especially for all wondering what they would do in a natural disaster scenario, or indeed those living in the shadow of 2012.

It's when you start having good dreams that you're in trouble."" I think that was just a good dream. It made no sense otherwise. Why would a family decide to follow them?

325,sgtGiggsy,Avoid it at all cost,3,18 February 2015,"Boring, illogical, and the most part, unbelievable. It's exactly the movie that some snob love to call good, because it's overly dramatic. The problem is it lacks the real depth and explanation. I don't mean the back-story, we know, something happened, and the world died. Okay, it doesn't need an explanation. On the other hand, there are several things that would. I mean, okay, there are cannibals, who eat people, because basically nothing else left. But where do the cannibals get the people to eat? In the movie we see about twice as many cannibals as non-cannibals, and it's might be an understatement. I wonder how much meat a human, who nearly starved to death can provide. I'm sure not too much. Not nearly enough to feed the cannibals for this long. The characters constantly lack proper clothing, while most of the humanity extinct. Why? I mean there are malls, there are people's houses, from they could get clothes, yet every character looks like they lived the last few years in one set of clothing. Why are they walking? Are bikes extinct too? Again, you go to a mall, get a bike with what you can go twice as fast and can carry twice as much stuff. Why do the father and his son wander on the ROAD, while it's obvious that all the cannibals hunt there? I don't think it would be that hard to avoid roads and took the woods (what's left of them). Why do they set campfires all the time in visible areas. When there are no other light sources, a campfire is visible from kilometers far, yet the father and his son, who supposed to hide from the cannibals, light campfires every night. The whole movie uses illogical choices on the characters' part, just to increase the drama. I understand that they tried to show a situation, where nothing else left than the survival itself, and there is nothing else to live for. It's a desperate situation, but still everything in this movie is overly dramatic. Unfortunately people do live in situation that close to what we see in this movie, and they still able to survive. People live in constant war from the day they are born, people live in places where basically no food, yet they still able to find something to live for, without constant crying. They don't stop to bitch about life, or moral choices, because they are busy with trying to not die. Aside from the kid, the acting is good, but you don't expect less from a movie with Vigo Mortensen, Charlize Theron, Guy Pearce, and Robert Duvall in it. Unfortunately even they can't make this a decent film. This is a very pretentious movie. Not in a Michael Bay way of course. It does everything to make you depressed, and to be honest, if you can set aside of ALL the illogical things that happen in it, you will feel what the creators wanted you to. Deep depression. But in the moment you start to think about why certain things happen in the movie, you will feel these two things: boredom (because of the pace), and/or anger (because of the half-baked things).",The Road
326,ZombieFlanders,"A bleak, near masterpiece.",9,26 June 2010,"When The Road begins, with little to no explanation, the world has burned, now dying a slow death. From what we can gather, for approximately ten years until we join the film in present day. The few humans left trudge over nature's remains in search of food and mere survival. Cannibalism has become, for some, the only option. We follow nameless Man and Boy exclusively on their journey - constantly living in fear. This a world where the moral dilemmas of our protagonists are stripped down to being either ""the good guys"" or ""the bad guys"". The Road encompasses an other worldly atmosphere. A disturbing re-creation of a post apocalyptic world. Given the elements pulled together by director, cinematographer and production designer, I was blown away by the film's look. A gorgeous, moving artwork on a decaying future world.The few ""action"" scenes feel perfectly placed. Not intruding on the pace, but unraveling at just the right moments to keep the main journey constantly involving. All the thriller elements in Road I thought were expertly directed. One scene in a mansion provided chilling suspense that rivals anything I have seen in modern horror in a long time. Director John Hillcoat has said his film is not a horror one, but with it's themes of cannibalism; it delves into the darkest notions of human desperation. That is an exercise in pure horror. Perhaps compared to the novel, it has been toned down, but there is no denying the territory we are in in these moments.Kodi Smit-Mcphee's performance as the boy is possibly the only distraction unfortunately, but I think for a child actor, he does extremely well and as good as probably expected. Mainly, given the intense material too. Obviously, the connection between Man and Boy is the crux of the story and unfortunately, it seemed to lack some depth. Convincing enough, yes, but not earth shatteringly emotional. I still believed in their connection, it just did not move me as much as I'd hoped. In reality, as it is entertained in the film, they are virtually from different worlds. The boy only knowing the one of cannibalism and desperation, while The man once had that normal life. Having a connection that lacks a more predictable, typical father son level of emotion, could possibly be a more apt approach. Viggo Mortensen as The Man, unsurprisingly, excels. Outstanding in breathing life into the character, especially when you consider him in the flashbacks, then in present day as time goes on and finally as his inevitable death looms. His arc perfectly realized, his desperation was gut wrenching in some scenes. It proved to me yet again, that he remains one of the most impressive and important actors of his generation. Of the side players, Charlize Theron, Robert Duvall and Guy Pearce were all excellent in their respective, brief appearances.The Road was haunting, suspenseful and poignant. A near masterpiece of the bleak, depressing nature of loss and notion of what would you do? The idea of a post apocalyptic world is one that always brings an intriguing interest, but I felt Road transcended a mere genre tag with it's stunning set design and powerful performances. Nick Cave and Warren Ellis's score I found appropriate and unobtrusive, if not overly exceptional. Finally, though, is it too much to award a film that shows a child being taught to kill himself? Seems to be, but sometimes dwelling in such a dark place is a rewarding and necessary thing.",The Road

I also love apocalypse themes. Of all I have seen this is definitely the best. It deserves 10/10 for the simple fact that I imagine that this is how it would feel to exist after the world has really ended. This is what the movie sets out to do and it does it brilliantly. All these people are complaining that it has no story - what is a story? Some fabricated, stilted load of hogwash they whack in there for pretense? The Day After Tomorrow comes to mind. There was a movie with an absolutely great idea and millions spent on fabulous special effects and then, the so called ""story"" destroyed it. I would never watch that again. The Road however, I have already watched twice. It really does put you there and it makes you think about what YOU would do if it were you. Classic.",The Road

331,ajaymittal,"Illogical, Intellectually Unstimulating but Artistically Awesome",6,26 May 2010,"A film should be based on its performance on screen, not rated in association with what the book offers. I say this as I know many believe the book was more intellectually stimulating and adds value to the film - I haven't read it.From a purely film perspective, it just seemed totally illogical that the father and son lived in relatively good condition (so much so that they could walk for miles and miles) whilst most of the country were starved to their bare bones. At times, for instance when Theron leaves the house, they claim it to be cold, yet she was dressed in one layer....why? If she'd lived like that for years, why did she suddenly feel ""this is no way to live"" - implying she craved the luxuries of life. These are questions that just annoy me and are by no means thought provoking. Character-wise, I felt the film made the boy seemed irritating and stupidly cowardly for someone brought up in that world (""there's nothing you haven't seen before"" the father says once). For acting: Viggo - 8/10 Charlize - 9/10 Kodi - 4/10One thing I will say is that The Road excels artistically in its portrayal of a life-less world full cannibalism and divided by good and evil (defined by the decision to eat a man to survive). It did make me feel like I was watching a moving picture in between frames, not a TV screen. A great achievement yet unsurprising coming from a Director who happens to be a painter as well.",The Road
332,winston9109,A Miserable Journey Displayed Beautifully,9,15 November 2009,"With a surplus of post-apocalyptic/disaster flicks present in today's film circle, the Road does what very few films in any genre seem capable of doing. Here is a picture that in it's own discreteness captures the realism of a holocaust horror, combining the absolute worst possible future with the most profoundly beautiful human characteristics that keep the main characters persevering. Not only does the story accurately exhibit the polar opposite aspects of a post apocalyptic existence, but the cinematography used during the flashbacks of a life full of color and hope many take for granted, is excellently positioned with the dark, dismal, and often terrifying reality that is the Road. The score was also fantastic and perfectly appropriate for the film.The only two, minor issues I had were the sound editing, (MINOR!) and the ending which was NOT at all a disappointment, but I felt it was quite open, without giving anything away. This is, again, a minor issue, for the story in itself was a journey, and we see only a small portion of the great, tragic, and ultimately fulfilling struggle.And, though I'm sure no more attention is necessary, the acting as a whole was phenomenal. Each film since LOTR Viggo has greatly improved and I'd like to think of this as the beginning of his finest hour. Very few performances touch me emotionally, and his was certainly one of them, in three scenes in particular which were, being discrete, (the parting flashback, the dinner, and the climax.) Well done, the Road, thank you Mr. Mortenson.",The Road
333,robert-broerse,Not worth the trip... Slight Spoiler but Related to Theme,3,15 January 2010,"This film is a dull disappointment at best. I have not read the book nor plan to. It astounds me how many people are impressed with this unbalanced, relatively lacklustre film. The dismal scenery wouldn't be so much the problem had the material itself been worthwhile.I'm not one to be afraid of bleak material. A work of art should never have to explain itself but there has to be structure, variety of themes, ideas, coherence and plausibility. The Road is a plausible story but tailored to an audience without a sense of humour, people who happen to revel in pessimism and continually find the much abused 'redemption' theme somehow original in an industry saturated with Holocaust films and romantic comedies. (If it isn't the rush to the airport scenario/make-up scenes, its the release of a prisoner.) The human character is far more complex than this film would you lead to believe. The acting is good, acceptable but at times it would be nice to see a smile, let alone a nuance as opposed to the three blasting emotional tenors of fear, anguish and sorrow. Imagine listening to a song with only minor chords and you'll understand that there is virtually no spectrum here, let alone a hint of subtlety in the performances. Viggo is good but one gets the impression he could have 'mailed' it in (to borrow a much-used cliché).One thing I continually find difficult is that for a man who is determined to get somewhere like Viggo's character, wouldn't he have greater emotional tools as well as survival skills to get to his goal? We understand he has endured a great deal and a man can only take so much but wouldn't there be evidence of his deeper will in his coping? Watching the film I only saw physical reactions to the hostile environment and never human, below the surface ones.The viewer has to ask his or herself - is watching this film an exercise in spiritual let alone intellectual masochism? Without any character development, without a sympathetic lead, the audience is only trudging along miserably with our two supposed 'heroes' and for a discerning viewer, one should eventually feel cheated with this film's reliance on the visceral to provide sustenance instead of a story. There is nothing really at stake in this movie beyond survival. The post-apocalyptic world of The Road is empty, colourless and seemingly devoid of relationships. Sure the father loves his son and there are some tender moments but the unconditional love for the child by the father cannot carry a story.But somehow I get the impression that the politics of Oscar will somehow keep this film on the clunky pop-cultural radar. For me, it is a case of the Emperor's New Clothes and I'm tired of seeing Viggo's ass.",The Road
334,moviegoingamer,The Road,9,28 November 2009,"The Road is based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy. It is about a father and son trying to survive in a post apocalyptic world while trying to reach the Northwestern Coast. Viggo Mortensen did an excellent job playing as the boy's father and I really think he will get an Oscar nomination. Kodi Smit-Mcphee did great too. I think the movie's dark tone just makes it more emotional, and this is a movie that will make you think about humanity and the human spirit. I think this movie may have a shot at the Best Picture Oscar this year since the academy will nominate ten movies for that award this time. Overall, I give the road a 10 out of 10, and I think this movie is definitely worth seeing. It's in limited release, so you might have to look for it though.",The Road
335,alex703,Frustratingly Close to Great,7,11 February 2012,"John Hillcoat's The Road, adapted from a novel by Cormac McCarthy is a gritty survival tale that chronicles the journey of a father and son traveling south (the purpose is unclear) in a world where there are few humans left and most of them are ""bad guys"". This setting leads to many dramatic encounters but also allows the relationship between the two to evolve.The way that this story is told is one of the most fascinating parts of the film. The viewer is not told what caused this to happen, what the world was like before it happened, or what the main character's lives were like before they happened. From a series of flashbacks, we ascertain that Viggo Mortensen (whose character's name is never given) was VERY happy with his wife (Charlize Theron), as displayed by the rich colors and close up shots that contrast so well with the endless landscapes of gray that dominate the rest of the film, and that their son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) was born after the ""apocalypse"" happened. These flashbacks work well to give the viewer a bit of context, but do not reveal too much, and end relatively early on.In the ""present"" timeline, Hillcoat does a fantastic job of alternating between the bonding between father and son and genuinely thrilling chase scenes where their lives are threatened. The main symbol here is fire, representing the spirit to go on living and shown almost every time Mortensen and Smit-McPhee are together. The point was belabored a bit too much in the dialogue, overstating a meaning that was already apparent, but it was not too bothersome. Slightly more bothersome, however, was the narration occasionally used throughout the film by Mortensen, which told the viewer everything he already could perceive and gave a slightly forced sentimental edge to a movie that did not need it. On the positive side, the numerous wide-angle and overhead shots gave the viewer the idea that it was just these two, father and son, together against a vast and uncompromising world.As the movie continues, the dynamic between them continues to develop. Mortensen is teaching his son the harsh realities of this world that spares no one, but is he losing his compassion and humanity along the way? Early on, he assures Smit-McPhee that they are and will always be the ""good guys"", but both the boy and the viewer are left doubtful when he forces a man to give him all of his clothes at gunpoint, and then just walks away. There is always the counterbalance of hope, however, with the son discovering a beetle as they near the coast, a sign that there is still new life to be found.Mortensen's acting does a good job of lending some gravitas to this movie that could have gone wrong in many ways. He is serious about his role (as a father and human), but he is not overly grave or foreboding and is willing to show love towards his son despite the difficult circumstances. Smit-McPhee is relatively believable, if not great, although he does not necessarily grow with his character throughout the film. The rest of the cast is solid, with Charlize Theron standing out with her grittiness and Robert Duvall giving importance to a character that was not.There were many good things about this movie, but its ultimate fault was the ending, which was poor, to say the least. After all the lessons that the son has learned, why would he trust this family? Guy Pearce could be lying to him and kill him the second he puts his gun down (a lot of tension could have been created out of this), so why does he give in so easily? Does this family have food for another person? The revelation of the dog leads the viewer to believe that this family has been following Mortensen and son throughout half the movie. If that is true, how come they did not present themselves earlier? There are almost too many logic holes to count in this final scene, and on top of that, it felt rushed and wasted good talent (Guy Pearce, Molly Parker). This scene undid so much of what the viewer learned in the film that it ruined my overall satisfaction. However, it was still a very good film and at times, excellent. Check it out.",The Road

These fall into two categories: ""realistic"" attempts to examine behaviour in the aftermath of some catastrophe. The most recent one I would recommend is Octavia S Butler's Parable of the Sower.The second category is nihilistic despairing romance. Anna Kavan's Ice - where the world is smothered in ice - and some early Ballard are in this category. So is The Road (book and film.The Road is basically ridiculous. Neutron Bombing? Nuclear Winter? Giant Asteroid hit? Plague? Humanity eaten by Giant Mutant Pink Ants? The author doesn't tell us because he simply hasn't thought it through.

Just so the author can set up a fake dilemma.Farming Humans for Cannibalism? If you have food to feed humans, you would eat it yourself, rather than loose calories.Leaving the bunker - the height of stupidity. Wait out and try to rebuild. And one presumes that the people who set it up would have a) stocked it with weapons and ammo b) medical supplies. So when the Dolt (we can't really call him a Man) gets shot with an arrow he should have had antibiotics etc so he wouldn't die.Medical supplies: ditto the Ship. Question - why does he swim back - are there no life rafts or lifeboats left on the Ship? You could carry a lot more supplies safely.Maddened brigands and bandits: this comes to the heart of the matter, even bandits are likely to negotiate first. They can't afford wounds, loss of members, and may even want to recruit more people into their gang. Safety in numbers.It's just ridiculous that there is no government at all surviving, or people banding together for skill sharing and mutual defence.Why would the nuclear family with the dog accept a lone boy into their group?

Now this is what production companies are suppose to be making. Viggo Mortensen is pretty good at this role as a protective father trying to go south with his son and make it there alive, even thought they run into a few hold ups. Robert Duvall, of course, is excellent in everything. Although, it would have been nice if he was in the film a little bit more. Its hard to have a great movie and then have a big movie star that has been acting since the 60's and just give him a little role, probably lasted about 10-15 minutes. The script, the story was great. Having to set in a Apocalypse time was creative. The thing that got me thinking about most was what if this would really happen? What if this is the future that will be coming? Everything dried up, plants, animals, most of the human population dead. And what was left was solo people and gangs. Food source being so low that our own species would kill and eat us. Hunting humans down for food. Losing our dignity and humanity to do this to each other just makes me sick. But to think about it, this would happen if it ever comes to pass. As much as it seems impossible, people have shown what they would do in extreme situations. Let's hope the End isn't like that.

I think the movie misses some subtle things that I picked up on in the book. For example, the father demonstrates patience at nearly all times with the boy and his never-ending questions. He does not come across that way in the movie. Plus, the book has a spiritual theme and several references to the boy being a messenger of God (""I am the one""). Nevertheless, the movie follows the book reasonably we'll, and I'm sure McCarthy had final say on the screenplay. I've read the book twice, and I've seen the movie once, but my memories of the story seem to relate to the movie, and I wish they didn't.

352,Mazinger31,Very true to the source material.,8,30 August 2016,"The title of this review will probably say all that needs to be said for fans of Cormac McCarthy or those who have read the novel this movie is based upon. I thought The Road was McCarthy's best work since Blood Meridian in the mid-80s, which is a movie I have been patiently waiting for the past few years. Viggo Mortensen was terrific as the Man and the young actor they found for the Boy was solid as well. This movie is not your stereotypical fast-paced, action-packed post-apocalyptic film. The movie focuses mostly on the father-son relationship as the Man tries to mold the Boy into a beacon of hope in a world where society has collapsed and most humans have seemingly thrown civility to the wayside in order to survive. This movie contains cannibalism of the non-zombie variety, which is a relief as the film industry was already becoming over-saturated with zombie movies by the late-2000s. Ultimately, the film is fairly brutal and often bleak but the emotion and struggle feel realistic. It actually feels like you are watching these two people barely scrape by and despite their own desperation, the Man constantly assures the Boy that they will not lead themselves down the path of evil. That path becomes murky at times but by the end you begin to realize that there is far more good in the Boy, who is sometimes naive to a fault, than the Man, who is violently protective of his son. I enjoyed the film, but it is not one that will be enjoyed by all. I feel the criticism that the film is too bleak will be valid to many, and is by no means unreasonable, but the ending is quietly uplifting.",The Road

354,afair,a road poorly travelled,5,25 October 2009,"First, in the words of the old joke, when asked the way to the hospital the old man replies, ""don't start from here."" McCarthy's undoubted masterpiece, Blood Meridian' is still waiting to be made, given that ol' Sam Peckinpah has left us may I plead for the great American director at work today, P.T. Anderson, to give it a go. Anyone tackling such difficult source material has my sympathy. McCarthy's work is what R. Barthes called writerly as opposed to readerly. That is, his work makes demands on the reader, a reader's pleasure is derived from the sheer chutzpah of McCarthy's prose. Reading his novels is a sheer joy but also a task gargantuan, for example 'Blood Meridian' seems to demand that we should read 'Moby Dick' as a kind of parallel text. Well,I sympathise with anyone taking on 'The Road', this novel is a winding ribbon of words that seems visual but on refection is in fact a discourse on the condition of humans more suited to philosophical rumination than Hollywood animation. I was, subsequently disappointed with the film but feel unable to really criticise either the actors or the people behind the camera. My only specific carp would be the inability of the film makers to produce an adequate sound-scape. If the sense of destiny was to be articulated it was in what people hear not what they see which would have enhanced the cinematic quality of the film, the howling indifference of isolation might have been made concrete by a Michael Mann, let's say. I never really got the sense of desolation that is invoked by McCarthy's prose.The two central characters, admirably played by the central actors, work hard to carry the idea of a futile travelling forward but the film, which begins with a flashback,doesn't seem to have the courage to explain the existential dilemma of being alone in a threatening environment.The film fails to enhance the broken poetics of the novel's vision, at times falling into cliché. The one moment that is dramatically forceful is the encounter between the two travellers and the nearly blind man, here we get close to the mournful sense of loss and the certainty of death, here we see the iceberg tip of what is the profundity of the adults sense of time and the child's innocence.I realise a film is not a novel but even so one might look toward the ethos of the source work.

355,Downtown242,Not what I hoped for,3,9 January 2010,"The Road did deliver on some of what I hoped for. All of the burned out rubble and trash strewn roads looked very convincing. The destroyed and crumbling forests and the beaches littered with the remains of society were pretty incredible.Unfortunately, the story matched the bleakness of the world every second of the movie. That would be fine if there were some kind of story arc. There was no real plot to speak of. There was no moment of levity and fun. There were two types of scenes in the movie. One of general boredom and malaise, and there was another of terror and panic. At the end of the movie you realize that there were really only two things that happen in the movie. They run from the cannibals, and they chase a thief. Both of those plot lines are resolved within a couple minutes.There was absolutely no range of emotion. Viggo Mortensen (sorry if I misspelled that) was either worried or terrified. The child was either crying or complaining. The performance out of the kid was particularly disappointing. He looked about 10 years old, but he acted like he was 5. He sure wasn't very tough for someone raised after the apocalypse, who had presumably seen cannibals, corpses, and violence his whole life. There wasn't much connection or compassion with the main characters, because they didn't give us anything to relate to.The last problem I had with the movie was what I couldn't forgive. The message was so feeble and insufficient. In a movie that bleak you expect something deep and probing about our existence. When you strip us down to the animal level and remove all the humanity who are we? We certainly don't get any answers or even ideas about that question. All we get is ""carry the fire inside you"" to survive. Seriously!? All that movie left me with was a vague feeling the people who killed themselves were right, and Viggo was a coward for not killing himself and the boy. That really isn't a feeling I enjoy getting from a movie.",The Road
356,tekir_izm,not out of ordinary but real and mysterious.,9,15 January 2010,"i didn't read the novel. i just realized it on IMDb and saw 8.0 point. so i watched it. the road doesn't commits you something out of ordinary. there are a father and a sun. their only aim is to survive. it shows you just a part of life. you can't see any story. you don't know why the world is such a bad and silent place. what happened in past? what did made the world like that? you wonder. you must wonder but actually you don't want to know that. because if someone only care about his/her life, the past is only a lie. especially, if you have to care your sun's life instead of yours. at that point, past just gives you pain. it reminds you good things but the father knows there is no good thing anyway. there is just a road without ending. but unknown ending may be something good. so we are people, we are not animals. just to survive isn't enough. we need a meaning. we need have feelings. feelings make us a human. if you don't want to be a human, there is only one choice: being a hunter. a hunter can hunt anything if it helps to the hunter don't feel hunger. even a human. but this sun and his father has a fire inside. a fire to shine their road. if the fire don't die down, you have still a belief. you believe there may be something good, at least a man who carries the fire too.the sun can keep this fire more easily. because every children is an angel. they all have good feelings, dreams, believes. because all we come to the world as a good person. but the life tries to make us bad ones. it's what i believe. maybe what the movie or novel believe too. so you can see the differences between the father's and the sun't ideas about people. more optimistic or more pessimistic?i said the movie doesn't commits you something out of ordinary. it's just shows what must happens. very ordinary but very real. just keep going on to carry the fire and see what will happen.",The Road

I also read the book and to thought it was a pretty good book, a pulitzer prize winning book? I don't know about that, but it was. So the movie pretty much centers around a boy and his pops and they are in some post apocolyptic earth. Its a drama like a mothertrucker so don't expect any real action. Also if you expect to see Charlize Theron on this movie, she is. but scarcely. So all in all this movie can get a little boring and I barely gave it a seven. Some people would say that this movie was a masterpiece but those people are the same old geezers that gave the book a pulitzer prize. So if your gonna sit through this one get ready to chill out throughout the movie with a drama movie that ain't too bad. I give it 1 blunt up.",The Road

The only real colors I recall were from blood and fire, the rest were shades of brown or grey. After watching it, I felt a a little sick from seeing a future that could not be farther from the truth.This movie is definitely not light, it is thick and can be hard to swallow, but is well worth it. It gives you a much greater appreciation for everything we have now and how we take so much for granted. It also gives you a glimpse into what the end of human life on Earth would look like, but not the usual way we see it in movies (ie. a large world war, or lots of action, zombie apocalypse etc). This movie moves past that and goes into the dying moments where there are barely any people left in the world, and practically all food everywhere is literally gone and humans can only obtain food by killing other humans.",The Road
359,lastaria,A story about a man and his son.,9,31 May 2011,"Set some years after a worldwide cataclysm, the result of which is all the plant life and all the animals have died. And a world getting slowly colder, with little food left in the world and few humans left this is an incredibly bleak tale. A movie that has little hope in it and for the most part despair. Where most of the humans left have fallen into the worst state of depravity, not only committing cannibalism, but murder to achieve cannibalism.And yet through all this bleakness the story focuses on a man and his boy travelling through this world, heading south to find the coast and where it might be warmer. And it is their struggle and journey through all this bleakness that shows the very best amongst humanity.It is a touching tale of father and son struggling to survive and their relationship with one another that is very touching and endearing.Throughout this you have some flashbacks to both times before the cataclysm with the man's wife. And after when it's the three of them together and the slowly falling into despair of the mother.It deals with difficult subjects and their are some harrowing scenes, but I think these are needed and help contrast the good moments for the characters.It shows the very best in humanity as well as the worst, with a boy born into this world who still sees the good in people when his father can only see and do what he thinks is best for his sons survival.The post cataclysm world is shot with much of the colour drained from it. Sometimes it even appears as though it is shot in black and white. In contrast to this the pre cataclysm world focuses very much on vibrant colours, showing the beauty of a garden on a summers day.Overall I think this is a very good movie that has you on a roller-coaster of emotions. It can be hard going at times but it is worth it for the rewards you get. Overall I give it 4 out of 5.",The Road

There is so much wrong with film, and so much of it has been covered by other reviewers that instead of piling on I'm just going to cover what I think is worst thing about this movie, and that is the lead characters. The Man is a wimp and a poor excuse for an adult, especially one in a post apocalyptic scenario where cannibals are everywhere trying to eat you and your child. One would think that after a decade of this hellish life, and probably eating a few people in that time yourself, since food is so scare, that he'd be a little tougher. The Boy who is 11 acts like he is three years old. He whines his way throughout the entire movie while The Man seems to enable this by physically carrying him around like a sack of potatoes and speaking to him like an infant.

It is a preachy evangelical Christian film about the apocalypse and fire and brimstone. I was seriously disappointed in this movie because the previews made it look like something it was not. The movie would have worked as a short film, maybe a 20 minute long DVD extra on someone else's movie. There were some cool cinematic shots of the barren landscape, but other than that it was 100 minutes of slooooowww and DEPRESSING nothingness, with almost no plot, no likable characters, no action, nothing. Dude it just sucked. I've had it up to my neck with these preachy right-wing evangelists infiltrating the mainstream media. These christians do nothing but take advantage of people. I think these people almost want the apocalypse to happen. Believe me, if the nuclear holocaust does happen, it will definitely be some right-wing Christian that pushed the button. My fellow Americans, do not watch this movie, and if you do, please don't take it seriously, and certainly don't go around thinking the apocalypse is coming. God, these idiots.

362,wintermancer,Something went wrong in adapting the book for the big screen,5,12 January 2010,"The book stands at the pinnacle of recent American literature and certainly earned the Pulitzer for 2007 Fiction. The movie attempts to render that soul penetrating book into film and succeeds in several areas while failing overall. The visuals, cinematography, lighting, costume, and Mortensen's acting make for a potentially fine film. Yet, in the end, the adaptation of the story destroys the potential and we are left wondering why they bothered.The omnipresent shopping cart is an important part of the book, yet in the first half we often see the father and son wandering around without one. The father has pneumonia and is fighting against time to save his son, but he coughs hardly at all until the second half of the movie? The many flashbacks to the mother don't help and neither does Charlize Theron, an otherwise fine actress.The shear joy of finding the bunker/shelter after nearly dying in the woods is abbreviated to just finding the bunker. Visuals for the the road (literally the road they travel on) are not brought in until the second half of the movie - a shame. Earthquakes in the movie - huh? The list of annoyances is long for me so I'll stop there.There are some inherent difficulties in adapting the book (such as the son's contrary need to help others), but in my opinion, this film could have been much better if they had attempted a straight forward linear adaptation. Not all was lost in the adaptation but the overall arch of the storyline was compromised.Is it a good film for those who have not read the book? I do not know but I suspect not. Read the book, then ask yourself if the film even approached the shear joy and despair of the book. Not for me, not for me.",The Road

For the first 30 minutes i was somewhat hopeful, but i got bored and angry at my decision to watch this beyond that. Some scenes were awfully rushed and cut, especially down in the shelter, that scene skipped to the next scene of them leaving much to fast, without a clue who was up there and so on... while i get the hopeless scenario and all, it didn't provide any entertainment, something i expect even from a serious movie like this one. The tearjerker scenes, sorry -much too obvious and wannabe touching. The much praised boy just annoyed the hell out of me, especially the poppa, poppa..terrible........ I cant describe all scenes, but honestly , the movie just made me look for the stop button on my remote. Since i was watching it with friends, i didn't touch it. There are much better post-apocalyptic movies than this one, and i sure don't need this movie to understand the problems of this world and what we may be heading to....this movie to me seemed rushed and flawed in many places.

The problem is clear when it gets newspaper reviews like -""masterpiece"", ""magnificent"" & ""the film everyone should see"".

A lot of the scenes were exactly as I had imagined them in my head when I read the book. Shot by shot it looks fantastic and even when not much is going on you find yourself engrossed. Viggo Mortensen is superb and although a lot of people will go into this film expecting something else (partly because of the trailer that suggests a lot more action than what was ever going to be the truth) This definitely isn't going to brighten up anyones day but as a piece of film-making I think it is near faultless and as good (and realistic) a rendition of a global apocalypse I can think of.

366,dbk-923-252984,Don't waste your time watching this lemon,1,16 January 2011,"The striking thing about this crappy film is that some viewers give it more than a 1/10 rating. It simply is mind-boggling! The only possible explanation is that such reviews were written by staff of the film studio or highly depressed viewers who felt less depressed after watching this lemon.Let's be objective here. The acting was crap, out of touch with the story and terribly contrived. The score was bad. The images were poorly shot, using bad angles and close-up views of what should have been filmed from a distance to give the audience a feel for the desolation.The story itself is totally unrealistic. For example:1/ An armed group has one of theirs shot and don't even go after the father and son, despite the fact that it's daylight, they carry rifles, the father is slowed down by having to carry his son, the group is obviously starving and out there on a hunting mission. This could never happen in real life.2/ The house where the human herd is held by cannibals is left unwatched. Since the keepers feel starved enough to eat human flesh, one would think that their prisoners constitute their most precious item. So why would they leave them alone for someone to find and possibly help to escape? Simply unbelievable.3/ Father and son find a stash of canned food which happens to be still good for consumption after... 11 years, according to the story. Has anyone seen a can of food left in a damp place like a cellar after ten years? Well, the author of the book obviously hasn't. I'm surprised that father and son lasted more than a few hours after eating the stuff.4/ The old man played by Duvall is nearly blind, can barely get off the ground by himself, can't obviously run, and has managed to survive despite roaming baddies, cannibals, etc? Come on, what are the odds of that possibly happening?5/ Father and son travel that long road without ever running into a trap, not even once? Say you're an armed group starving and out there looking for prey, wouldn't the first thing coming to mind be to set a trap for some isolated travelers?6/ You're in charge of a young boy and living in a dangerous environment. Would you look for an isolated place to weather the storm, surviving on roots and hiding from predators, or would you undertake a senseless trip to the ocean in freezing conditions?I can appreciate some comments that claim a good adaptation from the book but... a good adaptation of a crappy and unrealistic story doesn't make a good film now, does it?In keeping an objective and unemotional outlook, which should be the most important guideline for anyone writing a review, I simply cannot understand why anyone would recommend watching that film or even find anything good to say about it. Granted, the subject matter is interesting, I won't argue that, but it could have been handled much better in both the book and the film.I must agree with all those who branded it a pure waste of time, they are absolutely right. This is a bad film on all accounts. As to those who mentioned possible Oscar nominations or spoke of the best film of its year, I'm sorry to say that they're completely off the mark, as much as someone claiming that McDonald's deserves 5 stars on the Michelin guide.My advice if someone suggests taking you to watch ""the road"": run!",The Road
367,nabillaarsyafira,An interesting take on the critically acclaimed source material,7,27 November 2016,"The greyish ambiance and the atmosphere of despondency are really two fundamental factors to the film, but the first half's pace is so insufferably dragging that it makes watching it all the more exhaustive. Then it gets a lot better.Obviously this isn't just some generic post-apocalyptic movie. I've read some interesting interpretations of the source material, Cormac McCarthy's Pulitzer-winning novel, though I must beg to differ. People seem to think that 'the road' symbolizes the natural human drive of survival. I think it symbolizes the human age. It keeps going and going no matter what. You get older; the world wears you down. Sometimes it eats you up. Sometimes you find a sanctuary, sometimes you find a testimonial of your youth. The Man is a long hardened commonsense, skeptical and practical, only operating under a strict set of moral codes. The Boy is a beating conscience, pure, innocent, and hopeful. The mutual belief they share is to keep ""carrying the fire"", to always stay as ""one of the good guys"", both principles being representatives of existing ideals.The ending scene, I suppose, shows that you're never that alone, as long as you keep pushing through with the fire. Good guys will look after you and preserve all the good you believe in.The movie is overall minimalistic, I simply hoped they had spent more time emphasizing or foreshadowing the allegories. Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee have a really great on-screen connection and both are fantastic individually.7/10.",The Road

Viggo Mortensen takes the method approach, losing an astonishing amount of weight to bring a level of realism that has yet to be replicated in the genre. He tells the tale of every parent's struggle to raise a child in an unforgiving world and bestow upon that child the tools necessary to survive before his time is up. The Road takes a no-nonsense approach to a genre that is often marred by the presence of leather-clad marauders or near cartoonish antics.

Through the 1 hour and 40 minutes of the film, there was MUCH less action than I had expected.... And I am glad about that.The relationship between the characters was very much the centre point of this narrative. Both Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-Mcphee deliver astonishing performances, there wasn't a single moment where I doubted them to be father and son. I found myself enjoying the quiet ""father- son"" scenes more than the suspense/action based scenes. During the movie the man and the boy carry us through numerous situations and emotions with ease; from being trapped in a house with cannibals to sitting together and eating a meal. By the end of the film the actors had me in the palms of their hands, even making me shed a tear, and i don't usually cry at films!!Personally, there isn't a single thing I would change about this movie so I would feel unjust in giving it any less than a 10/10.",The Road

I don't think I enjoy it. There's nothing to enjoy in this incredibly effective depiction of post-apocalyptic hopelessness, but there is much to respect. I found it beautiful despite its starkness and hopeful despite its gloom. The acting is sharp and appropriate for the story, reflecting the misery and the desperation of characters subtly veiled by a tenacious instinct to survive, like the ash that covers the gray landscape. It haunted me because I could never be sure of what I would do if put in the same circumstances as the protagonists (or the antagonists, for that matter). The difference between good and bad, brutality and compassion, loses its clarity in a dying world.

This is one of the most gripping movies that I have ever seen, by a mile. The way the man's love for his son is portrayed, paramount and unbreakable right to the end, despite the most frightening and hopeless circumstances imaginable, is stunning. I'd like to hope that in an apocalypse fewer people would be willing to kill and eat others, because what kind of life is that, but the scenario the film presents is chillingly real.In particular for me, the scene in the first cannibal house, in which he man prepares to shoot his son rather than let him be caught by the cannibals to suffer a terrifying death in the hands of brutal strangers, is unparalleled. It is also totally believable, which shows the strength of both actors.Other war films, disaster films, zombie films I've seen just seem like flashy pyrotechnic entertainment for big kids with short attention spans by comparison.(My only slight criticisms are all with minor details of the plot...By the time they stumble upon the second deserted cannibal house (and once again narrowly avoid being captured by returning cannibals) I thought SURELY by now they would have learned their lesson about approaching ANY building or structure with extreme caution? And in their shoes I think I would have to be EXTREMELY cold before I'd even contemplate lighting a fire at night, when goodness only knows how may cannibals could be out there hunting.Oh and the Man is an INCREDIBLY good pistol shot too... two fatal direct hits from two shots; both at long range, one a head shot on a guy holding his son close to him, the other a flare from a flare gun fired through a second storey window across the road.

The only reason I made it to the end was the hope that something might change, or there might be an enlightening ending. But as in the film, there was no hope.This film leaves very little to contemplate. The production and acting is good, thats why I rate it 2, not 1. One could view the film as harrowing and sad. A film that questions humanity, and religion. But these aspects are drowned out by the dull void.And then one must wonder how in such an environment anyone can survive with no oxygen producing plant life, no real food (apart from the occasional stash of canned food and a few insects). These issues make the film less believable, and therefore you have less connection with the characters.

I already think Denzel's movie is better and i haven't seen it yet.Now about the movie...sigh...where to start. There are just too many questions left unanswered and too many situations that don't make any sense. Why are all the animals dead? No one thought to keep some alive to farm? Why did the planet die?

Sadly, this movie came no where near my expectations and I am surprised at the score this has somehow managed to achieve.Whilst the acting and the photography were okay- the story and lack of substance in this picture left me feeling like I'd wasted an hour-and-a-half of my life on a film that was pretty much devoid of plot, thrills, twists or any follow-though on any of the scenes. Each scene felt less relevant than the last and I was less than gripped throughout still waiting for something of worth to happen as the credits started rolling.The setting for the movie had such potential, and generally would be my cup of tea, other films that have tackled similar issues such as ""I am Legend"", ""The Postman"" or even, to some extent, ""Carriers"" have all portrayed a dystopic view of the future, but have also made the story entertaining and relevant.

Other movies like 'I Am Legend' and the older 'The Omega Man' also handled this genre with great skill. 'The Road' does not fare so well. It is boring, dismal, and totally unrealistic. Upon watching this movie you get the sense that whoever wrote this book or screenplay doesn't have a clue when it comes to human nature and man's indomitable spirit when it comes to survival. This movie is motoring with four flat tires.The movie starts out with 'the father' narrating about how all the animals had died out.

Or perhaps some directors should not be making movies.If you can't afford movie sets (The Road's sets were obviously bought for cheap from an old 80s B-movie maker), at least get the attention of the viewer with interesting characters or developments. This movie has neither and tries to redeem itself with an ""artsy"" and ""indy"" flavor it can't even achieve because it falls victim of the same old and tired clichés every Hollywood movie with a strong Judeo-Christian theme must have: a guilt trip and a happy ending (all things being relative).At least if the pool of untalented people who worked on this waste of film managed to entertain or captivate the audience, we would not mind being told what to think about life, its meaning and how to redeem ourselves. Some of the more obvious references:-Suicide is bad. Wife commits suicide: reject her, forget her and throw your marriage down the bridge. -Good people don't eat people. Bad people do. -There's a flame inside good people -Wake up in a church with a poorly written and narrated paragraph -Continue your journey despite the hardship, never give up.And it goes on and on with the moral brainwashing, UNFORTUNATELY, whenever you think the story is going to take off, the scene gets cut short and you get a repeat of the previous scene. I stopped counting the ""going to bed"", ""take the gun"" and ""exploring an abandoned house"" scenes at 3 (for each of the above).There's so little interaction with the few characters we meet that you simply don't care.We get it, the only preoccupation people have is food and despair. From that premise, there's not much else going on. But at least build an interesting story around the characters and don't try to make the audience think after 1:40 (felt like 3:00) that in 20 years, canned Pineapples and a can of Coke will be more precious than Jewelry and $100 bills. WE GET IT. It took 20 seconds and a can of dog food in MadMax to pass on the same message.Finally, if the director and all the sellouts who made this movie had any guts, they would not have added insult to injury with one of the most pathetic ""everything will be all right"" feel good endings I have never seen. Had it been for a cruel and cold ending, we might remember this movie for having dared to be a little different than the rest, but that would have been what a real director might have done. Not the monkey on a corporate and religious leach who did this piece of crap. Never mind the book and its ending, I did not read it. We came here to watch a movie and if you're adapting a book, at least try to make a good script. I could care less about a movie if the only interested people are the ones who read the book and will spend the movie pointing out: ""look, this is the part in the book where the guy tries to grab the kid to eat him"".Do not get me wrong, I love independent movies with an original story and great characters. Vigo Mortensen is the reason I stepped into the theater expecting a little bit of relief from the garbage holiday blockbusters like 2012 made for the zombie nation out there.

However, the plot let the entire film down for me. I felt bored, waiting for something to happen the entire way through it. The dialogue was boring, disengaging and the cheesy cliché flashbacks didn't help either. And it's just such a coincidence how there's just two bullets left - one for him and one for the child.

This film has no plot. This film has no substance. The goody goody mentality portrayed by the main characters was sickening and cliché. If I'd wanted to hear someone whine for an hour or so I'd call my ex wife. The only decent thing about this movie was the kit and scenery.

384,prestonnaclk9,"Dismal plot, movie makes no sense",1,10 January 2010,"Let me first start by saying I love Apocalypse movies. It is rare I don't like one. But this one is just horrible. It didn't even make any logical sense.My primary problem with this movie is you are never told or discover how exactly the apocalpyse started. Why is the world the way it is? The movie misses a golden opportunity to make a statement on an important issue like global warming and instead turns the movie into a ""character case study."" The movie watcher knows these facts: 1) the world erupts into random fires; 2) the world has random cataclysmic earthquakes; and 3) every living thing on the planet is dead except humans. (except for two bugs shown at the very end which come as a complete surprise to the main characters after existing in this world for what appears to be 7-10 years.) What catastrophe on Earth could cause earthquakes for 7 years? What could kill every living thing on the plant and yet completely spare humans? I don't know of any explanation for it and apparently the producer and writers didn't either because they don't tell you. I could have lived with not knowing if the characters had been born AFTER the apocalypse, but 99% of them lived through it. Lame.These questions are really important because all the humans are starving and resorting to cannibalism and many are committing suicide. The main characters are even considering it throughout the movie. It is also important because for some unknown reason the main characters have to travel ""south"" where it is warmer. So the apocalypse is basically the destruction of every living thing and causes every known natural calamity. Whatever. Without some known logical reasoning for why the things are the way they are I found myself asking more questions and feeling ""outside"" the movie instead of engrossed in it. To me, it seemed like the producer was too ""afraid"" to take a political stand and describe what exactly happened for fear of offending some viewers. The acting was good, but the cliché plot and overall feel and experience of the movie made me want to vomit.",The Road
385,mrsfixit,True to the book- which was also awful,1,22 March 2010,"***Warning- Spoilers Below**** To those of you who criticized aspects of this film such as: 1) the unknown apocalyptic event that we are told nothing about. 2) the annoying kid who acts like a 3 year old. 3) the idiocy of finding a fully stocked bomb shelter and deciding to leave and go back on the road to nowhere. 4) the conveniently happy (?) ending when Papa dies and the kids finds a new family. OK, don't blame Hollywood for this mess, blame the author. I read the book, and the film is very true to the book. BTW- I hated the book too, and found it to be even more annoying than the film.Throughout the book, the inane and annoying dialog between the father and son goes on for page after page. It consists of ""Papa I'm scared"" ""Papa I'm cold"" and ""Papa I'm hungry"" endlessly from the kid, and ""I know"" and ""it'll be all right"" from the father. By the end of the book I wanted to shoot them both. At least we were spared this in the film.The book gave no details of ""the event"". Neither did the film.The ending in the film also was the same as it was in the book.Why were they even on the road in the first place? What was the point of enduring all that danger and suffering traveling from where they started out to some point south where things were just probably the same? The father knew he was dying. What father would want to leave his kid in a dead world, on his own, to fend for himself amongst hordes of murderous cannibals? Anyone with any love for a child would have put that bullet in his head to spare him that kind of suffering. There ARE worse things than dying...Hollywood took a book that was bleak, depressing, and pointless and made it into a film that was also bleak, depressing, and pointless.This film never should have been made. And maybe the book that inspired it should not have been written either. Avoid both unless you're just a glutton for punishment.",The Road
386,braunsb,Excellent work,8,1 February 2010,"I'll try not making any comments about the book or the adaptation process.The movie works most of the time, thanks to the dark, gray and sad cinematography job made by Javier Aguirresarobe, and, of course, to the stunning acting by Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smith-McPhee.It's a hard movie to watch. The human kind and the Earth itself are basically gone and there is no much hope left. We suffer watching the difficulties in living at such times, but we admire the courage of a father and son that are not corrupted by the situation.As you see, this is not a walk in the park. The Road is a disturbing movie, but if you look closer, you will see many inspiring stuff here.Highly recommended.",The Road
387,trevor_nemeth,There is Never Nothing to Live For,9,27 November 2009,"To be alive means something in The Road. It isn't so much the why or the how or the what for as it is just the unapologetic fact that you don't give up on life, even when it seems to have given up on you. It forces us to ask ourselves what we would do if everything were just stripped away from us? Different characters in the film answer that question in different ways. Perhaps you just give up. After all, the world you know has been altered beyond recognition, how are you to start over when survivalists lose all regard for the life of another? It is the impossible task of a father to decide if this is a future he wants to allow his son to grow up in. The desolate landscape is the backdrop of the film, and it is symbolic of the seeming hopelessness of the world. The Road itself is something to be avoided because to my mind it represents the linear progression of the old world, the world destroyed. This path is no longer an option and spells doom for any who choose it, any who can't see their way to the current reality and let go of the past. The pacific coast is hope. It is a goal. It provides meaning and direction in a world characterized by chaos and madness. In an America unrecognizable, a Man and a Boy embark on a journey no one else sees as worth taking. So beautifully acted is the film that it is easy to take for granted the performances. There isn't a moment of artifice in the two leads' portrayals. Their chemistry is quiet and powerful, and it becomes difficult to watch the film towards the end in large part because we are forced to imagine a life for one without the other. It is an unbearably sad truth of the world that is heightened by the tragic nature of its post-apocalyptic condition. If the mother's final gift to her family before she abandoned them was the coldness of her departure, then the end of the movie undermines her by showing the actions of a true parent. The man dies by the side of his son and refuses to take the boy with him because that's what the movie is about, living life until your last breath and not a moment less. That is the wisdom he imparts before his passing, that you can choose life when it forsakes you, and that love extends beyond the grave to provide meaning and strength to loved ones. The boy will always carry the fire, because the fire is his love for his father, and it burns on even once the Man's physical presence is wiped from the landscape. Trevor NemethP.S. To those who have read the book. This is a movie well worth seeing as it succeeds on its own merits and captures the essence of the narrative.

388,Adam-Machin,"A bleak, desolate world yet love still exists",8,24 June 2020,"This movie may divide audiences. One side may see it as a depressing tale that rarely gets any better. Another side, or which I sit, may see it is a depressing tale in which we see how love can always shine through to make even the bleakest of futures less daunting.
Mortensen is brilliant, I rarely see him as anything less. The relationship he has with his son known only as boy played by Kodi Smit Mcphee is truly touching. It is a story simply about a man trying to keep his son safe and prepare him for a life without him in a post apocalyptic world where groups of people prey on the weak and often kill them to eat them. Whatever caused the apocalypse (we are never told) seems to have also caused the Earth to undergo changes. There is no sunlight, at least not in what was America, the sky is blanketed in never ending dust and grey.
Mortensen's character ""man"" knows throughout the film that he is slowly dying and wants to get his son as far south as he can. It is a slow film but there is enough to keep the audience gripped. If you have a good relationship with your father as I do then some of the final scenes will really get you.
Overall a film well worth viewing",The Road

390,IndyMan_88,Extraordinary Dystopian Film.,10,11 August 2010,"When the Dystopian Genre is tackled onto the big screen, there are disparages regarding whether the film itself is a success or a deep crowd-depressor. A film that evokes no will or strife to carry on or one that just leaves you empty with a slight hole in your stomach. Cormac McCarthy's novels are wondrous in so many ways. Written as if it could be easily adapted into a screenplay (i.e. No Country for Old Men), making scenes and characters easier to image in the readers mind and yet, give enough emotion and gravitas without the use of circumlocution. Heralded by John Hillcoat, rather then Roland Emmerich (insert a ""Thank God"" phrase) whom would rather spend the entire film immersed in far- too-complicated disaster effects rather then the subsequent and suitable cause to base the film. What hits us is the faithful adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's devastating post-apocalyptic novel ""The Road"". The very opposite of what Emmerich does when showing a end-of-the-world film where all goes to hell, but one ray of hope protrudes through the expensively lavish effects. The world is not at its end, it is simply limping onto what is salvageable after an unexplained apocalypse (which is kept unexplained). Who are the good-guys and the bad-guys? What we get is a downsized version of a dystopia filled nightmare, with enough jumps and images to really shock ourselves into the afterlife. It really focuses on what the human race would do in a situation so bleak, so desperate, so hopeless and so forgotten. As one of the characters mentions: ""If God came down, he would find no humanity here."" Hillcoat directed the brutal ""The Proposition"", a off-beat Western that was received well via a small number of audiences. This time he makes a world truly apt of the nightmare dreams of children and adults. Where trees are so decayed they are even losing the will to live. Dark, smoke- covered skies and endless storms, with constant winter chills. The real scare lies in the Humanity of the... well Humans. Or what is left of the Human race. A group of broad-faced heathens and cannibals. Reverted so much into the early primate ancestry of Humans that we can't really tell apart who is good or bad. The hordes of humans who will hack down women, children, and even unborn children, consume them, or capture and starve them in dark underground cellars, naked and cold. Stored like animals waiting for the slaughter, mirroring the effects of that small town's horror onto the entire planet. The book itself can sometimes be difficult to transfer from writing to screen, however, you look past some minor misgivings for the excellent performances by the cast. Charlize Theron who plays 'Woman', Viggo Mortensen as 'Man', and Kodi Smit-McPhee as 'Boy'. The Latter two actors are constantly and yet almost un-detoured from finding food, hiding from the gangs, and scouring the abandoned towns. This also includes a few cameo appearances from other actors to further intensify the Man and Boy's resolve. The former Aragorn (LOTR) actor was never one for bad performances. Neither does Smit-McPhee's innocence and constant reassurances of his father to remind himself that they are the good guys. Mortensen goes for a more older bum-like look where we all invest into his will to survive, the physical and emotional carriage, which all draw into to make the ""Man"" character strikingly compelling and still paternal towards his son. He doesn't hide to his son what the world has become, but explains it with reasoning and a mature understanding as the Boy will one day be left to carry on without his Father. If you thought parenting was tough, think again. The Boy character played by Smit-McPhee has a aura of child-like shivers with an edge of a gentle otherworldly innocence. He keeps the Man (father) in check with his humanity in a world deficit of any real humanity. These moments are inter-laden with strong stomach-clenching scenes of savagery, to tender loving moments of glimmering hope. Overall I found this genuinely more Dystopian then Cuaron's take on the 2006 film ""Children of Men"". 8.5/10",The Road
391,Luc_6,an emotional apocalypse,8,17 January 2010,"the road is a movie that takes place at two different times, the time right after the incident happened, and well after it happened. this allows for scenes to move around, sometimes being the present, sometimes being the past. the movie tells the story of a father and a son who struggle for survival in a world where food and water are a luxury.there is a deep emotional link between the father and the son, and their performance is outstanding, Viggo as always gives a very realistic and human approach to the situation, and the kid, who i had never seen in a movie before, gives an outstanding performance that put together with Viggo creates an emotional bond between the characters.the movie its quite dark in its content, although there are a few moments where the characters find something that gives them hope. quite a sad, emotional and perfect approach to a never ending apocalypse.",The Road
392,canviral,I loved the novel of The Road and also thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation,9,31 July 2010,"I loved the novel of The Road and also thoroughly enjoyed the adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's other novel No Country for Old Men so I couldn't wait to see this one. It stars Viggo Mortensen as ""The Man"" who has survived the apocalypse and is now taking care of his young son and trying to keep them both alive, struggling against exhaustion, starvation and cannibals. I knew from reading the book that this wouldn't be a happy film, in fact you couldn't get much further from it. That doesn't stop it from being an exciting and heartbreaking film exploring man's will to survive and the love that he has for his son.The film is beautifully shot, being partly filmed in post-Katrina New Orleans (as well as Pennsylvania, Louisiana and Oregon, I believe), the scenery is bleak, cold and depressing and most importantly authentically destroyed land, but is equally breathtaking and extremely atmospheric. Acting from Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee is very believable and their bond together did feel genuine to me and mirrored the characters of the novel perfectly. The story is just about survival a coping with the end of the world, basically - nothing more, nothing less. I particularly liked how you never really know why the whole of the human race has been wiped out, so that part of the story is left completely up to you to decide or guess.The Road is a very haunting and quite powerful film that is very faithful to the novel, but didn't quite make the impact that the book did as it is always harder to feel what the characters do in a movie as opposed to using your own imagination when reading their emotions in a well written piece of literature. This is no fault of the film though, so don't let that put you off. I definitely rate this highly and will most certainly purchase it on Blu Ray or DVD when it is released.",The Road

So it took me a long time to watch the film, because I didn't want to ruin the images that were in my head. However I was pleasantly surprised- the movie is great for the most part, tense, bleak and scary, and Viggo is wonderful. I was disappointed to have so much of the wife- despite my LOVE for Charlize Theron- she was only minor in the novel and this distracted. Also I felt the really tense moments in the novel weren't translated properly to screen. Minor quibbles but really worth a watch. And oh yeah the kid was great.",The Road
394,jfrahman,Unrelentingly depressing and grim...as appropriate,8,29 June 2010,"In a nutshell, some unspecified catastrophe (from the few hints the movie gives you, an asteroid impact) has destroyed the Earth's biosphere, and reduced the few surviving humans to brutish lives of scavenging and cannibalism. This movie is the story of the Man (played brilliantly by Viggo Mortensen) and his son the Boy trying to survive in this very harsh post-apocalyptic hell as they make their way to the coast, presumably to find other survivors and eventually to make their way south to warmer climes.In between scenes of the Man and the Boy dealing with cannibal marauders and insane survivors, the film flashes back to immediately after the catastrophe, when the Man's wife (played by Charlize Theron) first gives birth to the Boy, then slowly loses hope until she decides to wander off into the waste and end her own life. The film is washed out and gray, much like 'The Book of Eli', but unlike that movie this one gives the viewer very little reason for optimism.It is the very tender scenes between the Man and his son that made this movie so compelling, and so difficult to watch, for me. In particular one would have to have a heart of stone and ice in their veins not to be moved to tears by the scene where the Man shows the Boy how to end his own life in case capture by cannibal raiders is imminent, to avoid (in the words of the Woman) being raped, tortured, killed and eaten. As they make their way through the terribly bleak and dangerous countryside it is clear that the Man is losing his grip on humanity, as evidenced both by his reluctance to help the Old Man (played masterfully by Robert Duvall) and his humiliation of the Thief. In spite of this, however, his love for the Boy never falters, and even though he is very sick and eventually is severely injured by the Archer leading to his death, he is able to protect his son for as long as he survives.Having two young sons myself I was moved to tears numerous times while watching this movie. The people in the ruined world the pair wander through are all severely damaged, especially the cannibals who in a particularly disturbing scene are found to have a dark cellar full of insane prisoners who act more demon that human, whom they harvest for their meat.Some have criticized this movie for being so bleak and grim; however it makes sense that a world without most of its biosphere would be just such a living hell for those inhabiting it.I have not read Cormack McCarthy's book this movie is based upon, but it is now on my must-read list.This is one of those rare movies that will haunt you for a long time after you see it.",The Road

Have to concede that Viggo played the role of the broken man very well and you can't fault his acting. They were not really skinny though. May be compared to people who are used to super-sized meals... Acting aside, it's a story I had a problem with. There was a single good line in the move uttered by 90 year old man in response if he ever though of committing a suicide. Basically he answers along the lines that in these times you cannot think of luxuries. It was good to see that at least someone has enough strength to make a joke. It would be more interesting to make a movie about the life of those who banded into cannibal gangs. Surely they're people too and despite being ""bad guys"" they still have some thoughts and feelings and there are some life lessons that can be learned there, surely... Instead we are treated to the blatant product positioning - yeah Coke is an ultimate treat, and pineapples and Spam keep for decades and do not develop botulism. That people stock up on chips and Cheetos instead or freeze-dried foods. That despite sunshine and obvious presence of grasses and insects people still have nothing to eat. How about growing something? No it's much easier to just roam around and shoot and kill others and eat them. By the way ammunition does not grow on trees so firearms would become useless quite soon in the absence of bullet making factories. Recently I read 'Lucipher's Hammer' by Larry Niven - this is a much better book of what happens to different fractions of society when a disaster hits. It's a bit of a slow read but much more thoughtful though not without going overboard at times. I'm seeing all those 10 star reviews and wondering what I missed, but for me there was no message in the movie. You'd think that two people traveling cross country and facing such adversity daily would harden. Instead the kid was whining all the time and he looked and acted so much like a girl that there was no other way for him but the soup pot once his dad was not around. Which brings me to the next point - he was left completely unprepared for the first person who met him once his dad was gone. It was just his dumb luck to meet a happy family. By the way what did they feed that dog with? He did not look particularly skinny either. I was hoping for something happen that would either cause an epiphany in me why this movie is so great or something that would jolt those two into having some purpose instead of being a waste of oxygen.

Some great locations and stunning camera work. The non verbal communication the director puts through the film is thought provoking. True to form Cormac McCarthy manages to write characters so well. Characters that feel richly complex, have history and regrets. Characters you feel you will learn more about each time you watch the film and here the dialogue again. The acting from Viggo as the dad I thought was nomination worthy. He displays a range of emotions that befits his characters depth and complexity.

Though simply shot without much actors and almost no VFX or SFX that pop in to your eye this is such a touching story. So important and timeless. Almost like a story of human mankind itself. It's like Au hazard Balthazar the story of the world in 2 hours but much simpler. The title is the story and while we don't really know what happened we can imagine an apocalyptic war must have taken place. Destroying almost all of mankind but a few. No animals seem to have survived and all resources are hard to find.

In the novel, one of the most poignant lines comes from the boy as he tries to share the can with the man, who initially refuses to partake. The boy says something along the lines of 'It's because I won't ever get to drink another one, isn't it?' In that one sentence McCarthy sums up that gap between what the man knows he has lost and what the boy has never experienced, but is slowly coming to realise once existed; a better, 'road'-less world.I also lament the omission of those little examples of the mans resourcefulness, examples of how this terrifying new world has shaped and honed his senses; from the finding of the morels, the apples, the residual oil, his whittling of bullets from wood, his jerry-rigging the gas burner so they can take it on the road, his penny-drop moment which leads to the discovery of the flare gun. Even the nagging feeling that leads to his discovering the hidden trove of food and supplies was brushed over a barely noticeable 'Wait, what was that I just stepped on?' moment. We never know what the man did in his previous life before this tragedy struck, but from the novel we get the feeling (or at least I do) that he's probably a well-educated, white collar guy who's had to step up to the plate in order to ensure his and his families survival.I can't go without mentioning the thief sequence. In the novel the thief didn't spare the boy, he came upon their things off-page. In the film he's portrayed much more (sym)pathetically and one is almost compelled to side against the man; after all, the thief didn't kill or try to eat the boy like almost everyone else we've encountered so far; he might be a 'good guy', surely the punishment meted out to him was too harsh.This theme is further hammered home in the ending, where it's made clear to us that the dog (and the rest of them) are the same group who were heard above while the man and the boy were in the bunker / shelter. Indeed, the second boy is the same boy glimpsed early in the proceedings, though the window of a dilapidated building. If only the man had listened to the boy on those two occasions and trusted that the others might be 'good guys' then maybe he wouldn't have had to die, and ultimately, fail his son. None of this is in the novel, McCarthys theme is much more subtle than that, it's closer to 'what are the implications of maintaining your sense of morality when everyone else around you has forsaken theirs'. In the end, the mans love for his son is such that he can't bring himself to kill him, even though he knows that his son will most likely suffer a shockingly brutal death, but such is his love he can't bring himself to do it. He's fated to be the ultimate good guy, no matter the cost.In closing, as much as I hate to be one of those people, I must recommend the novel over the movie. If this film made you stop and think even just a little bit, and you've not read the novel, then you really should.",The Road
404,guy_simpson,Excellent wakeup call to a nuclear holocaust.,9,11 January 2010,"I'd rather not talk about the story of ""The Road"" as a nuclear tale, the political circumstance behind the scenario isn't mentioned in the movie, it doesn't matter as everything is obliterated. The Road is a story is a story that sums up the reality of a post-apocalyptic environment, lack of food, lack of water, lack of animals, lack of people and the break down of civil society were we head back to our primeval instincts with a lot greater ferocity than before civil society.The expectation of post-apocalyptic religion based gangs and ghouls is replaced with utter survival based groups, cannibals (not monstrous caricatures but a group surviving by any means) thieves and family units. The story centre's around a father and son and there path through these everyday desperate struggle to survive and the complete paranoia of anything outside their group.Overall, the film is a wakeup call to humanity about the realisms to a nuclear holocaust and is a poignant and dismally truthful reminder about the aftermath.",The Road
405,Burtros_Von_Burto,Haunting and compelling,9,20 April 2010,"Bleak. Barren. Piercing. Lacking kindliness. These are words that can describe both the character of 'Man' and the post apocalyptic vision of director John Hillcoat's adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel The Road. Be aware that this is not a happy film, this is about the destruction and breakdown of civilisation, where people have resorted to cannibalism in order to survive. In this world there are no friends, no hope and your only instinct should be that of survival. By any means.The story tells the journey of Man and Boy (never named) who are heading south to get to the ocean, your never sure of the reason why, just that they feel they should. The post-apocalyptic world they now inhabit is never explained to the viewer, is it nuclear war? a natural disaster? All you know is that there are countless fires raging, consuming every bit of life left to take which makes the effect more menacing, an unseen force. Throughout their journey they must come up against man at his most despicable, who would batter women and children to death for a meal, where every abandoned house is filled with dread and unspoken horrors while all the while slowly starving to death. Told you this was bleak stuff.Viggo Mortensen plays the Man, gaunt, filthy and without compassion for anyone else other than his young son played by Kodi Smit-McPhee. Both leads are truly superb in the characters they portray, showing a astonishing range of emotions over the films 111mins running time. Its a testament to the actors, especially Smit-Mcphee that they pull it off and how both of them were overlooked at the Oscars is a complete mystery to me. The credit for their performance must be attributed to the director who got the most out of everyone associated, every aspect of the film is aimed to devastate and show a collapse of humankind and succeeds on every note.I could throw all sorts of clichéd terms to describe this film, edge of your seat, terrifying, psychological but there isn't really anything you can bracket this movie into, it stands on it own and what's more draws you in and doesn't let you go until the end credits begin to run. Its quite possibly the best portrait of a post-apocalyptic world that has ever been put up on screen, and yes I include Mad Max in that assessment.There is only one flaw that I found with the movie and that's the flash back scenes of the family together (including Man's wife played by Charlize Theron) before the disaster took place. This felt tacked on and didn't serve any real purpose to the narrative, they are not present in the novel and I don't think were needed in the movie either.I urge you to seek out this film, there's not many of this type around and immerse you as much as they should. A definite triumph and should be lauded as such.Mark - http://kaihorotimes.blogspot.com/",The Road

But the conversations were bad. If sad and gloomy scenes are the factors for making the movie more artistic, I can not be agreed. It's an amazingly bad movie in my opinion. Please,do not rely on cast.It was not anything other than two-hour loss. We don't know what happened to world. And we don't know why. Actually we know nothing about the script. When I was watching, I sometimes could guess the dialogs and flashbacks' timings. I can accept there were some scenes in art. I couldn't believe the dialogs sometimes between the father and son.

407,hcole-proven,Don't be fooled by the trailer,8,1 March 2010,"The Road is a great story, but don't be fooled by the trailer. This movie is not about a post-apocalyptic world of cannibals always trying to eat non-cannibals. This movie TAKES PLACE in a post-apocalyptic world of cannibals always trying to eat non-cannibals. The story itself, in my opinion is about the hope and courage we get from our family. Even in the face of tragedy, if we hold tight to whom we love, we have something worth fighting for. This is not a zombie movie.Viggo Mortensen is brilliant at playing dirty and desperate. And with, what might as well be cameo appearances, by great actors like Robert Duvall, Guy Pearce, Charlize Theron and Molly Parker - the movie is well rounded.Charlize Theron plays a flashback character. She does an amazing job. From where I was sitting I hated her character and that means the acting was great. Feeling selfish and suicidal in the ravaged world she abandons her husband and son and wanders off into the darkness never to be seen again.The journey of this father and son is touching.

Every word that came out of that boys mouth was just a pain to hear. Also he's not the best actor. Another thing that bothered me was the ''intro'' of the movie. It was really weird and didn't give us much info about whats going on. Viggo Mortensen(The father) Did a good job. Some of his lines were really dumb too, but he did a good job and really made me believe that he cares for that boy. The best thing about the film is the atmosphere that it creates for the people that watch it. While i was watching the movie i really felt the fear that they experienced.",The Road
409,teachermark,An interesting failure?(Spoilers alert),6,17 March 2010,"This movie has wonderfully bleak sets and a relentless vision of a disaster but has some major logical and plot flaws. A disaster that somehow leaves all but a few a bugs and some people alive is in itself something that begs for explanation - especially as we see a well-fed dog at the end! WTF? It seems like the director just had to throw in an optimistic ending but with no logic behind it. As another poster mentioned, starving people gorging on food would get seriously ill - something the father, supposedly a doctor, would certainly know.Performances are very good but there are far better and more logical End Of World movies out there. On the Beach did it better a half a century ago.Another problem is the engagement level. It is too bad that the wife leaves very early in the film and thus just two people essentially carry the story. It is not quite enough for two hours. Father and son see cannibals, almost get eaten, then see some more. Run run run!For a much more engaging story see the recent Children of Men. For the above reasons I would say this is worth a watch but doesn't quite make the grade.",The Road

""The Road"" could easily be edited down to 10 Minutes and tell the exact same story. Actually where was the story, where were the twists, where was the tension, where were the characters, I could go on and on about what this film lacked and I will.... The films main flaw is that it has no plot, we know the earth is dying from the start of the film, the story then progresses to the main character (Viggo Mortensen) who is on a walk south to the coast with his son and then nothing, nothing happens during the whole film. They eat and walk and then walk some more and then walk some more and then they reach the coast and the father dies. Does this constitute a plot ""I don't think so"". I would like to know how people get films like this made and how they then get 8 out of 10 stars on a website like IMDb. I now firmly believe that the film studios have teams of writers not working on good scripts any more but writing reviews for films like ""The Road"" and posting them on sites like IMDb.",The Road

Simple things that are left out, (like the dirt and grass around the hidden manhole cover at the farm on the coast). There was also running water in that house. There are many other inaccuracies that should have been included and excluded. Can the ""boy"" only be carried? Can he not run on his own? Did they not come from a civilized family? Their fires are never seen? And how were the fires built? Is the ""boy"" 'slow' or 'gifted' that he can't understand what his learned father says? To me he is a whiny little boy. It is also supposed to be about the humanity of people and the father is not very good at being a help for anyone; that he is coveting the boy and not letting the boys thoughts and actions enter into his own life.

There is action and drama but very limited and no story. They have stars like Viggo Mortensen and Charlize Theron in to sell the movie, but really, come on!!

It never occurs to the main character to try and connect with other people, to try and find some way out of the unexplained dilemma the Earth is in. I guess it was an eco disaster, and since eco disasters are by definition caused by man's rationality, then you can't use rationality to try and find a solution.You can always tell when a bad director wants to make you feel grossed out: they put in a puke scene. With this movie I lost COUNT of all the puke scenes. And greyness. This is the first color movie I have seen that is in black and white.Someone above said the kid looked 13 but acted like he was 5. Right on. And he was a pretty whiny kid for living in a post-apocalyptic hell hole.One of the main themes of this movie is suicide. At least the main character decided to keep on going.

I have not actually read the Cormac McCarthy novel in which the film is based on, but I feel the film stands on it's feet steadily and quite well.Viggo Mortensen is superb as always; his vulnerability as a desperate father really shines in this one! Kodi Smit-Mcphee holds his own wonderfully and is believable as the timid son who constantly moonlights as his father's conscience.The film has many strengths going for it, but the chemistry between the two weary travellers is what makes the movie so memorable.

I read the marvelous Cormac McCarthy book about a year ago. It was one of those unforgettable page turners that you read in one sitting. The movie however is a completely different story. It is very dark, gloomy, depressing, and lacks the deep metaphors and rich emotions of the father son bond developed in the book. It is lacking in a lot of ways and was a huge let-down. I can see how someone who did not read the book could think this is a lot better than it was, but no one can deny the boring surface level story that didn't quite show us everything we were looking for. It's almost like watching this story unfold from far away through a blurry set of binoculars unlike the way McCarthy had us experiencing it first hand through the fathers mind.

The boy has reactions like if he was raised playing computers games and watching children movies... if he was raised on a post apocalyptic world and knows no other way of living he must be a totally different character! one more prepared for aggression and to live in a hostile world. In the movie you see too often behaviors that don't go with that. He lived 10 years in the woods and never show survival instinct at all. BAD SCRIPTWhat's the point in the movie?

I'm sorry for what I am about to write :)I have to say what a wonderful film, dark and terrifying and superbly made and acted. The cinematography was stunning and all the actors definitely earned their pay. The problem I have with the film is not actually with the film itself but with the story it's trying to tell. I had the same problem when I read the book. For me there are two plot holes that I just can't get over. Firstly the apocalyptic event. Why doesn't McCarthy explain what it is? Oh yeah because there can be no apocalyptic event so all encompassing that could ever fit his needs. The event he comes up with has somehow killed all the flora and fauna in the world but people (in regular civilian build houses) are unaffected by it...what??? how??? Either you have a global event that kills everything or you have localised events that kill everything but here we have a global event that kills 'most' things but still leaves us enough people for our cast of characters...sorry I don't buy it. Seems lazy storytelling to me to 'leave it to the reader'...I paid my money now tell me the story. The second, is the mothers character. This is a woman who during the beginnings of the 'event' has given birth to a son, she loves the son but then feels that the best thing for him is to abandon him. So while he sleeps she strips down to her t-shirt and jeans and walks off into the night to die of exposure...I'm sorry but when I read that, and later saw it in the film, I couldn't believe it. My wife actually turned to me when we were watching the film and laughed asking was it a man who had written her role because he doesn't understand a mother's feelings for her child. There is no way she would have walked off to commit suicide while her child was alive, it just doesn't add up. If McCarthy wanted to focus the emotional centre of the story around the father and his son why didn't he just kill off the mother at child birth rather than the, frankly, contrite manner it which he did it. To be honest, I can't understand why the book was so lauded but then again I'm not a literary critic so who knows.

The question that Hamlet addresses is a question of existence, not a simple matter of living or not living. The issue of death arrives while contemplating on suicide. ""To die, to sleep, no more;""I believe that this strong existentialism that Hamlet expresses is one of the major themes of ""The Road"". To this very essential question of existence all characters provide their own responses. And whenever they choose ""to be"", a sea of troubles awaits for them. Pain becomes the only certainty of their life. The post-apocalyptic scene is the theatre of the exploration of the human condition where various responses are provided by different westerns subjects. The everlasting gray seems to have jumped out of a Beckettian universe, with the unfortunate fact though that the film cannot abandon its Hollywood origin. The film is a magnificent intermingling of subplots, while the main plot being simply the long and dangerous road to Ithaka, to remember Cavafy's famous poem, beginning and ending ""in media res"". What impressed me was the wonderful aesthetics it possessed in its multiple interconnected narratives, with so many different genres being part of the same movie, from classic horror movies with Faulknerian innuendos, such as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", to science fiction dystopias, to modern dramas, even to American propaganda films, such as ""The Pursuit of Happiness"".

Overall, very satisfying acting by everyone to say the least. Plot & Twists -Here we are brought into a very realistic, grim, post-apocalyptic future. Basically the whole story is based off the survival of the nameless family (Viggo, Charlize and Kodi) and the test of their willpower. -Throughout the story, it takes you through various grim events, locations, and scenarios but doesn't go much farther then that. -The movie leads you on to believe it is building on to something, something redeeming, anything really. By the later part of the movie, you are on the edge of depression. -Here is the game changer, the ending. I have to say, the ending to The Road has to be the most unsatisfying ending I've ever seen.

Then they start to dress up the same dirty clothes and the house in which arrived full of new suits, shirts and sweat shirts.Moronic 4)They are looking for gasoline, which is the point of that? There is no car to drive across the wasteland, even if they have a place to go is pointless, then why do not they save the mother with the children running from the gang? the point should be to save people, to survive, not to have a fire in the heart. 5)Why the hell they removed the clothes of the black man who apologized because he steal they stuffs and asked for help,what's the point?People should stick together instead of that his father talk all the time how is gonna come moment when his son gonna put a gun in his mouth and kill himself,then why the hell they try to survive if they gonna commit suicide.6)Family with two children survive and become his new parents and he father die on the beach,what a hell?I mean this is the worst doom movie ever.Don t watch this crap,I don t like Charlize Theron at all ,and Viggo Mortensen I really like him but I still don t understand why he accept to be in this crap.Actors,actress,directors they should carry about our reviews because if was not us they movies would not be watchable.",The Road

I am not sure if it was the editing or the filming but it just seemed to jump from one encounter to the next, it didn't flow.I would recommend it to watch, just for those glimpses, but overall it could and should have been more.",The Road
429,missnobody717,"Depressing and pointless (which I suppose is the point, but)",1,12 December 2009,"When my husband and I went to see this movie, we chose it purely because a) it wasn't one of the ridiculous movies already out, and b) it got a good rating on Rotten Tomatoes. At the snack counter, a poster proclaimed, ""One of the most uplifting and optimistic movies of the year!""After watching that movie, we concluded that the poster reviewer either was completely high, wandered into the wrong theater by mistake, or thinks that Schindler's List was a wacky comedy. The Road has to be one of the most depressing, pointless, excruciating movies you could ever see. It will make you want to go home and stick your head in the oven.The first 7 hours of the movie contain an endless slog through a desolate landscape bereft of plant and animal life. Only bugs and humans remain, somehow. Everything else on Earth has been burnt or smashed by some unacknowledged Doomsday Event. The director leaves it up to the audience to somehow figure out what kind of reasonable scientific explanation could account for anyone surviving for any amount of time after all the oxygen-producing plant life plus everything else in the food chain between bugs and people bit the dust. Apparently it happens through the magic of Dole Pineapple Chunks, the search for which takes up another 4 hours of movie.Once you get inured to this laugh riot, you eventually start to disassociate from the main characters. The Boy in the book is supposed to be 6 or 7. In the movie, though, he looks to be about 10 or 11, but seems to still act 6 or 7. He comes across as a total feeb and you start to wonder how a kid born on the cusp of a complete apocalypse manages to have such poor coping skills. The Kid was supposed to have been running into dead bodies and cannibals practically every day of his life so you'd think he'd be over it after 9-10 years, but no, he manages to seem traumatized at every instance.Dad doesn't help things out much as he spends his days talking to the kid like he's three and tucking him in and carrying him around every chance he gets. I'm sure that'll help grow hair on his chest, Dad! It's nice to see that no matter how shitty the world gets, there's always a parent willing to overshelter their kid from the reality of their situation.Dad also seems to make poor survival decisions. The poorest decision comes when the two find a friggin' BOMB SHELTER FILLED WITH FOOD AND WARM BEDS, but after a couple days they need to abandon it because they heard somebody walking around up top. Apparently this is the only bomb shelter in existence that didn't come with a lock on the hatch, and everyone knows how easy it is for a starving bum to breach a cement bunker with a steel trap door on it. It's much easier to pile a bunch of crap in an old push wagon and hit the road again to defend it in the open air against every marauder and sneak thief that walks by, while you slowly die from exposure.But one can't point fingers at such glaring plot holes, because This Is Such A Serious, Award-Winning Oscar Contender! You can tell this movie is an Oscar contender because the kid cries real tears and there are at least a couple scenes where the audience gets treated to a rear view of Viggo's naked ass and nutsack. Everyone knows that if Viggo is letting you see his junk, he's very much into his role and you should respect his process by taking his nuts very seriously like he does.There's a scene somewhere in the middle where The Mom (Charlize Theron) decides to end it by walking out into the freezing winter in her sleep shirt to die in the woods, because she can't take it anymore. By the end of the movie, you'll be wishing you'd walked out in the middle too.There was one very uplifting part to our experience, though: After leaving the theater, my husband found a five dollar bill on the ground. That cheered us up immensely. There is life after this movie!",The Road
430,grilices,This movie carries the fire,9,9 July 2018,"It took me almost ten years to watch ""The Road"", but today was finally the day that I watched this movie. To be honest, I didn't know what to expect. I only knew that it was in an post-apocalyptic future. So, since I actually really like Viggo Mortensen, I decided to open my heart to this movie. And I must say it: it is amazing.
Most of the movies (and TV series) that show post-apocalyptic scenarios have zombies... So, that's our main idea when we think about the ""end of the world"". But this movie only shows what happened to nature and to people - obviously without zombies. Everyone in this movie is trying to survive at his own way. Some became bad people, but others are still humans. 
In the end, even after realizing that this apocalyptic scenario may never happen, I cried. Because the characters and their relations are so real...",The Road
431,RadialDaze,Apocalypse with no depth,4,28 November 2016,"I like slow developing movies that builds towards something meaningful.This movie starts and ends in the same place. There is no depth to this movie only melodramatic moments that attempts to give meaning to this movie's purpose. The constant presence of suicidal denouement gets tiring and less dramatic. This movies moves at a snails pace moving away from meaning or character development. Clementine, from the walking dead game, had much more character building than the child in this movie. And Lee is a much more sympathizing character than the father in this movie. The endless, supposedly touching moments, involving the father and son embraces bordered on nausea. Again, this movie goes nowhere like a toy train running through an elaborate train setup only to return where it started. I never thought an apocalypse could be so boring.",The Road
432,bonhotelb,Bleak with an apprehensive light at the end of the tunnel,8,31 January 2017,"I have the book but have yet to get around to reading it. From all accounts I've heard so far, the book is even inauspicious than the movie so I'm going to hold off on the book for awhile. Anyway, the film is fantastic. Hillcoat sets up the totally lifeless, gray, dreary, and savage landscape perfectly. Between the lack of beauty and ferocious remaining people, the viewer can't help but sympathize with the woman (Charlize Theron). I constantly considered what I would do if I were ""the man"". I like to think I'd go on a fight to survive but after experiencing our current society it's hard to fathom that lifestyle. Which also begs the question if the boy is better off because he's never experienced any luxuries. This also brings about one qualm I have. Why is the boy so sympathetic? I would think he would be just as distrustful and jaded as his father. He has no reason for believing that people have good in them. But it does make for some good drama in the film. The final scene is curious. I noticed the man that approached him on the beach looks like a grown-up version of the boy. But his thumbs are missing just like the black burglar (which is interesting, why'd Hillcoat make the robber black?), what does that mean? So this family he comes across. Are they real? Are they a figment of his imagination? Was the other boy he saw in his father's hometown not real? Did he hear that families dog when they were in the bomb shelter? Or did he just want it to be a dog? Why would this family care about following the boy and the man, because they knew the man was dying and the boy would need their help? I like to think the family was real and the beetle was a sign of life surviving farther south so they'll either find a commune or start one themselves.",The Road

435,Stephen_in_Elkhorn,Do Not Expect the Trailer,10,29 December 2009,"After reading the book ""The Road"" by Cormac McCarthy and seeing the trailer for the movie and thought, oh no another book ruined by a movie. The trailer makes one believe that this is a fast-paced, action packed, thrill ride of a movie and the book is completely different. However after watching the movie I was content with the movie.The book is a story of a desperate father trying to stay sane in an insane world while keeping his boy alive. Slowly the father becomes more and more paranoid and the boy starts becoming a little more independent but dependent emotionally. The movie is the same thing thank the lord.Viggo Mortensen is convincing in the role of the ""Man"". He plays him loving enough while being paranoid; a role that could easily be ruined with the wrong actor. Kodi Smit-McPhee plays the Man's son, the ""Boy"". While any other child actor would've been annoying and whiny, Smit- McPhee takes it under his belt to not let that happen and make us take the Boy's journey rather than the Man's, which is a great thing in my perspective.The atmosphere is set by both the cinematography and the score. The cinematography gives us the feeling that all is hopeless and you are helpless to change this truth which is eventually you will die. The score gives the audience the cruel beauty of this world and the characters in it. While all this death and helplessness is set by the cinematography, the beauty and simplicity of the score makes it the perfect atmosphere for the movie.The movie, I thought, was harder to ""witness"" (if you will) because unlike a book that you can put down if it gets too draining or too emotionally intense, the movie forces you to watch and feel it as the characters themselves are.The only part I wish I would've seen more of are the wife flashbacks. True, they added more in the movie than in the book, I still would've like more of her character to develop.All in all, ""The Road"" is now my favorite book-and-movie set. The movie is a great example that even if the audience is searching for something more desirable, they can be well satisfied with a movie that gives a bleak world with little hope. The movie ultimately survives on its two main actors which in this case is great. ***** out of *****",The Road
436,Morrow-7,okay....,4,31 January 2010,"First of all I haven't read the book, so I'm not familiar with the story neither its quality. Although I've seen this movie.Second of all I must emphasize the work of the artists that matte painted all of those apocalyptic landscapes in amazing gray tones! They just look terrific and this movie earns a lot of interest just by that.Third of all, what's the point of doing a movie about the story of a father and a boy who live in a post-apocalyptic world where there isn't much objectives in life other that surviving? What's the meaning of that story? What do you want to achieve by telling us that?OK, so now I must say that I just left the cinema with a great disillusion when I noticed that I have spent 1.30 hours of film without getting into any conclusions or at least without knowing what was the point of all that effort in recreating a devastated world, if all you will see all the time is more of the same (even at the end). How come someone can produce a movie with this kind of story? OK, so it's the end of the world, people are struggling to survive, people get less and less human, even cans of spam because the most valuable item you get have, families are committing suicide just when they can't take anymore the reality they live in, men become cannibals, and so on. It's an interesting to see and to feel, how come humanity can change if our context changes (there are so many books and movies about that!). So how come you make a movie of it without having a really good story to tell? I know there can't be any story of hope to tell, but at least tell me a story! Because all that I've seen for 1.30 hours was a set of stunning landscapes, great acting, great production, interesting locations, but no plot, no action, nothing that could make you wonder and think about how could life happen in a place like that. All that it was given to me was scene after scene of alienated people wondering in a devastated world full of dangers. So it seems like each scene of the movie shows you what are those dangers that you can find in this world. You can either be killed, raped, eaten, beaten, be glad to find some food, have nightmares or dreams, be scared by other people that you find in your way, you can even be shot by an arrow! And after that, nothing else happens. You've got your catalog of ""activities"" in a post-apocalyptic world and the movie comes to an end.So, just to conclude, I believe it is a shame to spend so much effort in creating such an atmosphere (those desaturated images that get saturated in the end) and acting and nothing having anything at all to tell. There's no story, just a set of scenes...What a shame...If I want to appreciate a movie with a great story of humans being dehumanized by their change in context I would definitely see again ""Blindness"" and many other movies, other than this one...",The Road
437,augut0,Struggling to carry on,8,3 July 2011,"This movie exposes our survival instinct under extreme circumstances. It shows the prevalence of the strongest to the weaker, the overprotection of a father forced to endure a situation of desperation and daily struggle, fighting to carry on to an unknown future.The movie is great and Viggo's performance is, once again, outstanding. In the other hand, it lacks of a solid argument in what regards to the bottom line of the story.SPOILER FROM HEREHonestly, I don't understand why the mother leaves that way.

440,tfwc88,"Extremely static and slow movie goes nowhere, has poor special effects, nonsensical ending",1,24 May 2010,"Sure, the movie *excels* at projecting a barren, desolate, hopeless life of a father and son, but it is a very static and slow movie without much of a story line. It basically consists of two interchanging scenes which repeat multiple times over the course of two hours. On one scene, the father and his boy go around traveling in empty roads and sleeping in deserted cars while having occasional memories from which the father will suddenly wake up from in a jerky and annoying fashion. And on the other scene, they witness psychopath gangs which are out to kill them and other people in a putrid and bloody fashion. These two scenes pretty much interchange and repeat in cycles, but it is done in such way that there is no progress whatsoever. Rarely, the father and son will encounter another homeless person, and so you get your hopes up that the movie is actually going somewhere, but over and over again, the movie brings your hopes up and lets you down, as the they part ways and nothing is resolved. Then the movie keeps on interchanging the two scenes just like before.For starters, it seems the whole world is destroyed, but from the very beginning of the movie, it is never revealed what caused the world disaster, or how the father and his kid survived it...and I don't know about you, but if the whole world was destroyed, I'd like to know HOW.Worst of all, the movie is shot in a really cruddy way. During many scenes, the camera was zoomed way into the characters' faces as to avoid filming the natural sky and surroundings- -- but when they do show you the surroundings, it becomes obvious that they are using a special filter to make the green-and-blue scenery look less colorful (black and white, almost) and to tone down any sunlight being captured in the filming process. It's really poor quality special effects. There was a part or two where the filmmakers ""made a boo-boo"" since you could clearly see sunshine! (and there was not supposed to be any in the so-called post- apocalyptic scenery). It was clearly being toned down to make the scene look more stark, and it was not easy on the eyes, and poorly executed.The final straw watching this movie is that after two hours of patiently tolerating two repeating scenes, no progress in story line, and poor camera filters, the ending that you wait breathlessly for turns out to make no sense whatsoever. Supposedly a group composed of a woman, a man, two children and a dog (a dog?! come on!) show up out of nowhere *right on time* after the boy's father dies and claim that they have been following them ""all along"". But that's ridiculous. In reality, they would have caught up to them immediately and robbed them of their food for their own survival! What a disappointment! I wasted two hours of my life burning my eyes in a state of anxiety, but you don't have to. Pass this movie up, it's a waste of your time and not interesting or worthwhile whatsoever.",The Road

442,photography00,A film without a personal vision from a book with a strong one,4,15 September 2009,"The major problem of the director was how to adapt a novel where the reader has the impression of entering into a nightmare from which he is waking up a different man.Well, the power of the novel is to create a sort of metaphor of the world that Mc Carthy has created in all his books and that this metaphor is never more than the awareness of what is in front of us.In that sense, ""The Road"" and ""Blindness"" (the novel of Nobel prize ""Saramago"") are two mirrors of the same image but with a different landscape. Saramago shows that landscape is secondary (the movie of Meireilles is also good at showing this), while Mc Carthy insists on a landscape but this is also secondary and a simple metaphor.Unfortunately, John Hillcoat has decided to focus strongly on the digital transfer of Mc Carthy nightmare, with the result of a succession of nightmarish landscapes (but finally boring, because they are visualized and not imagined!). In its search for the fidelity to the text he has lost his own personal contribution to the movie (see the great difference with the other Mc Carthy recent adaptation: ""No country for old men"", showing both Mc Carthy and the personal vision of the Coen's).Finally, what the book is excellent to do...leaving us in the incertitude to understand if this is a real landscape, a remote part of our mind that cannot be even imagined, in a sense a metaphor of what Mc Carthy has described in his other books, then the movie is totally incapable to represent.",The Road

However I think this movie is being propped up by fans of the book because 7.5 stars is way off. All I can say is thank god I haven't read the book because the film is bad enough. I was expecting a 28 days later style film but instead got a movie that felt like it's was 7hrs long yet nothing really happened. The storyline had so much potential to be good with a father and his son having to survive in a desolated word where nothing has survived apart from a handful of other humans that have mostly turned to Cannibalism. But instead you get a storyline focused around a wimpy kid and his over protective father dragged out for far too long. A movie this boring I would normally turn off half way through except I didn't due to the high rating, so i painfully sat through the second half hoping for a twist or a thought provoking ending.

444,McDozer,Why This Road?,7,8 March 2010,"This movie is probably the most realistic Endtime scenario Hollywood has brought forth to date, and many people, including the medieval seer Nostradamus have foreseen such times of famine so great ""that man will become a man-eater,"" giving reason for serious concern about whether this might actually be a realistic peek into our future. We know from Jesus' own words in the Gospels, that a ""time of great tribulation"" is awaiting mankind, such as has not been since the beginning of the world, nor ever shall be (Matthew 24).Of course, such thoughts bear very little entertainment value, and we're not likely to find the movie among the top ten favorite films of all times of very many people, except maybe for the occasional pessimist, who's just waiting for the day he'll be able to tell us, ""I knew this would happen someday."" Thankfully, the makers of this film had enough sense to not let this film be non-stop agony without any hope. The young actor playing the leading role in this film (Kodi Smit-Mc Phee) is truly one amazing kid, and you root and hope and pray for him to make it throughout the movie, against all the odds.Testifying of some deeper insight than just creating one heck of a bleak scenario movie, the maker even gives us one prominent reason for the fate that has befallen mankind in his not all that unrealistic portrayal of what might be our future, if we don't change some fundamental attitudes: When the father and his son are sitting on the beach (presumably on the East Coast), the boy asks his dad, ""What's on the other side?"" - And after pausing long enough to have come up with some substantial answer, all the wisdom and insight the father comes up with is, ""Nothing;"" reflecting quite accurately the general attitude of the average citizen of the world's presently predominant nation regarding the rest of the world: it simply doesn't even exist, as far as they're concerned.

445,Abhirup14,Breathtaking,10,1 February 2011,"Every now and then you experience something that reminds you of a certain Professor John Keating forcing his students to stand atop the teacher's desk and look around the classroom, just to get a different perspective. The Road is a movie that takes this ""different perspective"" to a ""different"" level.Every now and then you experience something that threatens to tear you into two with the contradicting emotions that it stirs in you. The Road instills the fear in you about the people around you and yet wrenches your heart out for the ones you love.Every now and then you experience something that makes you hold your breath, only to breathe easy when it has passed. The Road is such a movie.I should perhaps correct myself and thank Cormac McCarthy for writing the book. I haven't read it, pardon my ignorance, but what the movie achieves, despite the excuse of having a presumably brilliant, albeit Pulitzer-winning book, to fall back upon, is the successful recreation of a theme which is in reality dark, thought-provoking and scary yet much in need of a different perspective. I have always been a fan of sci-fi fiction and anything to do with post-apocalypse or disaster movie makes me reach out for popcorn and coke. Watching this movie made me want to reach out within me and spare a moment for those people who have given me a life worth living. Even an avid reader, such as myself, would have probably kept down the book on such a theme had it gone long enough. I intend to find out. The movie makes you want to watch. Therein lies the beauty of its devastation. It threatens you to quit watching and yet makes you watch not wanting the father and son to quit. It has been a while that such a situation has presented itself in front of me. The ""lighter"" moments of the movie in which the man dreams of his woman are nothing short of brilliant yet underplayed, with the one with piano is one the finest cinematic pieces of recent times. There are ample tear-jerking moments in the movie for the weak and the tough of heart, but anyone with a heart will find it skip a few beats in the sequence where Viggo Mortensen lets go of his love. The only reason, I can imagine, that Mortensen did not get a Oscar nomination was because he had a ready script to rely upon. He has been consistently giving performances that deserve all the attention which weak movies based upon slums of ""developing"" countries don't. He has, in my opinion, always been a powerful actor and a personal favorite and here he proves it yet again. Mr. Duvall lives up to his name after a long long time.A movie that has moved me. Moved me as much as ""Grave of Fireflies"" or perhaps ""Forrest Gump"" did. It's a movie that might.might make you keep it and yet never watch it a second time. For it is not merely a movie, but a culmination of a million moments, moments that shock you, moments that make you sad, make you feel hope and pain. A review is no justice to this movie. Watch it and you might feel I have used too many words to describe it. In my defense, it took me a while to regain words.A note for those who like fast-paced movies.....steer clear of this mere 1 hour 45 min movie. It can seem a long time",The Road
446,lesinvictus,Not the ending that I was waiting for.,6,21 March 2010,"Prior to watching the movie, I had no idea that it was a book adaptation. I was waiting more of a Book-of-Eli sort of thing. However what amazed me the most was the chain of events: We don't even know what happened to the world and why it happened. It was a depressing tale of a common man seeking for survival. Dark atmosphere, cannibalism, starvation, hopelessness and the power of primal needs makes people question the true nature of mankind. However there are many loose ends in the scenario and some really questionable decisions. I am not going to criticize the mom's willingness to end it all due to what their life was reduced to, but I am sure there are more logical ways than running into the hell in the middle of the night. Moreover leaving the full-of-food-ultra-secure-bomb-shelter is also questionable. What made me really rate this movie a 6 was though, the ending. The time wasn't given exactly in the movie, but we can understand it from the boys age. It has been 11-12-13 years of solitude of this family and the moment that the father dies, there is a really welcoming ""American Dream"" family with 2 kids: a boy and a girl, a loving mother and a protective father model (with guns and stuff) and even a DOG! accepting the kid into their family. I am not talking days here! 13 years past while they were living alone, and 2 minutes after the father dies, they are right there, claiming that they were following them because they were worried about the boy. -- What happened to the poor 90 year old blind grandfather, didn't you see him too?Anyways, except for the ending and some loose ends, the movie makes every viewer to experience the hopelessness and the dark atmosphere. The end comes without a warning, and just like that, without a meaning or an explanation. The solitude and despair makes people do unimaginable things, even Viggo (with the African American in the beach). A really good example of the post-apocalyptic genre.",The Road

How the film company put this together without knowing the rubbish that it is, I don't Know! The movie is not your normal end of the world stuff. Its like mad max without the action. This movie fails to deliver something. I wrote this to warn people that this move is just awful.",The Road
448,lynnhaydn,One of the worst films I have ever seen,1,31 January 2010,"I am sure the book was great and there were some good actors in this film, the big question is why? It was the most slow paced useless depressing piece I have ever seen if there was a message or moral to the tale I did not notice it.It seemed to go on forever without much happening the whole story and everything in it could have been told in 15 minutes.I am a big fan of Robert Duvall, Viggo Mortenson, and Charlize Theron their performances were as good as ever though they did not have much to work with, the script was chronically bad it could have been written on a napkin in a bar and probably was.If you are considering watching this film I would suggest that instead you pay some one to slap you in the face for a solid 2 hours, trust me you would find that to be a much nicer experience.",The Road
449,scoobyisdubious,"bleak, brutal and unrelenting",8,30 May 2010,"Jesus....this movie is DARK. Just bleak, brutal and unrelenting. It ain't your typical cartoon post-apocalyptic Road Warrior nonsense. Be prepared for some intense desperation. You'll need a heavy dose of bright sunshine after this journey down into hell. Escapist entertainment it is NOT.Having not read any reviews of this film before viewing, I was unprepared for the intense nature of it. For anyone with some degree of empathy, it really puts you in the ""what if that were me? what would *I* do?"" mindset. Imagining yourself in this very realistic nightmare scenario, WITH YOUR CHILD, is just chilling. The film succeeds on that level. It's not a horror film, but it is horrifying on many levels.",The Road
450,funyans,discrepancies,6,30 July 2010,"Being a father, one can only put himself in the situation. Therefore i believe that the film is unrealistic. Living in a post-apocalyptic world must sharpen your fears and lack of confidence in anything going on around you. Viggo's character never realises that the are more chances of his son surviving him than the opposite. He never fully displays the harsh truth of facts to his old enough son. Human beings are to an extent how they are raised and with much influence of the physical context in which they are brought up, so i think the behaviour within the couple doesn't match their context in time and place He never pushes his son towards his own self preservation instinct, as he tries to stand as the only one capable of providing for the pair.Technically i think it is a very well made film. Great photography by Aguirresarobe who i think is and addition of Viggo due to his experience with Spanish film industry.",The Road
451,gnam,One of the most touching films I've seen,10,1 November 2011,"There are some small SPOILERS in this review. - Recently I've become somewhat of an apocalypse-film maniac. I'm following The Walking Dead, watching zombie movies, apocalyptic movies, disaster movies and everything like that.First off, I have NOT read the book, now we're through that. :) What made me check out The Road was firstly because of its genre, secondly because of it's cover^^, and thirdly and finally because it starred Viggo Mortensen. I hadn't read any description of it beforehand, so I didn't know what to expect, whether it was gonna be zombies or simply total wasteland. It did NOT let me down. :) So. The very gray tone of this film gave it a depressed feel. ""There is no hope"" it plainly said to the viewer. But the inseparable bond between the man and the son added some kind of optimism, and a little bit of hope.Not far into the movie I was told that there would be bad guys, and they would be cannibals. That's what added a bit of tension to the plot, which would otherwise have been a bit dull and slow I think.One thing that never cross my mind during the film, but rather struck me later, is that the scenery was unbelievably well made. There must have been loads of expensive shots. Although all the environment was gray all throughout the movie, I realize now that there wasn't any part where I doubted the realism. And that's gotta count for something.The scene that affected me most, was the one where they caught the thief who stole their cart of supplies. A movie scene hasn't affected me that much in a long time. It was painful to watch as the man stripped him to his bare feet, and just left him there, it really hurt emotionally to see. :'( The Road was clearly one of the saddest movies I have seen to date, also one damn inspiring one. There may have been parts of lesser acting or anything not that great, but I never care about such small things. Any movie that feels so real that scenes become emotionally touching, I feel are genuinely well made.10/10 Because the slow pace and depressed feeling made it stand out among other disaster/apocalyptic-movies. Great job.",The Road
452,abro16,Good but Not Perfect,7,7 March 2011,"I like normally apocalyptic movies, this was good but not perfect and precise, in so many ways. yes first thing the boy must should be so brave, after all he is born and grown in such a harsh environment. and its natural thing as well. the boy makes the movie so pathetic. people don't like such sympathies in such movies. Except child should be so innocent cute or a girl! i am wondering if it was a good idea that if it were a girl instead of the boy. the movie would be more emotional!The boy must had helped his Papa without asking, it'd a good idea that the boy look around to find something, a big stone or rod to give Papa to open the Hole, Bomb Shelter where they found food. and also he should help his Papa to drag the cart by himself. But He was not dragging or helping even when his Papa was Sick and Injured, and also Papa were saying him to do.The Old man who told his name Ely, was pointless, without benefit. May be the writer introduced this character just a s person to communicate once. But it would be better idea if this old man helped them in another scene to make this character useful.It was very sad to see when one woman and girl (daughter) were chased and killed. it would be good idea if old man (Ely) was switched with that woman and girl. (this papa and son communicated this woman and girl) while old man was chased and killed!Also they don't show in the movie what happened actually to cause this world like this. and they don't show any dates between this time and that time when he was with his wife. (like they showed in I Am Legend)In this Apocalypse there was no any shortage of fresh water Unlike Book of Eli. But shortage of food unlike I am Legend. It became impossible to eat meat in this movie except cannibalism. and also plants and trees were dying. if this was the case then logically there was no reason to survive. because you are going to die not later but sooner due to shortage of food. and you cannot find the all expired packed food all the way. Or you have to become cannibal. or at least scavenger, who eats a corpses. !!Also they showed that they helped an old man, but in other scene they left a black man without clothes in cold, when he was not harmful! !?Also Man's wife (charise theron) leaved simply... i don't know if it is psychologically possible that a wife and a mother leaves/kill herself so simply. while contradictly in the almost end scene when Man kills a old man who shot him with arrow. That old man was with his old wife. also we see such scene in Book of Eli where a old couple is surviving by helping each other. so how Wife is leaving her husband and specially a not-much-grown-son so simple while it was also not much danger at that time!",The Road
453,igbadbob,"I managed to see both sides of the coin, but this truly is a marmite movie (love it or hate it!)",6,10 July 2011,"Okay. To begin with, this movie is beautifully shot, staged and directed. Secondly, it features some great performances from MOST of the actors. Thirdly, the idea in writing intrigued me enough to watch this film. Now that that's out of the way, I'll explain my not-so good rating...The Road is about the journey taken by a father and his son, who are heading south towards the sea after the fallout of an undisclosed ""event"". This journey obviously proves to be somewhat perilous, but this peril is dampened quite significantly by the father's blind tendency to overlook the fact that his son is a sappy, whiny, annoying brat that needs a significant amount of toughening up, in order to survive the ordeals of life in the bleak wilderness that is the landscape of The Road. At one point the father even admits he's trying to pass on this very knowledge, but he never teaches this to his brat, and the brat is constantly crying, whimpering and wanting to make friends with every grimy individual that pops up that doesn't want to eat them, being that foods in short supply!This pretty much sums up the majority of this movie, which has few flickers of light to provide a balance that I felt was lacking from The Road, resulting in a thoroughly depressing movie which made me cheer towards the end (yes, at the sad bit - the kid deserved it!). And this, just before a convenient ""family"" moment which seemed rather out of place. Considering the boy's father had been ramming home the message not to trust just anyone, this was just ridiculous!So, to sum up, I would give The Road a chance. Watch it,take in the lovely cinematography, the fine direction and excellent performances from everyone but the brat and decide for yourself. Just don't watch it if you suffer from depression. Or you're having a bad day. Or if you like nice Hollywood endings. The Road seems to try and aim for this, ultimately, but after all the warnings imparted within, I found it rather hard to swallow!",The Road

I have only watched this movie once and have never had the heart to go back to it... it took me about 3-4 days to get over watching it (at the time) and sort out the multiple feeling that it forced on me... great acting, a feel of desperation, an emotional gut renching movie and a must watch!!

455,bradwk-60-379925,A tribute to hopelessness,2,12 February 2012,"The setting of ""The Road"" is an anti-Earth: a world that has inexplicably become uninhabitable and uninhabited. All plants and animals are dead, except for a few bugs and a few humans. No explanation is given of the ongoing catastrophe, or of how there could be individuals who have survived for several years in such. Implausibility reigns in ""The Road"". For example, we are supposed to believe that with virtually no food, a man and his son are able to hike hundreds of miles through wastelands and chilling rains as they try to get to a warmer climate.A recurring plot device is that the man and boy stumble upon a band of cannibals, then desperately try to escape. Except for these extremely disturbing incidents, in which the father anguishes over *at what point* he will murder his own son to ""save"" him from the cannibals (!), almost nothing happens in the movie.The theme is that life is a joyless, hopeless, and impossible race towards either starving or being tortured and eaten by your mindlessly cruel neighbors.I suspect that only those who want to believe that life is despair will ""like"" this movie.",The Road
456,lucas-poisson,Shock!,10,16 December 2013,"I shall not define ""The Road"" with what it isn't, rather by what it is: It is GREY, in its photography, its scenario and its truth, a dark tone of grey, hopeless, full of despair, a striking amount of darkness I had never seen before.It is Beautiful, in a sense newly discovered: the feelings shared between all characters, especially the boy and his father get real and suck you in the story, it is one of those rare movies I actually cried, affected by the despair, the love, the sorrow, the hope, the fear...It is True and Shocking: the images are hard, symbolically (a simple piano leads to great amount of sadness for example) but also visually, I wasn't used to this violence, you can see the hardest things out there however this movie felt real. It pushes the viewer to question his world, himself, his courage and his will to live.A great life lesson, as it shows the struggle of a man and his son to survive and continue being ""the good guys"".This film will remain one of the truest post apocalyptic movie in the industry, and one of my favorite in terms of humanity.",The Road

Completely faithful to the book by Cormac, the story is set in a bleak and desperate world, full of death and destruction. This strips the plot to something quite simple. This is a love story between a man and his son. It also is a story about what makes us human. There you are, the plot boiled down to 2 sentences. As the man and the boy survives in a post-apocalyptic world, everything that happens are a bunch of 'what if' questions. I admit the movie is bleak. You develop a rapport with the man and the boy, and wish for a happy ending, but know that there wont be one- at least for the man, and even the future for the boy is left open to question.

460,ejisaacs,an honest review -,8,29 May 2010,"Looking at my review history, there's not much, but I have felt the need to give some exoneration to a couple of movies I have watched, out of the last twelve or so. I normally get my initial thoughts about a movie from the trailers, or IMDb (or my friends who might have seen it) and then watch it or not. So, I wanted to give this movie something ""honest"".This is not the ""worst movie ever made"" or ""the best"". I, personally, thought it was VERY GOOD. The D.P. did a great job, Viggo was excellent, the son-actor (what's with the comments about his whining?? he's TEN!! do some of these reviewers expect him to be some sort of savage??) did a very good job and everything seemed to work for this motion picture.So, if you are looking for an overall honest review of this movie that may help you decide whether or not to watch it: it is bleak... it is sad... it is survival AFTER an apocalypse (no apocalypse scenes)... this is not a ""popcorn"" film... if you watched ""Old Country"" and thought ""huh?"", this is even more grim. I am not offering spoilers, but just recommending this as a very good movie to rent and be prepared to not feel uplifted at the end. (And, personally, I thought the end worked).",The Road
461,ibuckingham6,Grey on Grey on brown.,7,12 October 2013,"Survival, that is all that matters in this bleak and colorless tail of of a man and his son trying to survive in this post-apocalyptic, violent, empty, cannibalistic and hungry world. The movie follows the story of a name less man and his nameless boy try to survive in the world created adapted form the author Cormac McCarthy. This movie is first and foremost one of the most depressing movies I've seen in cinema in a long time. There is practically no color in this movie, just various shades of grey and brown. There are no animals, the plants are dead and the water is polluted, therefore there is no color, and no food. The motivation for the characters in this movie is just food, that and survival. The story is quite sad, the characters just seem to be scraping anything they can, and then losing it. There is a constant fear of having no food, and cannibalism. With a food shortage in the world, it is revealed that many have resorted to cannibalism, which comes up on some truly shocking ways in the movie. The land is ruled by those who join gangs, and eat people, and those who choose to be by themselves, and don't eat people. One of the things I wasn't so happy with in the story was that it didn't seem to explain how the world had gone to crap very well. There was a narration at the beginning, but that was kind of it. Another issue was that their purpose in the movie never really seemed that important to the characters. They seemed very keen on reaching their goal in one scene, but then in the next they would just not seem to care at all. But other than this, the movie was actually very well set up.The portrayal of the world and the characters that live within it is very well done. I really felt that these characters were doing what ever they needed to do to survive, and thats what the movie was aiming to do, so for that it gets kudos. You can really see the toll scavenging has taken on this place, there is just nothing around. All the buildings are empty, there are no animals, only there bones and everything is just covered in dust, dirt and ash. In summary, this movie sets out the scene and the characters very well, its a little jumpy, and too many things seem to happen too quickly. It has a very sad mood, and the fact that I wanted to stop watching because the world was just so bleak and depressing it made me scared that the real world would be the same, is a good sign. This is a great post-apocalyptic tail of a father and sons struggle to survive and is definitely worth checking out.",The Road

465,thereasonforlifeismemes,It was OK,6,15 May 2016,"I am unsure as to whether or not I liked this movie. Unlike some people I know, I preferred the book to the movie. I agreed with their choice for actors and loved the makeup, but when I watched the movie after reading the book I still felt in my chest that something was missing. The movie did not stray far from the actual text of the book, but like many movie adaptations of books, the devil is in the details. First off, the setting did fit quite well to what I imagined when I read the book. I imagined a dark, ash-covered, waste land where life cannot grow. Although, I think that the movie was a too ""light"". When I say light I really mean light. The whole movie was very bright. A couple of times I found it to be quite unfitting. The world is ""burned"", so why not focus more on the burned setting? Where is the dark sky with clouds of ash and a red sun peering down onto the dreary world? I remember a scene where they were walking through the forest and there was clean, crisp snow covering the ground. If this is a world where forests burned for weeks, then whey is the snow so clean? After a volcanoes or forest fire, ash comes down from the sky for days. So a world-wide fire like shown should go for weeks.The plot of the movie moved fast compared the book as well. Unlike a book, movies cannot keep readers entertained for a chapter with their writing style and dialogue. So, like Never Let Me Go, this movie focused on the major events. Although I see the reasoning, and although I know they had to, I still find myself confused when watching the film. In the book, the boy and father could go weeks without seeing another human being. The book focuses not only on the relationship between father and son, but also the desolation that they feel however close they are. The random people we see on the road serve as a refreshing new face/personality when left with the father and son for so long. The movie just skips over these small events and when it does not, they are not given any effort. The constant event after event, the constant meeting of new people to running away may put the watcher on the edge of their seat, but gives the impression that the world is still alive. The world is not alive, it is dying, dead even, and the movie still gives the impression that a good number of people is alive.Other than those two problems, I have had no other issues with the movie. I found it overall a pleasurable experience, but the two issues I had with the movie, as told above, made me unsure.",The Road

467,charman-07268,A fight for family and survival,8,3 May 2017,"The Road is a slow yet striking movie which benefits from its sincere acting, gruesome setting, and sympathetic plot. The movie not only grips viewers, but it also forces them to have empathy for characters in the book, instilling fear and pity into their minds.The first great success this move achieves is solid characters. Empowered by strong quotes, our protagonist, the man, is a relatable character with sensible motives. He prioritizes survival and family, two traits which I stress greatly as a viewer. Additionally, though the man may be aggressive towards strangers, he does so in order to protect his son, staying with him as long as possible and guiding him in preparation for life alone. Beyond our protagonist, there are many other striking characters in The Road. Though he may be annoying at times, the boy injects some youthful hopefulness into what could have become a glum film. Also, the men encountered down the road are simple and sincere, acting passionately to overcome the difficult circumstances in the world around them.The Road also excels from creating an engulfing environment. Scene after scene featured dark, cloudy days or dim, candle-lit nights, forming a mood of despair. Despite this darkness, the movie never slows down due to a dull setting. Each location brings in new areas of intrigue, with cars, caverns, and underground shelters all introducing new aspects of the world to viewers. One scene which captured this introductory effect was the scene in which the man and his boy discover the underground food shelter. While the actual space is minimal in size, it feels very significant due its indoor feel and food stocked walls.Overall, The Road is a simple yet well executed film which is both visually and mentally stimulating. Though it had its disturbing moments, the movie was ultimately about family relationships and extreme survival, two themes which make for an thought-provoking film.",The Road
468,cmyles-07888,Underperfomance of A Movie,4,23 April 2018,"The Road is a 2009 American post-apocalyptic drama, based off The Road, a novel written by Cormac McCarthy. The film was directed by John Hillcoat. The man (played by Viggo Mortensen) and the boy (played by Kodi Smit-McPhee) struggle to survive in a post-apocalyptic world as they travel on the road to the southern coast, in hopes of warmth and refugee. The mother of the boy, (played by Charlize Theron), deserted the two years after the apocalypse. 
Those who read the novel know that cannibalism is a huge element within the storyline of The Road, which I think wasn't emphasized enough. The element of cannibalism was significantly downplayed within the film. The only time cannibalism is truly shown in the film is when the boy and the man enter the basement of a house, and find several nude and starving people who were locked up. It is assumed that these people were being held captive as a food source for their captors. 
Another aspect that played a huge role within the text but wasn't really incorporated in the text was the setting. After reading The Road and before watching the film, I anticipated the setting of the entire film to be dark, grey, bleak, and full of ash. These aspects play a large role in why the journey south was so treacherous. The film did a poor job of showing a post-apocalyptic world in my opinion. The setting of the movie gave me the impression that the weather was constantly cloudy, and that the establishments such as various buildings, stores, and houses were being poorly maintained. There were no places shown within the film that gave off the feeling of being abandoned or burned down, just ignored. 
The only aspect of this movie that I really enjoyed was the input of voice overs and narration of some scenes. The use of voice overs helped incorporate the ""vibe"" given off when reading through the pages of McCarthy's writing. 
 Overall, the film did a poor job of trying to bring Cormac McCarthy's writing to life. There were quintessential aspects of the book that made it so enjoyable were left out. The man and son were unrealistically lucky within the film, to the point where the film became stale.(How can a cold, starving man on the brink of death go diving into a freezing sea and walk out like it was nothing?) The actors' performances were subpar at best. And to top the movie off, the only African American within the film robbed the boy and the man, and then was robbed himself.

469,rohanshah-84809,rohan Shah,6,27 April 2018,"Although this movie has a lot of star studded actors in it, the movie is not very good. This movie is based on the book and follows it pretty well and follows the book most of the time. However, they do stick with things from the movie that don't fit well in the movie. For example, in the book, the dialogue is choppy and is somewhat acceptable in the book. However, when seen by two person having an actual conversation, it disrupts the entire flow of the movie and takes away from the actual movie. Also, in the book, there is a major emphasis about the cannibalism and is one of the main points in the book. However, in the movie there is one scene about true cannibalism and it doesn't last long. I would like the part about cannibalism to be longer as it would more action and gives the movie a new and interesting story line. Also the setting in the book is that the entire sky is gray and the sun is covered. Therefore, all life is gone and there is no food available. The book also describes as towns being destroyed and completely being destroyed. However, in the movies the scenes have the appearance of being just used. The buildings don't have the appearance of being destroyed but just used and doesn't give the appearance of being destroyed.

The language is so rich and distinct, and for me that was one of the defining qualities of the story, so I thought that there was a risk of something being lost in the translation from page to screen, but I genuinely don't think they could have done a better job in making this movie.The direction and screenplay were excellent. John Hillcoat and Joe Penhall brought a real sense of urgency to the audience, and they seemed to tone down some of McCarthy's more archaic and flowered writing to make it a little more palatable and realistic. It's not that it was at all 'dumbed down', but I don't feel that the often-biblical sense of language would have been appropriate for a screen adaptation.Nick Cave and Warren Ellis done a great job in scoring the movie. It's at times very tender, but once or twice I felt it didn't particularly serve the scene. It's not that it was at all intrusive, and to be honest it's an issue and a personal preference I have with almost all films that I see, but I felt that having no music whatsoever at some points would have gotten the feeling across better.But for me, the real quality was in what is arguably the two most important aspects for a film of this nature: the acting and the cinematography.Beginning with the latter, I'd say that this aspect is (unfortunately, as I'd say most aspects of this film should probably receive more attention) the main hope for the film at the Oscars. It really is sublime. The achievement of creating the scale of greyness and murk while still holding some ghost of the world's past beauty on screen really shouldn't be overlooked. A lot of the scenes and wide-angle shots were reminiscent of a charcoal embodiment of today's world, as if everything had been placed in a carbon shell. Your eyes adjust to the dark canvas quite quickly, and it's only when compared with something else on screen - a can of Coke, a tin of food - that you notice the stark contrast of colour to grey and back again.The acting was nothing short of top-drawer. Viggo Mortensen's embodiment of the burnt-out, world-weary father was as convincing a performance as I've seen in the last few years. Kodi Smit-McPhee done a remarkable job considering his young age, matching Mortensen step-for-step the whole way through the movie. The chemistry between the man and the boy was convincing throughout, and you really did get the feeling that things were being said without words between the two. The small-yet-important roles played by Charlize Theron, Robert Duvall, Michael K Williams and Guy Pearce were all executed with the kind of consummate professionalism one would expect from such talented actors, despite their relatively meagre screen time. For all I think that all the extra players were on a level playing field, I think a special mention has to go to Williams for being at once menacing and heart-wrenchingly vulnerable, all in the space of what must have been three or four minutes, and to Duvall for portraying a fragile relic of the old-world lost in a time that no one should be a part of.All in all, I have to say this movie has perhaps surpassed all my expectations. Of what possibly could have been done to bring the source material onto the big screen, they done it, and they done it well. I had high hopes, and I'd been following it through all the delays and the hype for the past eighteen months, but I never expected it to be so good.Go see it.",The Road
474,rivernwind,A movie that has no intention to satisfy the audience yet is stunning.,8,20 September 2020,"Journey of a dad and his son is processed naturally and realistic. Characters you see is not made for you to like them, even the dad or his son. But this is what it's supposed to be. You understand the characters motivations and thats really simple, surviving. The reason i loved this movie so much is no more than this. Movie accomplishes to make you feel that all they want is to stay alive and this seperates it from other apocaliptic movies. Not once i said ""Why are they doing this?"" unlike other chaotic movies.
You will see corruption which is supposed to happen to people in a dystopic world like this.
Cons:
-The story is not that interesting.Pros:
-Acting is good.
-Decisions made in stroy makes sense
-Does not try to add dialogues, characters or events to make movie more interesting.(Which is a positive thing because naturally everyone's main goal would be to survive in a world like this.)If you expect action you won't like this movie.

You can feel the emotion the fear the anger the love and devotion in this post apocalyptic world. The fathers only goal to keep his son alive and to reach a safe haven where they can live in peace and harmony.

Because what we have here is an exercise in pointlessness squared. Take the bleak but beautifully written source book, replace the 'beautifully written' bit with bleak monochrome cinematography and all you are left with is an exercise in bleakness, which has outstayed its welcome after the first twenty minutes.Yet an hour and forty minutes later it is still limping onwards to no good purpose like its nameless protagonist, who at least has the good sense to die in the end.Leaving a) his whiny pointless son in the hands of another band of hopeless stragglers and b), come on Hollywood you know you want to, room for a sequel.In the words of one of the interchangeable supporting characters: ""Can't you smell the stench?""",The Road

""um....no""",1,31 May 2010,"***Spoilers up in here****** This movie should have only been 2 minutes long; it should have started and ended with the whole family blowing each other's brains out. I consider myself a deep thinker and love a good post-apocalyptic movie so I was excited to see this but I was left in awe with the utter bleak pointlessness of this one. There is no real plot or storyline, unlikeable, undeveloped characters and the story left nothing to ponder except: if you were starving and the world was essentially just ""over"" would you start munching on the other survivors or kill yourself? I would just go ahead and off myself but I can assure you I would not have done it the way Ms. Theron did (wandering in the dark to death.)How did the world come to be 100% dead of vegetation, wildlife and almost all of humankind in such a short period of time? One might make the argument that this movie is not about the actual science of the apocalypse but rather that it's about human nature and human relationships, unfortunately there are only two characters in the movie and it's pretty basic, a father is caring for his crybaby son. I believe the author's inability to explain the world in which his boring characters live in can be attributed to lack or creativity or laziness. There was no creativity or even anything remotely resembling beauty in this tale. The cannibals were called ""the bad guys"" and the non-cannibals were the ""good guys"", ""Hope"" was called ""the fire"", and the main characters were ""papa"" and ""son."" And the ending was just embarrassing.",The Road
480,nickdonofrio84,"Good movie, but a glaring omission",7,2 July 2010,"I never read the book, I am reviewing the film only and how I felt about it.I have a thing for post-apocalypse movies. I find the concept of a catastrophic event setting our social evolution back thousands of years very stimulating. However, it should be noted that The Road is not a post-apocalypse movie (which is the way it was advertised, and what I was expecting to see). The Road is a love story. It's about a father teaching his son to survive, and his son teaching him compassion. Our main character is tortured by constant reminders of the wife he lost. The fact that it takes place in a post-apocalyptic environment is almost irrelevant.My biggest gripe (and only gripe, really) is that we never got so much as an elementary explanation to what got them there. What happened to put them in this situation? This is never revealed because, again, the movie is not about the environment - it's about how the characters are living in it. I'm sure the writer pondered throwing in some dialogue that fills us in. In fact, there was a perfect opportunity for it; when the father says to the son, ""You must think I'm from a different world,"" this would have been the perfect time for the son to ask why they grew up under such different circumstances. Was it a nuclear war? Some biological weapon? Asteroid? The writer left this out to avoid distraction. It had an opposite effect on me because I was distracted by not knowing.It reminds me of the movie ""Cloverfield"", with the giant monster tearing apart NYC. You never find out what the monster is or how it got there. The director made a good comment when asked about this. He said, ""In this type of movie, the main characters always run into some scientist or biologist who explains what the creature is, where it came from, and maybe even how to kill it. Our characters never met that guy."" That sums up my gripe with The Road pretty well. ""Our characters never had that conversation.""My thoughts on this detraction won't apply to everyone. In fact, I still thought the movie was very good, a-typical to say the least. 7 out of 10.",The Road

The kid has no idea what life was about before this all happened. i.e. drinking the coke. He's never had friends, never seen children and all he want's to do is see the blue sea. I could see how this would actually happen. All that would be on your mind would be ""food"". The acting was awesome along with the story line.

No other predators left except for men? Of course, we ate all of them or they died of starvation. But we didn't. We are special. And well-preserved dry plants everywhere several years after they had died? This one I found especially amusing. It normally takes about a year for dry grass or fallen leaves to decompose, still throughout the movie we can see tons of them everywhere several years after they had all dried out. Say nothing about the complete lack of fungi, insects (well, there was ONE beetle) and other detritivores. The post-apocalypse world should be a paradise for them, shouldn't it? So what type of apocalypse was it? It looks that even the screenplay author lacked the idea of how to reasonably explain it. A meteorite collision? Some enormous fire? Thisis the kind of information we get at the beginning. But can we see any aftermath like burned-out forests for example? Nope. Just the grey, barren world. And why for god sake all cars and trucks are always left in mess in the middle of the road? What stopped people who nevertheless survived the disaster from parking them properly? Just to mention a few things from many.Add to this annoyingly illogical behaviour of the main characters. Leaving a safe shelter full of food for certain misery and slow agony because they heard some noise outside? Sure. 10 years old kid constantly behaving as if he was born the day before? Because he apparently doesn't understand the world around him. His traumatic father who does all to protect him (isn't it what this movie is about?) but who still takes him to every house, cellar and other potential trap he scavenges. And my personal best - the coke still drinkable after several years in a broken fridge. If this is what the product placement people wanted me to believe, I will quit drinking it straight away.So what shall I hold to? No real story, lack of elementary logic, no psychological layer that I can believe in. I know there's always some kind of agreement between the makers of any sci-fi movie and the audience: ""We create the world and you have to take it the way it is"". But how much crap can we swallow at the time? In short: another teary movie about nothing. A complete waste of time considering how entertaining or thought-provoking it is.

483,mkc7931,Unconvincing and Unfaithful,1,26 December 2010,"Well, maybe it didn't deserve to get just 1 star, but after reading others' reviews, I felt I had to make a point of getting the score down.To start off, I did read the original novel by McCarthy, and yes, not only is it ""not as good as the book,"" it's a horrible film with unconvincing scenes and acting. I could imagine how the essence of McCarthy's dry/cold/grim dialogs and prose could be difficult to capture when adapted to the screen, but had the actors and the director/writers tried to actually portray this by, well, making the dialogs and acting dry/cold/grim, it would have been more convincing. Granted, it's been about 3 years since I've read the book, but I don't remember reading about a wimpy baby whining and crying and complaining about sh*t all the time, getting a piggy back ride from daddy every chance he gets. It's not only bad adaptation, but also unrealistic; like the Man says, the point of it was to try and get the Boy ready for when the Man would not be around anymore, not to protect him from everything they ran into down the road.Also, the violence and horror pictured in the film was way too toned down. It was so toned down that this, in effect, blew away the agony, fear, and anger the viewers could have felt in the mansion scene when the characters found the people being farmed, the suspense and relief during the escape, and catharsis during the fallout shelter scene.I assume that the Hollywood producers, like always, thought that making the film too long will be bad for business, and pressured the director/editor to cut out a lot of the pertinent scenes, but well, a bad movie's still a bad movie. Maybe I'll change my review when I see the director's cut.I would definitely give the makers credit for the stunning yet realistic apocalyptic cinematography, but that's pretty much about it.

484,miguel_poeira,One of the best post-apocalyptic movies of all time.,9,14 August 2010,"This is not the usual heroic tale of a father and son trying to survive and, meanwhile, ending up saving the world. This is a story of a father and son trying to survive, in a dystopian future, in complete solitude and loneliness. Period.The cause of the apocalypse is never explained of referenced, but I think everybody accepts the post-nuclear war scenario. Seriously, this is not a world I would like to live in . At all. That's what makes a dystopian movie really good to watch.Director John Hillcoat did a great work adapting Cormac McCarthy's homonym book. He captured the dystopian idea of the book very well. The cinematography is one of the best I have seen in this genre of movie.Viggo Mortensen, Charlize Theron, Robert Duvall and an almost unrecognizable Guy Pearce did a very good acting job, as it was expected. But the greatest honor must go to Kodi Smit-McPhee.A great representation of what the world will become in this worst-case scenario. Also, the film explores the best and worst of mankind in this dystopian scenario, the anarchy and chaos that rules the world.The father (Viggo Mortensen) understands that the most important thing is surviving, no matter what. The kid (Kodi Smit-McPhee) does not have this cynical attitude and coldness as his father, instead, he knows that surviving is nothing if we have to break our own moral codes. That's why he says ""no dad"" when his father is about to shoot someone. He represents the clean and friendly conscience of his own father.",The Road

Father and son take to the road in their struggle for survival and face sometimes terrifying brutality. The development of their relationship is heartwarming, with excellent performances by the two lead actors. The cameo performance by Robert Duval as a half blind survivor they meet on the road is a treat.

They travel through the deserted world, mainly looking for food, shelter and protecting themselves from the enemy, cannibals. Basically, in the last decade or so, there has been a spray of ""post-apocalyptic thrillers"" that have corroded and ruined the idea completely. This film not only reinvented this idea, but changed it for future film generations to replicate. The performances from child actors this year were truly eye opening, but Kodi Smit-McPhee stands alone. This is a young person, who through this film, emerges as a man, of serious emotional force. He carries this pictures until the end without a doubt. Viggo is never a disappointment, but here, he replaces what you thought you knew about him and adds a breakthrough in dramatic cinema. Above all however, Robert Duvall has never been more true and more real than any role he has represented in the last 30 years. Even in this short section of the film, he steals the entire picture.

How is it that everyone's teeth turns brown the same exact way and all so evenly?

My expectations were exceeded. The movie stayed true enough to the themes presented within the book, making it a powerful moving picture. The acting is tremendous, the whole cast are convincing and emotive. With beautiful cinematic direction and a well adapted script this film moved me to tears. I am very rarely effected by any film in this way. The last magnificent film I had seen had to have been either No Country for Old Men or perhaps There Will Be Blood.In summary, the themes of a farther's love for his son, family and humanity; where effectively visualised in stark and emotive scenes and cinematography. The film does leave out some of the darker elements of the book, but I did not miss or long for the exclusions. As film is a completely different medium to literature, The Road successfully manages to adapt linguistic pages of rich substance onto the big screen with a haunting, deeply moving result.I feel that I have rambled on long enough. I am going to see this film again soon and I recommend this film to those in search of a powerful cinematic and atmospheric watch. John Hillcoat, Joe Penhall, Viggo Mortensen, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Charlize Theron and everyone who worked on this film should be extremely proud of what they have created and accomplished in regards to the film adaptation of The Road.10/10 Film making at its finest.",The Road

It's frustrating because at odd moments it really clicks and you get a glimpse of how it could have come closer to the novels overwhelming power. My biggest bugbear was the very obvious clear sunlight in a number of scenes. In the book the world is meant to be an ash covered, dark, freezing place with permanent, heavy, grey cloud cover. There aren't meant to be any sunny days in this dead world yet the man and the boy are often are bathed in bright sunlight (this is worst in the scene when the man takes the clothes of the thief - we're meant to feel the thief is going to die of exposure yet he's standing in the sun!). This really punctured the illusion of a destroyed world that in other scenes had been recreated so carefully. The cannibals seemed a bit cartoony (a bit too Mad Max). And there were too many hollywoody genre tics like the POV shots of the Man and the Boy on the beach indicating they're being followed. This story needed a more austere, uncompromising treatment and style of someone like Haneke. To be fair, the film is quite good and the acting strong. It's just that expectations from fans of the book are so high that it needed to be a masterpiece to satisfy. And it isn't.",The Road
491,Walker74,Consistently and effectively dark and brooding,8,1 December 2009,"Walking out of a movie theatre in the middle of the afternoon can be an interesting experience. I can feel distanced from the world, the passive observer of movies out wandering in the light of day. I came out of The Road, a post-apocalyptic tale directed by John Hillcoat and based on Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same name, wondering at the stares of boredom from the workers in the food fare, what it is to fight for a life worth living in our world, the things that must be done to survive. In The Road, a man (Vigo Mortensen) and his son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) journey in search of haven through a bleak, seemingly dead world that has become a desolate and violent wilderness in which survival is reduced to its most basic form: finding food, shelter, warmth, and avoiding those who would take your life in order to ensure their own – by eating you.The question this film posed to me was, what in the end would we choose to preserve of ourselves in order to protect ourselves, what is it that is most valuable to survival. The answer, movingly demonstrated in The Road and which rings true for me, is our humanity – our ability to work together. Without which, each left to our own devices, life becomes despair followed by a lonely, brutal death. Holding on to one's humanity, however, is a complicated matter when there are so few resources and so many risks, survival so tenuous. How, for example, does one distinguish friends from enemies when just to protect someone is so great a burden that it could mean your own death? The man (Mortensen) cannot be simply a good guy; he must abandon some who need his help, and even, in his mind, punish those who risk his life and that of the son he protects.He sacrifices his own humanity to protect his son who in turn the man has taught to be good and in whom that very humanity has been preserved. A kind of bearable survival, if only bearable. Mortensen gives a convincing performance – his character is almost as bleak as the movie itself – and, aside from a few missteps – Robert Duvall's southern hick old man is archetypal and as a result unnatural in a film that relies on naturalism for its intensity – The Road is consistently and effectively dark and brooding.",The Road

Tom Hanks did it in Cast Away, Emile Hirsch did it in Into The Wild, etc., etc. Why was this overlooked? The apparent aim was to put the moviegoer into a realistic post-apocalyptic condition...The gray hues were prevalent, the desperation was there, the bad teeth, but the actors were seemingly enjoying their 3 squares daily between their takes...What gives? When Viggo swims to the ship, that exhausted me even thinking about it, yet a ""starving, dying"" man swam out and back to a ship off shore.

493,hakmi,Lots of hype but fail miserably,2,8 December 2009,"Literally, I begged my friend to see this movie when it came out in theatres. I enjoy movies that have deep thoughts put into them. Movies that bit mysterious and clever. Boy, was I ever disappointed with this one.First, I didn't read the novel. Thus, my review is focused solely on what has been relayed to me in the movie.****** SPOILER ALERT ******** The story is basically, for some reason all living things are dying and thus no food is left on earth. Human resort to cannibalism. A Father and Son travel ""The Road"" to see if they can escape this horror and find hope. The movie is focused on the Father & Son adventure. ****** END SPOILER ALERT *********The directing is poor on so many levels. Seems like the director loves to emphasize ""butt"" scenes. For some reason, the actor has to be completely naked to swim (In the extremely cold weather, mind you!!). The flash-backs are useless, we get no benefit from them but lengthening the movie.The movie doesn't even explain what was the actual disaster that wiped out all biological life on the planet!! (Maybe because the whole idea does not make sense), but my assumption it is the lack of Sun light, but even that sounds absurd.The story gets extremely boring, the acting is clumsy. The movie is not about post-apocalyptic world. Rather, it is about a Father and a Son relationship. Which the film fails miserably at relaying it to the viewer. I felt the boy acting very weak. I could never connect with him as a son. He seemed like 13 yrs old, but acting like 5yrs old. Typically, when things get rough, men rise up and not the opposite. The scenes are there, but they never clicked with me, never felt they are real. Many of the events don't make sense either (swimming in extreme cold, eating/drinking long expired food, animals/insects disappear before human, the wife leaving in the cold dark, why even go to the ocean?).I found so many illogical things in this movie that it made it really difficult to appreciate the story (if there were ever one).

This movie succeeds on many levels. The dark nightmarish mood that pervades all through the novel is brilliantly rendered thanks to great photography, lighting and editing. And what of the acting performance! Mortensen is fabulous in the part of the ailing but struggling father and Kodi Smit-McPhee is perfect in his portrayal of the scared and innocent son. And the scene with Robert Duvall... it's just noteworthy! Although the part of the mother is not essential in the novel, I think it added some drama in the story.

495,pittsillustration,Looking forward to the director's cut- Hollywood chews up another gem.,7,19 December 2009,"After loving the book and respecting everyone involved with the movie every step of the way I have to say I was let down a little by the theatrical cut. That is not a criticism of the movie but rather the overseeing forces that decide what final form a movie takes and when it gets released. The Road was set to release November of 2008, but was delayed so that the company could push 'The Reader' for an Oscar, after early screenings of The Road to often clueless (to the book) audiences were less than stellar. It was being called to grim and bleak by audiences that did not know what to expect, had never read the book, and were used to a Hollywood happy ending. So for the past year, it was edited and reworked. The trailer- which was a horrible 'action-packed' butchering of the film, contains so many scenes not in the film it is almost its own movie. The final theatrical cut of the film itself- as seen on December 18th when the film was finally released to more screens- suffers from obvious editing and rearrangement of scenes. Again this does not fall at the feet of director Hillcoat, but most likely a retooling by the Weinstein company. A major scene involving the cannibalism of a newborn was glaringly omitted from the final cut. It was grim, but one of many gut-punches needed to understand the dire situations of the dying world. In the scene where this was to be discovered, the film sloppily scans and pans before cutting short of showing it,and then jumping to a hastily shot and added scene that is nowhere in the book (woman and child being hunted by cannibal gang)- and then cuts back just as jarringly to our protagonists somehow escaped and sleeping in a church. It is known know that Hillcoat fought for the scene to remain but it was out of his hands by that point. In all, a sad tale is made more sad and bittersweet when you appreciate the direction and the wonderful performances and sacrifices made by the actors and those involved, only to see the final product butchered by the production company in a bid to cater to an audience ill-informed of the book or used to the typical seasonal film. very much worth seeing and given support after a year or more of delay. very much worth blogging and reviewing to get the word out about the great work involved and how it was abused by the production company. let's cross our fingers and hope that the DVD has a cut as it was filmed and intended to be shown by the artists.for now, i have to give the theatrical cut a 7 out of 10. i will be glad to give an unaltered version a 9 out of 10.

I appreciate a good ""life's a struggle"" movie, but again, this wasn't it...The acting was OK, I wouldn't echo ""great"" like others have commented, but then I don't think it would take much to act out this movie... I found the cinematography to be pretty good, there were some very good shots, and the makeup was pretty impressive... but it all added up to a lot of parts without any real glue to hold me to the movie...Better luck next time to the cast and crew... if you had to ask me, I'd say skip this and move on...",The Road
497,alexanderfrees,The Coen Brothers should have directed this movie,5,9 June 2010,"Okay, do me a favor: watch the Coen brothers' terrific 'No Country For Old Men.' Done? Now watch Whoever-The-Hell that did 'The Road.' Maybe even read both books; you'll appreciate my position much better. I'll tell you what both movies have in common: both are adaptations of terrific works by Cormac McCarthy. The difference between the movies? The Coen brothers did a far better job of interpreting the subject matter and extracting McCarthy's essential message, they better isolated the thematic elements in the text, i.e. the ominous, sparse and disconsolate setting in West Texas, the isolated imperative and personal determination of the central characters; even the ambiance, the stillness and the self-aware, self-judgmental atmosphere usually reserved for the modern Western of McCarthy's prose remained intact... That's why it won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2008. I rented 'The Road' a few days ago, in the hope that it would, likewise, recreate as well as a motion picture can the subtle nature of McCarthy's writing. Instead, what I watched was a highlights-version of the major events of the book. Immediately jumping into action, the film focuses on the protective nature of The Man, emphasizing primarily the 'action' scenes in which he protects The Boy, whose plaintive and diminished lines and presence betray the elemental role The Boy plays in the fiction as the Good, the Word of God in McCarthy's own writing, which is cropped and hackneyed from the original text in the narration. The movie emphasizes violence and excitement, using dialogue, it seems, just to 'get there.' It's intimate in all the wrong scenes. There's waaay too much ambient noise (automatic weapon sounds in the distance, as if it were a war zone?), and the almost-biblical dialogue between father and son, the ongoing debate between Good and Ignorance of Evil, is summarized. The soundtrack is useless. The references to the past are clumsy and ineffectual, especially regarding Charlize Theron's role as The Mother: this important, but brief reference in the book is devoted to a quarter of the movie. Viggo does great. The kid does okay. Robert Duvall does well, for a few minutes. But all the acting in the world does nothing for a movie emphasized in telling the story without the subtle art of storytelling. Sorry, Whoever-Directed-This, but you suck. 5/10.",The Road

It was not merely product placement (as was the Del Monte), it was a full-blown ad. The character development was overlooked - making the vacuous characters much more appropriate for advertising. It's as bad as Robert Zemeckis' Cast Away, the film about how dedicated fed-ex staff are. The Road otherwise is quite unoriginal in the use of characters, such as the mysterious blind man (who traditionally appears in all of these disaster scenarios), and the wife (remembered through dreams) who is seen always shrouded in blissful times before the unmentioned disaster.

499,ashkarbel,"Slow, boring, and depressing",1,17 January 2010,"Unfortunately, I found this one of the worst films I have ever seen. I have no complaints about the making of the movie; in fact it was technically very well made, and the acting was very good. However, the film was very slow, very depressing, and watching it I was waiting through the movie for something to happen and make it interesting, and nothing happens.The film is set in the future where all plant and animal life has died, and only a handful of people are left alive. It is left to your imagination to figure out how this has happened, which is good when it is something you can interpret in many ways. But here it just does not make sense and needs an explanation. How can all plant and animal life die yet people are still alive, I would love a feasible explanation.But what annoyed me most about this film, is that I don't understand its purpose. Most movies are made to entertain you for a couple of hours, and this is certainly not this type of movie. So it should go into the category of a film that makes you think or teaches you something. I am pretty sure I did not learn anything, and it did not leaving me thinking either. All it did was depress me.So to conclude when I go to the cinema, I generally expect to be somehow entertained. The last movie I watched before this was Avatar, where I was both entertained and had an emotional journey, and as I left the theater I felt great. Here I left the cinema feeling terrible. So for anyone who wants to go to the cinema to be entertained I would not recommend this movie. I on the other hand you watch movies purely for how its made, and for the acting, then this might be a movie for you.",The Road

Indeed the film is very humourless, starring Viggo Mortenson of LOTR and History of Violence fame. He and his son try to make their way to the coast, trying to survive on meagre amounts of food and trying to avoid the cannibals that now roam America. The story is rather bare-bones, but the duo's journey is tense, depressing and touching all at the same time. Their encounters with the cannibals are especially intense. The film is also one of the most touching and saddest films I have seen in quite a while, and the dreary landscapes are a sight to behold.

Well first of all those 2 people would have died in about a week having been killed and eaten as one of the first because they are simply pathetic. If they had taken a glance at ""survival for dummies"" they would have LONG AGO realized they were being utter crap at it. Let me put it more clearly for those that are so simple minded as to give a movie as this a good rating.1. It's a sad movie. Yes... thats about it. You don't know how the world got this way, you have no idea why they are heading to the coast and south but what the hell perhaps something will happen during their travels and it might be exciting.2. There is no other way than saying the 2 main characters are RETARDS. They're running around with a revolver with 2 bullets but aren't in any way looking for any other weapon. They're not making a bow, they're not finding another weapon. Hell you don't even see the guy with a knife. And I'd understand this if he was traveling around Europe where guns aren't exactly common. But he's traveling in the US, and no offense but there's more guns than there is people in the US so I'm pretty sure he'd be able to find some more than just a crappy revolver (which he doesn't even clean, so it's a miracle it's still working) and 2 bullets.3. WHAT THE HELL IS HIS SON DOING?!?!?!?!?!?!?! He's crying about every little thing they encounter. Whether he takes a dump or just taking a deep breath, there will be a squeal escaping the little annoying bastard's mouth. If there was any form of realism the little boy would have LONG AGO learned to STFU and be tough. Instead he's a pathetic little softy that cries whenever he doesn't get pancakes in the morning. He even mentions at some point that he's hungry... yes well I'm sorry but the little tard has been hungry probably during the entire duration that he grew up and has been traveling. So nothing special there now is there? He'd long ago would have learned to shut up about it.The simple truth is that you must be incredibly brainless to even think this in any way represents a glimpse of how 2 people during some apocalypse of the world would be living and looking.

Most of the things I wanted to write have already been written by other users who also liked this film (and when I say liked I do not mean enjoyed cause this could never be an enjoyable movie). There is just one thing I would like to point out. The father, Vigo, was always so suspicious towards other people. He invariably thought that other people he ran into only wanted to hurt him or his son. And I agree with him since under those conditions you could hardly trust somebody. But the kid saw the good in people, call it naive or childishly innocent, I don't know. He had faith that there were still nice people like themselves and in the end he found new companions who belonged also to the ""good ones"". He could not be sure but he risked it and it was worth it. The same happened with the old man. The father was very reluctant towards him, but his son helped him see that there were more good people left, that they were not the only ones and then we realise that the father truly needed a talk with somebody, apart from his son and the old man was the one for this. And apparently, faith in others, the ability to trust others under those circumstances, is the only hope in this whole hopelessness and the only thing that could keep people together, united to start over again. 9/10",The Road

The two main characters really make the audience feel and root for them which is honestly the basis of a great film. I think this is a great movie but you have to really enjoy post apocalyptic novels/films. If that is not something you enjoy, you will think this is the same old Hollywood movie.

513,dumas777,A long boring slog with no story to be found,2,15 August 2010,If you are expecting a story as riveting as No Country for Old Men skip this movie and wait for a future McCarthy (hopefully better) screen adaptation. I will admit the acting by the two main characters was very good. It does not make up for the depressing (in a very bad way) story and setting. Kind of sad the setting others are raving so much about is basically stolen directly from the video game Fallout 3 with an even weaker plot than the game (granted one the best video games ever but still). The world and people are so ghost like and ambiguous that by the end of the movie I was thinking this reminds me of the Thin Red Line with too much focus on the photography of the scenery and not enough focus on an actual story or a background to the story or even enough characters to make it seem like a story (only the main two characters get more than about 5 minutes of screen time). The movie also lasts at least 30 min too long (slogging through wasteland with nothing happening is not the way to add to the running time). In addition the ending is very weak and feels tacked on by studio executives worried about focus groups and some kind of lame happy ending no matter how unbelievable. This movie would have been decent had it been made into a short about 15 min long where the director shows how terrible the world is and then shows a truly merciful dad who puts his son out of his misery with a bullet to the brain instead of cursing him with having to suffer horribly for the rest of his life in an inhabitable wasteland.,The Road

It's a deep thought of what would became out of people, if there was no food for everyone, or, to put it this way, if food stocks were limited and no new food would be produced. Normal people would turn into animals (it's similar with people, who are given a complete control over somebodys life - watch Das Experiment (2001) ), they would start practising cannibalism, slaughtering innocent victims - we can see some bloodlust stuff in film, that's for sure. And then there is fathers care for his son, everything beautifully acted, but generally speaking, that's it. OK, plot shows us some ups and downs in life of protagonists, their emotions about it etc., but to put everything together, it's not enough to fill 111 minutes of movie lenght.

But the thing is the tension throughout the movie is quite high although you sometimes get sick of the conversations and want to forward the movie for a while. I remembered some scenes from the movie ""The Book of Eli"" because I rarely watch post-apocalyptic movies, and that ""The Book of Eli"" was the previous one I watched. Not suggested to the ones who already watched two or more post-apocalyptic movies. Not surprisingly the father tries hard to keep his son from danger. But come on apocalypse has already started and every human-being has turned into a cannibal as expected. In my opinion, the little son was very successful at wandering under his daddy's feet. That is one of the most awful situation in these post-apocalyptic movies. Some guy has to take care of some other guys. Most probably those requiring help are lad or daughter. The idea to save your child's life is truly instinctive but as the viewers we also see the idea to sacrifice or take some lives to survive. I guess, it wouldn't be blamed to leave some of your fellas behind if you attempt to survive in the post-apocalyptic era. Lastly and sadly, this movie doesn't offer you anything new.

518,stefankienzle,Possibly will be one of my favorites ever,10,21 January 2011,"This is one of those movies I have total fan boyish love for. I loved the book, and I loved this movie.It tells the story of an unnamed man (Viggo Mortenson) and his son (Kody Smit-McPhee) journeying across post apocalyptic America in a quest to reach the coast. Nothing grows. It's freezing, the only food they find is food that has been preserved,the environment is completely hostile to life. And to top it off, most anyone left has resorted to cannibalism in order to survive.This movie manages to be both inspiring and heartbreaking at the same time. It's inspiring to watch the man not bat an eyelash at the prospect of bringing up a child in this dead version of the world, yet it's heartbreaking to watch him lose faith in the world as everything he's ever loved dies.Same with the boy, who was born into the world. It's heartbreaking to think he would've been born into these circumstances, yet, we see that he has a sense of compassion that somehow transcends all this oppression and his innocence allows him to see want to help those he feels needs it.The movie gets pretty disturbing at times. The portrayal of the cannibals in this film may easily go down as one of the most harrowing roles ever, even if brief. You don't necessarily feel that the cannibals are evil, they're just doing the same thing the man and the boy are: surviving by whatever means they can. In a way, that's the saddest part of this movie.Another disturbing quality is how suicide is constantly hinted at in this movie. In one of the opening scenes, we see a barn full of people who committed suicide to avoid capture by the cannibals, and right after that, the man goes to instruct the boy how to properly shoot himself in the head in captured to avoid torture.Robert Duvall and Charlize Theron give some pretty stunning performances here, but their pretty much overshadowed by Mortenson's and Smit-McPhee, who embody the duo perfectly from the book. Also, the visuals in this movie are spectacular.I think this movie should have received so much more attention upon its release. It was overshadowed by THAT other movie with the over sized smurfs, but in my opinion it was better. Even visually. (Avatar looked like a rave meets a f*cking greenhouse.)

519,nitzien123,What a brilliant movie!,10,4 July 2011,"Gripping from the very beginning, this movie for me, touches upon the very concept of being a parent and what comes with that responsibility. It explores the very purpose of human life and the will to live another day. I have myself many a time thought of a similar story-line where people have to pit hope and human spirit against utterly despairing situations - so I can relate to it very closely. Just put yourself in the man's shoes and you might know.I thought the movie was superbly shot. The ambiance of the movie remains grim throughout - in line with the theme. The locations, the screenplay, the direction and the cinematography looked so well integrated. Also the background score - subtle and never stood out as it should never do.Viggo, my goodness. What a fine actor of our times! The desperation and determination in his eyes to protect his son at all times braving all odds - it's just there to be seen and experienced. I don't think his performance as the man could have been bettered. Even though the others (as actors) didn't have much to do, they all did just fine.From a philosophical point of view, personally, I thought the man could have coached the boy a little more deeply. He says he wants to prepare him, but the boy didn't change much through the movie. Surely the man is knowledgeable, very sensitive - so bringing that in would have also strengthened the spine of the story-line a bit more - bringing in the spiritual coaching a parent does to his offspring. I would have liked to say more to support what the man could have done; but since it is a personal point of view and it might necessitate me to give away key details on the climax, I would better just leave it there.

I am a father and I want to believe in a bright ""sun-shiney"" future for my kids and grandkids and great, great, great grandkids for that matter. Cormac McCarthy is a depressing guy. I imagine that if i spent much time with him I would be convinced that suicide was the only decent option for humanity. The depictions in this movie of our post apocalyptic future are so bleak and horrifying that it made me go from a fence straddling agnostic to wanting desperately to believe in God. The sad part is, as far as this movie goes, that wouldn't do me much good. So, after watching and being frightened by this movie, I feel as if there is no solace to be had. My only hope is to die early should such events take place as do in this story. It makes me feel like I need to find a happy place and scared when the sun doesn't shine. If asked, my recommendation would be to not watch this movie. It's a depressing movie written by a depressed, pessimistic, high and mighty, judgmental man who doesn't like humanity and wants to punish us for our being human.

I'm not talking about the photography because the dark and bleak and gray background definitely matched the intention. And I'm not talking about the subject matter since obviously such an apocalyptic event would be dark and dreary. No, I'm talking about the inaneness of the dialog.

Definitely in the minority or it would have grossed a lot more. Unless you are like me, watching bad movies to appreciate good movies, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. Terrible dialog, the kid is an idiot (read MissNobody's review--it is spot on), and the execution of the concept stinks. I think they should have left this as a book only.",The Road

There is gore and blood, but not to make the movie look cool for theaters. It seems realistic, such as when he pulls out the arrow he was shot with. Both my parents are nurses. The did an awesome job on almost everything. One thing I thought was a little off was the Man had a single revolver, and must of not had many bullets. They give you the vibe he was prepared for the disaster, and yet he only had that to defend himself with. It was also a bonus it was based on a novel, that'll give me something to read.

They said they had been following the Man and the Boy... hmmmmmmmm. I knew something was weird when I noticed that the Thief, the Veteran, and the Motherly Woman all have their thumbs cut off.The dog was the really scary part - in that world, dogs could only be for hunting otherwise they'd have been eaten long ago...Maybe I'm just paranoid, but all these little clues made it into the most serious horror movie I've seen in a very long time.

This movie is not like a family/mad max type movie as the trailer would lead you to believe. Any action in the movie is in the trailer. I don't mind movies that are fairly slow and devoid of action, but this movie is very slow paced except for a few spots. It makes the movie drag on. Charlez Theron's character is disappointing. She's not in the movie like you think she is and her state of mind is a cross between disappointing to not believable.

Terrible characters and terrible storyline which displayed no common sense if anyone was realistically put in this situation and somehow survived.Don't be sucked in by a summary of the plot - there is none!

But man, it was so depressing I ended up fast forwarding the movie just so i'll see what happens in the end without suffering through it. Some scenes are nothing less than a horror movie, only very real (no monsters here, ""hell is other people"" indeed). One scene is especially cruel and terrifying, like a holocaust movie together with Hannibal.

But I also had a feeling that this might have been a hallucination or imagination that the kid has had in his last minutes of his life? He has suddenly found a new mum and dad -whom have accepted him without even thinking twice- and also some siblings and even a dog which seems like a perfect dream. Maybe in fact he decided to commit suicide after his dad died or was found by some cannibals, and his mind produced just such a perfect imagination to escape from reality in his last moments while he was dying.

Also what i love about this movie is that its probably the most realistic recreaction of how the world will look like if some kind of catastrophic event will happen on earth,people try to eat each other as a source of food,mass suicide, bandits every were trying to take your stuff and people are not trustworthy anymore making the fight for survive very hard especially when you have an young child with you.

It was interesting how you do not wonder how their world ended up that way, what the catalyst was, the story is so engaging. A very stripped down, true story-telling plot. The big stars in small roles truly showed their acting skills. Robert Duvall is barely recognizable, and you don't think about him, you think of the character while you watch him. Id they had cast a different boy or directed him not to be such a high-pitched whining brat I would have enjoyed it more. He makes his character hard to believe that he's been on the road trying to survive with his dad. Listening to this kid was torture by the first 30 minutes, I would rather sit next to a buzz-saw than listen to this kid.",The Road
532,keirabeera,"AMAZING, not what I expected will stay with you in your mind",7,6 June 2012,"When I began watching this I assumed that it was another post- apocalyptic tale where a parent and child are battling against the end of the world with many near death experiences etc... Well I was not wrong! The Road directed by John Hillcoat is an incredibly well made film based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, It follows the life of two characters 'Man' and 'Boy' who to me represent the population of human race and I believe their journey just shows the hope and battle we go through as humans. Throughout the film there isn't much dialog but the lack of words is made up by all the beautiful shots of scenery that presents us as the audience how the world would appear when it is so empty. The man in the story looks after himself and his boy through the pain of the dying world when Man probably knows that there isn't much hope. During their journey they search for food and water and places to hide for the evil gangs of Cannibals that will make your your hairs stand on end. My favorite part of the film is when Man and Boy are by a waterfall and there is a rainbow, I think this symbolizes the hope they have and also with everything else seeming so Grey and dreary the splash of color really contrasts. Overall this film is incredible made me cry, laugh and even scream at the telly and made me really appreciate the life I have.",The Road
533,ssskalor,It is only focused on pulling your heart strings,4,22 March 2013,"The Road is wonderfully shot and staged, it really is a piece of art. Where I feel the film lacks however it logic and realism, so much so that the emotional cues quickly stopped effecting me due to the characters behavior.The young boy has spent his entire life in this chaotic, harsh, ugly apocalyptic world yet somehow has turned out to be as soft as a grape. I wonder if the movie is trying to claim that children are all pure and loving but sadly I don't think this is true, just look at children brought up in a dog eat dog society today. The boy's behavior doesn't particularly improve throughout the film either, his very brief conversations never show he is learning his fathers reasons (such as why they shouldn't kill themselves, why you can't give your food away to everyone, why they need to go south). The father is played brilliantly but I also have issues with his script. Firstly it was unbearably annoying how little he told his son about the world. Even when they finally found food in the bunker and should have energy to talk, we don't see the father explain the 'world' he is from or really comment on anything. We're only really treated to repetitive conversations they love each other, want to die together which are meant to pull at our emotions (which I'm sure it does for most viewers) but only grew tiresome for me as I felt I wanted to know more about the characters and who they were.The grounding of the story and characters comes from the flashbacks of the father at home with his wife before the boy was born. Here the reason for the apocalypse is purposefully vague as the emotional aspect of the film is meant to be the focus of your attention. The wife doesn't agree with her husbands desire to survive and fight to the end of their time in this apocalyptic world, so eventually she's had enough and rather than saying goodbye to husband or even that she loves him, she decides to quite abruptly storm out into the blizzard and essentially chose to die a painfully long cold death? Really didn't understand why she did that.I will say many of the more 'actiony' scenes were quite thrilling when they encounter the gang of cannibals on several occasions.To conclude I feel the main problem with the film is that it relies completely on trying to pull your heart strings. Upto the point of becoming obvious and annoying, partially due to lack of details about the characters/world and partially due to the characters not developing. Perhaps a good movie comparison would be 127 hours in terms of the emotional heartbreak the viewer will experience. Except this movie is far more successful in my eyes as it has a deep background and character development.PS: Watch The Road if you want to feel depressed. The positive ending felt very tacked on, almost like you could imagine the script writers saying ""Oh man this whole thing is so depressing, OK lets put a happy bit right at the end to try please everyone"". I know this is based off a book so I could be wrong on that.",The Road

I fail to believe that a kid raised in that type of world would be such a moron. Most kids raised in a tough environment are tough kids. That characterization, being half of the story, really let the film down. And who in North America calls their dad Papa? With no other kids around how did he come to call his dad Papa? That just sounded completely out of place and made the kid look even more ridiculous.I also fail to believe that everyone else on the planet would turn into cannibals.

The standard of acting is brilliant but the lack of a meaningful plot renders much of this pointless. WARNING- Spoilers Viggo's character is a somewhat tortured soul after his wife's suicide and the constant battle for survival. He has lost the ability to trust and attempts to pass this on to his son. ENDING-SPOILER However, at the end, his son ultimately trusts a stranger who takes him into another family. This ending shows us that the world still has hope, alongside the possibility for life to continue as is evident with the finding of a wild beetle, something which could not survive in the north. The power of this ending is reduced as Viggo's character does not witness the error of his ways. This is still a film i would recommend but the failing plot of the film makes me hesitant to rate the film higher than a 6. McCarthy's world is beautiful and his characters are well written and Hillcoat's execution of scenes leave a well put together film which has you on the edge of your seat from start to finish with a good taste in your mouth at the end.",The Road

I don't really review movies much anymore but I feel like I need to here. This is such a well done film and at times I can compare it to castaway.

Seems longer ago that it came out, but, 2009 is 5 years ago! A very harsh and dark movie. Mortensen is solid, of course, and the boy gives off a nice dose of hopeful desperation. I see a few spots in this movie where a couple light-hearted musical numbers would spruce things up a bit. Kidding! For being post-apocalyptical, which in 2014 is almost every movie, it is nice to have a break from the heavy CGI. The production team did a great job of portraying a ruined America. I assume it wasn't hard to find unfinished subdivisions in the wake of the economic downturn in 2008 when this was likely filmed, but the cinematography adds layers of erosion to the landscape.

542,boiledcandyfrog,Immensely stupid/irritating characters,3,16 December 2013,"The one upside of this film was that it portrayed the bleak post apocalyptic world very well. It was very depressing. On the other hand the characters did not fit in this film at all. If you travel to third world countries where life is tough, not quite on the scale as seen in the film, the people tend to be quite vibrant and tough themselves, especially the children. I have encountered street kids in Africa, Thailand, Botswana etc and they were all very cocky, mature and mischievous for their age due to their hard life and robust upbringing. By the end of the film I disliked all the characters. The kid was soft, pasty, whiny and annoying and came across more like an over privileged brat than the expected tough street kid you would have expected him to have become considering the circumstances. The father after he decided to leave the bomb shelter full of food and warm beds immediately looked like a complete moron hell bent on their own destruction. The mother came across as a hyper selfish, self absorbed woman interested only in her own pain and suffering and this reached a peak when she sulkily sloped out of their shelter to die alone in the wilderness leaving her son and husband behind. To be completely honest, by the end of the film I was desperately rooting for a street vandal/cannibal to put an end to the father and son's misery. And mine. Terrible character development. I had no respect for any of these characters whatsoever. Very mediocre film.",The Road
543,Rainbowish-unicorn,This film shows how lucky we all are,10,31 January 2014,"In my opinions there's no spoilers here but IMDb disagrees. I mean, you've heard this film is set in a post-apocalyptic world where there's occasional cannibalism, right. Well, I'm no expert at writing reviews and I don't mean to talk about how 'developed' characters are or how they 'deliver' or how refined the scenery is. I'm just telling what this film did to me. :) What matters most in my opinion is, what the film can give you. Either laughs, if it is a comedy, or something else, if it isn't.I cried after watching it like I've never cried at a film before. I was horribly sad and hurt as I realised it was the cannibals that were more terrible than pain, sickness, hunger and death altogether. Hhumans being inhumane. That thought scared me and hurt me like nothing else ever had. I realised it is an enormous privilege that I have never been in a situation where death would seem like luxury and where I'd be forced to choose between my life and somebody else's life. You know, we should all be so grateful, grateful for the crap life keeps throwing at us, grateful for all the pain and loneliness, grateful for every bad day, for having to learn maths, for having our hearts broken we should be so grateful that we live in this world, that we don't need to be violent to survive, that we have food on the table and people who love us, be that parents, friends, anybody. Whatever faults this world has, it is perfect compared to the world presented in The Road. So basically, this film is a cure for self-pitying and whining. We have it good, better than we even know. There's horrible things happening on this Earth we live on, we just don't see it much and aren't aware of it. Maybe there's not much one can really do to help but there's one thing everybody can do to make this world a better place.

While I am not a action-adventure junkie, I really found myself crying out for a bit more action, if only just to punctuate the monotony. Another question I couldn't get out of my head (regarding both films) is how absurdly obsessive the US film industry is with guns, as if no story can be told without including them. Although it was made a plot point that these guys only had two bullets, I really can't get my head round this: it's the end of the world, there is virtually no life left on earth, no food, no fuel, no electricity, no working machinery.

I thought that it might another bleak, teen angst, post apocalypse movie like the ones in theaters today. I was wrong the movie is an amazing portrayal of the human condition.Basically the plot is a father and a son are heading south through destroyed America. The doomsday event is never explained but that really is the point of the movie. The movie is long and the father and son wander throughout America pointlessly. But whatever the plot lacks the characters and the world make up for it. You really can connect to the characters and the movie's portrayal of dystopian America is amazing.A lot of people complain about how boring the film is. Honestly, if you want to see an uplifting film or a mindless action film this is not for you. This movie raises moral questions and has a lot of spiritual and religious allegories. It is a depiction of the raw and gritty side of humanity. Though it does capture happiness sadness and many other emotions.I think the reason a lot of people don't like this film is because it is a more ""realistic"" depiction of the post apocalypse. It is not a movie with a lot of romance like the Hunger Games or Divergent. It is a story about endurance, the role of a father, and morality.

Never in my life I've seen people praising so hard the visuals while neglecting the characters. It's like society preys on watching desperation and lack of luxury items. Somehow it makes them feel human, however this is the real deception because people notice the lack of luxury in other lives, but they skip the lack of character, this is a really good hint on how mad most of us are.And now to the movie: Never in my life I've seen such under developed characters. A children born in a apocalyptic world without any sense of danger, any sense that he could be brutalized the next minute.Somehow all he wants to do is be a good kid, be one of the ""good guys"" without no apparent reason for it. Nothing could be more far from the reality, and a simple look on the behavior of any 3rd world country kids would show how bad this character was developed. Did I forgot to mention that his relation with his father is one of the main keys in the movie? Yes I did forgot to tell you that, and yet, the character is so poor. Lazy scripting, that's what I'd call it.Yet, reviewers and people in general fail to acknowledge this (and then proceed to say how materialistic society is.. duh!).But don't take my word for it, go and watch it, just be ready to waste 2 hours.",The Road
548,andrius-semas,"Movie Review. The road movie, inviting the trip",10,2 August 2014,"The film's title - road trip - one of the oldest archetypal imagery, known since Adam and Eve's expulsion from Eden story. Many of its present value, and one of the film's actors - experiencing a crisis of Irish writer Jack. Traveling can be dreamed (son of Daniel Thomas) in need (the main character of the United States is going to France to bring back the remains of the son), spontaneous, as if from internal demand (Thomas pilgrimage route). The film tries to figure out why people are venturing to testing: to the question they are trying to answer for themselves, and about the writer Jack. For the religious, cultural, sports, health reasons, want to quit smoking, lose at least a couple of pounds of weight, waiting for a miracle ... And what you want Tom? Spontaneous its determination - St. Jacob's son on the road scattered the ashes.Very nicely reveals the father and son relationship. Action impetus - the news of the death of the son, then the father is going through a retrospective son's departure, shows the gap, alienation father son does accept it for what it is. Daniel called his father and wanted it to be a father and son's journey. Father then he seemed to be as many people can not afford such a luxury - to drop everything and go.Paradoxically, it then did. Daniel started to trip, the father continued, completed both metaphorically. So the captain was right: Tom went for him, to be reconciled with his son, to understand it, it's a gentler, more human, more directly learn to interact with others, to discover the difference between the life you have chosen, and the life that you really need to live ...I had read that the Emilia Estevez create this movie persuaded his father Martin rail (Martin Sheen) from Galicia (Spain) comes an American actor. He played in the movie and the main pilgrimage performing the role of Tom. So this film not only depicts, but also play a father and son. The film is still a father and son's parallel: Gypsy Ishmael and his sons steal. ""Our children - they are the best and the worst of what is within us"" - Gypsy laments and despite Tom's protests, tells his son to carry his backpack to the city limits. Maybe this is a beautiful metaphor alludes to Christ carrying the cross ... Tom, though not understanding why, I asked Ishmael's advice to travel further through Galicia to the sea and scattered the ashes son there.At the end of the film we see the four main characters, divested of his phobias, his heart med, learning a better understanding of the other, to see not only their trouble. And it does not matter, that failed to stop or attenuate the įtilptum his old suit ... The main thing is that they are looking for answers to their questions and concerns of life found ... Father implemented son's dream to travel his ashes along the way. Their spiritual suffered a clearing and other fellow Thomas. Each of them can tell the story alone biographical details of individual fragments of the film - the director of the characters life stories wafer slowly, like a mosaic.In the film a number of meaningful detail. For example, Tom is determined to go on the Camino, turn in the opposite direction. I think this highlights the fact that it was quite different than his son, because of their different life paths. In order to actually implement the ""father and son journey, he has to change. The metamorphosis of the actor in Martin able to perfectly convey: from a closed, hostile to other human Tomas gradually turns into a friendly, though takes a fraction of the goodness of the Dutchman has heaped Jostens to realize that life is too short for it to pass that one ... the other eloquent detail revealing four fellow convergence, emergence of individual pilgrims friends - witty picture when we see a woman looking to the road, and the three men backs ... Beautifully staged scene, as if the road saga, where spiritual things are mixed with the mundane.The film began a retrospective view of father remembers son. Towards the finale, the viewer thoughts begin to return to the beginning. Only then can understand what meanings have been present, it seems non-significant words. And regretted that when everyone in the world has a cell, his only son does not recognize. This bold does not understand why his father's son: they are the opposite. Father weather eye doctor, honorary member of the golf club seems to know everything about the world, and thus of life, which clear rules.Know nothing at all about the way the pilgrims to Santiago Compostela (Spain), while seen a feature film ""The Way"" (The Way). Even if you are an avid traveler, you will feel a trip cry. My soul is already on this path. Even if it will not materialize, will be experienced at least a part of this journey of spiritual experience.

549,GrindlayWeinberger,Brilliant adaptation,8,7 February 2010,"I wasn't expecting this film to capture the book's bleak, despairing narrative, but it succeeded and in some respects, perhaps exceeded it. I was impressed with the additional ""flash-back"" scenes that emphasise the emptiness felt by the Man and Boy over the loss of their mother. The Boy, who has never known anything other than desolation, is played brilliantly, and his conflicting emotions over his Father's survival tactics (including murder) are almost too painful to bear witness to. As in the book, just when your heart has been ripped out by the scene where the Boy's father dies, you are lifted up again in the final scene. An incredible emotional journey that illustrates why you don't need fast action, gore or graphic depiction of apocalyptic events to make a gripping film.",The Road
550,shannon-briggs1,A very emotion story that has stuck with me for years.,10,21 January 2015,"This movie has stuck with me since the first time I saw it in 2009 when I was only 12 years old. I thought about it for weeks afterwards, I kept wanting to see and know more and more as I was (and still am) emotionally attached to the characters. The raw emotion that this film displays can leave you emotionally drained by the end of it. I'm just an average person and I don't really have the capability to judge acting but I could see how phenomenal the acting is. The scenery is amazing and really gives you a good idea of how dreary and barren the world is. There's not a whole lot of words exchanged between the boy and his father... You never really see them having long in depth conversations, you never hear a word about what caused the world to become the way it is...I don't really know what else to say because I can't really explain the experience I had when I watched it, it's something that should be experienced first hand. This movie is what I would call a masterpiece, I just wish the movie was longer because the moment it ended... I was left wanting more.",The Road

552,thomaserving,Master Piece,10,8 July 2016,"I am huge on post apocalyptic everything and no movie comes close to way this movie made me feel. Most apocalyptic films give you some glimmer of hope throughout the movie that everything is going to be all right but this movie strips away any chance of finding that. I actually ended up crying so hard at the end of this movie that i cursed the people that made it and swore i would never watch it again. To me that is not a bad thing but in a sense something of a holy grail that it made me feel that way. I hold this movie closer to my heart than any other movie I've ever seen alive, it is something so good that i want to forget so when I'm lying on my death bed i want this to take me to paradise. If you haven't seen this movie yet and you consider you're self an post-apocalyptic fan then forget everything you know about zombies, forget everything you know about viral diseases. FORGET EVERYTHING, because this prepares you for something much more worth taking in.",The Road

554,ethandbowes,What would you do? When the time comes?,8,29 November 2017,"The Road is one of those movies that to me stay true to the post apocalyptic genre of media. If a film is set in this genre and then put onto the big screen, it's usually portrayed as over the top violence, raider fights with huge mutated freaks and monsters. The Road is very different to what a lot of people expect an apocalyptic film to be. This film is based on the 2006 novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy, which tells the tale of a father and son's journey across the state to find true shelter after the mother of the family is gone. The movie itself is centred on their relationship and their ability to survive the harshness of the wasteland in which they inhabit. The film opens up with the main character, Man (Viggo Mortensen) rising from his bed and seeing a sepia orange tint coming from the windows. His wife (Charlize Theron) is in a frantic state as she hears out to the sounds of people screaming to get to safety and then cuts to the man waking up in the new world. Not much is told about how the apocalypse came to be, other than there were series of bright flashes and lights and small concussions of energy. The wilderness perished and the landscape has completely gone. Maybe this all happened through man's use of nuclear energy, or simply the wrath of God? The whole film is dimly lit and everything the Boy and Man encounter is always dusty and dark and the only light in the film comes from the cannibals that they come across during their journey. The film is very well structured in the events leading up to the boy's birth for example as the film cuts from the present to the past and so on it gets more into detail of his birth but also showing little glimpses of the life that the man and woman both had before and after the event happened and I think it's great how that is done because it makes the viewers try to work out what could've happened that left the world in the state that it's in now. The acting is raw and the actors all deliver it so well. It makes you empathise all the way through as you just want them to have happy endings and have nothing but a quick and safe trip but it's not the case. You can feel the emotion in Mortensen's expressions as he worries constantly about the boy's safety. The boy (Kodi Smit- McPhee) knows about his condition and he knows the new life he now lives. The two characters relationship is heartbreaking and so upsetting due to how much they care for one another as they travel and that the father wants nothing but to protect the boy. He questions the viewers what they would do in his shoes when the time comes that he's in such a situation that he has to take his or his son's lives because of the new world that they inhabit. I recommend The Road to all apocalypse genre fans that want something raw and true to the form where it's not over the top action, silly characters and science fiction riddled storytelling. It's emotional, it's thought provoking and it's a well done adaptation to the novel.",The Road

557,isabellastclair,Amazing Movie,10,10 May 2018,"John Hillcoat, with the help of his producer Joe Penhall, has executed a very well crafted depiction of the post apocalyptic world as told in the 2009 film The Road which was based on the novel, The Road written by Cormac McCarthy, published in 2007. The father, played by Viggo Mortenson, started off in this post apocalyptic world with the help of his wife, played by Charlize Theron who later birthed their son, played by Kodi Smit-McPhee, in the dark of the ashes. While his wife could no longer continue, the man and the boy carried on throughout the depths of the dark world on the road which would lead them to somewhere that only they would be able to discover. Together they faced not only the bad, but the good as well. 
 The creators will take you on a wild ride of emotions as you read the book and watch the movie. The book was good, but the movie was even better. The costumes and makeup truly made the movie. While reading the book, it is hard to tell what they look like as the descriptions aren't as good as the real life thing. The makeup and outfits were absolutely disgusting, in the best way possible. From the father covered in dirt and torn clothing just like the son. The son also wore a wool hat for the entire film that his mom had worn before she left. If they hadn't looked the way they did, it would just look like a rainy day walk. 
 Had John Hillcoat not executed his use of lighting and color, there would be a struggle to decipher what parts of the film are flashback and what parts are current times. He made it so that if it was in the past, the film was seen in color, but if it was during the post apocalyptic time, it was strictly in black and white. Using this technique also helped highlight the man's flashbacks to the simple times with his wife before the apocalypse as written in the book. 
 To any future watchers of The Road, I would highly recommend watching this movie, as it has totally shown me what a well made movie looks like. From the costumes to the tone of lighting, I have greatly appreciated the production of this movie.",The Road
558,aidanhall-73991,Film Review,7,15 May 2018,"The Road, a CinEuphoria Awards best cinematography winner, is about a man and his son who struggle to survive in a post apocalyptic setting. They run into many challenges including getting over the loss of the mother, finding food, and finding the mental strength to do what is necessary in order to survive, most importantly the mental strength to kill someone. At the end of the story the son if faced with the decision to go with another family, which he questions because his father said not to trust anyone, and he had the other option to stay on the beach with his father. Unique elements to this film include the different cinematic techniques used by the filmmaker. This includes the dark and sad colors present in the film as well as the filmmakers strategic angles to show the destroyed world. Personally the film was entertaining but probably not something I would watch again. It is not one of those movies you can watch over and over again. I also like movies with more happier moments, but there were not that many in this film, mostly bad things that would happen. I suggest for the viewer to read the book first so they can develop their own thought on what the characters look like then get the surprise of what they actually look like. The book does a good job describing the characters but I think when reading a book before watching a film the way you perceive the characters is always a little different then how they actually look. Personally I would recommend this film to anyone who likes post apocalyptic movie settings, thrilling moments, and emotional moments, some positive but mostly negative.",The Road
559,nicholasrouthier,The Road film review,7,15 May 2018,"The Road 2009, the director John Hillcoat, screenplay Joe Penhall, and costume design Margot Wilson. This movie was from the book The Road written by Cormac McCarthy and won the Pulitzer prize for fiction in 2007 when the book was published. Viggo Mortensen who played the man was the main character in the film. Mortensen also took a part in the Lord of the Rings in 1999. 
 America is very gray after a catastrophe. A man and his young son wander through this post-apocalyptic world, trying to keep the dream of civilization alive. They journey toward the sea, surviving as best they can on what they can scavenge, and try to avoid roving gangs of savage humans who will turn them into slaves, or worse. I didn't notice any significant differences from the book to the film. Everything seemed to be how it was portrayed in the book. 
 The filmmaker uses cinematic techniques very effectively. The lighting that the filmmaker used was effective because during the flashbacks it was nice and sunny but when it came back to the setting of the film everything was dark, gray and gloomy. The filmmaker also has a good use of costumes to make the actors look like they are very dirty and are in very poor conditions. I feel like this was a good film because it followed the movie very well and also provided great imagery and setting along with the book. 
 I only recommend this film if you read the book. The only reason that I only recommend it if you read the book is because the film is pretty slow and gray so it gets tiring and boring after a while of watching it and if you haven't read the book you will probably get bored of it. If you read the book though you will want to watch the movie to see the ways that the scenes are presented in the movie opposed to what you were intrepatating in the book.",The Road
560,mikaeladorsey,The Road,8,15 May 2018,"The Road directed by John Hillcoat was released in 2009, produced by Paula Mae Schwartz and Steve Schwartz, and written by Joe Penhall. Based on the novel The Road by Cormac McCarthy, which won the 2007 Pulitzer award, as well as many other nominations and awards. McCarthy has had various other books adapted into movies including Child of God and The Sunset Limited. The leading roles played by Viggo Mortensen, who played the man and Kodi Smit McPhee, playing the role of the boy. Mortensen who had leading roles in the Lord of the Rings series, also acting in Crimson Tide, A Dangerous Method and 45+ other films, is a more experienced actor than McPhee. McPhee, who played the young boy in this film, has also appeared in other movies including X-Men and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. These actors worked as one in this movie to adequately represent the true message of the film. This film is intense, yet touching and withholds many messages expressed by Mortensen and McPhee. This film starts in the the post apocalyptic world, with a man and a boy, and many untold stories. Throughout the film we see their hardships as they embark on a journey down the road to reach the south, and the ocean. We see the characters grow as they experience new things and learn new lessons. The man plays the role of a leader for the boy, who has never known different from the world he lives in today. But we see that the man, who holds many secrets, can vividly remember life before his life turned upside down. We experience these times through flashbacks and it only accentuates the true hardships he has experienced. After reading the book, and watching the film it is notable that there are few differences between the two, overall messages as well as small details carry throughout both. This film is very intriguing and intense to watch, many moments leave you on the edge of your seat and wondering what will happen next. This, combined with angles, soundtrack and lighting allow the true message of the novel to come through. Point of view shots allow the audience to feel more connected to the scenes and make them more intense, along with this, the music played at moments of intensity, keep the audience on the edge of their seats. Throughout the film the use of lighting, or lack thereof, keeps the mood, low and dreary. Overall this film truly captured the post apocalyptic world, in a way that kept readers on the edge of their seats. All combined, the actors, props, editing and soundtrack, keep the audience engaged at all times. I would recommend this film because it encaptures true messages and struggles, while in the meantime keeping the audience engaged and entertained.",The Road
561,henderson-09706,Terrible film,1,1 July 2018,"This has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. The entire film up until the last few minutes portrays a horrible post-apocalyptic nuclear winter where all animals have died, no crops will grow, food has run out and the few people left hunt each other for food. The ending of this film cannot be described as anything other than ridiculous and stupid. Spoiler: At the end, the father dies and the boy, almost immediately afterwards, finds a kind family of four with a dog who take him in. No explanation of how the family feeds itself while the rest of the world is eating each other. And a dog? Seriously? Cannibalism everywhere, but this family can feed itself and a dog. How? It's just a totally stupid ending that makes no sense in the broader context of the film.",The Road
562,bst-11,Beautifully crafted but horribly bleak,8,21 October 2014,"I'm not exaggerating or being ""dramatic"" or facetious when I say: if you watch this film be prepared to be down on life for a week or two.The movie is built on the premise that planet Earth no longer supports life. There's no solvable problem for the protagonist and his son to work against, the two just spend the movie trying to avoid immediate death while slowly dying of starvation. They travel to the ocean because the inland winters are getting impossibly cold and they think the coast might be a little warmer but that's pretty much the extent of their ""hope."" The movie does have it's own version of father-son moments, like dad teaching his child the proper way to commit suicide (the scene plays out the way a father would teach his son to tie his shoes, or ride a bike, or shave, killing yourself is the new ""essential skill"" in the world of this film) if they ever find themselves surrounded by cannibals.And it's important to point out that in this extreme situation, none of what we see is heightened or exaggerated for dramatic effect, it is all portrayed in the starkest most realistic manner possible. I'm being completely straight with you when I say that this movie will hit you and you will carry it with you for a while after watching it.Right now I feel like a parent telling his child, ""you should wait to have sex until you're really ready, but if you're going to do it despite my advice, at least use protection."" I recommend steering clear of this movie, but if you absolutely must watch it, at least go in having braced yourself to be deeply affected in the most depressing way possible. In terms of ""bracing yourself"" it is impossible to be ""too prepared"" to watch this movie. You might even want to read a synopsis and spoil some of it for yourself so that you're not too heavily hit by some of the darker portions of the film.While it's technically a beautifully crafted and well put together movie, I don't know a single person that I would recommend it to on the basis of taste and preference. It's so sickeningly bleak, if there is anyone out there who finds this movie to be ""right up my alley,"" I surely wouldn't want to meet them.",The Road
