0,moonspinner55,The cinematic equivalent of scab-picking...some see this as Art,1,6 April 2009,"Years after a tornado has wiped out much of their small town in Ohio, leaving behind nothing but memories and decay, a group of young and old characters react in different ways to the boredom and vacuousness that has settled in around them. The kids torture and sell cats, lift weights, and listen to death metal music, while the addle-pated adults seem to have killed off all their brains cells from one substance or another. Made for just over a million dollars, writer-director Harmony Korine's independent film is preconceived to shock with its depravity. To Korine's credit, the stultified atmosphere of the piece is arresting, the cinematography is scarily good, and--though the amateur acting is sometimes facile--the foul, stunted vocabulary and heartless aimlessness of the characters seems pretty truthful. Chloë Sevigny has a small part (and also designed the costumes!) playing a platinum blonde flirting with a skinny, pasty jock who tells her he has ADD; when Korine relaxes a little bit and just engages in their talk (or in sibling roughhousing, or jumping around on the bed to Buddy Holly's ""Everyday""), ""Gummo"" manages to work a bit of primitive magic. However, the main objective (as I can tell) is to show the bestiality which arises in human beings who have nothing else to do but lash out. The anger and betrayal these kids feel isn't necessarily addressed verbally (they seem too uneducated to process a genuine thought or articulate their emotions), but it is visualized for us, sometimes graphically. Viewers can argue endlessly whether or not this depiction of human waste is Art...whether or not it is exploitation, common huckstering, completely dishonest, or enlightening. I certainly can see an askew sense of talent (visual talent, anyway) hovering around the movie's edges, but not much entertainment value. If apathy and abject indifference in our society is really this bad, then there's no hope for any of us. The lunatics are running the asylum. * from ****",Gummo
1,Quinoa1984,"Howard Stern meets Ingmar Bergman, mayhap; both genuinely disturbing and pitch-blackly funny, and not a complete waste",5,1 July 2004,"There were things I were wishing Gummo could've been as opposed to what it is, but I guess that it's inevitable to feel as such when dealt with such a challenge of an art-film. Harmony Korine, who provided a searing, revealing screenplay for the underground classic Kids, makes his debut where it's almost like a neo-realistic film put on for the crowd waiting for Jerry Springer. And, in a way, I felt that might've been part of my problem with the film. The concept is that a tornado rips through the (fictional?) town of Xenia, Ohio, and creates an atmosphere for its inhabitants that's bleak, disparaging, and with little hope for its youth. While Korine is simply (as he has said in an interview which is included on the DVD) looking for images he has not seen before, and in some regard does a unique, remarkable, and perhaps even transcendent job with his DP's (the late, intriguing) Jean-Yves Escoffier, and James Clauer, many of the scenes don't work for me. I suppose that's where the Stern comparison comes into play, as some of the film is like watching a train wreck, where the humor that comes forth is in laughing at the people &/or the situations they're in. But there in lies a problem, as Korine also creates a sincerely realistic approach to what's in the neighborhood. Sure, this is SUPPOSED to be a town after being the grip of a tornado, but then why does it seem reminiscent of other, un-harmed small towns in America?Practically all of the actors (excluding some Korine regulars like an un-recognizable-at-first-sight Chloe Sevigny) are non-professionals, which is where the neo-realist aspect comes in. Many of these people will never be in front of a camera again, and the fact that so much of it is in a documentary-style feel showing faults and all, it breaks your heart while the film inter-splices weird clips shot on hand-held video. Might these people be as fascinating, if not more so, in a real documentary as opposed to a mind-f*ck of a Americana town where we as the audience get a better view than is given? Even the main characters (who do all turn in fascinating work despite the constant downtrodden feel of the picture) only give inklings as to what's behind the surface. Korine's approach to the feel of these people is that of a Bergman film, with pain and the absence of God always somewhere in the work. But his approach definitely lacks the wisdom in creating people to care about. But, it's not a complete waste to watch this. As the scenes rolled on, I couldn't turn off the film. Some of the scenes are right out of a deleted clips from backstage at a Springer-type show (i.e. the crazy beating of a chair, a little kid with bunny ears tortured by two little cowboy kids, a girl with a razor), but despite some of the oddities, at least a few of them are recognizable caricatures, and if they are creations of Korine and not simply filmed people off of the street, some are original. I guess I can put it this way- if you watch Gummo, and you can't understand what the hell was the point, you're not alone. 5.5/10",Gummo
2,HumanoidOfFlesh,Hollywood brainwashed you all!,9,8 February 2002,"Young Harmony Korine,who wrote ""Kids""(1995),made his directional debut with this truly bizarre low budget piece of art about young people in small town of Xenia,Ohio.The main characters-two boys(Solomon and Tummler)kill cats for fun and break into a house to euthanize an old woman.Other oddities on display are a man who pimps his retarded sister,a strange shirtless boy in pink bunny ears etc,etc.I love ""Gummo"",because I'm in the position of enjoying everything what is different and controversial.Almost everything today is corporate Hollywood trash with an overblown budget and overpaid actors/actresses.It's truly a refreshing change to see something original like ""Gummo"".Of course it is intentionally outlandish,often repulsive and occasionally hilarious,but it's a treat,if you're fed up with MTV-oriented banal Hollywood crap.Personally I love the soundtrack of ""Gummo""-great death/black metal stuff(Burzum,Bethlehem etc.)Especially Bethlehem is an unique band.They play totally depressing death/black/suicide metal with some of the sickest vocals ever recorded.It's truly an amazing music-check out especially their albums like ""Dictius Te Necare""(1996)and ""S.U.I.Z.I.D""(1998)!So if you don't mind to see something different,watch ""Gummo""-you'll love it!",Gummo
3,StevePulaski,You be the judge...,9,28 March 2013,"Are my mores changing or am I becoming more grown up and mature? Perhaps both, as I recall when I refused to watch Harmony Korine's Gummo based solely on its animal cruelty. Consistent readers know I despise animal cruelty in any way, shape, or form. I find it reprehensible and simply unnecessary in almost every film. Gummo is the first film where I found the animal cruelty to be somewhat just (take note of the word ""somewhat"").With the abundance of other quirks, shocks, horrors, and unforgettable instances of inhumanity here, the animal cruelty could appear as one of the higher points in the lives of the characters in Gummo, widely known for being one of the most controversial films of the nineties. It depicts the small town of Xenia, Ohio, which was ravaged by a tornado in 1974 and is shown as a town that never fully recovered from the destruction. Its residents, some of the quirkiest and strangest souls this side of any line in the sand, are seen in a naturalistic light, going about their daily routines. For some, that means committing atrocities like shooting cats, vandalizing property, spouting racism, fighting, expressing grief, making small talk, or trying to find a meaning for their seemingly pointless existence.I realize I'm playing Gummo as a documentary, when it clearly isn't. I do this on purpose, because the film is so jaw-droppingly smooth, consistent, and believable that an ignorant me would be hard to judge a real documentary next to this one in terms of factual quality. One character we focus on is a young teenager nicknamed ""Bunny Boy"" (Jacob Sewell), who wanders around the brokenness of Xenia in nothing but bunny ears, short-shorts, and tennis shoes. Another character, by far the most interesting, although he has tough competition, is Solomon (Jacob Reynolds), a young boy who spends his days shooting cats with his pal Tummler (Nick Sutton) and keeping to himself in the presence of his family.Solomon is so interesting because he accentuates so little personality in everything he does. He never smiles, never gives off a friendly persona, though not a mean one either, quietly goes about his day, no matter how weird or pointless it may seem, and has a unique look to him to boot. He's a character that seems to not hold an ounce of humanity or sympathy in his body, and what is walking is just a cold, lifeless shell of a human. There's something beyond his oddly-shaped head, crooked eyes, and strange hairdo that made me want to know more about him. It's his inability to emote, but his consent to conform to a lifestyle that makes him such a driving force in Gummo's success.Korine's cinematic philosophy is one I'm a full supporter of, as it is one of the countless number of reasons I'm such a cinephile in the first place. He believes that characters should be the main focus in a film, and not plot-progression, specific events, or any other possible feature (except maybe cinematography, but that rarely overpowers character here). After any Korine film, I guarantee you're left describing events and characters rather than plot. If cinema had any ground-rules, or anything it could do more of as a broad whole, I'd want strong characterization in just about every film I watch.Speaking of scenes, there are a handful of ones I can pull out from here and try to meticulously construct a message from, but I'm only going to briefly analyze two. The first one comes relatively early and is as funny as it is depressing. It takes place in a junkyard, where two boys, no older than nine or ten, are vandalizing broken cars or mounds of garbage during a game of what appears to be predators and prey. They are talking about their extreme loathing for policemen when ""Bunny Boy"" shows up in his trademark uniform to much dissent. ""Bunny Boy"" is treated and approached like a real bunny, with the two boys using their toy guns to shoot him down and ridicule him for about two minutes afterwards. During this time of ridicule, the boys are mindless swearing, criticizing the boy's (rabbit's, technically) smell, face, build, etc, before finally ""leaving him for dead."" This scene, alone, among with countless others, could formulate the viewpoint that Gummo is about the degradation of culture in the face of a tragedy. The ever-so popular method of ""recycling,"" where the following generation inherits the traits of the previous generation, regardless of their good or bad nature, and passes them on in a never-ending ""apple/tree"" cycle.The second scene involves Solomon sitting in a decrepit bathtub of filthy, black water, eating away at his dinner; spaghetti and milk, with a Crunch bar for desert. This scene is a heavily ambiguous one (like many in the film), and we're left questioning what we should take away. Other than it's an example for quite possibly why these children will grow up to be unsuccessful, relatively listless adults, I couldn't provide an explanation. I can say that it will be a scene that will long stay with me, just for its simplicity, and its haunting depiction at how a character could go and spend his childhood.One day, I'd like to sit down with Gummo on the TV, and heavily analyze every scene in it, trying to extract some meaning in it and formulate my findings into an opus of a blog-post. Talk about a challenge with no reward. It's the kind of film where there seem to be morals and themes growing on trees, but you need to work hard and climb a number of rickety branches for the small but noble reward of finding them. Just for its characters Gummo deserves praise; everything else is just cherries on a huge sundae.",Gummo
4,JohnSeal,Yech,1,29 July 1999,"Gummo is the most recent feature from Harmony Korine, screenwriter for Larry Clark's repulsive 'Kids'(1995). Gummo is only slightly less foul a concoction, filled with unbelievable characters played by some of the worst actors ever captured on celluloid. Korine needs to learn that great art (or even good dada) depends on more than a talent to disgust. If you like shooting cats, you'll love this appalling waste of time. Personally I'll stick to old Warhol movies.",Gummo
5,Polaris_DiB,"The America we don't want to think about, so ultimately don't.",6,21 May 2006,"I've been wanting to check out this Harmony Korine person, being that in general people are pretty impressed with his work (minus a few film snobs, some of whom's opinion I trust, so I was very interested to see which side I would join).This is a documentary-like look at small-town America, not the small-town America that has nerds dancing to electronic music or the small-town America filled with hyper evangelists, but the small-town America with a Wal-Mart, dirty homes, and a lot of stray cats... hick-ville, basically. I think the most noteworthy feature of this film is the fact that almost all of the characters are as unpleasant to look at as they are unpleasant to think about, which is of course why the camera stays on them for long periods of time and lets them tell their own story, forcing us to see and think about them.I'm pretty sure it's meant to be disturbing, in a way, especially to happy suburbanites, but the problem with disturbing material is that once you've seen something more disturbing than something else, the latter doesn't really have much of an effect anymore. Still, I could call the film unsettling and not be lying... though nearing the end I began to get antsy not because of the subject matter, but because it was beginning to drag.Here's an interesting point to make about the film: I love cats, a lot, and seeing them hurt or tortured angers me and upsets me to great degrees. But the treatment of cats in this film didn't really upset me too much because it felt natural considering the strays and the type of world these people lived in. So is that a symbol of this film's strength, or weakness? I'm not sure, I'm pretty sure a second viewing could help answer that, but then again I'm not really sure I desire a second viewing because I feel pretty finished with the work as a whole.--PolarisDiB",Gummo
6,drownnnsoda,"""Gummo"" - a Tour Through American Wasteland.",10,12 October 2009,"""Gummo"" is more of a documentary than anything (a faux-documentary at that, but nonetheless) that chronicles the lives of various fictional residents in Xenia, Ohio- a town that was previously ravaged by a tornado, which left the physical remains of the city (as well as its people) destroyed. We, the audience, meet a variety of characters, ranging from a mute sort of martyr-boy with bunny ears; two teenage boys who hunt local cats and sell them to a Chinese restaurant; three sisters who spend their days taping their nipples and bathing their cat, Foot Foot; a mentally disabled girl who walks around town with her toy doll which she believes to be a real baby; and a group of rowdy rednecks who find pleasure in smashing furniture. This, of course, is only a handful of who we meet; there are other equally bizarre characters whom we are introduced to in ""Gummo"", and none of them really seem to have anything in common, aside from the fact that they all reside in this hopeless town and live out their hopeless lives. I've seen various reviewers state that this is a ""love it or hate it"" type of film, and I'd say I have to agree. Although I did find some areas weaker than others, I do love the film as a whole. Plot-wise, there really isn't much to discuss, as the film doesn't really have one. The audience only gets glimpses into these characters' lives; individual vignettes, if you will. After being introduced to them for the first time, we meet some of them again throughout the film (and others we don't), but their presences in the film echo nonetheless. We won't forget the drunken teenager (played by director Korine himself) and the gay midget, or the pre-pubescent cowboy kids whose vocabulary solely consists of words like ""pussy"", ""faggot"", and a handful of other expletives; nor will we forget the brief but ever haunting monologue given by a young girl who confesses her stepfather's molestation of her as a child, or the childlike Down's Syndrome girl who is prostituted by her cruel brother. These people's lives, sometimes oddly humorous, but otherwise extremely dark and painfully twisted, are utterly fascinating.As for the technical aspects of the film, I will say that it is very nicely photographed. The cinematography varies in style - most of the film is standardized, but some video footage is included, as well as random still photographs with voice-over narratives that weave each vignette together. Oddly enough, the film has its own ""flow"", and once you get into it, it's very easy to just go along for the rest of the ride, regardless of how disturbing and utterly bizarre it becomes. The soundtrack was also well- chosen, with some anthems of Americana such as Buddy Holly's ""Everyday"" and Roy Orbison's ""Crying""; these mellow tunes are extremely well-juxtaposed with the death metal that fills out the rest of the soundtrack, almost as if representing a clash of the town's personalities pre- and post-tornado. Perhaps Xenia, Ohio was once a lively, optimistic town; in the context of the film though, we will never know, for the only Xenia, Ohio we see is the cultural wasteland that it has disintegrated to.The performances in the film are also remarkable on all fronts. The two lead boys (Solomon and Tummler) are extremely convincing, as are the rest of the cast. Everyone in this film is painfully believable. Chloë Sevigny, Korine's girlfriend at the time, stars in one of her first roles as the eldest of the nipple-taping sisters, Dot, who moseys around the town with her bleach-blonde hair and eyebrows; she and her two sisters (one teen aged and bleach blonde as well, the other one a rather young brunette) are some of the most innocent of the characters; they're just as hopeless as the rest of the town's trash, but lack the violence and carelessness that many of the other characters unabashedly display.Overall, I can guarantee a unique movie experience with ""Gummo"". The viewer has to keep in mind though that they are about to view a film that gives no care about plot; it is simply a series of insights into the lives of people who have nothing to live for; they are the ones who we brush under the rug and pretend to ignore, but their existences continue just the same - uneducated, bored, and completely shut off to the rest of the world outside of their own. Xenia is their galaxy, and they merely orbit it as planets. You probably know people like this, or have met some in your life. Granted, they probably weren't nearly as extreme or abhorrent as the characters we meet in ""Gummo"", but nonetheless, you know who these people are. I like to think of this movie as a sort of portrait in the form of a film; there really is no solid story, but what we see in it provides us enough to understand the subjects and hopefully understand their positions to some extent. ""Gummo"" succeeds in this regard, as a portrait of the grim underbelly of America; prepare yourself for a tour through the wasteland. 10/10.",Gummo
7,Agent10,"Pretty awful, but you still can't turn away",3,19 May 2007,"I'll never understand Harmony Korine. Ever. A perfectly good talent being put to waste in this rather stagnant, dull and ridiculous ""movie."" You can't really call Gummo a movie, simply due to the fact that it seems to be more of a confession of inner turmoil or an indictment of modern ignorant rednecks. Neither extreme would surprise me. It's strange, while some people would call this movie hilarious or touching or whatever, I just called it utter crap. One painfully blunt scene after another, one more nail being stuck into my head.You know you're character set is in trouble when the best performer in the film is wearing bunny ears. Yes, I understand the weirdness of the film was meant to be intentional, meant to jar your out of some middle or upper-class bliss that inflicts all of us when we become self absorbed with things like image and materialism. But to say these extreme examples are beautiful and interesting is an awfully big stretch.While the movie is terrible, you still can't stop watching because you're anxiously waiting for Korine to reveal that there is some hidden meaning within the madness, but it just continues to boil over in false brilliance and bizarreness. A Sergei Eisenheim knock-off Harmony Korine is not. Just because Wernor Herzog nearly craps his pants because he saw some bacon on a wall doesn't mean you're a visionary.",Gummo
8,Jonny_Numb,just...weird,6,17 October 2005,"A weird conundrum washes over me as I consider ""Gummo,"" screenwriter Harmony Korine's directorial debut: is it so strange that it deserves praise, or is it so strange that it deserves NO praise? While I usually have little tolerance for filmmakers who attempt to make art out of nihilism and anti-social behavior, ""Gummo"" is a strangely transfixing oddity filled with repugnant, idiotic characters and next to no plot. It's a trashy-looking film about brothers who kill cats in exchange for an airplane-glue fix, a wandering boy in bunny ears, and mullet-headed fools who wrestle chairs... While the subject matter is mind-bogglingly empty, Korine's taste for the offbeat, matched with inventive camera work, somehow makes ""Gummo"" fly...like viewing portraits of a slow-motion car wreck in an art gallery.",Gummo
9,framptonhollis,a sad story,10,1 September 2017,"Above all, ""Gummo"" is, simply put, a damn depressing movie. It is also hilarious, entertaining, creepy, quirky, trashy, gritty, surreal, and disturbing (among many other adjectives that it'd take far too long for me to list). But, most importantly, it's highly effective and arguably genius. Now I can't say for sure if Harmony Korine himself really is a ""genius"", although he's far more intelligent than he may seem, but I am willing to make the case that some of his finest films could support this possibility, and i think that ""Gummo"" probably is his masterpiece.It's not a film that's easy to digest, and not just because of its disturbing, messed up content and themes, but also because of its loose structure and dense layers of meaning (or possible lack of meaning) as well as its firm refusal to actually tell a story. Instead of any real semblance of plot, Korine settles for a series of vignettes that take place in a white trash town a few years after it was ravaged by a massive tornado. He explores the lives of some of the town's most eccentric (and often unpleasant) residents. Some characters are more heavily developed and examined than others although there's really no single character that can really be labeled as the ""main"" one. There's a multitude of things that feel necessary to discuss while discussing ""Gummo"", which is why there are so many reviews of it and why so many of those reviews are so long. No matter who you are, you are bound to have some strong opinion on Korine's film, whether you absolutely love it or deeply loathe it. Personally, I belong to the former category; particularly on my second viewing, I felt oddly attached to this film and its sentimental yet darkly comic and occasionally cynical approach to some very sensitive and thought provoking material. There's silly moments (the entire ""chair wrestling"" sequence makes me laugh harder than nearly anything else in the history of art-house filmmaking) as well as some very philosophical moments (the haunting, mumbling voice overs given by two of the film's young ""protagonists"" (?) are both insightful and odd). There's so many memorable scenes and images that will doubtlessly stick with you whether you like the film or not, everything from the depressed bunny boy to the iconic scene in which a kid awkwardly eats his dinner and dessert in the filthiest bathtub imaginable, his surroundings including demented barbie dolls and bacon strips taped to bathroom walls. It's poetic, funny, beautiful, and sickening-one of the most uncomfortable viewing experiences I have ever had, and yet its also one of the most rewarding. It's worth rewatches not just because it will help the viewer understand and grasp the film more, but also because the viewer will likely be able to find more odd and funny details with closer observations. It's also surprisingly fun to watch despite its heavy sense of tragedy and grief, and this is because of Korine's unremitting taste for the absurd, particularly the absurdly comical. The sense of humor is similar to the funnier works of Werner Herzog, the great German filmmaker who Korine has admitted multiple times to admiring quite a bit, even to the extent that he has actually cast Herzog as an actor in a few of his films (""Julien Donkey-Boy"" and ""Mister Lonely"").Whatever your thoughts or feelings about this weird and, to some, very mesmerizing work of cryptic madness may be, there is no denying that it is an unforgettable viewing experience and one of the most delightfully strange movies ever made.",Gummo
10,p-stepien,Into the looking glass,5,21 September 2012,"A decade before the hipster sobbings of teenage prodigy Xavier Dolan made him the in-director we had the hipster sobbings of teenage prodigy Harmony Korine. After scriptwriting the controversial ""Kids"", he soon debuted to both wide acclaim, festival awards as well as to critical onslaught with his first feature ""Gumbo"". Much in the same mold ""Gumbo"" is a cryptodocumentary, portraying various loosely connected scenes into a wider message / picture. True to his beloved vaudeville Korine offers little in way of story, instead focusing on improvisation and connecting series of unrelated scenes, which aim to portray life of so-called 'white trash' in America. The end effect is a grim portrayal of everyday life, which is as strikingly realistic as it is metaphysically abstract.Unlike the realistic artism of ""Winter's Bone"", which deals with the similar underbelly of American society, Korine prefers a full frontal approach, attacking through audacity and despicability, characterised by all engulfing turpism. The two main characters Tummler and Solomon earn pocket money by pelleting cats and selling the bodies for resale as Chinese delicacies, which speaks volume about the level of depravity, which is churned out. Almost no one is truly relatable in a movie mostly populated by seemingly grotesque caricatures, who at the same time feel brutally realistic in their extremity.Immersed in debauchery and focused on the spectacle fronted by the weird and freaky, ""Gumbo"" isn't easy consumption, and even those who acknowledge the impact of the movie may be turned off by overreaching sensationalism and exploitational tendencies. Initiated with a scene of drowning a cat (possibly truly performed for all intent and purpose) initial disgust is kept glued to the viewing experience. Such cinematographic assault may feel excessive and lack subtlety, but Korine seems to be self-aware of his goal. What's important is the fact that the characters aren't judged and morality does not feature, apart from self-imposing suggestion of a tornado being a godly act aimed at ridding the Earth of travesty.The biggest discussion behind ""Gumbo"" has long been focused on the character of the bunny-boy, a half-clothed bay donning Playboy-type bunny ears. Seemingly using the symbolism of ""Alice in Wonderland"" the character is our guide taking us through the looking glass to see a deformed version of everyday life, one rife with brutality and immorality, albeit with a certain logic creating it. The rabbit wanders throughout this world presenting us the unknown. At the same time he is a watchful observer, one that does his best not to escalate the aggression and depravity, but offers hope that life can be reconstituted. As a light of positive ideals he is the sole person attempting to do a go deed by bringing back a lost cat in the final scene, offering a suggestion of possible rebirth to a better reality after the destruction brought about by the tornado.""Gumbo"", though significant, does offer a severe rankings problem. On the one hand offering substance, but simultaneously not being the type of cinema I would want to watch. Viewing was almost like a laborious responsibility, but offered little satisfaction or connection to the issues portrayed. Despite that it does touch cerebrally forcing to consummate the images, however repugnant they be. Essentially not a movie I enjoyed or rate highly, but one that can't simply be disregarded.",Gummo
11,Maciste_Brother,Phony,1,8 April 2004,"This so-called authentic view of white trash folks is as real as a 3 dollar bill.The scene that destroys the so-called authenticity of this movie is the scene between Harmony and the black midget when they're sitting on the couch. The two cannot act through this scene with straight faces because none of them believe in it. The jumpy editing cuts just when the ""actors"" are about to laugh out loud. The editing is sloppy and that scene basically shows how intellectually vapid and self-indulgent this film is. It's a freakshow disguised as a pseudo-documentary.The fact is, I'm sure there are tons of folks out there who would make the characters in this movie look like Snow White or Einstein. But is the voyeuristic display of lowlifes reason enough to create a movie around it?
Nope.",Gummo
12,kevin c,IS THERE LIFE IN THE U.S INDEPENDENT ??,5,9 December 2000,"This film arouses vehement criticism, so you know it must be doing something right. Anything that alienates the U.S conservatives, is heading down the right avenue. Just when you thought the U.S indy scene was dying and had been hijacked by Hollywood, something like this comes along. An original, haunting film.

13,Son_of_Mansfield,Apathy on parade.,1,28 September 2007,"From the writer of Kids comes...more of the same. There isn't anything wrong with showing what is believed to be the depraved youth of America, but should it be this dull and manufactured? Just because real people are in it doesn't make it any less synthetic than the typical Hollywood film, they were still cast for a specific purpose. The difference is that these people have no clue of what real acting is, which is making a character, a complete person. Kid swears and whips a dead cat. Kid swears and prepares to have sex with a pimped out mentally challenged girl. Kid swears and blah blah blah. It's apathetic to a fault. It isn't some Hollywood construct that people have to have good in them, it's nature.

Being an animal lover, I'd like to see him get beaten with a pole, and see how he likes it. The video cover that has this scrawny kid, sitting shirtless on a dunny with bunny ears, is the best thing about it, and surely this could be such indication what kind of movie you're in for-possibly the worst film of 1999. Chloe Sevigny co stars, and helped produce it. One scene has her and her friends go off at a pedophile. Another scene, has this kid in the bath, eating a chocolate bar. A truly repulsive scene, as is the whole movie. Just because people are so bored with their lives and where they live is no excuse for animal cruelty. Why don't they do something about it. There is a disturbing air about the movie, I admit, but viewing this trash, once was enough. Trash throughout. A truly repulsive movie.",Gummo
15,asda-man,About as eventful as someone chewing a piece of gum-mo,2,24 August 2015,"I first heard about Gummo about five years ago when the good old X Factor did movie week, where the contestants have to sing songs from films. Simon Cowell chose the song 'Crying' for Jamie Afro from the movie Gummo. Perhaps they should've said from Mulholland Drive, a much more well-known film than the mysterious Gummo. All of the judges were accusing Simon of being a cheat, ""Who has heard of Gummo!?"" screamed Louis Walsh. Then Harry Hill's TV burp did a hilarious sketch where he went out asking the public what their favourite film was and they all said Gummo. Like most of the viewers, I googled Gummo and discovered that it's often hailed as one of the most disturbing films of all time.This prompted me to watch the trailer which absolutely scared the hell out of me for some inexplicable reason. But of course as a lover of all things disturbing, I digged further and found the clip of the boy in the bath which basically haunted my every waking hour. I vowed never to watch Gummo because I knew that it would just completely destroy my life. Unlike most people I don't find conventionally scary things scary. Daemonic possession I can deal with, ghosts, Michael Myers all don't bother me one bit. I get scared by strange things. For example, I consider the ending to Sleepaway Camp the scariest thing I've ever seen. However, now I'm a big hard man I decided to finally give Gummo a watch and to my surprise it hardly bothered me at all.It started on a creepy note with a croaky voice narrating over a load of depressing, grainy images of a hurricane-stricken town. Then a half-naked boy in pink rabbit ears appears, prancing about on an overpass whilst a hideous song about a cockerel plays over. The whole scene is mildly bizarre and sets the tone for the majority of the film. Most regular cinema-goers would quit here, however no normal goer would be sticking Gummo in their DVD player.The problem I had with the film is that it is plot less. Not many films can get away with being episodic or abstract. Ones I enjoy (off the top of my head) are Eraserhead, Under the Skin and more recently, Mr. Turner. However, all of these films inspire extremely divisive opinions. You either 'feel' them or you don't and I just didn't 'feel' Gummo. Nothing of interest happens and I didn't care for any of the recurring characters. I understand that the point of the film is that it has no point (I think) but it just doesn't interest me. The film is basically a series of sketches with the odd character who crops up now and again. We get the odd random documentary-styled snapshot of bizarre locals, such as a blind albino woman looking for love and director, Harmony Korine feeling up a Jewish midget.Most of the film resolves around two boys who go around sniffing glue and killing cats. They also have other meaningless adventures involving visiting prostitutes and exercising to Madge. All of this sounds far more disturbing than it actually is. There's nothing explicit shown so you can't accuse it of being exploitative or shocking for the sake of it, there's not really much you can accuse it of. Surprisingly it's actually pretty boring and aimless. Some might see some sort of high art or intrigue in it, but I couldn't find any. I was kept glued to the screen because I was expecting something horrifically disturbing to happen any minute, but it never did.I did still find the bath scene very disturbing though. The mise-en-scene is just so uncomfortable with the filthy walls and water. The sound of the boy eating the melted chocolate is also quietly revolting. The whole atmosphere of the film is raw and creepy, but I still can't really see why so many people consider it so disturbing. It's just so uneventful and ponderous. It seems like one of those horrendously pretentious art-house films made by self-absorbed directors trying something new. It all comes down to what turns you on though. I really enjoyed Harmony's latest Spring Breakers, but I know a lot of people hated it and it's not difficult to understand why. Gummo is love it or hate it and I'm definitely more on the hate side. I'll never forget it though.",Gummo
16,t_atzmueller,An American parable and an excellent study of America's underbelly,7,20 February 2013,"For many people who know the United States only through cinema, tabloid celebrity-news and TV, the US is the land of the rich and the beautiful. For those people, the likes of Tom Cruise, George Clooney and Angelina Jolie, in other words, actors with big, polished grins and empty eyes are the faces of America. And Hollywood is its capital city.Well, ""Gummo"" isn't about that America; ""Gummo"" is the America of the poor, uneducated and the degenerated descendents of the dregs from around the world. These aren't the (supposedly) proud and noble people who came to America on board the Mayflower, but rather those that travelled in the ships hull; those who eventually ended up in some dreary trailer camp and hamlet somewhere in the Midwest, simply because they weren't wanted anywhere else.""The prophet has no honor in his own country"", goes an old saying, which would explain the harsh criticism that director Harmony Korine has received, especially by American critics and reviewers. Too close to home and too harsh a reality, but undeniably a reality that Korine is more than familiar with. Korine descends from a similar environment and I dare say that it took courage to explore such an uncomfortable background.The closest I can compare ""Gummo"" to is Werner Herzog's ""Stroszek""; not only are the filming techniques very similar (whether Korine is a Herzog-fan I do not know, but it wouldn't surprise me in the least), blending together professionals, amateur- and non-actors seamlessly, but both films have a similar nihilist air, telling stories that are free of redemption, yet captivate the viewer's attention like a travelling freak-show or the birth of a two-headed cow.One of the main reasons that I was watching ""Gummo"" in the first place, before even realizing what kind of film it was, was the presence of actor Jacob Reynolds. I had seen Reynolds in ""The Road to Wellville"", were he has a small but impressive scene as Dr. Kellogg's (Anthony Hopkins) adopted son. Apart from being an excellent actor, Reynolds is ugly. His ugliness, the over-sized head, bird-like features and asymmetric features, glues itself to the eye of the beholder; one could watch him for hours, giving new meaning to the term ""so ugly that he's back to beautiful again"". A shame that the young actor hasn't been starring in more films and bigger roles, but, like I already said, the industry relies more on pretty and lifeless actors.Well, this definitely isn't a ""pretty picture"" – if you want ""pretty"" or ""artificial"", I recommend films with above mentioned ladies and gentlemen – and it most likely will not make you feel better if you happened to have a bad day. But it's authentic, and that's not exactly common these days. A movie one either loves or loves to hate.",Gummo
17,Seamus2829,Don't Bother,1,6 November 2007,"When I heard that Harmony Korine had directed a film after writing the screenplay for 'Kids', I thought, ""I have to see this!"", as I was uber impressed by Korine's bleak vision of contemporary youth gone insane. What I got was an overblown,pretentious,self indulgent home movie that says nothing,makes absolutely no sense what so ever,and features some of the most annoying characters assembled into a feature film (or what passes for one). I would rather sit through an entire screening of Warhol's 'Empire', than to subject myself to this piece of s**t ever again. It was because of Gummo that I avoided his next film, 'Julian Donkey Boy', all together",Gummo
18,Mort-31,"""Life is beautiful. Without it, you'd be dead.""",4,13 April 2003,"How witty!Allegedly, this film never reached Europe because it was too sick and too American. I think they didn't show it here because it is too inconsequential. It tries to shock but it can't because meanwhile we learned that real life is sick in a much more subtle way than displayed in Gummo.Gummo is not shocking. It has moments of hilarious silliness, though. Scenes, which can be considered as absurd only, like a young boy running around half-naked with two bunny-ears on his head. Or Jacob Reynolds, eating Spaghetti and chocolate while having his hair washed in a bathtub by his mother. These scenes are good for being giggled at by groups of people watching them on video, but they do not quite have a message.
The soundtrack of the film displays its silliness. Slayer. Buddy Holly's Everyday. Madonna's Like a Prayer. Roy Orbison's Crying. I wonder (this has nothing to do with the quality of the film) whether it is a coincidence that both Everyday and Crying were covered by Don McLean as well?Korine/Clark movies Kids and, even more, Ken Park, are much more successful in really shocking their audience. They are not as anarchical but more intelligent.",Gummo

It's distressing that so many people ( professional & amateur) reviewing Gummo (or natural Born Killers, for that matter) seem to base their judgements on *manners* and *taste* more than anything.

21,Tromafreak,Spaghetti: The History of Gummo,6,29 February 2016,"Trash cinema comes in many forms. Funny, shocking, confusing, offensive, scary. And then there's Gummo, which, I guess, is a mixture of all that, and also, just plain pointless. But hey. Not all movies need a point to be entertaining, or to gain a cult following. A fact which makes writer/director, Harmony Korine a very lucky man. Because, even after watching his masterpiece (?), I'm still not convinced this guy has all that much talent. But he does have some pretty unique stuff going on in his head. And above all, that's what Gummo is. Whether it's a good movie or not is debatable, but let's just go with unique at the moment.About a town full of backwards, hateful dicks who have simply given up on ever being anything. A bad tornado hit this town some years ago, and things were seemingly never fully restored. Ignorant, aimless and bored, these hateful dicks love killing and torturing cats, running their mouths about nothing, getting it on with retards and just hanging around and being trash. Some of them get in fights with chairs. Some of them even win. Hell, some of them enjoy eating spaghetti whilst getting their hair washed. But I don't think any of them are very happy people. And they'd probably prefer to live somewhere else, but are too lazy and stupid to take the steps to do so.The movie seems to revolve mostly around some ugly little pussy kid who's probably an ass hole, yet, we don't get very many examples of this. The kid pumps iron, using handfuls of spoons, and apparently needs his mother to bath him. There's also some other little weirdo kid, wearing a pink bunny hat, and wandering around in his own little world. I'm not sure what he symbolizes, if anything, but like everyone else, he's just there, existing. Despite everything I've said so far in this paragraph, There's something very real about this movie. And surreal at the same time. It almost comes off as some kind of bleak documentary about a small town full of trash, where a bunch of stuff happens.As a lifelong cat lover, I find it hard to watch a cat get hurt or killed, even in a movie. But strangely, I see the treatment of felines in Gummo as somewhat fitting for the characters, as they just naturally feel the need to bully and destroy the only thing they see as beneath them. Adding to this perfect portrayal of hateful, pathetic trash.After despising the abomination that is Spring Breakers, I thought I'd give Harmony Korine one more chance to prove himself not a talentless POS. And much to my surprise, I'm glad I did. I think I actually get Gummo, and even have an appreciation for it. However, I could easily see someone hating this as much as I hated the obnoxious Spring Breakers, because one thing Gummo (and Spring Breakers as well) is not is a likable movie. Seemingly no story, with just a bunch of random scenes put together, showcasing these hopeless citizens and their attempts at killing time and, I guess, having fun. But if you look a little closer, it's clear that these people's behavior tells the story. loud and clear. And it's not a pretty one. Of course, this is not the most entertaining movie I've ever seen, but I'll give Korine one thing. Gummo is far more entertaining than it should be. 6/10",Gummo
22,cgearheart,Very misunderstood and moving film,10,18 June 2018,"Harmony Korine's feature debut suffered very harsh criticism when it was released due to it's non-linear storyline, non-professional actors, frequent use of different unusual cameras, shoestring budget, and an array of several different disturbing topics that seem quite disjointed and sordid. The movie itself is not for all tastes mainly because it deals not only with the breakdown of a town, but because it's about how not every place in the USA is an American dream and how poverty, boredom, abuse, death, loneliness, disaster, and a lack of healthy relationships can complete destroy and desensitize a whole community and turn them into a band of crazies. The film is a moving and unpolished tapestry of broken lives and the random insanity that occurs in those portraits.",Gummo
23,Aussie Stud,This movie is a piece of trash!,1,10 May 2002,"I must admit, upon seeing the opening credits where Chloe Sevigny is also credited as the ""Costume Designer"", I found it very hard to hold back the smirks and foregone eye-rolling that I would endure throughout this obnoxious and incredibly trite 'art house' movie that focuses on the residents of a trash town in Ohio known as 'Xenia', a 'survivor' of a tornado that ruined it in the mid-1980's with several casualties to boot.That unfortunately, was the least of my problems. What the 'Director' tries to achieve with ""GUMMO"" is to hope that you as the viewer will witness the atrocities and horror contained in the citizens of the town of Xenia and the way they live their lives that you will discover at the conclusion of the film that you yourself will have a bad taste in your mouth. Yes, Harmony Korine certainly achieved that, but it was a result in reaction to the incredibly awful movie that was cranked out - not so much the material, but the poor delivery of such and the non-existent plot line accompanied with the incredibly shocking acting and the overbearing 'in-your-face' approach that so desperately screamed, ""YOU MUST LOVE ME, I AM AN INDEPENDENT FILM!"". Yes, ""GUMMO"" is a poor attempt at trying to examine a small town 'documentary' style, but it fails on every level - it just tried too hard, and even that's a stretch. The actors are totally unbelievable. Their actions are not supposed to be humorous, yet you'll find yourself laughing at nearly half the situations they  wind up in. For example, the obligatory eccentric (and possibly insane) mother character who flails her arms in the air in front of a set of mirrors, tap-dancing in her ex-husband's shoes while holding a toy gun to her child's head demanding a smile out of him as he pumps iron with a set of kitchen utensils that have been binded together with masking tape (!). The kitchen scene where a drunken redneck destroys a kitchen chair while his inebriated buddies egg him on from their seats, that being the formica kitchen counter - not so much the part where the chair is destroyed, but a cushion does fly off and strike the wall a few inches above a woman's head which is pretty darn amusing if you ask me (!!). And finally, what about the 'cinematic' scene where two foul-mouthed little brats shout obscenities at a rabbit-ear wearing child who lies on the ground playing dead in a local dump while pretending to be attacked by afore-mentioned brats (!!!).Yes, it's all very intellectual. One might actually learn something from ""GUMMO"". People actually do make use out of cat hides? Taping down your nipples with masking tape will result in having bigger breasts? Regardless of what Jerry Springer might say, some sisters are actually pimped out by their brothers! While making note of these fine points, one must wonder what Harmony Korine wants us to make of ""GUMMO"", and furthermore, what must we do with all the information we 'received' from it? Does Korine want us to remember this movie or to simply forget it? I am sure most Directors do not intend on making a film that one will watch and simply forget within the next twenty-four hours. Well unfortunately, I did forget this movie, but not fast enough, as I obviously found enough time to write this scathing review?My final point it this. As talented an actress as Chloe Sevigny has proven to be in the past, she was absolutely ridiculous (which I am sure was the intended goal of her character) as a trailer trash teen with peroxide hair who seemed to have absolutely no aim in life other than to tape down her nipples with masking tape and to hunt down her lost pet kitty cat. The greatest and most smartest dialogue I have ever heard (or seen) probably came from her climatic scene in a car where she and her two sisters are being attacked by a filthy pedophile who puts the moves on them by sliding his hand up one of their skirts and saying ""I just want some. Oh come on, you're just a bunch of hoes anyway!"", Sevigny screeches in reply, ""Hey! Don't touch her coochie!"". Absolutely timeless!As was my main point throughout this review, if I thought that that was the best scene in ""GUMMO"", then something is obviously terribly wrong.Rating - 0 out of 10",Gummo

You know then that this is going to be unconventional stuff.The film focuses on the town of Xenia in Ohio, which is recovering from a violent tornado, and the two main young delinquent characters whose primary pastimes are stiffing glue and killing cats and selling them. It is a very down-to-earth look at life in a dead-end town with its assortment of characters, ranging from squabbling brothers to a gay dwarf who is skilled at arm wrestling, and some of the other folks who mostly seem to be aimless and bemused.

25,netwallah,The ramblings of a Geek aesthetic auteur,5,18 April 2006,"What passes for style in this ""auteur"" independent film is little more than randomness, varieties of the grotesque, casual cruelty, and a patina of calm in the midst of clutter and senselessness. Korine frames the story with video footage of tornadoes, and an almost inaudible child's voice tells of wreckage and carnage in Xenia, Ohio. Apparently this provides the context for nihilistic characters and healthy doses of rather grim absurdity. The the rest of the movie alternates between the dull adventures of Solomon aka Gummo (Jacob Reynolds) and his friend Tummler (Nick Sutton), gluesniffing boys who ride BMX bikes through town killing cats to sell by the pound, and two tow-headed sisters (Chloe Sevigny and Carisa Glucksman). Also featured is the Bunny Boy (Jacob Sewell), who appears mournful and fragile and arbitrary. And a host of small-town people in various stages of dementia, obesity, undress, inebriation, exhibitionism, and so forth. Every interior is crowded with junk, so there's barely space for the characters to walk into a room. Only the retarded people have neat bedrooms. Tummler has a young, tired face. Gummo has strong features in the upper half of his face, and a receding chin, and his hair is swept up like a woodpecker's crest. There is some striking imagery and a few interesting lines, but the whole piece seems contrived and self-indulgent, and aimed at three effects that probably are at war with each other: 1) the film-maker's ability to generate striking images in support of or extraneous to a narrative; 2) a desire to shock the bourgeois audience; 3) a curiosity about people at the fringes of society or at the edges of a world that has stopped making sense. Ultimately, the movie operates by what I would call a geek aesthetic.",Gummo

28,noizyme,Great weird movie to have on in the background,7,25 August 2005,"Belly (DMX, Nasir Jones) had this movie on in the background of main hangout pad of the film, and the question that needs to be asked is why? Why would anyone watch this free-flowing look at dis-social youth for entertainment purposes. I have quite a few answers to that, too, but let's look at the film.(From the IMDb.com summary of the film) ""Solomon and Tummler are two bored teenage boys who live in Xenia, Ohio. A few years ago, a tornado swept through it, destroying more than half the town and killing the same amount, including Solomon's father. The film, from there, chronicles the anti-social adventures these two boys have. These include sniffing glue, killing cats, having sex, riding dirtbikes, listening to black metal, and meeting a cavalcade of quirky, bizarre, and scary people. These include a man who pimps his mentally ill wife to our anti-heroes, three sisters who play with their cat and practice becoming strippers, a gay black Jewish midget and his boyfriend, a 12-year-old gay transvestite who is also a cat killer, Solomon's mother, two foul-mouthed six-year olds, and most importantly, a nymphlike skateboarder who walks around town wearing pink rabbit ears."" For me, I found the acting by out-of-place Jacob Reynolds and the appearance of the ever-cool Chloe Sevigny to be enough to base a movie on. The soundtrack is nothing but rare death metal tracks (not ever to used again in any movie really again) which adds to the despair of the town. You really grasp a complete hopelessness but one that the whole town understands and takes with a grain of salt. It's as if nothing more can go wrong so they plateau on this assault of swearing, beating animals, living in squalor, and behaving completely abstract to the rest of the world a if they are their own tribe.I think this film will always rank on this site about an average 5/10 stars because some people just don't ""get"" Harmony Korine films. They can be very in-your-face with brutality and awkwardness, yet there is an originality that adds to the experience every time you watch one. I say if you like weird movie, watch one of his because the weirdness is only the top layer of depth for his movies. There's some kind of message socially to them that strikes a chord in me (probably middle-class living and this kind of absurdity in a film seems artful). But I will always give it 7/10, at least.",Gummo
29,fostrhod,A classic film in its own unique way.,7,29 October 2018,"Back in the day when we still had video rental shops or in our case DVDs . I would regularly have films nights with three of my friends. We all lived in the same block of flats, picture Rick Mayall's Bottom for overall seediness and squalor. Any way I digress on one of these film nights, which would always involve a two hour slanging match, almost coming to blows in deciding which film to choose and then subsequently watch first. Each of the reprobates voting 3 for the favourite then 2 etc . Following this long convoluted system, if no film was chosen we would flick a coin .. then start watching said movie whilst guzzling copious amounts of booze and eating a take away (voting system again came into play on what eatery we would go to then who would pick it up etc)
Anyway one of the films we famously chose on a film night was Gummo ,I can't recall too much about it other than it did our collective heads in and maybe we found it hilarious for all the wrong reasons. It did contain a bizarre scene in which one of the protagonist in the movie sung ""Jesus Blood Never Failed Me"" (famously recorded by Gavin Bryers a few years earlier)
So much for the film. Although I do look back to those days from over 20 years ago in which we had the film nights without a care in the world other than what verbal abuse we could throw at the chosen film. I salute you guys Happy times",Gummo
30,shaun98,Falls flat,4,2 February 2003,"**possible spoilers**After penning the screenplay for Larry Clark's controversial ""Kids,"" Harmony Korine attracted instant notoriety before he was even out of his teens. It wasn't long before he negotiated a deal with the same producer to finance his own film as director. That film, known as ""Gummo,"" attracted equal controversy in its own way--and is arguably even more grotesque in content. There is next to no plot to speak of. It's a group of loose vignettes about white trash in a crumbling, forgotten Ohio town (though it was actually filmed in Nashville). The film is intent on offending the sensitive viewer from the start, with a boy in a bunny hat urinating on traffic from a bridge. Two other boys hunt down cats to sell to the local supermarket. A man prostitutes his wife to local teens. A retarded girl runs around and sings for no apparent reason. Korine himself appears as a gay man making drunken advances at a dwarf. At the very end, there is an utterly disgusting scene that seems to have been put there simply for shock value. There's no point to any of this, and the more I think about it the more I am convinced that the filmmakers had no idea where they were going with the material. They seem to have thrown in these unpleasant things just to distract us from that fact. The film wanders aimlessly (like the characters), then it's just over.I wonder what the actors thought of performing these scenes. Surely they didn't intend to make a bad film. They must have trusted the director to make sense of it all, but that may be an impossible task. Most of the performers are nonactors, as Korine intended to give the film a documentary-like feel. No problem there, but often he just sticks them in front of the camera and makes them act stupid. The most curious bit of casting must be Jacob Reynolds, as a very odd-looking teen with a short body and a long, oversized head. I'm not praising his performance or anything; he just stands out because he looks so weird. According to an interview, Korine cast him due to his performance in a Dunkin' Donuts commercial. His co-star, Nick Sutton, was selected after an appearance on ""Sally Jesse Raphael"" when he announced his glue-sniffing habits on national television. Judging from the film, the production crew seems to have been inspired to take up this habit. The only performer I remotely liked was Chloë Sevigny as a bored young woman, but I suspect she only agreed to appear in this thing because she was dating the director.Very little in ""Gummo"" works, though the cinematography does have some merit. This must also be one of the most pretentious films I've seen. Korine claims to have been devising a new and improved form of filmmaking art. Does he really believe that, or is he just posturing to hide his lack of any real creative talent? I hope he's just inexperienced. Roger Ebert's positive review of his next film, ""Julien Donkey-Boy,"" does suggest this. I'd like to think he can refine his techniques over time. If that is the case, I am willing to give him another chance. In the meantime, I'd recommend another film, ""Boys Don't Cry."" It had similar settings and characters--including one played by Chloë Sevigny--but it was a much more compelling film that offered genuine insight into its ill-fated characters. In contrast, ""Gummo"" fails to enlighten or inspire. Its creator would have you regard it as an ""art film."" And so it is. A bad art film. At least it tries to be something different and unique though. *1/2 (out of ****)Released by Fine Line Features",Gummo

33,Camoo,Startling and unique vision,10,5 April 2013,"Gummo is perhaps the greatest manifestation of Korine's bizarre view from the trench he's dug for himself - a loose, dark and poetic work with a nihilistic bent and an unending cast of interesting characters, though 'interesting' is too easy a descriptor .. Lost, damaged, deformed, hurt, strange, weak, strong, isolated.. Though always human. A film like this is easy to dismiss but not easy for an ordinary Joe like me to imagine being made. How does he find these people? Where are these places? How come I've never seen this side of America before? What Korine does very very well is present a side of life that you don't get to see very often -particularly in the movies. Gummo, to most, might as well have been shot on Mars. It has stayed with me since I first saw it years ago - the images are impossible to forget.

Eschewing linear narrative, Korine explores, through the use of vignettes and bizarre episodes, the cat-killing escapades of its two protagonists and weaves this quest around a set of unrelated but bizarre events taking place in Xenia. There is no sense of a story, only a mood, and that mood fluctuates wildly from revulsion to surprise. By giving voice to those marginalized from society, Korine paints a startling portrait of landlocked America, one at odds with the Hollywood cliché of its inhabitants. There are many unforgettable scenes and yet it's not an enjoyable film, but it challenges, provokes and pushes the margins - and that in itself is worthy.",Gummo
35,FrankBooth_DeLarge,White Trash theater,9,15 June 2007,"This is a very odd movie, and is probably one of the most critically divided movies out there. While it does have a cult following and it does receive a lot of praise, it also receives an equal amount of harsh criticism. I can see both sides of the argument. When I first saw this movie, I was interested because of how bizarre and surreal it was, but I was also kind of mixed about how I felt, because I felt it was just the director Harmony Korrine parading his personality. Sort of like this one guy I knew who bragged about how he was into film his whole life, I felt that Korrine was just saying ""look how weird and messed up I can be."" I've seen the movie about 3 times since, and my opinion changed. I like it now. Part of the reason I like this movie could be because I lived in a town near Xenia Ohio, where the movie is set. The movie really doesn't have much of a plot. The whole concept is a tornado ripped through Xenia damaging half the town, and killing half at the same time. What is left afterward is a boring, post apocalyptic world, narrated by a 14 year old kid named Solomon. The rest of the movie is basically a series of somewhat unrelated clips, the reason I say somewhat is because the way they flow together is kind of like someone took a camera through a messed up town, mainly following two kids, but filming some other people on the way, and showing things that the two kids talk about.Some of the things they do in the short segments are funny, some depraved, and some just completely weird. The two main characters, Solomon and Tumler, kill cats and sell them to a butcher shop, so they can get money to buy glue to huff. In the middle of the movie they realize they have a little competition, a cross dressing teenager who takes care of his catatonic grandmother is also killing cats to make money. Some other characters are two teenage girls who try to raise their nipples, and basically do teenage girl stuff throughout the movie. One of them is played by Chloe Sevigny, who is currently on HBO's Big Love. Some other characters include an albino, two skinheads who killed their parents, a bunch of drunk hicks who wrestle chairs (one of which is played by skater Mark Gonzales), a guy who pimps his retarded sister, and the movie's mascot, a kid who skateboards around in bunny ears. One of the funniest and strangest parts of the movie is when he runs into two foul mouthed 6 year olds in a junkyard, who say some outrageous things. It's been commonly interpreted that the bunny kid represents the only true happiness in the rundown town.One thing I've grown to like is how the movie is a half documentary. I say half because some of the stuff appears to be real people that the director found in a Tennessee town who are just being themselves. Another interesting element is the usage of different film throughout the movie. Most of the movie is filmed in regular film, but some parts are filmed with grainy hand-held camera footage, giving it even more of a documentary like feel.If you're a metal-head you'll love the soundtrack. It has songs by Bathory, Burzum, Sleep (one of my favorite parts is when Tummler and Solomon bike down the hill while Sleep's Dragonaut plays in the background), and a song by Bethlehem plays during a couple of scenes. Black metal fans will be pleased during a scene in the middle when they show footage of people in corpse paint doing some kind of ceremony. Besides just metal, there's also that song Crying by Roy Orbison (another one of the best scenes is when this song plays), Like a Prayer by Madonna, and this one classical piece that perfectly fits the movie.This movie might take a few viewings to appreciate, and it's not guaranteed you'll like it. One thing I can say is that once you watch it becomes hard to stop because of how depraved everything becomes. By the end of the movie, you'll wish the tornado had just killed the other half of the town the first time around.",Gummo
36,Hawkensian,"'Gummo' has a peculiar, candid realism that captivates",6,28 November 2012,"'Gummo' is a very strange little film. Its documentary realism is rather captivating, the bizarre people we see appear to be completely real. There's no plot to speak of, its just an insight into underclass America. The filthy circumstances these people live in will make you cringe, as will their moronic forms of socialising, which includes cheered-on chair smashing.The film is certainly laced with pretension, and there are pointless scenes that just reek of 'art-house'. I can understand why some people wouldn't like it; it's non-linear, quirky narrative is very likely to polarise audiences. However, I found the veritable aberrance of the film undeniably interesting. While 'Gummo' isn't that good, its candid realism makes its uneventful narrative quite engrossing; it may well be the most peculiar film you ever see.",Gummo

Most of the time I'll give a 3-4 star rating if there was some kind of effort put into the film.

Boys kill cats, sniff glue, and smash things. Girls shave their eyebrows completely and put tape on their nipples.

What a premise. Gummo is a rather pointless tale that shocks the viewer with an onslaught of horrendous images and characters.  It's hard to forget Gummo and it definitely isn't the feel good movie of the year.

40,jcslawyer,Overrated and boring,4,3 April 2020,I barely remember much about this forgettable pretentious film. I do remember being bored and it didn't catch my attention or pull me in. I give it credit for atmosphere and acting. I don't even care that there's not really a story. It's just not a film I found particularly interesting.

41,PeterJackson,Why bother?,2,29 September 2000,"I've never given a ""1"" to a film on the IMDB, and won't do it this time, but this film sure comes close to it. It's one of one those typical ""what were they thinkin' of?"" movies. I can understand that many people find this movie plotless or pointless, but in my opinion there always is a point and plot. Just a bit more difficult to find it in this waste of time. You can't say this film is a study about life in an ordinary Godforsaken town, just look at the characters: there isn't one ""normal"" character in this, nor a character with real emotions. It's not shocking either(I think that was the point), just plain boring. There are so many scenes where you just sit and think: ""Hmmm, strange, weird, dumb, ... . Now what?"" Those are the only words that pop into mind when you watch this.The only (slightly) interesting thing about it is to see Chloë Sevigny(not much screen time however), who obviously has a taste for these independent little films. However, she hasn't  chosen a good one yet: the slightly overrated BOYS DON'T CRY, the unconvincing AMERICAN PSYCHO, TREES LOUNGE(nothing special), ... But this film is surely her worst to date. She's not a bad actress, but hey, I think Michelle Pfeiffer is one of the best and how many classics has she made?So, just skip this one if it plays on TV, maybe not because it's a bad film, but because I can't imagine who would want to see several cats getting tortured. I hope none of these animals were hurt during the making of this film, but many people who watch this sure will be. 2/10(maybe for the occasional good music, although totally inappropriate)",Gummo

You feel like your in the actual city and homes of these people.The one drawback is that the storyline diverges too far at times.

45,Tom Murray,If you love Unique and Original then Gummo is for you.,8,16 September 2002,"A few years ago, I ordered the set of the six string quartets by Béla Bartók, which had been recommended to me by a friend, around forty years ago as his favourite music. I hated them, or at least most of them; they seemed to be purely chaotic. I listened again for the parts that I had liked and found that I liked more this time. As this process continued, they eventually became my favourite music and I listened to them almost daily for the next six months. What a shame it would have been had I acted on my first reaction and returned them. I would never have become familiar enough with them to learn to love them. The same thing happened when I watched Gummo for the first time, except that I liked more of it. Some critics hated Gummo but others loved it; the critics varied from 0% to 100% (see http://us.imdb.com/Reviews/171/17125); I wonder if a second viewing with an open mind, would have improved that score. If you love the unique and unusual, you could love this, otherwise it could go either way. I rented it on a free coupon so that I would not feel bad if it were a waste. I was delightfully surprised. The director, Harmony Korine, has said that he wanted to show people visions unlike any that they have seen before. He definitely succeeded at that: an albino girl telling of her feelings for Patrick Swayze; a boy, who always wears a cap with large rabbit ears, playing a concertina while seated on a toilet; two deaf people having a loud argument; a retarded girl who is loving and lovable, talking about her babies (her dolls); a party where furniture is torn apart, etc. Although set in Xenia, Ohio, Gummo was filmed in Nashville Tennessee because, I suspect, they would have been run out of town in Xenia, which is certainly not glorified in any way and is not even accurately portrayed, especially the accent. On April 3 and 4, 1974, a terrible storm hit the USA and spawned 148 tornadoes from Tennessee to Ohio, two of which joined together and hit Xenia (see http://www.april31974.com/ for the details). Xenia was half destroyed along with many of the people. It was hit again in 2000. Gummo fictionally portrays Xenia as never having recovered and still being dysfunctional. Gummo is a fascinating film with some very interesting scenes and with several scenes that were too long. Rather than a continuous narrative, it is a series of vignettes, some of which seem unrelated to the rest of the film. From a plot point of view, they would be, but as part of an overall view, they are integral. Many scenes look as if they were from a documentary or cinema vérité and others look like home movies: all done on purpose. The cinematographer worked for one-quarter of his usual stipend because he liked the film and its director so much. The language and actions are quite coarse but the film gives a strong impression of the lives of the white trash in a town in Ohio. If one thinks of it as a documentary or a collage, it does produce a powerful impression. Only five actors were experienced; the rest were rounded up from the general public in a very short time. The film was shot in a very short time. It won four awards. The culture of the characters is so different than mine that it was like visiting a foreign land with foreign customs and a language that sounds a only a little like the English that I know. The background music goes from Bach to Rock. There is little there to do and many people lead aimless lives. The young people spend much of their time riding bicycles, killing stray cats to sell to the local Chinese restaurant, smoking, drinking and sniffing glue. Gummo also depicts incest, depression, sex, sexual perversions, prostitution and sadism but it does so in a roundabout manner, without being too graphic. If you choose to watch it, open your mind and just let the visions roll by.",Gummo
46,Squrpleboy,White-Trash Magnolia,8,7 December 2003,"Without a doubt, Harmony Korine's GUMMO is one of the worstmovies I've ever seen......but also one of the most beautifully made,and purposefully realized.  It's like a car crash: twisted, ugly,sickening in so many ways, yet utterly mesmerizing andenveloping of the viewer's senses.  And it shows that beauty existsin the very simplest, mundane and awful of existences.Imagine going home and hanging out with any of the guests aftera taping of The Jerry Springer Show and you know what you're infor with this film.  Racist, lethargic, uneducated, ugly, morallycorrupt, poverty-ensconced folk from a town that barely cares theywere hit by a tornado a few years previous, and doing nothing torebuild the lives they never had. Gut-wrenchingly real, andunfortunate. But every individual presented in the course of the filmis so utterly entrancing in the way they look, to what they say anddo, to the way they build up and interact in a story so sparse itreads as documentary, yet so surreal you pray it's complete fiction. It's not: This is the ""American Heartland"" splayed open in full.Ugliness aside (and the film is nothing if not ugly, both in visualsand emotion), GUMMO is a brilliant piece of filmmaking regardlessof what most might say to the contrary.  Korine has taken the sameinexplicable lack of moral grounding that was so preciselycaptured in his writing on KIDS (1995) and brought it down to alevel of realism so believable that one cannot help but benegatively effected in watching it (anyone with a conscience thatis).  He seamlessly casts and directs performances out ofcomplete amateurs, alongside professional actors (ChloeSevigny, Max Perlich), so as it becomes almost impossible todiscern them from each other in the mix. Composing a stirringmelange of grimy yet richly colourful scenes; film, video and stillphoto snippets; a tossed salad of death-metal, silence and folkmusic; clear and intense cinematography, and doing so with suchsuccinctness as to seem as if we were living in that worldourselves, praying to get out.  If you are bored watching GUMMO itis because Korine has made you bored, if you are grossed out byGUMMO, disgusted, enraged, sickened, or perversely tickledsomehow it is certainly because the director knew how and whatto do to get you there.  A considerable feat for any artist, let alone a23 year old.I wouldn't recommend this film to very many people I know, and attimes I wonder why I watch it again myself, but I am truly thankful itexists.  GUMMO slapped me in the face and made me see thebanality, desperation and repugnancy that some people choose orare forced to live with, and yet also made me realize that somebeauty can be found even in that.  One beautiful rose does notmake a whole garden, but life continues to abound despite it.8/10.  So far ahead of it's time we may never catch up.",Gummo
47,maxastree,Student film filler with two decent jokes,2,22 August 2017,"Harmony Korine has hung onto some kind of entirely constructed ""hipster"" status since the 1990's, based on his claim that while skateboarding he met someone big in film and pitched an edgy, youth- oriented story idea, and secondly through verbally offered association with art film directors and appearing in advertising/youth culture handout's like VICE magazine.Harmony Korine's film ""Gummo"" is: a non-narrative black comedy about poverty and alienation in a very small town in Ohio, destroyed by freak weather incidents. The film is, also, neither funny or emotionally moving. Occasionally models or other *hipsters* (if that's still a valid term) name drop his films among better quality releases, as if his solidarity with poverty and American suffering is somehow valid. The truth is that Harmony Korine is a social conservative: his films all play off of the same riffs and themes that the Youth of Today are mislead, transgressive, shocking, out of control, unloved etc. He might as well be making films for a conservative family values center.Films are valid if the emotional and dramatic reward is there for an audience, not because of the directors posturing and this film is particularly slight in it's construction, and somewhat forgettable.",Gummo
48,latherzap,Zzzzzzzz...,3,1 September 2002,"Among people who dislike this movie, there are two camps- 1. people who are offended by it, and 2. people who were bored silly by it.  I belong to the second group.    The movie zooms in on a small economically depressed town, and follows the residents there as they each struggle to find purpose in life- or at least entertain themselves to pass the time. Not much plot.  That might be fine, but the movie also has boring non-characters, no momentum, and virtually nothing interesting is said or happens. Watch some kids ""shoot"" a boy with a toy gun, stand over him swearing for what seems like ETERNITY. Watch the shaven-head brothers self-consciously slap/fight for ETERNITY. See a group of shouting friends destroying a chair at a party for ETERNITY. Occasionally an interesting image floats to the surface (the kid eating spaghetti in the tub filled with black water) but that hardly makes up for the rest of the film.   Why do people like Gummo? I think for most Gummo advocates, this was the first time they made an effort to watch something that wasn't mainstream. To their cinematically inexperienced eyes, the mere fact that this movie was not fluffy and happy automatically qualified it as ""genius"".  Lots of positive Gummo reviews feature comments along the lines of ""well, at least it wasn't the same old Hollywood garbage. I'm the only person in the country who realizes how formulaic most movies are. Gummo is too much reality for most people..."" blah blah blah.    And you know, it's really funny when an IMDB member gushes praise for Gummo, and you click on the author name to learn that they are simultaneously calling Friday the 13th Part 5 a ""gem"" of a horror film .

The kids in the town indulge in all kinds of deviant activities in order to pass the time and entertain themselves, as well as make money. It seems as though the director thought about the most disgusting, depressing and depraved things he could, and then threw them all into a film, I can appreciate that, for the sake of imagination, but this film was nearly unwatchable. It wasn't really one part, or scene in particular that did it, but was the entire film as a whole was uniquely disturbing.

There is no plot in this movie, I know that is intentional and that is the point, but still without a plot I don't care. There is not even a slight resemblance of a plot anywhere. No characters you could even attempt to understand or sympathize with. I saw this movie twice because I read that Herzog liked it and I assumed I had somehow missed something. Suffered through it again to realize I even hated it more than I remembered.Its hard to even review this film, nothing happens but a few strange occurrences, a kid works out to light weights, his mom gives some monologue.

But don't take my word for it, because it really is a film that needs to be seen before you can decide whether you'll like it or not. And if you don't hate it, you'll love it.As you'll gather from all the other reviews, there is no narrative. There is no character development. There is no continuation. There is no theme. In large sections, there is no dialogue. It really is just a series of images that occasionally have words in them. It is, to some extent, the white trash, low budget version of Kooyanisqatsi.The director, Harmony Korine, also wrote Kids. Kids had a storyline of sorts (at least in comparison with this), and the film focused on one reasonably small group of characters throughout. And yet, Kids is nothing compared to this. Kids is boring because nothing happens at all, and it's the same nothing throughout the entire film. Nothing happens in Gummo either, but watching the nothing can leave you glued to the screen sheerly because of the sense of nothingness.

Clarke is viewed negatively because he shows too much erotic shots of teen's bodies in his movies. i don't think this is perverted, but is there to showcase what youth is all about, which is 'sex.' it's not put out as child porn or out of the director's own lusts.if you hate rednecks and hicks and people from the south in general, and love to see em ripped on, this movie is for you because that's exactly what it aims to do! the problem with it though is that it's too short. this guy aims to direct in a way that makes life look sh't, but it a somewhat beautiful, mystical way. after seeing this, I'm not sure i have any incentive to visit the south. i try not to believe stereotypes are true, but through experience, i have discovered 75% of the time these preconceptions with people from different parts of the country or what not are actually true.anyway, 5.7/10- not as good as Kids or Bully, but it's wrote by the same guy, so if you liked Kids or Bully, then you probably have to see this!",Gummo

56,Skeptic459,A film should be like a rock in a shoe.,7,24 January 2004,"After hearing so much about Gummo, I was really wondering what side of the argument I would be on for this film. Is this film a honest look at urban decay or is it an exploitative piece of trash? Well after seeing it  I would say Gummo is a flawed piece of art. Maybe I am psychologically disturbed but I really enjoyed this film. The statement above is a quote from Lars Von Trier. I use it for two reasons. One being that Harmony Korine is obviously influenced by Dogme 95. The wobbling camera, the decision to go for absolute naturalism in the setting. I also see elements of Godard, John Waters and Andy Warhol. This latter influence is interesting because Warhol also gathered weirdo's for his films. This was much to his detriment when he met Valerie Solanis. Korine is undertaking something similar. Lets us hope that none of his subjects decide to shoot him! Although some of the reviewers on this site would certainly enjoy that.   The second reason that I use this quote is because I cannot remember a film that made me so uncomfortable. This film is truly like having a rock in your shoe. There is a relentless push-pull effect in this movie. The filth, the inbred, red neck populace all push the viewer away. But despite the repugnance of the setting you are drawn to these people and  their lives. Korine seems to saying that life is beautiful, although beauty is not the first thing that comes to mind when watching this film. I really like the way Korine filmed Gummo. The sequences that played like home movies were very cool and worked well. They worked so well that I thought I was reading these characters case studies like I was an investigator of some kind.
 The acting is pretty so-so. The scene with those kids pretending to be the town Sheriff who shoot the rabbit-boy stands out to me. Is this a comment on how hate, racism and bigoted behaviour can start very early on? It is almost like this is a behavioural script the children are playing out because they have observed it happening in their elders. Chloe Sevigny is almost unrecognizable with that bad dye job. But I thought her performance was really good. Also, how many mullets can be in one film? Do places like this actually exist? I am taking it that this is based on a real town. Isn't this Korine's home town? I saw Ken Park and this was a film that just didn't work. This was mostly because the film became too self-indulgent. This is exactly the same problem here. The film is fundamentally flawed because Korine cannot reign himself in. You want to show urban decay? Well, fine. But do it in such a way that is consistent. What really bugged me is that Korine is determined to get a reaction by showing the viewer fouler and fouler things. After a while the viewer just blocks it out or tunes out. Some of the things don't even bother to make sense. For example, in a chair wrestling match you have an African American dwarf standing around watching. Why? This just seems like an attempt to turn the movie into a freakshow, which I guess this is. But you don't have to be so obvious about it!  The other problem with the film is that it has an overall feeling of nihilism. The characters are observed but there are certainly no resolutions formed. The film has a kind of existential angst. Notice the Madonna song, Like a Prayer, 'life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone.' Someone pass me Sartre  It seems to say that life is absurd and offers no solutions to the characters on how change can be achieved. As a result of these factors the film is always going to have charges of exploitation thrown at it. I can't remember who said it but it was either Peter Greenaway or Francois Truffaut that said you can only have 20-30 percent experimental stuff in a movie before you lose your audience. Korine has gone for the experimental side of things and as a result has lost everyone.   To me, the image that is the entire film is the kid with the bunny rabbit ears playing the accordian in the toilets. This strange image is very striking, disturbingly original and all at the same time kind of repugnant. This is Gummo.  Harmony Korine is undoubtedly a talented guy. I look forward to his future films. But Harmony, how about a story mate? Also, stop getting so excessive. Remember Bresson? Less can sometimes be more. This film is good but not great, 7 out of 10.  Excess is allegedly the American way. Gummo is more evidence of this.",Gummo
57,directjw,Like a joyride in a carnival freakshow!,10,20 October 1999,"First let me get one thing straight. . . not all movies have to have a PLOT to be good.  Films rely on so many other aspects besides plot to convey a mood, such as the visuals, the music, the acting, the editing.  If you want plot, go read a book.  There, now that that's over with, I can get on with my review.  Gummo is one hell of a movie.  Watching it is like going to the freakshow at a circus, which on the surface may appear frightening. However, what makes Gummo so much more than a ""shock"" movie (as so many people seem to think it is) is its non-judegemental tone on the various ""freakish"" characters on display.Like a good anthropologist, Harmony Korine presents the various characters in Gummo without criticizing or placing value judgements on them. . . he just lets them be themselves.  By doing this, Harmony is actually doing something quite revolutionary in filmmaking. . . by letting his actors improvise their scenes, he allows the actors to express themselves without worrying about whether or not the director approves of their ""acting.""  So, in a sense, Harmony Korine is trying to bring a new ""realism"" to cinema, without the restraints of either cinematic techniques (i.e. lighting, camera angles, setting up the scene) or the dictatorial control of the director.So, that, in essence is why Gummo is such a breakthrough movie.  Perhaps so many people hate Gummo because they're not used to seeing such a revolutionary movie.  As Freud once said, ""we hate that which we don't understand.""So, open up your mind, and I'm sure you'll see what a great film Gummo is.",Gummo
58,SanderStrijbos,"Strange, but it pays off",7,31 January 2002,"Gummo is not an average film. It is no film with a solid story-line either. Gummo plays in Xenia, Ohio where a tornado struck several years ago and the town people never really got over it. The film is a collection of loose scenes containing people and their (sometimes strange) behavior.Korine observes his cast, which mostly consists of amateurs. He doesn't judge them or ridicules them - which is often easy to do, but Korine loves his characters.Most of the film is shot with digital hand-held camera, which provides the film with a documentary-style look and sometimes I had to ask myself if I wasn't watching a documentary, especially at the moments when some of the characters seem to talk straight into the camera.The brilliance of Korine really comes onto the screen near the end, the sequence with Roy Orbison's 'Cryin'' on the soundtrack. That's - in my opinion - the best part of the film and it states the message of the film: In the end, it will stay the same. Nothing changes.Like a fellow-commenter said: ""It's a film to see with an open mind.""",Gummo
59,andrewhumphreys9968,Gummo - 9/10,9,5 September 2020,"Harmony Korine's ""Gummo"" goes well out of it's way to shock, offend and provoke a reaction, there's a handful of disturbing scenes throughout and almost every frame has something, or someone, strange to gawp at. The soundtrack, visual style and set design all combine to make this film a very unique watch, if you can get past the oddities and the animal abuse.There's not really a plot that runs through the movie, it feels more like Korine's taking you on a tour of this town, showing you it's residents and what they get up to. There's also a lot of eerie home-video footage intercut throughout, which helps make the film feel more authentic. The character's themselves are all strange and memorable, with Sol from the poster and the Bunny Boy being the most synonymous with the film. Watch the film at your own risk, I'd say it is slightly exploitative and it handles subjects like rape, disability, racism and pretty much anything else you can think of, without much care for political correctness.The film is always grounded in reality, but it manages to feel incredibly surreal due to almost everything in it being out-of-the-ordinary for most people. Even it's soundtrack is one of the strangest mash-ups of music I've heard, going from the sludgy sounds of Sleep in one scene, to the upbeat tones of 1950s Buddy Holly in another. There's also a lot of satanic imagery throughout, including the opening title's font and the long, thin upside down cross, but it all fits with the soundtrack and nihilistic tone of the movie.Korine was clearly trying to shock people with this, if not offend, but that didn't stop him from making a good movie and it works really well despite it's lack of narrative or plot. Everything that goes into the movie reflects the aimlessness and frustration's of its characters, making for a very bleak, hopeless watch. The fairly well-known bath scene is equal parts revolting and fascinating, especially considering this is the character, Sol's, norm, but at least it means he's not out brutalising cats.",Gummo

When I left, I was pretty confused but I figured that Gummo was one of the things you had to make if you were gunning for a spot in Nirvana close to Andy Warhol.Classic post script (probably could have found a spot in a DVD extra if I'd filmed it): The same friend I saw the film with and I bumped into the midget from the arm-wrestling scene directly across the street from the theater we saw it in.

Their hatred for big budget Hollywood blockbusters seems to cloud their thinking of ""art house"" flicks. Any film with the ""art house"" tag attached to it is safe from any real hard critiquing. Regardless, a film should have something intriguing, entertaining, or relevant to it. GUMMO has none of it. The characters are there, not engaging or endearing. Some of it is entertaining but not enough of it to commend. It's more hateful than anything. The style of filming is invisible. It just shoots whatever. No techniques of filmmaking whatsoever. Korine's JULIEN DONKEY BOY seems like CITIZEN KANE in style compared to this, but GUMMO is utterly useless as a film. People calling it beautiful or compelling don't know why they are calling it. Ask them and they will cop out. GUMMO is what it is- a piece of filth disguising itself as an art house flick to escape any real critiques. A director has alot of responsibilites. He has a plan to fulfill, a blueprint to realize, actors to motivate, stories to create and a quality of relevance to add.

Using a mix of professional and nonprofessional actors, the lives of those who make up the lower socio-economic strata of Xenia, Ohio, are played out in squalor and absurdity.  For those who doubt such characters exist in real life, I have three words: Ohio River Valley.  Having lived in the southern parts of Ohio and Indiana for 11 years, I can attest that there are indeed such folks. Doubters should also compare the characters in ""Gummo"" with the real-life participants of Steve James's documentary ""Stevie"" (2002), set in southern Illinois.

66,Beaumont-4,GUMMO ROX!,10,1 December 1999,"Gummo is probably the best artistic film ever made, even though most of my favorite movies are from Hollywood or are foreign. But this truly is art. Instead of having a plot or whatever, we are left with a random mosiac of images. Some funny, some disgusting, some sick and twisted, some bizarre, but most of all, the images are disturbing (unlike Harmony's last effort, Kids) because of what they all do. In Kids, all we see is smoking and drinking. In Gummo, we see smoking, drinking, sex, killing stuff, rolling in mud and eating it, killing more stuff, and doing things I didn't know human beings were capable of actually doing. It's like a painting, Mr. Korine goal is to leave us with an impression afterwards. And it's different for everybody. Some hate it, some love it, and the critics don't know one way or another because they are too busy scanning for a plot. Not everybody is going to like this film, I can understand, because everyone sees things differently. Some people see this as white trailer-trash, and some people see it as a masterpiece (me included). This being only one of 2 art films that are actually good in my opinion (the other is Marie Baie Des Anges).As for the title, Gummo, I saw in a Dave Letterman interview with Harmony, that Gummo was the 5th Marx brother. He says ""It's just a title I liked."" And I agree, but in my own personal opinion, Gummo was the 5th Marx brother. We never saw the 5th Marx brother.

I've just read all the User Comments here, and these are apparent:  Obviously GUMMO *is* art, because so many people hate this movie and so many people love it.  Just like art.  Those people who hated this movie and, therefore, object to it being called ""art"" are those kind of people who must like ""nice art"" like pretty seascapes, happy clowns and - yuck - ""crafts.""  It will also be fun to remind these sort of people of Hitler's campaign for ""moral art:"" it was all mundane.  (And look at the genuis of ""immoral artists"" such as Kirchner and Max Beckmann.) Gummo is pretty damned immoral: animal abuse, granny killing, cat torture, and so on.

I don't know why, but I felt something familiar in this guy.  That's great art.  My favorite image: hard to say, there are so many great ones, but I find myself thinking nonstop about the boy turning askew the pictures on the wall, and when he lifts the family portrait, cockroaches scuttle from underneath.

The film also invokes the courage displayed in Salo by Pasolini, in it's unflinching, yet disturbing portrayal of class levels and horrific imagery. People like these exist in  places the world over, and maybe Harmony Korine is making a statement about class levels, and societal acceptance and exposure of the outcast, whatever he did, he has managed to display an underbelly of underexposed Americana, that probably needs to be brought to light in order to improve the lives of people in despair and poverty.",Gummo

72,juanathan,Mr. Herzog What Are You Thinking?,2,14 July 2005,"Gummo is definitely an interesting film to watch. I watched it really because I wanted to know what side of the Gummo fence I was on. I can honestly say I absolutely loved about 15% of the movie but absolutely hated the rest. Some people think it is vile exploitive trash while others think it is a modern masterpiece. Even though I am on the negative side, I really do not agree with what the anti- Gummo people think.I really did not think it was exploitive at all. I definitely agree with the director in saying that it is not exploitive if these people know what they are doing and willingly agree to do it. Kind of like pornography and the women who perform in it. I have to say there are about five scenes(out of the dozens of scenes) that I thought were great. One in particular being the final Roy Orbison scene. It is truly a brilliant piece of cinema.I can go on and on about what is wrong with this film. The script is terrible any attempts at dark comedy flop pathetically. The dialog is extremely wooden and does not seem real. The film casts non actors (which worked well in films like Stroszek and George Washington) but in this backfires. The actors here are painfully bad even the leads. The annoying narrative style which consists of the two main leads killing cats and then going to people's houses and we get our little back story about the homeowners. Scenes go way way way too long. Basically, the whole movie does. You will be amazed on how many pointless scenes there are. I do not know why everybody is so amazed on how the director combined the super 8 and polaroids into the film. To me, it just felt like something to take up time and was ultimately pointless. Even though I hate using this word, but I believe this is the only way to explain the scenes: self indulgent and pretentious. The scenes I am saying are the ones where you get one of the characters giving their little commentaries on their lives.The thing that upset me the most was the directing style. Although before I said I did not think it was exploitive, there were a lot of things that upset me about it. By casting the people he did, it felt to me like he was saying, "" look at me, these are how real people and these people are so low in life."" Some parts it felt like he was rubbing salt into a wound. You see people cutting themselves, whipping cats to death, and worshiping Satan while heavy metal music is playing. It really hit me when the final beautiful scene and you heard the music. You will have to see it to believe it. It was just so insincere.Watch it out of curiosity.",Gummo
73,erniemunger,US indie fluff at its worst,1,8 January 2006,"Amid a slur of controversy, aptly launched by a string of indie directors enthralled by Harmony Korine's previous movie, Kids, the newly declared genius director was encouraged to deliver yet another account of life in white trash America, set in a fictional town hit by a tornado. Rather than following a classic plot line, Korine paints loose episodes that were strung up to form an kaleidoscopic picture of the hopeless ennui that he claims has taken hold of the underdog classes in the US. But what all too obviously sets out to convey a shocking representation of the underrepresented in an apocalyptic society is by no means more than the pathetic yelp of a premature tween, deeply in love with Kurt Cobain and, mainly, himself. While Kids may have had a raw and unaltered intensity about it  the emphasis being on the word ""may""  this follow-up is way too constructed to claim the virtues of innocence, ranging from the clumsily composed stills to the half-scripted dialogues and acting, which pay tribute to Korine's exalted brainwaves rather than a reality, however constructed or abstracted. Inebriated by his supposed artistry, Korine shows considerable contempt for his subjects, to judge f.i. from a scene where he stars himself, pretending to expose his inner bleedings to a black gay midget (no less) while trying to convince the man to have sex with him. By accumulating embarrassing and flawlessly boring scenes, our whiz kid ends up with a classic freak show, a both unreflected and utterly pretentious piece of fake cinéma d'auteur which owes credit to his great mentor Gus van Sant, who himself is often mistaken for an untypical (implying: great) filmmaker. It is interesting to note that, apart from the Sundance circuit, Korine found widespread acceptance in the contemporary art world, part for his use of video in film and part for the alleged critical stance of his films. In both cases, the art hipsters have failed to notice that noteworthy experimental film is usually characterised by a rare quality  reflected purpose, that is. Korine is typical US artsy fluff, and anyone with intellectual expectations and curiosity will leave it to the MoMA curators of this world to figure out why anyone is supposed to bother with a brain midget's poetry album of mainstream American teenage mal de vivre.",Gummo

75,anteksw,Intriguing Showcase,8,18 February 2015,"I found this film whilst blandly browsing through IMDb in the look for interesting movies, as I usually do. Initially, the synopsis and trailer of the film alone intrigued me significantly, additionally, as I briefly read a few short critic/audience reviews... my curiosity increased even further as most critics seemed to disregard the film due to its topic, whereas the audience discovered more. Although, as usual, I also had initial doubts about the evidently strange style the film undertakes. The so-called ""art house"" genre very often seems to be explored on either a very profound and effective level, or simply on a pretentious ""open for interpretation"" approach. My sceptical feelings about 'Gummo' were initially evoked around the fact it may undertake the latter approach due to numerous reasons, but predominantly due to the director's reputation and filmography.First of all, I believe it is vital to approach this film with a very open mind... there are touching as well as controversial moments, both of which are explored in a fairly appropriate manner; nor downplayed or exaggerated. However, there are a few character actions/motives which do feel slightly exaggerated simply for the sake of exploiting controversy and thus potential shock value. Thankfully, this is very minimal and did not distract from the emotional aspect of the film as I'm sure I would end up hating this film if the focus was entirely on exploiting controversy, which is what certain critics seem to suggest. A factor which supplemented this was the somewhat jarring utilisation of documentary conventions; initially the film seems to be unsure of what it's trying to be and seems to randomly incorporate found footage along with interview-like scenes for character development. However, as the film progresses, these seemingly unfitting conventions start to complement each other naturally and form an unconventional yet strangely realistic narrative, introducing new personalities constantly which I instantly became invested in.Most of the actors pull off a good job, all of the performances felt convincing enough and some of the characters' snippets of narration were executed very well, and thus allowing me to effectively 'absorb' their unique personalities better. Surprisingly, Korine himself starred in one of the segments, but unfortunately overacted his small role quite significantly to the point where the actual subtext of the segment felt overdone. Speaking of subtext, the entire film is woven with daring and extremely intriguing themes throughout, some of which include desensitisation, acceptance, self-analysis and for the most part, attempting to live an enjoyable and fulfilling life in arguably one of the most unfulfilled places stricken by poverty.One of the main reasons why 'Gummo' worked for me was due to its unusual exploration of what you can simply label as 'outcasts'. Thankfully, it took a suitable approach when exploring these potentially damaged people, as well as mentally challenged people. I personally despise the mockery of such individuals on film, or anywhere in fact, so I was continuously anxious about the film shifting into the comedic route simply for demeaning purposes. Instead, the film showcases these individuals and their raw emotions in its distinctive style and after its halfway mark, utilises the documentary conventions more successfully in order to create its overriding tone of harsh reality.In conclusion, 'Gummo' is an intriguing and thought-provoking experiment in film making which requires a very open-minded audience. Without trying to give the film more credit than it deserves, I do believe it is ahead of its time in terms of what it explores and how it's presented. Each character isn't ever fully developed, however each character was extremely evocative as I was completely invested in every story and representation. This was mainly due to the compelling themes the film chooses to explore, and furthermore providing a great deal of hidden meaning. However, whether these 'hidden meanings' were intended or whether I was simply reading into the film too much... I do not know. It is truly a unique film, and it's certainly difficult to recommend as it does require a very avid and open-minded approach; definitely not a film that the general public would enjoy, but certainly a film the general public should examine.",Gummo

I believe this is just a fairly sad attempt at trying to be ""arty"". Don't get me wrong I enjoy a good film be it typical blockbuster or small independent, the money put into a film doesn't really matter - story does. You have to ask yourself why was this film made?

79,Rosser94,Gummo is unique but negated by its non-engaging narrative,5,29 April 2012,"""Gummo"" is not the type of movie most people would enjoy (myself included). It attains a style that gives it a documentary style and the lack of any clear direction results in it feeling like an assortment of random events.In terms of what I do credit ""Gummo"" for, the honesty of it allows it to be undeniably shocking at points and its unique, peculiar characters make it in some ways intriguing. Furthermore, the cast is relatively weak, yet every actor pulls of a believable, solid performance, some of which evoke limited but evident moments of humour.However, the number of issues I had with this movie prevents it from being one I rate highly. Firstly, the pacing is incredibly odd. There seems to be no sense of progression or direction at any point in the movie and this gives it a lack of purpose. Furthermore, the characters were all very difficult to relate to; as a result, it hard to empathise with them, or to show any real interest in their predicaments and fates. In addition to this, there were a lot of insignificant moments that were dragged out in this movie that made it feel incredibly mundane; it began to feel like such events were used merely as time-fillers.Overall, I feel that whilst ""Gummo"" is a unique and honest experience, it lacks a sense of direction that renders it as a relatively pointless narrative. Furthermore, the lack of characterisation forces the audience away from the action-on-screen instead of engaging them and allowing them to relate to the characters, which is a major flaw for this type of movie. If, like me, you wish to watch ""Gummo"" purely because the concept intrigues you, then try it for 30minutes and see how you feel, because there is no change in style, direction or purpose for the remainder of the running time.",Gummo
80,matrixj23,Visionary White Trash Art from Korine...,10,17 January 2007,"So many wonderful moments... The first time I watched 'Gummo' is permanently etched into my mind. It was one of those rare and incredible sensory experiences that stay with you. Like the first time you hear 'Bitches Brew' or see 'Requiem For A Dream'. 'Gummo' is not your typical Hollywood film; its non-linear flow really turns some people off. Not every film needs a cogent story arc...'Gummo' is more a series of vignettes and unique characters, filmed beautifully by Jean-Yves Escoffier. He viewed white-trash suburbia (outer Memphis) through foreign eyes as if it was a third-world country or an alien landscape. It is presented to the viewer lovingly here. The retarded, mullets, and the disturbed denizens of Xenia, Ohio are beautifully combined in a surreal stew of glaring reality...At times, 'Gummo' has the feel of a documentary (possibly it is). There are few 'proper' actors in this film and that definitely adds to the charm. Korine claims to have assembled most of his cast in approximately 45 minutes from Memphis Burger Kings and Laundromats. Nick Sutton (Tummler) was discovered by Harmony on a talk show that pertained to 'paint-sniffing survivors'- he commented that anyone who can survive copious amounts of inhalants must have a good constitution and that those were the kinds of people he wanted to work with...Much has been made of the shocking nature of this film. But really how shocking are animal abuse, inhalant intoxication, and the exploitation of the retarded? It was all simulated (probably not the inhalant usage though) for this film. These things happen every day...Korine has a knack for letting the camera naturally flow places it has likely never been. There is an indescribable aura permeating virtually every frame of this wondrous creation. It is one of my favorite movies...What is 'Gummo' about? Korine basically follows Tummler & Solomon (Nick Sutton & Jacob Reynolds); two lost teenage boys as they go about the business of amusing themselves, having milkshakes, and staying sane in Xenia, Ohio. This is facilitated by indulging in inhalants, purchased with money obtained from selling dead cats to an unscrupulous store owner who then sells the felines to a Chinese restaurant. The camera also follows Helen, Darby, and Dot. Dot is played beautifully by Korine's girlfriend at the time, Chloe Sevigny who also handled the wardrobe for this movie. By the way, you will undoubtedly see some of the best dressed people ever in this film (and let us not forget the spectacular display of mullets)...A number of scenes from this one-of-a-kind film will stay with you long after watching it. The soundtrack is another highlight, for it is one of the best I have ever heard. The movie really wouldn't be the same without the exquisite soundtrack which includes Sleep's 'Dragonaut', Buddy Holly, Ray Orbison, Brujera, Eyehategod, and other delights...I can't recommend this movie to all. If you prefer big budget Hollywood fare and linear narrative, then please steer clear of this amazing film. However, if you are adventurous, artistic, and fascinated by the human animal in its natural habitat, then by all means see this incredible film...",Gummo

Moreover, the abscence of plot makes Gummo unique and unforgettable unlike most of the Oscar-nominated stinking slut-buckets.

All the characters are amazing, everyone has its own place in the movie. The mad female person with the doll for a baby. The rabbit boy, symbolizes good in the film, alone, cold, shot at, chased away. 
* Stupid humor - Gummo is not spposed to be a comedy and if someone watches it with the intention to laugh, he would be disappointed.

This film will either make you feel better about your life, depressed about theirs, or both.Unlike ""Roger & Me,"" this is a actual film and not a docudrama or real documentary. It's so well directed at points and so pointless in others, depending on your outlook, it's hard to say where it leaves you. It is a highly recommended film which I think betters ""Kids"" by simply letting go of any opinion in tries to make. Where Kids may leave you feeling hopeless, Gummo and his ""charismatic"" pal leave you with a small sense of hope. A feeling that when their ""lives"" in Ohio are forgotten and left behind that there is still the sense that they may overcome the problems their families and natural circumstances have left for them to solve on their own. They are capable of shining in a world of darkness. A Brilliant film. Period.",Gummo
84,Flowbeer,"Disturbed me in 1998, but I grew to respect its' ugliness...?",7,6 September 2009,"This disturbing, semi-documentary styled film kind of freaked me out when I first saw it (high, in 1998) but years later, I have now seen it in a different light. I still hate the crazy 'real' resident rednecks who talk smack about killing themselves, sticking firecrackers into the butts of cats and breaking up chairs in silly, childish tantrums; but with the 2 main characters, who seemed to be 'actors' as opposed to 'local talent', I didn't feel as repulsed any more. Nor by Cloe Svigny or even Max Perlic. These are Actors, playing sick & twisted characters, to be sure, but none of them were as disturbing as the other Xenia residents that were a shining example of the ugly underbelly of white trash society. I don't want to denigrate anyone, but those people really did give 'Southern whites' a bad image, in my opinion, kind of like the way ghetto trash makes people feel about other poor black people. I guess I just saw the honesty & accuracy of the way the film pictured these people. It would be great to see if anyone would ever have the nerve to show the inner-city ghettos showed in a similar, ugly way? I'd hate to think that the only 'trash' out there in America is rural, white and Southern!",Gummo
85,RichBuck,Just saw Gummo,7,2 January 2004,Gummo was very good.  I thought it was a documentary really.  The actors didn't come off as actors at all and I am sure that some of the people  used were just being themselves.  I thought the movie was very funny and honest.  People are actually like this in real life.  The music was put in the right places- I especially liked the bike scene at the beginning when the two boys were riding down the hill- the one kid looks like Johnny Rotten at 14. The reality of the film is rather depressing but this is what a lot of America is like- the grimy scene when the two boys get milkshakes was a great slice of the crappy culture that is much of the United States and of the world.  Very good film all around.  Nihilistic.,Gummo
86,eddie-177,Give the swine what they bellow for,9,1 June 2005,"If you've never lived in a small midwestern town (predominately white, predominately poor) then I suppose that the immediate power of this film would be lost on you, though it's really not that hard to translate the myriad of sick and twisted characters in Gummo to whatever community you live in. I have been a poor white person my entire life and although I've never come across a retarded girl being pimped out by her brother or a pair of kids killing cats to sell to a Chinese joint for meat, I have cut through the back yards and sat beneath the windows of the buildings where these kinds of things may very well have happened. They most likely didn't, of course. But they just might have...Gummo is a look at things that just might be. What Might Be going on down the street. What horrible secrets Might your neighbors Be hiding? We all play this game; we think of the worst things that people might do, and we hope, in a sick way, that they might actually be doing them.""Old Man Johnson, with the hook for the hand? You know he got that hook reaching into the woman's bathroom in the school, some girl took a knife and just cut it off."" ""The guy across the street, and I heard this from Judy who is friends with his ex-wife, she says that he used to dress up like a clown and give out candy, but one day he was caught with this little kid, doing stuff. What you mean, what kind of stuff. Dirty stuff, you know."" Sometimes these displays are ridiculous and funny, sometimes they're disgusting, and sometimes they're truly horrible, but they are always enthralling. Gummo is a series of these displays.No, there isn't a cohesive plot and I know that more than a few simple film goers will be genuinely confused and possibly even angered by this point (I might suggest that these people go watch some Buñuel, or at least try not to have such a narrow conception of film). Gummo really acts more like a portrait than a traditional film, playing on the viewer's emotions through characters instead of plot.There are no social or political implications to Gummo, which may lead to the mistaken but commonly-held belief that this is somehow an exploitation film. This is not a story of a town in need of a savior that will not come or even of problems that need to be solved. The lack of narrative ensures a lack of message: this is a neither a criticism nor a sympathetic portrait. It's a raw feed, without morals, and it's shot and acted so realistically that it might seem as if Korine were shoot a faux-documentary. The characters are just exaggerations of people that you may have come across, characters that you've already created--the ADD boy who plays tennis and has the world's coolest mullet, the young girls who put electric tape on their nipples to make them perkier, the creepy little glue-sniffing boys who murder housecats and pay to sleep with a retarded girl. These aren't real people and Korine doesn't want you to think that they are. They are merely what we've always thought our neighbors capable of and we've always, in a sick way, almost wanted to believe. Why else would urban legends stick around so long? Why else is most disgusting gossip usually the most interesting? Gummo gives us all what we want, unflinchingly, and doesn't ask to be thanked.",Gummo
87,Lexo-2,Film o' the Nineties (suppressed belch),10,27 August 1999,"A guy I know, more of a friendly acquaintance than a friend, raved to me about Gummo.  ""There's this scene,"" he said, ""when this bunch of people kick the crap out of a chair, nothing else happens in the scene, and it's brilliant, because the chair ... is ... life.""I watched it and he was telling the truth.  The main objections to it that I've heard are based on the objectors' distaste for the people in the film: I don't like this film because the people in it are horrible and boring. This is not a judgment on the film, but on the people who have the objection.  Gummo is true - after watching it, I looked out the window of my girlfriend's flat and saw the Dublin equivalent of the characters in it, hanging around a piece of ugly urban sculpture in the blazing sun, drinking two-litre plastic bottles of cider.  It was, in a bizarre sort of way, a beautiful moment.  (Though maybe not for the cider drinkers.)  I don't know what Harmony Korine is going to do next, but he never has to worry that he hasn't yet made a great film.",Gummo
88,matt-szy,covert apocalyptic science fiction tale,8,6 June 2006,"Harmony Korine has created a name for himself, a name almost as odd as his birth name. And his first directorial film, Gummo (1997), following his screenplay, Kids, which he wrote at 19, further carves out his relevance in today's cinema as one weird director. Once in a while characters come to prominence like Harmony and are greatly celebrated and severely criticized and consequently cause a stir of controversy. These characters mess with the medium in which they work, abandon what is normal practice, are uncompromising with their vision. Some people call these kinds of people artists. Some people call them jokes. Harmony's interview on Letterman can attest to at least his off kilter weirdness, if not an untreated bipolar disorder.But I like that about him.And I am reminded of two figures. The first is Andy Warhol. Definitely an experimenter, a madman of sorts, he worked inspired by impulse, channeling the consumerist world into art-entertainment-social critique. Maybe this hasty evaluation can be contested. Sure. The other figure is someone who I've never met and whose name I don't know. But when visiting the UCLA art museum during my last year of high school in dire hopes of getting accepted into that film school, I coincidently came across this person's art exhibit. This is what it was: a 40 ounce bottle of malt liquor filled halfway with water and floating atop of the water were a few Styrofoam packaging material things.I first imagined this individual to be a football playing jock type who put off his required art class final until the last minute. And in a necessity-is-the-mother-of-invention whim during his nightly bouts of drinking, with forty in hand, he came up with this art exhibit idea. I was angry. I felt cheated. I grinded my teeth and wanted to inflict harm on this individual or anything that could symbolize his existence: football, self proclaimed artists, Abercrombie & Fitch models, berets, the French. This moment lasted the length of time it takes to tie up a pair of Nikes. And it past. Then I felt awe. Maybe this person, I even granted them the title of artist in my mind at this point, intended for me to feel these things. If so it worked. How could I be sure? Alas, I cannot. Alas again, we are left with the question: what is art and what is trash? I have no answer. You may think you do. Harmony Korines existence, but more specifically his film Gummo, hinges on the brink of that space which separates the Andy Warhol and this no name jock from UCLA, trash from art.But I will throw an empty bottle, why not a forty, at his head that will cause him to firmly fall to the art side. Albeit deranged and at times random, this Harmony guy has revealed a unique and disturbingly entertaining vision in Gummo. Even Herzog, a visionary of cinema  without a doubt  is all about Harmony and his vision. When many films are rather similar and stale and stifled by plot or style a film like Gummo cries out, or rather gurgles, something like this: ""my huge and oddly shaped balls itch with furry, wanna see them up close?"" Then you see them. Maybe Herzog wouldn't agree completely with that but the idea is there.Watching Gummo, you will see this vision. And it's a disturbing vision not quite set in the past as much as in the future but mostly in some parallel world far from what we know. For example: two young characters who kill cats and sell them to the local deli owner. And they are not the only ones in the town working in this field. You will see Harmony being drunk and hitting on a black midget, proclaiming his loneliness. You will see a man pimping out his retarded sister. Women arm wrestling. Albinos. Chloë Sevigny as an albino, who looses her cat and can you guess why(one of few hints at a narrative form)? Guys fighting a chair. Glue sniffing. Bacon taped on bathroom walls. Shaved eyebrows. Tapped nipples. Are these things reminiscent, on a purely figurative way, of a forty bottle filled with water and Styrofoam? Maybe yes. These characters are illustrations or a caricatured embodiment of Harmony's own ideas of the world we live in - filling the landscape of this town, which is Xenia, Ohio. And maybe we can blame how they are the victims of a tornado that hit some time before. But it is not a normal tornado that only causes property damage. No. It is a tornado of spiritual chaos, a destructor of decency, which has left behind a morally devoid, meaningless wasteland. Sounds like science fiction. Herzog said that first.There is no solid story in Gummo. There are just happenings. Something in the vein of Linklater's Slacker. Something in the vein of Jim Carrols book  the film failed at adapting the essence of the aimless characters  Basketball Diaries.The film Gummo is a tribute to, or maybe just a tree house for, not necessary independent film-making but rather an independent vision. Harmony himself denies making independent films, instead calling it simply cinema. But simply cinema it is not. So with Gummo, and his other films, too, Harmoney Korine has made a name for himself. It's a weird name, and it is one of the most ambitiously unique ones at that. Whatever it is, it is interesting and cool. Maybe the kind of cool like when I second guessed myself and considered the possibly intended affect of the forty bottle with water and Styrofoam. Would Warhol even care? Probably not.8 out of 10.

89,gniandra,looking at pictures,7,4 January 1999,"I don't see what people's problems are with this movie. It's a very simple film. No plot, little acting. It's just a series of scenes that loosely follow different people. It's completely a piece of art. Who gives a crap about plot anyway. We need more things like this. It's the only movie of it's kind out there. Not movie, not documentary (although it looks like it at times when the *actors* make eye contact with the camera), just a bunch of scenes side by side. It's great there's not a name for it's kind, because it may be called a movie, and it may be shown in theaters and rented from your video store, but it's nowhere Hollywood has ever been before.",Gummo

Yet, I still can't explain why I was drawn to this movie.  GUMMO is very strange, very sadistic, and very comical.  Maybe that is all I needed to watch it.  Judge for yourself, but I gave this move a 1/10.  **side note**  the part with the albino girl dancing outside by her car in her work apron, has to be one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen.

It's supposed to be Xenia, Ohio.
Actually, the scene that made me the sickest was when Gummo, our water-headed pre-teen was taking a bath in the dirtiest water you've ever seen.  His sleazey little mother put a board over the old tub and began to feed him a plate of spaghetti, a big glass of milk, and a chocolate candy bar that moments before she'd bought at her front door from two African-am. kids who were pretending they were selling it for charity but laughed in private at the suckers who'd given them so much money.  Anyway, back to the tub... for some reason (maybe because it was just after MY dinner), seeing this little sleazey greazer eating and schlorping the pasta and sucking on the milk in a cheap plastic tumbler with Momma jutting her hips to the side.... I don't know... it was a magic moment and turned my stomach.See it if you're really really hip and really really cynical and really really in need of something twisted and different for an evening.

I enjoyed Kids and thought I'd give this movie a try. I watched about half but ended up turning it off. I had no problem with the content in the movie as is seen by a lot as questionable; i just turned it off because i was bored. There is no plot at all and it seems like a bunch of random things happen.

95,Tyferra,Boring as Batsh*t.,2,14 January 2009,"As soon as I was handed the DVD I could tell from the cover that I wouldn't enjoy this.So what if I had a bit of a predisposed disposition on this film? That doesn't take away from the fact that there was no plot, that there was no character development and that there was very little in the way of ANYTHING to even attempt at drawing the audience into the film. As far as I could tell it was a bunch of random scenes from certain people's lives spliced together in a way that made no sense, (and didn't even try to.) I'd say it was a pretentious film but that's probably not correct. I think more that the people who defend this film are the pretentious ones. This film may speak to those who like to look deep into a film and debate the finer points of it with other similarly minded people; I wouldn't know not really being among this type of person. However for everyone else it seems that there WAS no point and that anyone who spends time debating or trying to find the point of it is wasting their time.To summarise, there was nothing resembling a plot, there was nothing connecting you to the characters, there was no character development, there was no beginning, middle or end and although I can't necessarily blame the film for this; the subject matter wasn't exactly easy to watch. Watching this film is not an enjoyable experience.The one thing that redeemed it, (aside from the fact that it is fairly short,) and earned it two stars rather than one is that although it is as boring as Hell it's done with a certain style that, if you're like me, you'll actually be too f***ed off by the lack of any substance to fully appreciate.",Gummo
96,MichaelKamalEzzat,A Disturbing sincere dramedy,7,10 April 2020,A dark-humored messed-up sick tribute to all the instances of warmth in the hopeless world of the American people who missed the train of the American Dream.,Gummo
97,Catrician,An excellent masterpiece from Korine,9,11 April 2013,"1994 is oftentimes considered to be one of the best years for cinema, by both casual viewers, cinephiles, and hardcore film history buffs alike. We received films that would please all audiences; Zemeckis' ""Forrest Gump"", Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"", Kieslowski's ""Three Colours: Red"", Burton's ""Ed Wood"", Tarr's ""Satantango"", the list goes on. As such, it's easy to pass over a film that came out that year which, in reality, was quite influential, more so than some of the previously mentioned movies. That film was Clark's ""Kids"" (IMDb has it listed as 1995, but it premiered at film festivals in '94). While it was met with mixed reviews at the time (and mixed reviews now), it was seen as one of the first films that really had this bold statement about American youth, and that was that so many of them were these sex-addicted, hopeless stoners with meaningless lives. While Larry Clark directed this, Harmony Korine, 19 at the time, wrote the script and had a major influence on the film. Van Sant (whose film ""Elephant"", as I stated previously, makes him a more than capable director) cited that Korine would be ""the face of postermodern American directors"", and Werner Herzog (""Aguirre: The Wrath of God"") also gave similar praises. The partial writer for one film, however, doesn't get such praises. A mere three years later, Korine released what is known now to be one of the most unsettling, disturbing, and downright unusual films in the form of Gummo. Surprisingly enough, the critical reaction for Gummo has been worse than that of ""Kids"". A possible explanation for this is that ""Kids"" is simply more viewer-friendly. Any 30+ year old film buff with a decent taste could probably watch ""Kids"" and at least get a bit of perspective, while maybe questioning the youth of the nation.Gummo doesn't have any questions to ask though. It's more of a work of art that is absolutely disgusting to look at, yet fascinating in every way. So, for a comparison, it would be like if Van Gogh crashed two cars together at exactly 39.4 miles per hour, with them perpendicular to one another, with no wind in the air. It might seem pointless at first, but you may need to look a bit closer to truly analyze the themes of Gummo.The opening scenes describe how a tornado has destroyed the town of Xenia, Ohio, and we then begin viewing the residents of the town trying to find meaning in their pointless, hopeless, and overall miserable lives.Korine stated once that about 75% of Gummo was scripted. Upon rewatching the film, I can hardly determine where the realism starts and where the fiction ends. I've often times commended directors for having a sort of ""surrealism realism"" as Von Trier did so magically with his masterpiece ""Dogville"", and Korine takes it to a whole new level. The documentary feel adds to the film spectacularly because it forces the viewer to confront reality: that, somewhere in the world, there are people who behave as the characters in Gummo do.Even the name of Gummo is symbolic in a few ways. The name ""Gummo"" is named after the oldest of the Marx brothers, who were notable for their anarchist comedy, which Gummo is to some extent. However, the oldest Marx Brother never appeared on camera; he was always more indirectly involved with cinema. Korine, here, is stating that Gummo is something new; something cinema has literally never seen before, even if it has seen its ""relatives"" (""Kids"" possibly?)There are a number of assumptions that reviewers make when discussing the film; I'm not suggesting any of these are right or wrong, but they do exist. Some suggest that the town is made up of Satanists, which is how they are able to live in a near trance-like state throughout the film and simply accept the horrors of their lives. These conclusions are most likely also drawn from the images of self harm used in the film, as well as heavy metal taking up a good portion of Gummo's soundtrack. Other say that the film is a more real-life portrait of a post- apocalyptic scenario, stripping man down to his bare bones and showing what he really is. Curiously, only a single character in Gummo is shown to have any pathos attached to him whatsoever. This character is Tummler, who is seen to feel overwhelming depression in the film as it leaks over into the audience at times. It's not even sadness about poverty, or loneliness, but rather a state of hatred for anything and everything, the feeling of wanting to be dead, or at the very least have something to give life meaning.Gummo hits the audience over the head repeatedly with its horrors of this small town wasteland. Teens addicted to sniffing glue, teens buying down-syndrome prostitutes, teens making a competition over who can kill the most cats to sell to a local restaurant, etc. Although his approach is heavy-handed, it has an artistic purpose: some people live like this, and Korine is letting us see within his mind for an hour and a half. There are parts which are nearly impossible to watch, but the film has this unusually captivating ""feel"" to it, which is enhanced by the incredible cinematography.It's not easy to watch, it's not fun to watch, and it is also incoherent at times. The comparison could be made that watching Gummo is like reading about the Holocaust; neither are fun to watch, and the imagery is nauseating at times, yet many people are fascinated by it, not in a sadistic sense of the word, but merely fascinated by the fact that it happened. I'm amazed that a film like Gummo was made, yet I'm satisfied with its existence.",Gummo
98,zombieman1978,"Profoundly unpleasant, and unpleasantly profound.",10,28 January 2015,"Harmony Korine is one of the most provocative filmmakers who ever shot a frame. There (As far as I can tell) isn't a single taboo that's off the table with him, from underage sex, to incest, animal cruelty and twisted family values. In 1995, Larry Clark's controversial teen sex epic Kids, written by Korine, was released to wide acclaim and even wider controversy. Impressed by the acclaim his screenplay received, Fine Line Pictures (The ""Indy"" arm of New Line Cinema) gave Korine $1,000,000.00 and carte blanche to make any film he wanted as his directorial debut. After about six months of principal photography, this is what the result was.......Gummo plays like the bastard lovechild of David Lynch and John Waters with the nastiness cranked up to eleven. It maintains a stream-of-consciousness state without ever getting caught up in anything that can be considered a plot. Instead, we weave in and out of several people's lives in the crumbling town of Xenia, Ohio. In a truly unsettling opening voice-over, Solomon (Jacob Reynolds), one of the leads (If you can call him that) describes a disastrous tornado that hit their town in the seventies. He describes the destruction in ways that are absolutely devoid of empathy, with lines like: ""My neighbor was killed in that house. He used to ride bikes and three-wheelers. They never found his head. I always thought that was funny."" It appears that Xenia never bounced back from that, leaving it's residents to while their lives away doing drugs, drinking, and other much more (And I mean much MUCH more) nefarious acts. The film has no real plot, which mirrors the lives of it's characters, who simply go about their daily, filthy lives with no real concept of the future. The town becomes almost a human dumping ground, devoid of any authority of any kind.Gummo is a brilliant, once in a lifetime kind of movie. If the above description doesn't grab you, that's not even the tip of the iceberg in terms of what's on display here. The aforementioned stream-of-consciousness format perfectly puts you in this world. It gains a documentary feel as we have a series of vingettes that sometimes come off as out-and-out interviews. These scenes are especially unnerving when you find out that a great many of these people are not real actors, and they're not reading a script. Gummo is both hyper-realistic and surrealistic. There are a great many sequences in the film that are all too real-looking (The aforementioned interview vingettes, tales of incestuous sexual abuse, glue sniffing) and there are moments that are so absurd, you can't believe your eyes (Namely, a young boy, simply referred to as ""Bunny Boy"" on account of the fact that he tr traipses around this collection of human wreckage with nothing more than a pair of shorts, tennis shoes and a big pair of pink rabbit ears. I'm not making this up) The aforementioned Bunny Boy acts almost like the audience, seeing all this dysfunction with a look of detachment on his face.The cinematography of Gummo is one of the liveliest aspects of the film. Employing grainy 16 and 8mm, video, and pristine-looking 35mm, it juts back and forth between styles so quickly that you never have a moment to catch your breath. And why should you? Harmony Korine has so much to show you. It never stays one way for too long, keeping everything moving at a good clip.Let it be known, there is no hope in this film. While the movie never fully condones the actions of it's (Often) despicable characters, it never truly demonizes them either. These are lost souls, left to their own devices in a place where there are no repercussions for their actions (In one scene, the character of Tummler (Nick Sutton) is seen talking on a payphone, holding a dead cat by a rope around it's neck, with people and cars passing by, no one paying any attention to what he's doing) There is also never a sign of any police. law and Order are a myth in this place. As they go about their scummy lives, we see no future for them. Just as well, since they don't either. Therein lies the tragedy of the film.I've left out some of the more memorable (That's putting it lightly) moments, as they've been mentioned before. However, if this, by some divine miracle, happens to be the only review you read before seeing the film, I hope you are just as shocked as I was. You'll thank me later.",Gummo
99,jaijaijai73,"Disgusting, compelling, exploitive, relevant",9,1 November 2005,"_Gummo_ is blatantly exploitive of its subjects, disgusting, and physically repulsive. It also lacks anything resembling a plot or structure. Therefore, it's great art. Anything with this much emotional power must be socially relevant, as well. Not necessarily, but everyone should see this film, if only to feel less heartbroken the next time they read about a tornado taking out some trailer park. The imagery in this movie is deeply disturbing, to say the least. Tell all your foreign friends that if they really want to understand America, they should watch this film.Like a satanic version of the old ""Peanuts"" comic strip, _Gummo_ is a world largely devoid of adults, wherein the kids, most of whom apparently suffer from one or more chromosomal irregularities, developmental disabilities, or just plain old inbreeding, run wild in the streets- huffing glue, executing cats, and succumbing to various perversions. The filth and obscenity of this film are nearly transcendent, as the juxtaposition of the radiant beauty (and ugliness) of some of the actors with their wasteland surroundings, and the resulting fall from innocence into existential damnation, etc, becomes heartbreaking. One of the most interesting features of this film is the director's commentary during the slideshow. If nothing in the film itself actually made you want to vomit, listening to the director's fatuous, smug, whiny and obviously untrue descriptions of his ""filmmaking"" ""technique"" will, guaranteed. When asked about casting, he claims that he cast the whole movie in 45 minutes, and mentions four locations where he supposedly procured his ""talent"". Uh, okay... Maybe he was huffing too much glue to remember what really happened... Doing his best to make sure that his generation goes down in history as the very worst ever, anywhere, the perfectly misnamed ""Harmony"" peoples his movie with misshapen, diseased caricatures of people, claiming that he sees the beauty in each. BS. He's going for the cheap shot at each and every opportunity, in a race to the bottom. (_Ken Park_, his latest travesty, achieves that standard, being basically homicidal kiddie porn.) This film will surely prompt many people to take another look at birth control, euthanasia and depopulation. I was rooting for the tornado by the end. In short, one of the best films I've seen in quite a while. Don't miss it!",Gummo
100,TheEagle,Gros! Yuck! Dirty!,8,11 December 1998,"Let's be short about the story. There are two main lines. 1: Two dirty boys killing cats, selling them and paying for sex with a monstrously fat, ugly and mentally disabled woman. 2: Three girls having sexual frustrations.Furthermore there is hardly any story line. Look at it as a strange documentary, a gross documentary, that is. Gross as Suzy   (the neighbouring girl form Calvin and Hobbes) means it when Calvin spoils her lunch again. The bath scene was the first movie scene ever that I lost my appetite on.Another great scene pictures the fight between a man and a chair. Mind you, the chair is sometimes in a winning position.So, please go see this gross and terrible movie!!! It's great!",Gummo
101,JazB,Surprising and Unique,10,4 March 2000,"I happened to channel-hop to this film the other day and was taken aback. For a long while I couldn't make up my mind if it was a documentary or a piece of fiction. Only the camera angles changing once every so often gave it away... but I was mesmerized none-the-less.Very few films I have ever seen have ever truly been able to capture the homemade documentary feel and keep the characters looking real as well. The casting and acting was incredibly spot on. This is just like watching and documentary about real people, except it isn't, and for that I think it deserves praise.Some have criticized it's lack of plot, I felt completely mesmerized by each scene. It wasn't important what was happening, or who was saying what to who... the atmosphere alone was enough.Unfortunately the film veers from this genius to the impossibly bad with no warning. An intense scene watching a man smash up a kitchen chair is following by a 'in there cause its weird' scene of a kid skateboarding down a hill with a rabbit mask on. The fact that it seemed just be there to try and be off-the-wall was teeth grindingly bad, and these moments do pop quite occasionally without any warning.On whole an experience that is impossible to describe and equally impossible to forget.Recommended.",Gummo

There is no other way to describe this movie. I am not one to be impressed by phony and cheap attempts at avant-garde cinema nor am I the type to revel in Chris Farley movies-- and this movie is neither. It is very true that this movie is disturbing because deep down you know, at least if you've ever lived in the south or the midwest as I have, it really happens. But at the same time, it gives one a certain ego-boost or perhaps a feeling of superiority knowing that at least there's SOMEONE out there that you can look down on. It is both one of the scariest and most hilarious movies I have ever seen because it is a depiction of just how low some people are willing to let themselves go (without their even knowing it)!",Gummo
103,JackD-3,Trash masquerading as something important,1,30 November 2001,"A film doesn't have to have a plot, or likable characters, or a message. However, it seems to me there should be some point to making a film, and some reason for an audience to sit through it.  Gummo lacks any reason for existing, other than to portray the Director as some kind of very cool artiste who most of us are too dense to understand.  Drop any idea that this film is some kind of cinema verite.  This was not real life.  These were actors, or in some case locals recruited to be in the film, improvising from some ideas and/or scripts supplied by the Director. Handheld cameras and bad sound are used to create the illusion of a documentary, but this is actually the real life of white trash as imagined by the Director.  It's totally fake.  The people in this movie are unremittingly portrayed as stupid, libidinous, hillbillies with nothing better to do than to sniff glue, hit on each other (in every sense of the word) and murder cats.  For some reason they all have strong southern accents although they are supposed to be Ohio.  They do things that are outlandish enough that they are entertaining to watch at times, but it doesn't add up to anything worth watching.  If you want to see a true cinema verite style film in a similar setting, try ""Roger and Me"", Michael Moore's documentary about the attempts of people in Flint, Michigan to stay afloat after the local automobile factories had shut down. If you want to see a more compelling fictionalized version of this movie, try ""River's Edge"", based on a true story of a group of teenagers near Sacramento who all knew the location of a murdered classmate's body, which they visited and gawked at, but which none of them revealed to their parents or the police.",Gummo

It's not actually about the inbred mutants, since that would involve a plot, dialogue, things like that. In actual fact, the mutants are just passing through this garbage.

One hackneyed caricature of middle-America after another is thrown at the audience, to very little effect. There's glue sniffing, cat killing, fistfights, child molestation, cross-dressing, and mullets, mullets everywhere. But who cares? The result is kind of like watching a remake of ""Pink Flamingos"" where all of the humor that made that film somewhat enjoyable has been removed. On the up side, it does have a good, eclectic soundtrack. With music ranging from Black Metal bands like Burzum to Roy Orbison to more atmospheric stuff, I'd actually be pretty curious to pick up a copy of it up on CD (if there is one).So in the end what are we left with? Unfortunately, just a bland, unoriginal movie with a pretty good soundtrack. Of course the same can be said of ""Cool World"".",Gummo

But on the second and third viewing I just came to realize that is how kids are. Brutal in a deadpan way. I love the look of these people. I hate films that just pick outr the buff and finely chiseled featured types. Korine makes wonderful cinematic use of people who look like people, and aren't posing or primping. It would not have worked if Korine had brought in a lot of name actors and cinematic beauties. The story is well plotted, though often disturbing, it kept me watching.

Visually disorienting us with the film cameras recording off of a CRT TV and giving us the documentary feel; colour-wise it looks like the production team pissed on the film (however they achieved this ""devastated yellow"" tint) is incredible. Switching from filming a CRT TV Screen and scenes chain the story together; kind of how communities chain themselves together metaphorically (E.G. Storm Stricken). No matter how kept or unkept the results of reality may be.This film tackles many, many topics and some are just so dark I can't tell you. You'd have to see the movie yourself. It's not extreme, it's just shocking and in all the ways that make you feel like you're watching a Horror movie. Which I say makes the film memorable for it's deep messages too. The character Solomon narrating in a somewhat quiet, dry and choky manner, delivers very potent meanings and persists to even impress me more.The fact Harmony Korine is No stranger to Controversy. This film is similar in direction to Kids (1995) but this has some more obvious disorientation, that actually makes sense (if you can watch and understand this film metaphorically). This film made me realise how to keep spirits in devastating times like the after-effects of a tornado and just living your life like you wish.The fact these actors and actresses weren't (at the time professional or had experience) still makes me reminisce to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) of how the actors weren't experienced either then.This is a classic, you just need to be open-minded in seeing this film. Because you might walk away wanting to enjoy life a little more, from how potent this can hit you in the heart and mind. Like Solomon said, ""Life is Beautiful...""

113,TheMightyHodgeheg,Squirm inducing,2,4 May 2013,"I won't beat around the bush. I HATED this film. Friends were raving about how great it was and I eagerly sat down to watch it with them as they watched it for a second/third time. It was the equivalent to spending the afternoon stuck in a Ketamine induced state whilst trapped in supported living asylum in a hopeless, post apocalyptic, nihilistic society where everyone has completely given up. It's repulsive throughout and aims to be provocative but in a really pretentious, attention seeking without offering resolution sort of a way. It felt exploitative by nature, in imagining that these people or communities exist and the way that we would view or judge them as a different, lesser species. I felt nothing for the characters, so poorly developed that I couldn't even feel pity for them. I both squirmed and yawned my way through it. Films are meant to make you think or feel or open your mind or heart or at the very least entertain purely on the superficial basis of humour or beauty. It wasn't arty, it wasn't meaningful, it didn't offer anything new or leave me with any important questions or feelings other than wtf have I just watched and why is anyone digging this?! The hype surrounding it reminds me very much of the story of The emperor's new clothes. To heck with anyone who has been duped by this utter garbage, trying to tell you that you don't 'get' it. There is nothing to get. It is vacuous and degrading and reeks of an over stretched student film. Perhaps the pointlessness and boredom of watching the film was meant to leave you with some empathy for the boredom and pointlessness of the characters lives? Another reviewer nailed it with the title 'Hipster poverty voyeurism'. I think that sums it up perfectly. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it obviously left an impression on me although I am not sure why other than how dirty it made me feel for watching it.",Gummo

I grew up in various small towns in Oklahoma and have encountered people very similar to those portrayed in the movie. It was like going back in time and seeing all those twisted characters all over again. So yes, there are indeed people just like this, if not worse. I had to convince myself several times that I was NOT watching a documentary! I found that the use of raw black metal music added to the grim feel of the movie, particularly when the two kids are whipping the dead cat hanging from the tree. Hey, if you've never seen bored Southern youth, then don't think this stuff doesn't happen. I only wish it didn't.Overall, I guess you'd have to actually be a witness to those surroundings to actually get it, or to know people like that. I am unsure of what statement the movie is trying to make because the absurdity of the characters' lifestyles really overshadows whatever point Harvey was trying make here.

This movie sucks.  It is not convincing as a portrayal of ""behind the scenes"" America because the characters are too unbelievable and ridiculous.  Don't let any of the nitwits that praised this movie thwart you from the basic notion that this film is truly one of the worst films I've ever seen.

119,Taotrac,Good but you're not gonna watch it twice...,5,5 January 2010,"With the directorial debut of the guy, Harmony Korine, who wrote Kids, you see a somewhat very distorted, dirty view on a backwoods town effected by a large tornado, and how exactly the community doesn't function exactly right and/or have lost people or things (such as clean running water). Right away, I had a connection with this film because even though it is set in Ohio, it was actually filmed in Nashville, Tennessee, only minutes from where I live. I'm also a indie filmmaker and very artistic and out-there films are right down my alley.But the end point is...this film is not written very well. What it mainly is, is a bunch of very beautiful, shocking, and rustic scenes randomly thrown at you, most of which were penned not by entirely by Korine, but with the help of some famous french guy Korine actually hired to help the whole thing out. While the scenes do connect with all the neighborhood character's lives, there's no real point or 'conclusion'. No matter how artsy a film may be, or shocking, a film needs to be worth your time, and needs to make you feel more inspired, and while you can definitely be inspired by the directing, scenery, and character images (one reason I do love this film), you simply won't gain any emotion toward any point in this film, as there really just isn't much to it.I mean how much more than that can you really say? Korine needs to add a little drama to the story line, make it more of a epic tragedy, let someone die, SOMETHING. The point of a art film is to inspire in a different way, not to make it so unemotional that it pisses people off. =/. I mean, even the most random of films out there have made points about society, etc etc but this film just does not make a point other than to shock you with viewing special ed adults and dirty little cussing kids.

I normally like pictures like these, but this one just seemed to try too hard to be shocking, and when it was over, I just asked myself is that was it. I do recommend it because it's raw, there's no message or plot, it just happens because stuff like that happens, and in that sense its realistic, but is it a good movie? IN a traditional sense, no, its garbage, but then again so are all blockbusters, its all a matter of taste, really, and tolerance. its a profile of a town of bored and impoverished people.

This my friends, is the soft white underbelly of this country. What you see in Gummo is what (who) gets swept under the rug.Harmony Korine did an excellent job portraying lost souls in a carnivorous world. These two boys (Tummler & Solomon) simply drift through the sordid world they are given. The peripheral characters only serve to drive home the sadness of their world.Granted, this movie didn't have a plot, per se. But did it really need one? It was as if you had broken down in their little town for a couple of hours and couldn't take your eyes off of what you were seeing through your windshield.

Harmony Korine makes himself a creative piece of art with a strong script that really grabs your attention, and Chloe Sevigny (KIDS) gives a good.....well.....""performance"" as the character that she portrays. The movie Gummo can be described as raw, real, honest, exploitive, distasteful, explicit, artistic, and even ""life-changing"" as one film critic had said.

I've heard Harmony Korine talk about his ideas of universal transcendent beauty, and how nothing portrayed in this film is ""ugly"" to him, so it can't be exploitation. In other words, the guy pimping out his disabled sister? Beautiful. That boy eating spaghetti in a bath filled with brown water? Beautiful. Hiring ex-glue sniffers as actors for the sake as authenticity? Beautiful.Then later in the interview I mentioned, Korine recalls getting stabbed by some cast member as payback. Payback for all the non-exploitation and transcendent beauty, right? Sure.None of these subjects should be taboo, but a filmmaker who deals in such extremes should be able to fess up to what he's really portraying rather than assume some lackadaisical, hippie-dippie approach, and then hypocritically derive sardonic humor from it all.

The truth is, though, that there is absolutely nothing to get.  This movie is not innovative, nor intriguing, nor even interesting in the least.  There's no underlying meaning to it at all (writer/director Harmony Korine admitted as much in an interview).  It's just a loosely continuous assembly of vignettes depicting random scenes of filth, squalor, and depravity.The movie is not a social commentary, as some have argued.  It offers no insight into the lives of the people it exploits.  The entire backstory-the tornado-serves only as an excuse for the rest of the thing, as if it mattered.  It goes like this:  first, we get to watch a shirtless boy in a bunny hood spit and urinate off an overpass; next, we meet two teenagers who ride their bikes around the desolate and dilapidated town, looking for cats they can kill and sell to a local restaurant owner; then, we're introduced to three bleach-blonde sisters who don't seem to have any parents and who busy themselves with such activities as ripping electrical tape off their bare nipples.  These are the only recurring characters to speak of.  Nothing they do is even remotely interesting or entertaining, though.  And every other character is memorable only for the few minutes it takes the viewer to rid himself of the feeling of disgust, only to be disgusted again and again by characters he should be feeling sympathy for.And that's really why this movie is so awful.  Don't get me wrong, it'd be awful no matter what, but it wouldn't be entirely without merit if we could actually feel anything other than disdain for the characters.  But these are not real people, everything is actually scripted, and none of it is believable at all.The shock value is negligible; it's not really shocking, but even if it were, there are better movies to watch if that's what you're after.  It's not innovative, either-it's actually almost a blatant rip-off of some other, more noteworthy films.  It's quite obvious that the only purpose here was to be pretentious.  Of course, it probably wasn't meant to be so obvious.",Gummo
135,gonewishing,Excrement,1,17 March 2019,"I got a copy of this film because it was highly rated on IMDb. The reviews that showed on the first three pages (sadly I didn't go further, but there were a LOT of reviews) gave 9 and 10 stars!
It's a Hollywood bigot's brain dead idea of Midwestern America. A TIME WARNER film. Figures. Supposedly set in a small town in OHIO, it opens with credits presented as white lettering on a black background with RED GOTHIC letters completing the subliminal picture of a NAZI flag, an arm with a tatto of a CROSS, a Confederate Flag, Later, we hear the locals talking with ""down south"" accents.
The town has recently been hit by a tornado and apparently the local yokels are jess sittin' 'round waitin' fer FEMA to show up cuzz they're all he'pless bein' jess inbred rednaicks an' all. OMIGOSH.
Well, that's what I got from the first five minutes, anyway.
Being open minded I continued watching to see if the film went anywhere. It didn't. Halfway through I finally realized I was wasting my time. ""Gummo"" is on a par with the legendary ""cross in a jar full of urine"". No apologies to those who enjoy jars full of urine/
A teacher of mine once told me that historical (or period) literature tells you more about the author than anything else. The same goes for film. Some movies are true ""art"". This one was excrement.

136,Jayster-5,"Gummo tries desperately to shock, but ends up muttled & pointless.",2,21 October 2000,"It's not often that I agree with Mr. Leonard Maltin, but his review hits Gummo pretty much on the head. Just like ""Kids"" this movies is a random collage of ""shocking"" acts committed by foul mouthed, degenerate punk kids; and throws disgusting rednecks in for good measure. There is nothing 'funny' about this movie, in which some very ugly kids torture and kill cats and sell them to a butcher shop so they can hire a fat, retarded prostitute. They pick on cats a lot in this ""movie"" so don't watch it with your girlfriend. There is this kid wearing a set of stained rabbit ears who pops up in a few scenes...but he doesn't really do anything. Nobody in this film really does anything. There's a transvestite boy, a black midget, a retarded girl (whose innocence seems out of place), a fat redneck that gets p***ed when the aforementioned black midget beats him in an arm wrestling match; so he goes berserk and beats up a chair. There are also two young trailer park tramps who want to make their nipples stick out, I guess. This film has a lot of profanity, dirt, grime, filth, and pathetic, one dimensional stereotypes. Gummo tries too hard for shocks, especially when the two main characters kill a woman on life support with as much consideration as if they were turning off a light switch. Gummo has no redeeming features, I will never want to watch it again as long as I live. I have an ""open mind"" and I still didn't care for it at all. Avoid Gummo at all costs. ...It's still not as bad as the Blair Witch Project, though.",Gummo

I can guarantee that you haven't watched anything like this film before and probably never will again after watching it. This cult classic American art house gem takes us on a deep yet satirical dive into the lives of the locals of Xenia, Ohio following a tornado incident. The film doesn't really have a plot to go on, rather it is much more like a documentary. We are shown how low people can go in times of desperation and it can even be kind of heartbreaking watching all these people sink into depravity. Still shots, old video footage and vintage photos are frequently used throughout the film and really give Gummo a unique personality. The soundtrack can sound rough and even random at times but it's really fitting for the eerie tone of the film. Overall, if you're into watching weird and obscure indie films, you'll probably like Gummo. It is an experience like no other.",Gummo

I know Korine claims that he's bored with ""ordinary plot-lines.""  This has no plot, but you can still make something interesting and disturbing. Gummo was neither. A great disturbing film without a plot would be Bunuel's ""Une Chien Andolou.""  Gummo's so called ""disturbing"" images came out of ideas that seemed to have blossomed while sitting on the toilet. You could make this kind of movie filth in a week.  This is truly the worst movie I have ever seen. Gummo is worse than ""Dude, Where's My Car,"" and that's saying something.",Gummo

Not to get a sense of some kind of plot cause there isn't any (in a traditional way from narrative movies). Just to feel the different aspects of what is told in the movie. Very fragmented but still - sticks together perfectly. The most intriguing part of this movie is seeing the contrast as for how unreal the characters are, how bizarre and grotesque and at the same time - how alive. The characters, the way the movie it is shot and edited. Don't look for narrative, look for contrasts and the attitude to the real world!

I don´t wanna go into all of them but what comes first in mind is ""the spaghetti/bacon on the wall bath"", ""an albino talking about the love of her life"", ""two crazy little redneck´s shooting a ""wabbit"" and very very jaded teenagers.And the beautiful Chloë Sevigny is great.

If I had a list of three favorite movies, I'd throw this on top and spend and hour thinking about the other two. This is a film rich with life. I've heard a lot of complaints referring to some none existent plot. I think a pair of glasses would help you see that this movie is rich in story. The greatest and simplest plot ever, the struggle for living in adverse conditions. There is no great resolution in life. Most films seem to not recognize this. Those particular stories (I.E. anything Spielberg or Lucas, sorry) do not interest me simply because I've never seen a true hero or bad guy in flesh. We're all shaded in between and nothing ever gets solved.Gummo, bless it's little celluloid heart, has not forgotten. Even though this movie was filmed in Tennessee, I could not believe it wasn't Xenia. The trashiness was perfect. I know, I've been there way before I first viddied this little treat. I had been waiting for a film to effect me for a long time before Gummo came my way. Open up your senses and watch close, there are many sub-plots hinted too. My only question is... well the title.",Gummo
144,VinylBoy,innocence lost,10,6 September 1998,"It's a new type of movie! Gummo affected me in a way no other movie has. It made me totally rethink how films are made. If you are not easily offended, this would be something for you to see. There's certain scenes in Gummo that I will never forget, like Soloman eating spaghetti and milk in a bathtub of brown water, like a group of drunks beating up a chair, and like that final shot of Bunny Boy running up to the camera with a dead cat while ""Crying"" plays in the background. This film presents a problem, many problems, and does nothing to solve them. Why should it? These problems will never be taken care of in real society.  It's a film about innocence lost. It presents ""normal"" people as weirder than the outcast mental and physical deficients in the film. I love it.",Gummo

A Mulletfest of cat killing (they pay for cats by the pound), bi-curious midgets, retarded hookers, drunken midgets, old albino ladies, dorks wrasslin with kitchen chairs, and glue sniffing losers. Oh, there's more but it's so pathetic. Like the dork with the bunny hat sitting on the crapper playing an accordian.I suppose the ""plot"" involves two friends, one about 17 and the other 13, who love to kill cats and bemoan their pathetic existence while periodically stopping by to see the retarded hooker.Save yourself the price of a video rental.  This movie is truly a piece of crap in every sense of the word crap.  Poor acting, poor production, poor editing, poor viewers who happen upon this poor excuse of a film.But if you cannot help stopping to see the bearded lady and the dog-faced boy at the county fair, then this movie is for you.For you horndogs, move on.  A bizarre titty scene involving black electrical tape was just wierd. The titty girls did hook up with a horny pedo later on, but turned down his advances.All in all, this is a worthless piece of crap of a movie.

151,andrewmaxr,"eh, who knows. it's art, make up your own mind.",6,21 February 2002,"When I hear the term art flick', I think beautiful camera work, intriguing exaggerated characters and little or no plot.  Personally, I really have to be in the right mood to enjoy an art flick'.  I wish someone would have told me this was an art flick'.There is no defensible plot to this movie.  It is a series of vignettes that take place in Xenia, Ohio.  These come together to form a stark, bleak, often offensive portrait of a rural, `white trash' town torn in the wake of a tornado attack.  `I saw a girl fly through the sky and I looked up her skirt.'  Fortunately, for the intrepid, bold, patient viewer, many, maybe most, of these scenes follow a pair of characters, Solomon and Tummler. Solomon's could range anywhere from 8 to 15.  Tummler looks a bit older. Both are dirty, ignorant except in voiceovers, and fairly ugly: the perfect portal into Xenia, a town rife with filth, and a surface ugliness that on further examination shows some insight and beauty.Gummo' contains a healthy dose of cat symbolism.  Solomon and Tummler kill stray cats and sell them for spending money. (Money that apparently gets spent on retarded whores, glue to sniff, and whipcream, for the nitrous oxide, natch.)  Dot (Chloë Sevigny) and her sisters own a cat that may or may not be pregnant and is later lost.  The cat, Foot Foot, is presumably killed by Solomon and Tummler, but nothing can be explicit in an art flick. This narrative about cats can be at best described as a subplot, a subplot to no main plot.  My initial reaction to the cats is that they are a parallel to the citizens of Xenia.  They amble aimlessly, just getting by, until one day their number is up, and the tornado comes to town.eh, who knows.  it's art, make up your own mind.All in all, my best advice concerning this movie, sorry, film is caveat emptor.  It is brilliant and beautiful, but you have to be ready to work for it.  Where Kids' held your hand through the tumults of The City, all you get from Gummo' is some skinny, shirtless kid wearing bunny ears riding a skateboard.",Gummo

Go vote, and you will see why it is rated so low: there are lots of maximum and minimum votes and this kind of balances things. I guess this means that there were lots of people who have been just as stunned and shocked by this deeply impressive piece of art, and on the other hand there were lots of people who just did not get anything from the message which is quite sad, if you give it a second thought. For it is our own stupidity that we do not recognize the real value in front of our very eyes.

I spent a lot of time growing up in the midwest and I've seen a lot of towns/cities full of bored, poor, kids that really have nothing to do but smoke, vandalize, and go to work at the mini-mart for the rest of their lives.The portrayal of the bleak, dead-end town in this movie is typical of the suburban wastelands that are sprinkled throughout the country.  Towns that exist whose only purpose is to handle population overflow from the inner-cities.  No culture, no industry, no parks, nothing.There is so much rage out there.  I think the scariest scene is when the drunk rednecks attack that chair and destroy it in the kitchen.  It was scary because the way the guy attacked the chair, well, you can see that he has done this type of thing before.  It's just a creepy, depressing, yet captivating movie.",Gummo

Korine was not making a movie to simply shock the audience.  It seemed to me he was simply creating a vibrant meditation on what it means to struggle through life.  What it means to play with the fabric of propriety.  In my opinion Korine's camera was not actively seeking to debase the characters.  Instead there was a brutal honesty to the characters, their values, and how they themselves fit into the dreamlike landscape Korine constructed.Anyone brushing this movie off missed the point.",Gummo

Well, it is now 24 hours after my first-time viewing, and I'm proud to say I stand firmly with Werner Herzog and Gus Van Sant in the ""love it"" camp.Actually, scratch that - ""love"" is probably not the right word to use in this situation. ""Gummo"" isn't exactly a movie I'd pop in on a rainy Sunday, or hang up its movie poster in my living room, or quote with my friends during a late night at my local pub. But I'll say this: this movie deeply affected me. I haven't been able to think of anything else all day long; ""Gummo"" won't give me a moment's rest. I still can't get those completely bizarre (and sometimes downright horrifying) images out of my head...Dot moving in slow-motion with the crappy recording of the girls singing in the background...Bunny Boy shivering on the overpass...the dog impaled on top of the house...the girl tossing things into a pool of water while a distorted voice-over describes being raped...and of course the famous ""spaghetti scene""...this stuff will probably stick with me for years, if not decades. (Plus I haven't been able to stop singing that ""Cock A Doodle Doo"" song.) Was there a plot? Nope. Character development? Not really. Enthralling dialogue? Yeah, right. Those are usually my deal-breakers when it comes to movies...so why did I think ""Gummo"" was so freakin' brilliant? I'm still not 100% sure. What I do know is, like I said, it stuck with me. It kept me completely engaged, wide-eyed and open-mouthed, for the entire 90 minutes. Even with virtually no character development, every single person on screen made me FEEL something. Empathy, or pity, or just morbid voyeuristic curiosity? I really don't know. But my emotional response was off the charts, which is more than I can say for most of the ""critically acclaimed"" movies of recent memory.

I wasn't about the poor peoples fight to live in a town devistated by a tornato. That was all an excuse to film Hicks and Rednecks for a cheap laugh and maybe fool some into thinking there is a little symoblism involved. Want proof. I heard the interview with the director and he said the Kid in the bunny suit, was just there because He wanted to see a kid in a bunny suit. NO POINT! No symbolism for the innocence of the small town, no symbolism for said innocence being destroyed (it's been a while but i remember him fooling around with girls in a swiming pool).

Chloe Sevigny is a bombshell as usual and gives a great performance.

Having said that, Gummo is definitely not the kind of film you'd sit down and watch with the girlfriend.Basically, it consists of disjointed vignettes of life in a tornado- devastated hick town. The characters can best be described as white trash. Our two central characters go around killing cats and selling them to a guy who's going to ensure the felines end up in fast food, among other activities. These two boys resemble Beavis and Butt-Head, but with more nihilism and existential pointlessness. The scenes of chair-wrestling rednecks and a waifish boy wearing only floppy rabbit ears, shorts and tennis shoes add some sort of bleak hopelessness to the film as we also get glimpses into porch conversations that have an un- scripted feel to them.

It's lack of a strong plot makes it a stronger film, simply because it feels like an actual look into people's lives. There is not a plot arch in each normal day.I also thought that the once-mentioned characters were some of the strongest I've ever seen, such as the Junkyard Cowboys, the young girl who was abused by her father, and the young man who was talking to the dwarf. Although a lot of people disliked these short scenes, I thought it made the movie even more realistic, as you rarely know everything about a person.Solomon's opening narrative scene was absolutely beautiful, as was the title scene of bunny boy, who's possibly the most haunting character in the movie, standing for happiness and innocence. his final scene was one of the most powerful moments in film, the very picture of happiness and innocence holding up the mangled cat body and looking at the camera in dissatisfaction, as if he's the only one who understands that it's wrong.Even the very last scene with the disabled girl singing ""yes Jesus loves me"" wholeheartedly is a shining example of how sometimes only the disabled are able to keep childlike innocence in such crazy times.",Gummo

Some of the shots were pretty cool. There was a good use of slow motion and color. I think this is sort of supposed to be a documentary of Xenia Ohio after a big tornado hit the area. From what I can tell, it is a very depressed place and fairly bleak. The people are small town America and a lot of weird stuff goes on. I don't think this is Harmony Karin's best work.

166,blitzturm-1,Gummo; the image mirrors its disrupted personages,9,13 May 2000,"In criticising a movie, what leads me the most, is the impression afterwards, the traces it left in my memory.  Sometimes, a film has a nice story, perfectly told, beautiful filmed - and still I've forgotten it as soon as I left the cinema or switched off the video. Gummo doesn't contain such a story - there's no plot to be told - and still it is one of the most impressive movies I saw lately.Sure, there's something to pass on: It's about kids and childish adults living in an antisocial neighbourhood, which has been disrupted since it got struck by a tornado. It's about two boys who kill cats with their small rifles to sell them for local Chinese restaurants. It's about cursing and raging kids, apparently lacking loving parents to look after them. But all those remarks do not cover the film in any way.The movie is poetic in a sense that it is filmed in a same chaotic way as its subject of disrupted childhood appears. The movie is full of pointless, distracted and dreamlike stories, told by uncontrolled adolescents as to illustrate the almost sleepy tracks of their lives. The characters seem to lack any normal social recollection, which seems to be replaced by the overwhelming memory of the tornado event. There is no story to be told, there's only moments to recollect. In that sense, the form of the movie mirrors it's content - and that has been done beautifully.
And there are fantastic moments to recollect from this movie. The scene with the little Solomon, getting his spaghetti diner in the bath tube, the albino woman telling about her love for Patrick Swayze, the drunken kitchen party that ends with the killing of an innocent chair, the teen girls working on their nipples, the boxing fight in the kitchen by the boys who are supposed to have killed their parents and of coarse the speechless Bunny Boy.  Those moments, how fragmentised they may be, won't soon fade from my memory. The fact that this movie does only harvest 1's and 10's in the User Ratings - that it has been displayed by the Netherlands VPRO television - can only be a great compliment to its director Harmony Korine. I'll reward it with a 9.",Gummo
167,Lenny-13,Not so much a film as a series of posters for students,1,10 October 1998,"This is not so much a film as a series of posters to plaster on the walls of student flats.  A sad, badly thought out mish-mash of (very) vaguely connected images, designed presumably to highlight the grimness and all round pointlessness of existence amongst the urban poor of America.  From the opening shot of a young boy in a pink rabbit hat, complete with ears, urinating on passing cars, through some random nonsense about killing cats, having sex with the educationally sub-normal and generally being miserable and dirty, all the way to the end credits, this film has nothing whatever to recommend it.  When compared to similar low-budget films as Kevin Smith's ""Clerks"" or (perhaps more appropriately) Cheryl Dunye's ""The Watermelon Woman"", which also features a mixture of filming methods and has a similar semi documentary air, ""Gummo"" falls badly behind the pace.  No plot, no obvious scripting, poor editing and shooting and truly dreadful bits of acting combine to make this the shoddiest attempt at film-making I've seen in years. Clever, if somewhat obscure, title though.",Gummo
168,thehumble1,Much too much for one sitting,9,5 April 2000,"Disturbing and important It is impossible to summarize the movie, but may be possible to characterize it.  Although I haven't seen Kids, this film hits me as a dramatic look at the reality of our life.  The visual poverty and distopia is profound, but the lifestyle which accompanies it is more impressive, pushing you to realize the ways people cope with their circumstances.Don't watch it because you heard it was good and don't watch it if you aren't willing to look past the initial reaction, while still keeping it available.  The film makes you react, but it also wants you to think.  I didn't like watching it, but I am glad I have gone through the experience.",Gummo

Although you get the impression that director and writer Harmoney Korine sees himself as a visionary and someone who has a story to tell, this film simply doesn't do it.If watching white trash America drown cats, live in horrible conditions, and appear to be inbred is your idea of a good film, then this may be the one for you.  If you actually want a story with your movies, avoid it at all cost.For those who really want to be punished by this film, rent the DVD and listen to the director's commentary.

I know I'm getting sick of watching characters be put through the motions and end up on a stage having a big blowout after everybody has come together and made pretty. Movies have become so predictable that I am falling asleep during the most visually colorful films.  Producers in Hollywood today understand that the average lamb of modern America is perfectly happy watching actors that are so well-known you can't believe they are their charater, car chases and explosions that do nothing but halt the story to entertain retards with some pretty colors, and hip catch phrases that were used in fifty other movies. I am utterly depressed to live in a country that looks at film like we do. Other countries hold cinema up as an art; we only compromise artist's visions so that the masses will have some bright colors and pretty but boring faces to keep them entertained.  I loved Gummo.  It was quite refreshing.",Gummo

Trash like this inevitably triggers reviews rife with words like ""genius,"" ""misunderstood,"" ""surreal,"" and ""cult."" The lower-middle-class white Midwest has become the happening place for hipster artists to go slumming for material, but all Korine seems to have done is slap together a shock-value home movie featuring some cheesy film-school-assignment cinematography and editing. Too bad, because the film's premise (a town recently ravished by a tornado) could have made for a truly edgy exploration of an American social stratum that's usually ignored.",Gummo
173,Fetusman82,"A deep film, but in a not so deep kind of way.",8,8 February 2007,"After much research and finally watching this film, I still have trouble judging it. The IMDb's rating is pretty much split right down the middle, you either love it, or you hate it.Gummo is a film with not much of a plot, but still holds a grip on you. Traumatized residents of a small Ohio town try to find ways to live. The film is shown through viginettes of rather unrelated stories. Prodominantly it's about two kids, Solomon and Tummler, who hunt down cats to sell to the town butcher so they can buy glue to sniff.But the film has more strange and bizarre characters to speak of, a man who whores out his mentally retarded wife, two wannabe strippers, and, of course the strangely interesting and the most important character is a silent skater boy who wears pink bunny ears, who supposedly symbolizes the only form of happiness in a town 'you wouldn't want to call home'.But the folks of Xenia, Ohio have reason behind their madness and anti-social behavior. Apparently a few years ago, the town was struck by a tornado, from which the town had never recovered from.The film is a horrifying social commentary. Gummo deals with strong social issues such as sexual abuse, drug abuse, racism, prostitution, fighting, and death - all in a poor society in our own country.Although Gummo gives you something to think of, it offers no real moral redemption. And Gummo never really gets under the surface of why the characters are like the way they are. So really the film turns into a freak-show. In the end, the film really has nothing more to say than things like this are happening everyday, and no one is, and never will do anything about it.Still I like the film because it was different. It coins the term originality in way few films do.",Gummo
174,SweetToot,Get Ready for THE Train Wreck,6,10 December 2005,"What can I say?? This movie isn't for everyone. It doesn't have much of a plot nor any decent characters. It's a major train wreck, it doesn't feel right watching an accident happen but you just can't take your eyes of it. It's kinda making fun of a mentally challenged person..you know it's not right but you can't help yourself. A lot of the movie leaves the audience filling in the blank. If you like movies that are like this ....then go for it. If your a sane person and are watching the movie, you constantly find yourself asking ""why the heck are they (characters)doing that?"". For example, two of the main characters (kids/teeneagers)kill cats to make money. Not only do they kill the poor cats, they actually torture them. Then they take the money that they make selling the cats (didn't get why the grocery manager will want to buy them except to sell them to people and pretend its meat...ewww)and go sleep with a prostitute. In another scene, two boys ""kill"" and name call another boy with rabbit ears on. It's sad. Not only is it said, it shows how naive, stupid people can be. I couldn't believe those grown up teenagers got in the car with the creepy old guy. Hello??? Clearly they aren't thinking. If you think the kids are bad, wait until you meet the adults. Getting drunk and punching the s*it out of a chair isn't my idea of fun. In a way, I can see that a lot of people can read into the movie. They can say it addresses discrimination, hate, self-confidence, love, hope and loss. For each viewer it's different. It doesn't really open your eyes to the issues but it puts it in front of you and if your smart/observant enough , you will see it. For me, it's just shows a very sad lifestyle of people who live differently than me.",Gummo

By Korine's reasoning, there are actually people who live this way on this great big ball of diversity we call Earth.  But the lifestyles depicted in ""Gummo"" are nothing more than un-reasoned caricatures; disgusting exaggerations of lives being mocked more than glorified.

Among other things, I say ""With a strong vision and a bold syntax, Harmony Korine has imprinted his mark on the new generation of filmmakers.  He is embracing the medium's possibilities in regards to both subject matter and style, the use of the grotesque, the relationship of the subject to the camera, and the non-narrative structure.  He is instinctual but aesthetically conscious, rebellious but not reckless, controversial and inspirational.""Korine knows never to let the camera stop rolling. He has an eye for capturing the beauty in the grotesque (a beauty that verges on the sublime for the fact that it defies normal concepts of beauty). He reinvents the gaze to better suite his obsessions; viewers feel a mixture of shame and awe when they are allowed to stare at the forbidden things he shows.It'a all about visual, it's visual poetry, it really has changed me, too. It gets into my brain.  Harmony has a new syntax, he's pushing the boundaries of the medium, his syntax changes the way I look at the everyday world around me, for better or worse, i think about the beauty in the grotesque every day now.",Gummo
179,daniel_damaged,Astounding...,10,26 July 2000,"First of all i'd like to say this is the best film i've ever saw in my life and i cannot ever imagine seeing a better film! (well, not by anyone other than Harmony Korine anyway..) Basically this film is astounding, it brings out so many emotions in me, it is completely realistic but completely surreal at the same time. The film features lots of real footage of people talking about humourous and disturbing expierences and about half the actors in this film (including Nick Sutton - ""Tummler"") were took from talks shows (Nick Sutton - ""Tummler"" was took off a talk show about his addiction to glue sniffing) so unlike all these big overblown hollywood films were you can think to yourself ""It's Only A Film"", you can't with this because most of it is real! - a good example is the fight between the two twins, you see one of them hit the other in lip and it draws blood! and all the retards are real retards! Basically this film is just packed with some of the most amazing, original, humourous and disturbing scenes of movie making i've ever saw in my life. I think Jacob Reynolds - ""Solomon"" does an amazing job in this film, he's around the age of 12 - 13 and you see two sides in his character (without him actually changing himself): you see Solomon as a glue sniffing, cat killing, death metal fan and you also see him as the little innocent boy sitting in the bath while his mum shampoos his hair and trying to get muscles by weightlifting spoons! Your either going to love this film or hate it, chances are if your one if these big ""block buster"" hollywood ""action"" film fans you'll hate it (your probally too concerned about analysing the special effect in 'Mission Impossible 2' or something). This is without a doubt the most loved and hated films ever made... Can't wait to see Harmony Korines' new film ""Julien Donkey Boy""",Gummo

The nutritious detritus of advanced civilization has produced this subspecies, unviable before.  Sociopathy and brutality prevail; degenerate behavior you might be better off not imagining is everywhere.  It's sad that a tornado ripped through this town.  It's understandable that the people in the town fell flat on their faces and were unable to lift themselves back up.

Its characters consist of dysfunctional and generally uneducated townsfolk and we see them trawl through their everyday lives.The movie is well directed and some of the scenes work very well with the cleverly chosen music, the ending being a good example.Overall however, I just can't escape the feeling that Gummo is too arty for its own good.

I like slow-going pointless films occasionally, sometimes I really have to make myself like them, but with Gummo I genuinely liked it. It's set out like a documentary so it doesn't need to have a plot, it's simply clips of weird things people do in this town of 'white trash'. I thought the film was pretty funny at times, didn't find it too disturbing because it wasn't the sort of disturbing film you take seriously, unlike something like Irreversible which is probably the most disturbing film I've seen.If you only like films with a plot and lots of action then I wouldn't bother with this film, but if you're even slightly intrigued by the sound of this film then watch it!

It's about so many things, about small town America, about white trash but mostly about human decadence (every single story from this film may occur anywhere at anytime). In the most convincing way to depict Korine's harsh (and exaggerated) reality, the film is structured with no particular order in a documentary manner with a visual stroke of mixed images, sounds, situations and random lines said by the characters.You can tell why Korine was the only respected (or at least representative) director who openly embraced Von Trier's and Vinterberg's Dogme '95 in the U.S. (see ""Julien Donkey Boy"").This is one of the few films that will make you think about it over and over again.",Gummo

There is no discernible story and no worthwhile characters. It feels like the outtakes of one of those ""alternative"" 90s MTV videos - 90 minutes of outtakes, pieced together by editing and nothing else. It's a film made by a bunch of disaffected twenty-somethings about other disaffected twenty-somethings who sit in their gardens/kitchens/streets and do very little at all. And when it's really in trouble it resorts to shock tactics like children shooting cats, swearing, and having sex with an obese woman.

Even the director, would not not claim that of his film. The point however, insofar as there is one, is that this is a film so totally removed in style and content from the mass of material out there that you will not remain neutral. It has been a while since a director has avowedly set himself the objective of beating the viewer around the head with his intellectual stick. Having said this I would shy away from claiming that Korine is the only film-maker to have set himself such an objective. One only has to see such films as Gaspar Noe's ""Seule Contre Tous"" or indeed ""Funny Games"" by Michael Haneke (who outrightly declared his desire to see the crowds rushing out of the cinema while watching his film). But Korine is, I believe, a director with a vision as powerful as his youthful determination to shock and scandalise. People have complained of a lack of plot in ""Gummo"" but who could deny that the film does indeed tell a story set firmly in its own doomed present. There is no progression or resolution because these people have no future. The presumption of wanting to give a directional impetus to the desperate tale of this lost world of oddities is to suggest that the American dream does indeed reign supreme and that it has been achieved. This is a film about the dread and fear of spiritual death that has overcome the populace of America and to deny its unique power would be to ignore the tell-tale signs of a terrifying and inexorable decay.",Gummo

If you like seeing moronic kids beating cats to death then by all means check out this flick. I am not easily offended and this movie did not offend or shock me. It was just so utterly pointless and slow that I found it to be unbearable to watch. Perhaps that is the point. The director is daring you to sit through his meandering boring movie. However, I did like seeing all the Heavy Metal t-shirts and the occasional death metal songs in the soundtrack were welcome. Why on earth people found the scene of the guy beating the crap out of a chair enjoyable is beyond me. It was just stupid. Don't waste your time.",Gummo
198,xaos29,What a Horrible Film,1,4 April 2009,"I did sit through the entire showing, and I did hope it would get better. Sadly, the film languished until the sweet release of the final credits.There is nothing to make the viewer care about the characters. There is nothing to create sympathy in the viewer regarding the troubled world of Xenia, at least as it is portrayed in the film.The only character who appears ""wholesome"" in the film is really a pervert; he molests a young woman in front of her sisters, but even then I didn't care. By this stage of the film, I ought to have some emotional investment, but I honestly felt apathy toward the scene... it ought to have roused anger or indignation, but I found myself sighing and looking at my watch. When the viewer cannot establish any emotional connection to any of the characters, this is indicative of poor story structure and poor film making.Is this art? No; art follows a structure. When the director throws conventional plot structure and character development out the window, what the director has made is a poor Youtube video. This experience is similar to watching a child destroy a toy while his mother remarks ""see how creative he is"".",Gummo
199,VK-Fail,"Incredible, Shocking, Beautiful, Moving",10,1 August 2001,"This film is a unique moment.  People who knock it for lack of ""plot"", or characters have missed the point.  For a start the characters are an incredibly rich mixture of people and personalities, who are far more interesting than most Hollywood blank, 2D, characters.  While there may not be a plot, it doesn't need one because the different stories it tells weave together perfectly and you get a great picture of the town and its residents.The film is shot brilliantly as well, Korine using so many different techniques so effectively.  The editing is the same, bringing all the different parts together superbly In short, one of the best films ever. Ever. OK.",Gummo

And then what?? 2 kids killing cats to sell to a Chinese restaurant then getting high on glue with the proceeds, retards being pimped, chairs being beaten up and a bunch of imbred unpleasant hick rednecks talking mass sadism and imbreeding in a film that could have been written better by a 2 year old. Gummo fails on all accounts as a badly constructed misconstrewn series of events detailing the lives of low lives, I know I can walk round downtown Glasgow to look at the people frolicking there without having to sit and suffer this drivel. It's supposed to be a sign of our times movie but does so in a way that infuriates rather than makes us sit up and take note as it tries in vain to shock but is rather a spoilt childs way of getting attention rather than geting us with any serious clout. A catchy opening tune a good film does not make and certainly could not resurrect this DUD.Avoid at all costs.",Gummo
201,markjay9,Like an accident - can't look away,8,3 July 2006,"I wanted to turn this movie off, but could not. It was like an accident that you can't look away from. I even watched the DVD extras, which I NEVER do. Thie movie felt more like a documentary than a movie. I got the feeling that no one was acting, but someone was following a bunch of (hardly) normal kids around town. I must say, some of the oddest looking individuals you will ever see as well. Almost a freak show. Certainly not for the animal lover - especially if you lean towards felines. I heard them talking about this flick on Ron and Fez, which made me rent it. Now I want to see Kids and Bully, both of which were also mentioned. As far as Gummo goes: it was very interesting and goes down as the oddest movie I have EVER seen.",Gummo

Yes, Athena is the God of Wisdom, but the city is named after the word for HOSPITALITY. Tornadoes in Greece are very rare. The producers never visited Xenia. We've had 2 tornadoes since 1974, which one are they talking about?It's very obvious that this movie needs to be banished from fiery pits from which it came. It's absolutely horrible. Every year we get idiots who watch the movie then come to town expecting to see what was in the movie. Sorry pals, no such luck. Those people usually end up spending the night in county lock up.So, in summary, a horribly inaccurate movie.",Gummo

But for anyone who is going to watch this film you must have an open mind. My only word of advice. Enjoy it as much as you can. In my opinion it gives a raw look at life.

206,radovic_60,True gem of modern film industry. Sad and brilliant!,10,29 December 2007,"This is one of most unbelievable films I ever saw. Think its totally misunderstood gem of modern film industry. Harmony Korine did a great job freeing himself of stereotypes and showed what's the other side of America's red carpets. Story is unique and disturbing. It's about small town in Ohio called Xenia and it is showing how life can be a true hell. I think that point is on misfortune of birth, and how we cannot always chose how is our life is going to be. One of the great things in film is camera - wild and steady - depending on weight of the scenes. Some parts of the movie are documentary shots and they are brilliantly mixed up with regular scenes. If you're going to watch this, turn of your cellphone, put your headphones enjoy this masterpiece in the dark and silence 'couse it is its atmosphere. Dark and brilliant, for sure. If I could I would give it 11 of 10. Enjoy",Gummo
207,stroomblok,one of the best films ever made,10,3 October 2007,"why all this nagging about a plot line? Why do people want plots in movies? Let me tell you a plot; Something happens to somebody. Then another thing happens to somebody else. Then they meet. (or; that's WHY they meet). Initially things don't go the right way. But then something happens that makes them see the solution for the problem they've been having. And in the end everything is OK. Maybe one or more minor characters have to die, just to make it more interesting. END. Can I be a scriptwriter for Hollywood now? Why can't people just watch a film and enjoy it? Because they're not used to really watch. They want to be distracted. Because really watching means; using your brains. And using your brains is not considered cool for most people. They don't pay a DVD-rent, or the fee for going to the cinema to use their brains! (maybe even the opposite). In my opinion GUMMO is one of the best films ever made.",Gummo
208,orioli07,A great movie,10,9 December 2007,"Gummo is a truly terrific movie. It presents something very unusual that other movies never do.I think the people who most appreciate it are those who have grown up in a town similar to the setting in Gummo. People who appreciate watching something powerful and realistic, rather than some fake and insignificant movie like Superman.People who are fascinated by movies that are just useless and have the same actors found in other movies, will really not appreciate this movie. Gummo is for those people that firmly stand on the ground and like watching something that has meaning and reflects a unique demoralized society found throughout the world.I really recommend this movie, but not to everyone.",Gummo

I understand that it can be fun to watch movies that center around certain regional epitomes of Americana (i.e. Raising Arizona pegged Arizonians perfectly), but this movie was pointless and frankly, stupid. I know, Konine was just painting the portrait of backwoods, white trash Ohio. We all know that Ohio breeds morons, and yes, the movie paints that picture well. But, my gripe is why? Why do we NEED to see kids killing cats, drunken morons beating the crap out of a chair, mentally challenged girls being taken advantage of? Etc. etc. Why do people pay to watch this crap? I think it's a travesty that Konine gets any kind of financial compensation for this ridiculous, vapid, tale of what we all know encompasses the state of Ohio. Shame on you Harmony Konine....",Gummo
210,ObiMcD,Gummo is absolutely the worst film I have seen in my life,1,5 September 2005,"Even if you were a fan of the film kids, I highly highly highly discourage you from even getting close to this piece of trash. It does nothing that a good movie should, entertain, inspire, or inform. The director went for some sort of avant-garde thing and ended up with an 89 minute waste of film. From the poor acting to the ridiculous story line, every copy of this film should be burned at the stake. The depictions of the mentally handicapped in this movie are offensive, and I feel bad for the actresses (who were actually mentally handicapped i believe) that participated in this movie. The editing was bad and mad the movie go on about 88 minutes longer than it should have. It really could only make sense to someone who invents what the film is inside of their own head. The director has given you nothing but 89 minutes of paint huffing, mind numbing dribble. I would gladly take ANYTHING that's come out of Hollywood (even the awful Amityville remake) over this. Weird Indie does not necessarily equal brilliant. A good plot and good acting is still a requirement. In short, please for the love of God do not torture yourself with this movie. It should die a horrible firey death. If you still go out and get it, let it be known that you've been warned.",Gummo
211,ChocoBabiChan,An hour and forty-five minutes I'll never get back.,1,8 July 2004,"What can I say? I saw the movie and it SUCKED beyond belief. The movie was disgusting, distasteful, and retarded. To sum it up, the movie made no sense what so ever. There was no plot, no story line, no direction, other that the sad display of how a whole freakin town of white trash could be retarded. And what in the world was up with the ending? Most movies either end with a conclusion, or leaving you wanting more, etc. But this movie did neither. It was almost like the power went out while filming. I'm not even white and I felt offended by the malicious stereotyping. When I read a summery about the moview prior to seeing it, I thought I would be watching a film about a small town struggling to recover from a terrible tornado. The tornado was mentioned once in the movie. There was no other reference to the tornado nor the after effects of a natural disaster. WTF???????!!!",Gummo

This movie has something for everybody, a retarded prostitute, plenty of Roy Orbinson, and some of the most rockin songs by sleep and Bathory.  This movie has a  full throttle, f**k you hollywood attitude that I really got excited about in my numerous viewings.

When I had heard from friends that the movie basicallydoesn't have a plot, some of the acting is pretty bad, etc. I thought I would pretty much hate this film. But I love it, it always catches your attention (even when you've seen it tons of times), and isn't that what a great movie is about? Sure some of the scenes are fairly graphic and seem to make no sense, but that gives it character. It creates conversation and emotion, even if you ""didn't like it"" you are still talking about it. Like for instance the scene in the bathtub, what's the deal with the bacon? It makes no sense, but you have to give a second glance anyway? Besides the fact that Korine is somewhat of a ""subtle genius"" with the screenplay, the filming is amazing. They tie both the rough and professional filming together beautifully, and it's not obnoxious. The entire movie fits, everything in it works out, I think it was made to provoke thought, and it definitely does.",Gummo
214,btmaisel-604-5810,An inside look at lower-class America,10,9 February 2013,"I am not entirely certain how to describe this film. It is aimless, winding its way across the screen like the tornado that destroyed Xenia. It is truly an unseemly picture. I loved it.Gummo is the kind of film that draws you in with a visual aesthetic that is anything but. Even the goofy-looking kid on the front cover is harder not to stare at than found footage of Andy Warhol being pelted to death with Chambord-soaked Nerf balls. This was intentional; the director said that the adolescent playing ""Bunny Boy"" had a face he could never get tired of looking at. Gummo carries that intensity across the entire landscape.The portrayal of mental illness in the lower echelons of society is genuine: Gummo is the first honest film I have seen in some time. The entire film is in bad taste; the scripted scene with the obviously-exploited hooker with Down Syndrome is enough to jolt the system into alertness, but there's an innocence to the scene as well. To be honest, I thought the boys were buying meth until certain details were revealed. That's how this film works: revelation.The opening scene is a boy drowning a cat, something that most will find indefensible. It isn't real, people: this movie was made in America, after all. The prosthetic animals in this film are some of the best I have seen. Nothing is particularly superfluous about this film; it just is what it is. Anybody who takes issue with the treatment of cats in this film is either not paying attention closely, is drawn in to the realism of the work, or is just a person blinded by preferential treatment. Stray animals are one of the largest problems during a natural disaster; a wildfire last year in Colorado pushed more than 30,000 people from their homes and sent bears and other wildlife scurrying dangerously close to a downtown metropolitan area.This movie is white trash, no doubt about it. Many documentaries fail to hit the mark struck by Gummo. I doubt I will see another film that shows what growing up or living in lower-class America is really like. I've lived it, and could only imagine such an undertaking with the help of a lot of friends and relatives.There are treats to be found in this film, small glances at human behavior that otherwise are not readily seen without meeting people like these, yourself. There are other treats, unusual angles that take a second glance, or strange things in the background. There is bacon taped to a wall in a bathtub, in one scene, which Werner Herzog said ""particularly moved"" him. It was filmed in Nashville, claiming to be Ohio, but could take place in any backwater town in the country.Gummo is worth it, and cannot be compared to any other movie. It set its own bar. Later films by other directors will mimic the style or content, such as Jonathan Caouette's film Tarnation's editing, but just like Tarnation, will completely fail to achieve the same product.",Gummo

I had to. I was...what's the word I'm looking for?... Ah, yes, I was disgusted. I find no redeeming value in watching this movie. None.There's sick and twisted that's good(like any of the Romero zombie flicks). There's weird and disturbing that's good(like any of the Jodorowsky flicks). Then there's ""Gummo"". The title makes me think of gum stuck to the bottom of my shoe. Which makes me think of dog turd stuck to the bottom of my shoe. Which leads right back to ""Gummo"".I usually don't write bad reviews.

I can't speak for every Xenian, but that isn't the way we are.With that a side I'm a huge movie fan of all genres and a fan of both mainstream and indy flicks. After seeing hundreds, maybe thousands of movies, this takes the cake as THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE. That's quite an accomplishment. There is zero plot, zero story, zero point to this stench of a movie. I feel violated that spend the time to finish this movie. If I could take the time I spent watching this back and choose to watch paint dry during it instead, I could die a happier man. Please do yourself a favor and avoid this disaster at all cost!",Gummo

Not even a good soundtrack featuring Sleep and Brujuria could save this festering pile of dog crap. If you like movies that have no sense of narration, you might like this one. If you like movies that have no sense of purpose but to shock, you might like Gummo. If you like movies that feature juveniles inhaling spray paint, you might like Gummo. If you like movies that feature children eating plates of pasta while sitting in bathtubs full of filthy water, you will like Gummo. That bathtub scene pretty much sums up this film. It makes no sense on any level. I don't know if this film is supposed to make an artistic statement or if it is just supposed to shock people with its weirdness and its creepiness. I've heard that this is a black licorice sort of a film, either you love it or you hate it. Count me as one of the haters and don't trust anybody who claims to like this film with you money.

This movie is truly, honestly.. about nothing. There is no plot to this movie. Honestly, nothing happens that changes a character in any way, nothing happens that moves the plot forward, because there is none. The movie is a bunch of scenes of people in a city in Ohio, living degenerate lives, basically doing whatever they want to do. I'm writing this review directly after watching it, and as of right now, I can't think of any reason why this movie exists. I don't say that as a negative, but as me admitting that I have no idea what this movie is trying to say. Maybe the point of this movie is to show how horrible people can be, but I'm not sure in the slightest. The one thing I can give this movie is that its got some pretty memorable scenes. This movie has a lot of nuggets of goodness in it, cinematography wise, while also trying to be intentionally bad looking sometimes, which I personally take on the stance that its intentional to make the movie as dirty and rough as the world the characters live in. This review might be a little all over the place with the tone, but I honestly think this movie's alright. Its not terrible, and I wasn't even bored in the slightest watching it, and I believe the director did what he was trying to do; make a rough, dirty, pointless movie about life in a world with degenerate people.

It has a lot of great scenes, that show unusual and uncomfortable human behaviours that do happen but are never mentioned. Korine has a talent for creating memorable scenes with no substance behind them. The film is the definition of pretentious to me. It attempts to capture peak moments of difficult relationships and life circumstances but it never delves into any of it deeper or for longer. It just is. It feels almost as if Korine used the struggle of others to create a film full of intense moments without bothering to help us understand the situations of the individuals involved.

The movie, at least in my opinion, is a metaphor for poverty, depravity, hopelessness, rough upbringings, the people that stem from those upbringings, and the downtrodden parts of America that aren't all sunshine and rainbows.

The movie quickly goes into some of the aftermath of the tornado that hit the town. The story that follows is very unrealistic and insulting. I have many college friends from this town, and its not as bad as it is depicted in the movie. Surly any town hit with a tornado of that size would suffer economically, but i doubt it would end up in the citizens having to hunt cats to sell to local food stores. Every male in this movie has a mullet, and is portrayed as a racist,lazy bum with no job. Every women is portrayed as a cheap whore. Very unrealistic. The movie is very unique and ""messed up"", but it is NOT an accurate portrayal of Xenia, Ohio. The movie has great shock value, and the characters are enjoyable. There isn't much of a story line, its more like a sample taken out of the life of Xenia citizens.

Then about a year ago i see it's on IFC so i decide to watch it since i Love KIDS(also from Harmony Korine) I was blown away after watching the whole film. The film has this real gritty atmosphere and it feels so real. I doesn't have any plot but i understood it more then any film I've ever seen. Harmony Korine is such a great director and its the oddest film you will ever see. I highly recommend this film because there's nothing like it.

This film has somewhat of an identity crisis.  On one hand, there are some frank and gritty documentary-style interviews which wonderfully review rural personalities in Tennessee (where the filming occured) rather than Xenia, Ohio as we are supposed to beleive.  [Any Southerner would know those weren't Ohio accents..hehe] On the other hand, the drama segments attempt to loosely weave a story by sampling snapshots of local life, albiet through some rather bland acting.  Some scenes are obvious attemts at avante-garde by presenting some mundane, detached action which continues for what seems like forever (i.e. eyebrow shaving scene, bunny-kid playing accordian). Gummo could have been a good movie had it been aided by an interested script writer and a decent editor.

Now that I have an understanding of the medium, I can appreciate Korine's fine use of editing and mixture of film and video. While the film is disturbing, the subject matter is intriguing.  I think this intrigue is partially due to a certain shock value the movie contains, but the visual elements save the film from being dismissed as solely based on it.  I could only suggest this movie to certain people...and my mom, for instance, would not be one of them. And having visited Xenia, I can assure those of you who will not have the pleasure of visiting there that this is not an accurate, complete representation of the town, or any city in Ohio.",Gummo

I was hating it and loving it at the same time. It's a hideously beautiful series of perverse portraits of humanity, and I have never been so happy NOT to be on acid! It's been 11 hours since I watched it and I can't get it out of my head. I tried to explain it to someone as a movie I thoroughly despised but then found myself talking about how great it was.It reminded me of a David Lynch film (maybe Harmony Korine wants to hear that, maybe not) but it was so much better. It was masterfully assembled-I couldn't really tell if it was all acting or part documentary/part acting. The characters were such freaks, so ugly and stupid and incredibly sad. I could pop some popcorn, sit on the side of the road in a lawn chair, and watch these nuts live their beautiful little lives. I am changed.So, if you want a movie that will be with you under your skin forever, this one is for you. You do need to step outside the conventional Hollywood formula, however, and open your mind to aspects of human beings we like to pretend don't exist.

I also believe that it is a critique of American gender roles, through the juxtaposition of male and female characters, and the androgynous (perhaps a hero) figure of Bunny Boy. Anyone who thinks this film is pretentious or stupid should watch it again, with a more open mind.  There is a lot to this film, and it certainly stands up to repeated watchings.  Great movie.

The treatment of the ""actors"" was painful to watch and the movie was disgusting. There was no redeeming point of the movie; the filmmaker it seems just wanted to show a moving slide show of crap.

Otherwise follow the advise from Monty Python's killer rabbit crew and RUN AWAY! GUMMO is to movies what barf pools are to dive bar latrines. I paid to see this insipid paean to teen angst way back when it came out and so I watched it all the way through, although, in order not to gnaw my hands of, I resorted to sticking needles in my eyes to distract me from the dour farce perpetrated on the now forever stained screen before me.

I mean if you like watching something about misery and sadness then watch it. but keep in mind that these people your filming and watching just got hit by a horrible natural disaster.

It is essentially a documentary-style film chronicling the lives of people living in a post-tornado town in Ohio. While some may try to describe this movie as ""original"" or ""beautiful"", the truth is the English language does not have enough adjectives to describe how utterly terrible this movie is.The worst thing about this movie is that it really seems to think it's saying something important about life.  I don't know what the message of this movie is.  I don't care what the message of this movie is.  And if I knew what it was, it would not change my opinion.  The whole movie just plods along, with the most pointless, stupid, incoherent scenes imaginable, many of which are disgusting simply for the sake of being disgusting.  It is the film equivalent of a pig wallowing in its own filth.  I suppose Harmony Korine was banking on his viewers being as intelligent as the residents of Xenia, since those are the only people whom would be even remotely interested in this piece of garbage.What's truly disgusting though, is the fact that there's actually a market for this kind of trash.  I've read reviews of this film that call it ""beautiful"", ""brilliant"", ""stunning"".  Honestly, when I see positive reviews of this movie, I feel inexpressibly sad.  The fact that intelligent human beings can actually enjoy this mess is a much more horrifying comment on society than the film itself.In my lifetime I have seen my fair share of awful movies.

This film hit home for me in a lot of ways I am from a state with many little towns just like Xenia and the people that inhabit Xenia, so I was laughing pretty hard through most of it. The reason why people don't like this film is because they don't understand it...many people jump on the ""dislike bandwagon"" when they don't understand something.

What could be better than a what seems like 20 minute of several people breaking furniture in their kitchen in a drunken rage?  If you answered ""Anything"" then your sentiments match my own.  This movie was so anti-social and horrible that I could barely stand to watch for more than 5 minute periods.  I am no censorship advocate either.  I like a graphic movie if that graphic element actually adds something to the movie, but in this case it is just Harmony Korine trying to be edgy and sick, like he was in his first writing attempt, the deplorable ""Kids"".  How can you like a movie when you hate every one of its lead characters?  If you feel no sympathy for the protagonist, you obviously can't share in his struggle, and so you just don't care!

The concept of the movie is one thing and one thing only: to show/disturb you about the lives of a shell-shocked town shortly after a tornado. I must say, it does so very well. You are not SUPPOSED to feel much remorse for the characters through traditional character development (protagonist trifling through a series of events) since there isn't really a protagonist. Instead, you have to pay attention to the surroundings, the interactions and the links between various characters to get the full understanding required for this film. I saw it as more of a mosaic - several small bits to create a whole.No, this is definitely not a movie style for many people but if you ask me, the whole thing is damn near brilliant.",Gummo
242,eerk,"weird, hypnotic, you just have to watch it till the end",10,28 May 2001,"this movie without a story or seemingly without a script follows two boys in their village which was half-destructed by a tornado. it's a fascinating gathering of sypathetic, and sometimes not so sympathetic weirdos and freaky characters.it's really the way that the director filmed it (scratchy montage, digital low-quality shootings), and the conversations between the two boys that make the movie so compelling and fascinating to watch. the movie is filmed like the lives of all the people in the village. there's no real development, people don't really do much to improve their situation, it's a secluded world they live in.the weird southern-style music and the many unexplained characters like the pink-bunny boy make it a surreal experience.one more thing: lots of people compare GUMMO with harmony korine's later film JULIEN DONKEY BOY but to me they're two worlds apart. while gummo succeeds in letting the viewer sympathise with all the strange characters, julien donkey boy absolutely fails and really gives you no reason to care about them.gummo is a beautiful movie i have watched again and again, and would recommend it to people who have enjoyed films like 'bad boy bubby' and the like.",Gummo

Believe me. The plot is field with forced events tending to shock the audience. Technically the movie is poor pretending to be on purpose. The acting is helpless as well as the directing. The director wishes to become David Linch resulting less then Goofy. Don't watch this awful movie (unless you believe to my wife).",Gummo
244,gummo97,"So funny, yet so poignant, I found myself loving this film.",10,16 July 2001,"Gummo, well what can I say about this film, in a nutshell it is essentially a film about a town that has never recovered from a tornado.  But below that, the tails that the Director, Harmony Korine, has woven are fundamentally sad, this town has lost something and it aint ever coming back, but the people live on.  The narrative is seldom linier it is not about anything in particular, there is no imminent crisis, no-one is about to blow up the world, it is just about the town folk.  The film takes you on a tour of characters within the town using two boys, who appear to make there living killing cats, using rat poison, then selling the cats to the local Chinese food shop.  There is a very human quality to all the flawed characters that we are introduced to, you feel drawn into these peoples lives.   From the Albino girl with the boom box car to the pair of brother who fight about trainers and such, violence plays a huge part in this film, but it is an almost casual violence.Substance abuse is also a major issue within this film, be it glue-sniffing or alcohol, the story is about a dead town, a town with no hope, and a town with no future this is what happens when we have no future we seek to escape and we use anything to help us.  What these characters do is fill time, that is what they have, this could almost be a prison movie, because fundamentally that is what the town-folk do, fill time.  The girls want a man, want redder nipples or want a moustache, dammit, the men folk want each other, more beers, or a fight with that chair.  The bunny-boy seems to epitomise the sadness within the town the lack of hope that they all share.
Harmony Korine never lets you get under the skin of the character they are left only half drawn and maybe they should stay that way.  Each character is a cliché, someone your parents pointed at and said 'When you grow up do you want to be like that?'.  Yes I want to be like that there is nothing wrong with it, far more interesting that the lives of the rich and famous.
The individual characters can all be found out there in the real world, just here they are all taken and thrown together.  This film does not offer the glamorous view of life that Hollywood wants us to see, this is life of real people, and their very real flaws.Also no hint is ever given for the title of this film, but here if you want is my opinion.  The only other Gummo I can think of is the 5th Marx Brother, the one everyone forgets, the one who never made a film, and this film is about a forgotten town with characters the Hollywood and the real world tries to forget.  Well that is my opinion for the truth you would have to ask Harmony Korine, and I'll bet that I am a million miles away.I am in no doubt that this film will have critics queuing up to knock this film, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Films seldom touch me, nor do films make me think, but this film did both.",Gummo

246,Dan_Shearing,Uniquely compelling film that is not for people with closed-minds,10,18 September 2001,"Well, I'd heard a lot about this film before I bought it, but nothing I was told really prepared me for how different this film is from anything else I've seen. On first viewing, Gummo appears to be a collection of random events, but after watching it a few more times, it it becomes more obvious how each scene and character link together (although there are still a few that I am unsure of!!). The nearest analogy I can think of is of a music album. Each scene is like a song that can be enjoyed on its own, but when the album is listened to as a whole it becomes much more than just a collection of songs, all linked in their own way. Plus, like a great album, the more times you listen\watch, the more you get out of it. People will criticise this film for having no plot and to start with I agreed, but if you work hard to understand the film then you will get much more reward and enjoyment then from most Hollywood blockbuster's. The beauty of Gummo really is that there are so many questions that you can and will watch it again and again and get something different every time. This film is reasonably short, but it is probably the only film I have seen where every scene has worked. I am a very difficult viewer to please, but every scene in this film kept me enthralled and I did not want to fast forward once, even in the times I have watched it since (about 15 times!!)

The review snippets perked my interest in this film even more. I was very disappointed. The characters lacked any depth or personality. Don't wait for the storyline because there isn't one. I sat through this film expecting a moral, something tangible to take away from it but I was left with nothing. You could watch this film from the middle and it would make no more sense then viewing it from the first. Kids was a much better film it left me thinking about and feeling for the characters, so I was expecting the same from this film.   The few characters I was hoping to find out more about were the bunny boy and the rival kitty killer. Yet like all the other characters you are given information on them to perk your interest and then let down when you are given nothing more. The characters are left going nowhere and are given no depth nor personality. You know as much about them by the end of the film as you do from the opening scenes.I realize this film is meant to have no plot but when you have no plot then you must have characters that you can just fall in love with.

What bothered me was the mocking lens of the camera; the ""I am from a coast and therefore it's ok to view these midwesterners as zoo animals.  Aren't they entertaining?""I live in NYC now but I grew up in a town not unlike the Xenia, Ohio depicted in Gummo.  What disturbed me was the classism inherent in the creation of this movie.  It's not funny that people pimp out their retarded relatives for money.  It's not funny that poverty breeds ignorance and the pursuit of self-destruction.  It's painful in real life; it's abhorrent when elitist filmmakers commodify it and pawn it off as art for a quick buck.If Harmony Korine wanted to do something with any modicum of social justice, he would have donated a portion of the proceeds to a fund that serves to educate those trapped in environments like Xenia, OH.  Poverty and ignorance aren't something to be displayed arrogantly on the silver screen as testimony to what you are not.

This somewhat scaring film can have an effect like no other. Sadly it is an American, but in this case only adds to its perfection. This film is true poetry, although not for the week minded. Gummo is what films want to be but don't dare. A real look into life, however depressing this portrayal seems.

My sister who is older then I, rented it because it said made by the creator of Kids. Well, her and her boyfriend left after 20 minutes, and I slapped my tongue on the floor trying to figure out what was going on. I have this need to figure things out, like a Rubik's cube, I was sure the point was somewhere in this gem, well not exactly, but thats not its fault.People deny Gummo, for what reasons? Does it make them ashamed,depressed? I never could figure it out, I laughed most the movie, (my favorite scene ever in a movie is when he is working out to like a prayer and the mom talks about his shoulder) but I also had this sense of underlying fear, from the metal songs, talks about molestation, kitty killing and such, it disturbed me. That made me have more questions, why could this movie disturb me, and what was I scared of? Well the truth to me is, life. We live in a sheltered country, and behind every closed door is something that most try to hide, Gummo embraces these secrets and hidden actions. There is not a proper English sentence in the movie, problem isn't one in this review! As a society we are degrading, we lower our standered and we don't seem to care. This movie puts the lifestyle that most lead to truth, drugs, sex, rock and roll, racism, food, excess, etc.But from the opposite spectrum. Thats my take on it, but after I watched this movie over and over again, I no longer laugh as much at it, I feel it and I think I realize the main point of its brilliance, and that is not in finding a point, but to find what point you want.

Keep in mind we had no idea that the town was mostly destroyed by a tornado until after the movie and having learned that information, was strangely satisfied to hear the town fate. I think this is the first movie i've ever watch that had no direction, no plot, no intriguing story or character development, and it didn't even have that ""Documentary"" style that might help a viewer know what it is he's watching.

I pretty much see it as if your just high, then this movie makes you feel like your tripping, and if your tripping, then the first time you watch it while tripping is going to seem like the longest, drawn out, intense, curious, almost repulsive experience that your brain can endure for a while.This movie pretty much advertises things that society tries to ignore, yet they are still possible, especially in Ohio/the Midwest. IT shows that trashy people eat while taking a bath, and it makes the little annoying gross details quite apparent. There is really no way to fully understand the movie until you experience it for yourself. i Recommend watching it with a group of friends who have a tolerance for drawn out awkward and usually disturbing scenes. One other thing i just want the world to know...the part in the movie where the retarded girl is shaving her eyebrows, throughout the whole scene you probably will be disturbed anyways but what is really disturbing is when she laughs during the scene. It really makes you feel like she is laughing at you laughing at her, like as if she knows you are watching her real face in your TV as her mirror.When a movie can do that to you, i think that the director is most likely a genius in some way. Harmony Korine must share the same curiosity of the world as frequent trippers like myself.this movie is either excellent or pointless. it all depends on if your standard of life has a point to it. for me, drugs have proved that there is no point to life and that movies like Gummo are there to just rub it in for stoner's like me n you!",Gummo

Who cares about the couple of minutes scenes that don't say much, or the unexploited characters as someone said.

When I first started watching this film I was somewhat shocked having grown up very far away from anything like the town that the movie was set in. Something about the the disgusting lives and people draws you in and makes you want to see more. I realized partly into watching this movie that it is not just about hate, devastation and poverty. I saw the love in this film that is almost greater than the love I've seen in the upper-middle class neighbourhood I'm growing up in. These people do not fear judgement, they are what they are and don't apologize for it for feel shame, thats the beautiful thing about it.

I was blazing like the best of them when watching this (so as open minded as anyone could be) and it was still crap.

The storyline is non existent at the best of times, the actors are terrible, and the imagery is just shocking enough to make you keep watching, just. In my opinion this movie is light years away from the 6.0 it currently has on IMDb. Like going to the dentist for a root canal, this movie is unfortunately one of those things that is painful but has to be done.

261,Rex_Rudolph,White Trash: The Slideshow,4,28 December 2011,"This is certainly a curious movie, I'll grant it that. Another word to describe it, however, is the word ""random."" There is little, if any, plot concerned here. It just seems to be about a small, white trash town in Ohio that was hit by a tornado in the early 90s, and is a documentation of those who supposedly survived it. Sure enough (or is ""incidentally"" the word I'm looking for?), each and every one of them are just plain, flat out F**KED UP. So is this picture. Two young boys ride on their bikes looking for cats to kill and drown and kidnap and sell to the butcher shop for meat. Two teenage girls (one played by Chloe Sevigny from Kids and The Brown Bunny) with shaved eyebrows are just plain bored, put duct tape on their nipples and rip it off, then go out on the town saying dirty phrases to young men (or women, in this case). There are also at least three gay people involved, one who wants to be a trans-gender, and the other (played by the writer-director himself) who was abused in his childhood and wants to have sex with midgets. The parents are no better. They are drunks who don't even seem to work, they just either roughhouse with each other, act like racists or have relations with their own gender. There may indeed be people like this on spread out all across our planet, and in some places at least there undoubtedly are. Gummo is very unpleasant for anyone to watch.However, that is not the main reason why I was disappointed in it. I have nothing against avant-garde films, or even sick and depraved ones. The problem with all of this is that Gummo has NO STORY. It is nothing more than a bunch of random video clips, out of any sequence that could have been pulled out of writer-director Harmony Korine's bottom. You could go into an editing program on your computer, take one clip from the film, and put it elsewhere in it, in a place of your choice. For example, in at least three different parts, three different still photos of random cats are shown. Throughout the picture, different characters are introduced every five minutes who have no significance to the story whatsoever. It also looks like home videos, like the type you would find anywhere on YouTube, are stuffed in there, and these families are not introduced again. We are introduced to drug addicts, pedophiles, murderers, people who commit incest; you name it, with one thing in common: no connection to each other whatsoever. In another part, the two boys decide to shoot a dying old lady in the foot. WHY?! WHAT IS THE POINT OF ALL THIS?!! YOU COULD PUT IN AN UPSIDE-DOWN STILL IMAGE OF WOODROW Wilson EATING PIZZA AND IT WOULD MAKE ABOUT AS MUCH SENSE!!! On the upside, the performances are quite good (didn't care for Jacob Reynolds, though). It almost feels like it is a documentary, and not a drama. It seems like you are actually talking to rejects that live in a tornado-stricken town with no electricity, money, or interesting things to buy, not actors. What would probably explain this best is that on the DVD, there is a feature where writer-director Harmony Korine is interviewed, saying he just held auditions for and hired random people who worked in factories and fast food restaurants in the middle of nowhere throughout Tennessee, the state in which it was filmed. I also think at least a couple (emphasize ""a couple"") of scenes are rather powerful, like the scene where the two boys kick down the boy with rabbit ears, curse at him and rob him, Solomon's mother pointing a gun at him and threatening to kill him if he didn't smile, and I thought the character of the retarded girl was rather interesting. I have not yet seen Korine's other films, but at this time I think Korine had all the basic elements of making a movie, he just isn't sure how to develop a rational plot, sequence, or character background for anyone. I can see why a lot of people hate this film. I myself did not think it to be horrible, just not very well thought out or captivating as a whole.Unfortunately, all in all, Gummo just left me cold instead of entertained, or even interested. It was too long, as well. I suppose its over length contributes to my being unmoved by a majority of the complete randomness of the supposedly ""shocking"" sequences throughout; each action committed by a person in the movie just goes nowhereI believe Harmony Korine was trying to show that in real life, people like this are as aimless with their futures as they are depicted here, and just do whatever they are used to, no matter what it takes. But if it is to no great effect, then, I say, why bother to show those actions? I cannot recommend it, but some scenes should be viewed by everyone at least once, if at this time they do not understand that there are people in the world like this. I think most rational adult minds would know that, though, and there are better films out there that show that. Certain die-hard fans of the ""avant-garde"" or ""underground"" genres may like people and situations being depicted like this, not me. It's just not my cup of tea for a Saturday afternoon. My rating: **",Gummo
262,mpatrickmcconnell,3000+ films and this is the worst,1,11 May 2010,"As a film, humanities student, I have see a lot of films. A minimum of 3000. The opening goof that said that 'we are close minded' must have been paid to write that. I was told by another film buff that this was the worst film ever made. I blew it off as just another opinion in which the statement 'worst film ever' is made too often. Then I rented it. Without question, this an abomination that should be shown to everyone on death row until they finally end their appeal process. Many terrible movies has somewhat of a silver lining but this 'film' doesn't even have this. Stupid from the start and it ended up pissing me off that I wasted 88 LONG minutes on this.",Gummo
263,moviekid84,definitely worth seeing,8,2 September 2003,"Harmony Korine, although a spoiled rich kid pretending to be a struggling indie filmmaker, is really clever, and deserves credit for his work.  Love him or hate him, this movie is spectacular.  Although the simple plot line of ""White trash living in Ohio"" might not seem that enthralling, the way the movie is shot, mixing documentary style (albeit acted) clips with an actual plotline, is excellent.  The first time I saw this, I didn't know if it really happened or not, that's how well Harmony pulls it off.  And the actors, for  having never had parts in anything before (except for a few of them) do an amazing job as well.  If you're put off by 'realistic' movies, or are easily disturbed, then yes, this movie will probably upset you. But even if it doesn't appeal to you, it's still a unique and original movie on it's own.Before you start bashing the movie, ask yourself, ""what do I expect from a movie based on destitute, racist, drug addicted people living in a small, small town?""",Gummo
264,beeennbee,a slew of imagery...,10,16 June 2010,"Gummo is a film that has no fear. As the film progresses the aesthetic of Xenia and its characters almost permeate themselves into the viewers mind. It also becomes apparent that Korine has a knack for the sick and twisted; coming up with a variety of grotesque scenarios that leave you staggering on the line of hilarity and horror. That's part of what I think makes this film so daring and original, some scenes are portrayed in a light that contributes to both the comic and the crass.While the typical linear structure that is seen in most modern films is not at work here, Gummo manages to express the frowns and smiles of cinema that we all know and love. This aspect of the film makes Gummo one that can be viewed multiple times very easily,as there is not a major plot that gets resolved in the end. It is merely a flood of images based around one central town. These images can be gross, haunting, brutal and beautiful at the same time. I just hope that people are able to see past the blunt force of Gummo, into its soul, one that far surpasses that of any blockbuster film.",Gummo

After almost a year, I decided to watch this again, and actually watched it 5 times in a week. It lost it's initial shock value, but is still quite disturbing. I realized that Harmony Korine is a genius. He doesn't stick to the same boring structure that has been present in film since the beginning, which is actually the same boring structure that has been present in theatre since the beginning. He's an innovator who is not afraid to take risks. This is a film that requires several viewings in order to be properly appreciated, and you must be a bit of a masochist in order to watch it for the first time, but it is so worth it.

It turns out he knows his stuff. Gummo is about a small town in Ohio after it has been devastated by a tornado. The movie follows many unique and eccentric characters such as the bunny boy and the nihilistic and bored Tummler. Each character brings its own story to the table, which helps shape the desolation and loneliness of the small Ohio residence they live in. The thing I found the most unique about this movie besides the excellent soundtrack featuring stoner metal gods Sleep and black metal king Varg Vikernes of Burzum fame is the excellent camera work and story. The story really doesn't have a conceited, concrete plot and is told from many different twisted angles, which is really a refreshing idea. The camera work is also beautiful and well done. Not that i'm a photography or directing genius, but the director worked with many different kinds of film to bring out the grime and trash of the movie. It might take a few watches to fully appreciate this movie. If you're looking for a story that has a unique story and feel to it that will really make you think and wonder filled with eccentric and inspiring characters, this is the movie for you.",Gummo

270,samabbey,Gummo a film made of captivating moments and intriguing characters.,10,4 February 2012,"Gummo is cinema perfection it sets it's own standards and follows it's own rules, it has it's own blood life and form made up of the sad and heartfelt lives of the seemingly aimless residents of Xenia Ohio. I don't understand how anyone could hate this film or find it at all disturbing, it's a film about life and lives are what it captures, the cat killing isn't graphic or real and the drug use is not at all romanticized, the people who appear in this film are not at all exploited seeing as if you feel anything you will feel sympathy and understanding respect for each and every one of these people. I think what offends narrow minded unadventurous boring cinema goers is Gummo's lack of simple conventional narrative and Gummo's lack of distinct antagonists and protagonists, the only person that comes off as evil and unlikable is the wealthy old man who is the gossip columnist i guess the seen with him could play with the misconception that the wealthy have any more morals than the poor. The poor only what's done to get by and pass the time, while so called elites exploit only for the sheer sadistic pleasure of exploitation, that is a generalization but anyway i think the gossip columnist only tries to feel up Helen for the sake of making her feel degraded and worthless as to assert his position of wealth in a remedial way. I'd like to meet the critics in person to argue why Gummo is a moralistic film and not some freak show of white trash America. Gummo is a ground breaking American film in the vein of Cassevetes in reintroducing originality poetry and human beings in to a new type of film, like Cassavete's and all the greats of cinema Korine is an auteur and Gummo takes the viewer deep into the mind of the artist. With time Gummo will share the same pedestal for sheer originality as films such as citizen Kane.

I HAD to see Gummo.About two weeks ago, i finally got a chance to rent it... and from the moment that i first heard that GOD-AWFUL song during the opening (that made me want to throttle the next rooster i ever saw) all the way to the beautifully poignant tornado footage at the end, i truly LOVED this film. And I'll tell you why.This film has no plot. The cinematography is good, if not a bit sporadic. Most of the actual acting- as it were, is mediocre at best... the characters are believable, but they don't jump out of the film at you.... well, except for the film's mascot- the Bunny Boy.So why do I love it? Start out with the last sentence I said.The characters are BELIEVABLE.  The fact that they don't jump off the screen at you is what MAKES them believable.  These people could be anyone you or i knew, especially if you lived in a somewhat poor town in the midwest, like i did.You're not going to like this movie if you look at it to be anything other than what it is- a BRILLIANT and accurate social commentary on the sad, but at times bittersweet condition of ""white trash"" America.",Gummo

The story is suitably non-narrative with veiled references to dada and fluxus traditions; whilst the photography is lush and dirty at the same time.

Basically glue sniffing freaks that live in trailers and tell you disgusting stories about child molestation which,might I add have nothing to do with the story line and kind of just pop up out of nowhere. It's sort of like watching ""Freaks"",but thank god this isn't real. I wish Harmony Korine would just stick to telling depressing stories about New York because that's what she's good at.

Not following standard cinematic techniques and ideas, gummo is more of an experimental/art house film. It follows a small, hurricane stricken community in Xenia, Ohio and the daily struggles with their depressing and nihilistic Life. Nihilism, Religion, Poverty,Drug-use, and mental health are among the numerous issues and subjects explored by Harmony over the course of this film. The film is made up of a number of clips, centred around the people who live in the town. On the surface, this film is pure trash, but the more you delve into the disgusting and filthy masterpiece that is, Gummo, the more tragically beautiful the movie becomes. After watching gummo for the first time, I felt that I needed to have a shower. The movie leaves you feeling disgusting and sickened. And let me warn you, watching gummo is kind of like consuming a Harmony Korine ""drug"". By this, I mean that you cannot stop thinking about the movie for about 12 hours.

278,raspberryeskimo,Culture of Poverty,10,10 January 2005,"Harmony Korine, the maker of this powerful film, usually uses amateur actors and actresses that he meets in everyday situations. Many people in his films have never even considered acting. This creates such a raw and genuine feeling. The movie Gummo represents the culture of poverty, and it would not be as realistic if you have some rich celebrity playing an impoverished character. This movie takes place in Xenia, Ohio which is a small very rural town. I believe it is so important to keep in mind that these people live in a different world than many, yet this culture is a big part of the United States nonetheless. Some people may be uncomfortable watching this movie because they are not used to being exposed to those less fortunate and miseducated. An example is the drinking scene, in which a full-grown adult fights a kitchen chair, tearing it apart, while everyone else is cheering him on. This may seem like some bizarre ritual, but the truth is that it is perfectly normal to a people brought up on professional wrestling on TV.

The worst of the worst in the slummiest of the slums. In Xenia, Ohio, worn down trucks pass run down houses, emaciated cats lick up poisoned tuna fish off the ground, two greasy-haired teenage boys lean against a wall and huff toxic glue. Numbed and detached, they gaze into the blurred stretch of space in front of their eyes. This is rural America, and there really isn't much else to do.Gummo is a film like no other. There is no central plot and no character development. There is only the vision of director Harmony Korine and the 1.3 million dollars he needed to recreate the hypnotizing images floating about his head. Although it was filmed in Tennessee, Gummo takes place in a depressed, tornado-stricken town in southwest Ohio. It's a low-budget film about taboos-- topics that can make you genuinely uncomfortable, topics that shock and disgust, topics cautiously shown in the media, if ever. Gummo makes the viewer either want to shut the t.v. off and never see this nauseating garbage again, or keep watching until the end. But sitting through the whole movie doesn't make you a bad person. It means you can handle the hideous. The citizens of Xenia are vulgar and embody what many would define as white trash. They live in messy houses with plastic furniture, they speak crassly, they drink until they're belligerent and they torture cats for fun. They're societal outcasts, products of their dreary environment. They're deranged but they're believable. A gay dwarf comforts his crying friend. A long-faced adolescent eats soggy spaghetti while taking a bath, his mom rubbing soap in his hair. A Chinese restaurant serves stray cat meat. Skinhead twins wrestle in their kitchen. A four foot ten albino tells us what kinds of men she likes. A pervert tricks three girls into getting in his car. The glue-sniffing, cat killers shoot a comatose old lady in the foot with a b.b. gun while wearing clown-masks. A smiling girl with Down Syndrome is pimped around town by her brother. A man beats a dining room chair to death after losing in an arm wrestling match. A quiet, half-naked boy in pink bunny ears pees off a bridge. It's a sequence of images, a narrative about hedonism, about sadism, and ultimately about people. Montages of the 1974 tornado and voice-overs are placed here and there to create an eerie and enigmatic ambiance. Jumping from each character to the next, the film lacks any real sense of organization and story. But there's something so unique and riveting about Gummo, so fascinatingly appalling that its hard to get it out of your head.Gummo gives a rare depiction of aesthetics. Sure, a bouquet of roses or an orange sunset or a Raphael painting may be considered beautiful, but that isn't what Gummo is about. In a voice-over, the main character Solomon tells us amongst all the grime and misconduct of Xenia that, ""Life is beautiful, really, it is. Full of beauty and illusions. Life is great. Without it, you'd be dead."" In a rural town where nobody has anything, they can still see beauty in life, beauty in the grotesque. The grimness is only an illusion. They may not have diamonds or rubies or a tropical beach to gaze upon, but they do have wide blue skies, rainy cornfields, and a cornucopia of complex characters. For me, Gummo brings a sense of light to the nihilistic thoughts that cross through everyone's mind, the taboos that only those labeled as ""freaks"" would actually act upon.",Gummo

It even seems like it's really bad acting (especially by the younger actors) , but in a way I like it. It has something compelling and charming. The provoking part seems obvious. Main character Solomon and his friend Tummler shooting cats and selling them to the local restaurant to earn some money, sniffing glue and fornicating a mentally challenged person (and paying her husband for it). It's not everyday stuff for a 13 year old.

292,notrational,I can't believe Sundance fell for this crap,2,7 October 2005,"So, this guy Harmony finds some really cool characters and puts them in despicable places and shows us one disturbing scene after another. He does this with bad acting, crappy cinematography, and vague metaphors. He then has the audacity to put himself in the film playing the trite, predictable, awfully acted, victim homosexual. Add a black dwarf and it can be called art. Now throw in a common theme of cat killing for profit to sell to a butcher who sells it to a Chinese restaurant...oooooohhhh HOW ORIGINAL! The final blow on the B.S. detector is his ""holier than thou"" artist pose in the interviews under the credits in the special features of the DVD. I spent so much time in art class listening to this pitiful post-production justification of crap that I could spot it right out. Here's how it goes: 1. Make crap, but make it sad/distasteful/weird/socially annoying. 2. Avoid explaining any realization of your vision by acting like you are above the interviews. 3. Look down your nose at anyone who calls you on this as a cretin. I'm sad that Sundance fell for the trap.",Gummo
293,solomonopoly,This is Harmony Korine at his almost best...,9,22 October 2005,"If you like watching home videos of people you do not know that you may have picked up at a garage sale and they all turn out to be psychopaths, you'll love this movie.If you like watching Walt Disney Cartoons, you will HATE this movie...But your kids will probably dig it though...It has elements of everyday rural dig-dug and should be taken as very, very accurate of backwoods life.This town could be any town in Southeast Oklahoma as far as I'm concerned.If you have a problem with truth, you will not like this movie.If you have ever had Diabetes, are an Albino, are black, are gay, are dying of Cancer, or if you kill cats...then this movie is for you...",Gummo
294,mollytasha,Totally raw if not some what disturbing.,10,28 October 2005,If you are interested in seeing just how skewed our children have become please watch Gummo. The contrast of calm after the storm vs. the angst inflicted upon the towns people brings this film to life. This is not a film for the light hearted nor the adventure seeker. Be prepared to evaluate your own beliefs on the meaning of life as you know it and maybe even make some changes towards the betterment of others. The realness of the conversation is remarkable while disgusting at the same time. Some parts of this film made me nauseated while others made me laugh out loud at the complete lack of morality. I would not recommend to any under the age of 18. M.t.,Gummo
295,itldispatch1,Vastly different than anything you will see...,7,27 November 2005,"because no one else dares to write such a movie. Sundance fell for it because its unique and stylish whilst being incredibly disturbing and non-sequential. You just know a Korine movie when you see it and you watch it, sometimes repeatedly, because it is good. Gummo is great. Like kids, the happenings of a specific area and people are explored to the nth degree, bringing the full range of responses and behaviors from those people. Some will find this movie vile and disgusting but isn't that what we call entertainment? If it didn't shock you would you still buy it? Watch it again? Bother to go on a message board to proclaim your undying admiration for it? Everyone has their opinion so just watch it. Form yours...",Gummo
296,worshipnounours,Disturbing but strangely warm,8,17 August 2006,"Extremely disturbing film, kind of like a documentary without any narrative. Takes place in the town of Xenia, Ohio in the aftermath of a tornado. The characters are all extremely bizarre, which makes the viewer wonder how realistic things are. The settings, including messy houses and barren streets, are profoundly depressing. Still, there is a sensitivity behind the darkness that lends the film a strangely warm feeling. As well, one feels for the ""main characters"" (though these characters don't inhabit the film in a traditional sense) despite their misguided acts. Worth seeing for open-minded, patient audiences who don't mind abstract plots and off-topic segues.",Gummo
297,raredrops44,"Gummo, a convincing ethnography into a sick and twisted landscape of Hillbilly America.",9,6 March 2006,"Whats with the miserable people out there who have dragged this very funny film through the mud and failed to see its entertainment. As somebody who finds momentary journeying into the underbelly of any society quite fun, I rate this 9 out of 10.The characters are horrifically convincing, their boredom, glue sniffing and cat killing casual and normalised... This is a film to make you proud to be British (its set in Hillbillie territory; America), and one which whilst amusing you on one hand, will give you nightmares on the other.Watch it. Its harmless sick twisted ethnography of boredom in a hellhole town.",Gummo
