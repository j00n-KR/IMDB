0,MartinHafer,"Technically well-made, but the film isn't particularly pleasant",8,30 December 2006,"Here's a quick summation of the movie--American GRAFFITI stretched out over a one year period, set in the middle of nowhere and filled with liberal doses of sex.This is a very good movie in most ways. The acting and writing are superb and the direction is great--no complaints about any of this. However, despite being technically well-done, the film isn't all that pleasant to watch and isn't really appropriate for kids so you might want to think twice before you watch it.First, as for the unpleasantness, most of this was intended by the writer and director. It's all about life in a small god-forsaken town in Texas circa 1951-2. And, while a dead-on look in most ways, it also exposes how dull and awful it would be to live in such a place--at least for modern audiences. To top it off, the film has an omnipresent country music soundtrack that is appropriate to the time and place BUT which will also irritate most modern viewers. Listening to old fashioned country music, to me, is much worse than a film packed with opera or even bluegrass--it's just NOT what my rock-n-roll ears like to hear!! But, there is nothing wrong about this per se--it just doesn't play so well with 21st century audiences.Now as far as the sex goes, the film's themes all seem to revolve around it and EVERYBODY talks about ""getting laid"" or you get to see them in the act (and, by the way, it is incredibly brief and poor sex to boot). In addition, there is some full-frontal nudity and so this isn't a film to show granny or the kids.Despite these comments, I did at least admire the film even if I didn't particularly enjoy watching it. When not having sex or running around naked, the characters were exceptionally compelling and well-written. The acting was universally stellar as well--with Timothy Bottoms a particular standout. As far as sets, cinematography and direction go, you can also tell this was a labor of love--they really tried so hard to re-create the era and create a strong sense of nostalgia.",The Last Picture Show
1,TheLittleSongbird,"For me, it's one of the best of the 70s",10,26 January 2011,"The 70s is the decade of a number of wonderful movies, and The Last Picture Show is not an exception. It is a poignant, audacious, affectionate and hugely relevant film that for me has never aged or lost its significance. The cinematography and production values are simply superb. The script is beautifully written and evocative, Bogdanovich's direction is exemplary and the story draws me in and never stops. The film also has well-rounded characters that you care fully about, the nostalgic elements are lovingly realised and the re-creation of a long-lost sense of community makes the film so rewarding. The acting is superb, Jeff Bridges is wonderful in his role and so is Cybill Sheppard, but for me it is Cloris Leachman who is simply incredible. Overall, beautiful film and one of the best of its decade. 10/10 Bethany Cox",The Last Picture Show
2,bkoganbing,The Texas Ice Princess,9,13 June 2007,"The Last Picture Show, set in Texas during the early Fifties is about the coming of age of two Texas teens, Timothy Bottoms and Jeff Bridgesand the young lady who has an effect on both of them, Cybill Shepherd.Cybill part of what passes for society in this small hole in the wall town that's seen its better days. Her father is rich because of some prosperous oil leases. Her mother Ellen Burstyn is thinking she's discreet in her affair with oil worker Clu Gulager, but there ain't any secrets in that town. Shepherd is pretty, but spoiled. She flirts from Bridges to Bottoms, gets involved with Randy Quaid, Gulager and others. She breaks up the friendship with Bottoms and Bridges temporarily and causes all kinds of other havoc.Bottoms is also taken up with his high school coach's wife who also is unhappily married. Cloris Leachman delivers a strong performance there, possibly the best among the female cast members.However The Last Picture Show is known as the film that brought Ben Johnson an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Johnson drifted into acting, he was a rodeo performer who handled stock in several Hollywood films that John Ford took a liking to. He represented in his roles some of the best traditions of the American west as he does here.The tragedy is though he represents a way of life that has come and gone. And that it has passed is not for the better.Peter Bogdanovich as director got all kinds of deserved acclaim for this film that has become a classic. Sad to say Bogdanovich never quite did anything as good as The Last Picture Show.Almost 40 years later, The Last Picture Show still holds up well today and should not be missed.",The Last Picture Show
3,Leofwine_draca,"A look at life in a dead-end town, circa 1951",5,5 December 2016,"THE LAST PICTURE SHOW is a low budget, black and white character piece exploring the situation faced by youths coming of age in a dead-end Texas town in 1951. It's notable for helping a number of fresh-faced actors break into Hollywood; many of the cast here have gone on to great fame and fortune, and yet the film itself is a little disappointing, as is so often the way with these pictures that receive endless praise over the years.This film features more like a television production in terms of scale and I found it quite unaffecting, especially given the fact that many of the characters are self-centred and unlikeable. The exception is Cybill Shepherd, whose breathless beauty and carefully poised character is a highlight; she would later go on to greater things, not least TAXI DRIVER, but she's perfect here, capturing a sense of innocence mixed with desperation.The male characters fare less better, although the acting remains strong. Jeff Bridges plays a brash youth with some heart hidden away inside; Timothy Bottoms does the kind of kookiness that would later serve him well in the disaster flick Roller-coaster. Watch out for Randy Quaid in a small cameo, with the likes of Ellen Burstyn and Clu Gulager prop up the adult cast. THE LAST PICTURE SHOW is a film in which nothing much really happens, but it is realistic even if the effect is ultimately depressing. I thought Lucas's American GRAFFITI explored similar themes in a much more entertaining way.",The Last Picture Show
4,SnoopyStyle,aimless teens in coming-of-age movie,7,23 July 2014,"It's the small town life in the dusty Texas town of Anarene in the early '50s. There isn't much to do other than to go to the movie theater. Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane Jackson (Jeff Bridges) are best friends on the hapless football team and everybody complains about it. Duane is dating virginal Jacey Farrow (Cybill Shepherd) the daughter of the town's oil baron. Her cheating mother Lois (Ellen Burstyn) tells her to pursue somebody more capable. Lester Marlow (Randy Quaid) invites her to a naked swimming party. Sonny is bored with his girlfriend Charlene Duggs and he breaks up with her. He starts an affair with the unhappy wife of the high school coach Ruth Popper (Cloris Leachman). Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) is the owner of the local café, pool hall and movie theater.It's an aimless rambling teen coming of age movie. In that way, the movie brings out a sense of place. It has a lot of good separate story lines weaving around in this town. There are some very memorable scenes. It is a little too slow at times. It's the style of that era but 2 hours is too long of a running time. The one thing that is sorely missing from director Peter Bogdanovich is a truly fitting soundtrack.",The Last Picture Show
5,Hitchcoc,It Makes You Sweat,10,6 April 2006,"This is a really outstanding film. It is a director's movie, with every nuance strictly controlled by Bogdonavich. It's a sweaty, sad, depressing sort of film. The vitality of the town has been drained by decades of malaise. The kids feel hopeless. The adults go from person to person and have affairs and experience emptiness. There's some depressing football team that can't tackle. But mostly there is a street with dirt on it and a mentally challenged boy who likes to sweep. It is rife with symbols. This boy is trying to sweep away the dirt that is infesting the town, but he has no effect. As a matter of fact, he is victimized by the other boys in the town--part of their fun. We have the contrast of the rich family in town with the Ellen Burstyn character and, of course, her daughter played by Cybill Shepherd. The boys who are in a hopeless prison of the town's making are like a bunch of horny bulldogs. She is the queen in the town, but that's not much of an honor. These guys are going nowhere and she might just be there, like her mother, 20 years from now. The director builds a world that isn't pleasant, but it's certainly a total depiction of a place without a future. The movie theater represents a last connection with excitement and enjoyment. But nobody goes anymore.",The Last Picture Show
6,Prismark10,The new easy riders,7,13 June 2016,"Film critic and fan of the French New Wave cinema Peter Bogdanovich adapted and directed The Last Picture Show. A film shot in black and white and a soundtrack consisting of songs played on the radio, phonograph and the jukebox.It is about a dying town in the early 1950s Texas at the beginning of the Korean war and television become the increased focus for the viewing habits of the family at home.Bogdanovich inspired by his heroes John Ford and Orson Welles opens the film with the the desert wind blowing through the empty streets of the town of Anarene. A blue collar town in decline where his young have little hope and prospects. All it has to offer is a diner, pool hall and a picture house all owned by Sam the Lion.Jeff Bridges, Cybill Shepherd and Timothy Bottoms are the high school students who ride around in cars, mess about and have inept fumbling in order to have sex. Shepherd is the flirty tease Jacy who leads the guys on but has her eyes set on the rich kid at the next big town. Her ticket to get her out of Anarene.Jeff Bridges as the more cock sure Duane goes out with Jacy, the prettiest girl in town but even he stumbles when he tries to have sex with Jacy who then moves on to Timothy Bottom's Sonny knowing he has been seeing and having a tender relationship with the older and married Ruth Popper the wife of the High School coach.The film despite the stark black and white photography and a cast of veterans that includes Ben Johnson, Cloris Leachman, Clu Gulager, Ellen Burstyn, Eileen Brennan is a lot more about the comic misadventures of the young students trying to get laid, a kind of thing we would see a later in the 1970s in movies like Animal House and American Graffiti . Jacy eventually gets satisfaction from an older man on a pool table, the same man who also has a casual dalliance with Jacy's mother.At the end of the movie the picture house does close down, an emblem of the dying town. Jacy has left town to go to college. Duane goes to fight in Korea and Sonny has the pool hall bequeathed to him by Sam the Lion. He also returns to Ruth Popper, a woman he has been mean to as he dropped her like a stone for Jacy. It also gives the film its most tender moment.Despite the harking back to film history this is a daring film made in an era of the counterculture and the abolition of the Hays Code as the film features full frontal nudity and frank exchanges about sex. Just observe the exchanges between Jacy and her mother, who encourages Jacy to be sexually experienced just so she does not get married to someone like Duane for sex and get stuck in a dead end town.",The Last Picture Show
7,classicsoncall,"""Just remember, beautiful, everything gets old if you do it often enough.""",10,15 August 2008,"It would have been impossible back in 1971 to predict which of the film's actors would have gone on to bigger and better things. As it was, this was my first look back then at folks like Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges, and Cybil Shepherd. Tell me now, who didn't immediately fall head over heels for Shepherd after seeing this flick back in the day? As for Ben Johnson, his role here cemented my admiration of his work as an actor, having only seen him in various support and bit roles in Westerns prior. And for some odd reason, that bit of trivia about Cloris Leachman having been a Miss Chicago in 1946 somehow remained fixed in my mind for all these years. It was compelling to watch her character's appearance and demeanor change so dramatically throughout the picture, no doubt the basis for her Best Supporting Actress win for that year.I'm getting around to watching a whole host of pictures that I saw only once when they first came out, and I was somewhat surprised today to discover how bleak this picture actually is. Small town lives and ambitions crushed by mediocrity and boredom, punctuated by events that in some ways wind up defining the rest of their existence. Depressing realities for people like Lois Farrow (Ellen Burstyn), who marry for convenience and wind up living lives of quiet desperation; she sums it up herself - ""Everything is flat and empty here"". Sure there's a way out if you're someone on the outside looking in, but it's never that easy, is it? One's life becomes entangled and ensnared in relation to others, and the next thing you know, you wind up working till you're a hundred (Eilleen Brennan's Genevieve) to take care of your obligations.The other aspect of small town life touched on was observed by waitress Genevieve - ""A person can't sneeze in this town without somebody offering a handkerchief."" I don't know if anyone growing up in a big city can relate to that, I myself grew up in a town twice as big as Anarene, that is to say, a village of twenty two hundred instead of half that. It's true, you have a pretty good idea of what's going on with just about everyone else, and the flip side is they know about you too. When Genevieve made the remark, it was Sonny's (Tim Bottoms) first inkling that he just might be in trouble. And the odd thing is, he's never really called on it in a big way, even though each revelation that he's having an affair with a married woman comes as a jolt. Even the coach, as subtle as a brick in a punch bowl - ""You know a man never ought to cheat, unless it's for a good cause"".The film is full of intriguing little nuances like that, masterfully directed by Peter Bogdanovich, who broke from conventional storytelling by filming in black and white, and replacing a traditional score with background music from juke box tunes of the era. The silence during Jacy's (Shepherd) diving board scene is particularly noticeable, until giggles break out as she subconsciously trips up to conceal her embarrassment. A well played scene that looked like it could have come from, well, real life.Aside from the story, I was intrigued by the selection of films playing at The Royal. An opening scene had Spencer Tracy's ""Father of the Bride"", and an assortment of posters offered ""Sands of Iwo Jima"", Cagney's ""White Heat"", ""Winchester 73"" and ""Wagon Master"". That last one was a cool choice, it was one of Ben Johnson's few starring roles. I haven't seen that one actually, I'll have to get my hands on it.""The Last Picture Show"" won't appeal to everyone, it's a dismally bleak picture for a lot of it's run time. But it's a fascinating one as well, and one of the best examples of pure cinema from the 1970's I can think of. Highly recommended as a movie, and more so as an experience.",The Last Picture Show
8,lee_eisenberg,"Goodbye, America",10,30 December 2005,"By 1971, the image of a ""wholesome, small-town America"" was dying out (if not already completely defunct). Probably no movie captures that better than ""The Last Picture Show"". Set in the fictional Anarene, Texas, in the early '50s, the movie tells the story of several young people, their relationships with each other, and their understanding that the America which they know is slowly but surely disappearing; being filmed in black and white gives the flick a real sense of the past. The differences between the children and adults is most likely an allusion to the growing generation gap at the time of the movie's release. Jeff Bridges, Timothy Bottoms, Cybill Shepherd, Randy Quaid, Cloris Leachman, Ben Johnson, Ellen Burstyn, Eileen Brennan, and the rest of the cast play their roles perfectly, and this is a perfect movie in every way. Combined with movies like ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""The French Connection"", ""Shaft"", ""Willard"", ""The Devils"", ""Bananas"" and ""La noche de Walpurgis"", ""The Last Picture Show"" may make 1971 the best movie year ever.",The Last Picture Show
9,jboothmillard,The Last Picture Show,7,30 April 2012,"From Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Peter Bogdanovich (What's Up, Doc?, Paper Moon, Mask), I think I tried this film once before and gave up after just a few minutes, but I saw it was book listed as one of the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I had to give it another chance. Basically, set in 1951, the time at the end of World War II and toward the beginning of the Korean War, in the tiny town of Anarene, Texas, we follow a group of young men on the cusp of adulthood. They spend their time mostly going to the picture/movie house (cinema), playing football and hanging with girls, the main characters being senior year high school students Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms), who has and dumps unpleasant girlfriend Charlene Duggs (Sharon Ullrick/Taggart) to have an affair with middle-aged Ruth Popper (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Cloris Leachman), and Duane Jackson (Oscar nominated Jeff Bridges), who is dating pretty and wealthy Jacy Farrow (Golden Globe nominated Cybill Shepherd), daughter of Lois (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Ellen Burstyn). As they try continue with their routines and whatever existence they have, Anarene is actually dying a slow death as many of the residents move away to the big cities to get jobs and raise families, and the boys are not sure whether to follow suit. Duane and Sonny have the choice of staying in the town where the most they can earn is the inheritance of the movie house from their legend and mentor Sam the Lion (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Ben Johnson), or of course move away as well to better their lives more significantly, and their graduation approaching makes these decisions more critical. The big blow comes when many of the remaining residents are not attending the second film in double feature showings at the movie house, meaning that it is forced to be closed down, so in the end it seems like the boys have to move on after all, leaving Anarene pretty much completely deserted. Also starring BAFTA nominated Eileen Brennan as Genevieve, Clu Gulager as Abilene, Sam Bottoms as Billy, Randy Quaid as Lester Marlow, Joe Heathcock as The Sheriff, Bill Thurman as Coach Popper and Barc Doyle as Joe Bob Blanton. Young Bridges gives a good performance, as far as I remember Johnson and Leachman are very good in their award winning performances, and the direction by Bogdanovich is pretty good, I will admit that I didn't really see any plot, in my opinion almost nothing happened, but most of it was interesting enough, a fine classic drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, and it won the BAFTA for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film. It was number 95 on 100 Years, 100 Greatest Movies. Very good!",The Last Picture Show
10,ccthemovieman-1,Melodrama in Small-Town Texas,4,9 December 2009,"Plain-and-simple, if you like sordid melodramas, this is a film for you to see. Since it was the early 1970s instead of the '50s, a decade which saw a lot of ""soap opera"" films, the difference is the language and the nudity.This is a classic soap opera in which just about everyone in the movie is having some sexual encounter they shouldn't be having. This was Hollywood's updated version of a Peyton Place-type small town in Texas back in 1951. That said, there is excellent black-and-white photography and the movie is somewhat interesting despite its slowness, even for someone who doesn't care for melodramas, but the film overall is so-so and definitely overrated. I believe it was a critics' favorite because of all the the shock value it brought at the time. Part of the ""shock"" was seeing a full frontal nudity shot of Cybill Shepherd. Remember, just a handful of years prior to this film, there still was a morals code.Anyway, if you're a fan of melodramas and are not offended by profanity or gratuitous nudity, this is a movie you may want to check out, but don't let all the rave reviews fool you.",The Last Picture Show
11,moonspinner55,"Evocative, desperately important, cinematically exciting...",9,4 April 2011,"Small town Texas lives in 1951: the teenage girls are busy thinking about boys and marriage, while their boyfriends take sex in stride. All the while, time is ticking away on their adolescence, and turning their community into a shadow of its former self. ""The Last Picture Show"" was only Peter Bogdanovich's second directorial achievement, which won critical raves so filled with exaltation that it immediately put the noses of his competitors and counterparts out of joint (Bogdanovich was nominated for a Best Director Oscar, but lost). This adaptation of Larry McMurtry's novel, by McMurtry and Bogdanovich, is an unblushing look at randy, impatient young people and their elders, most of whom are living in the past. It has a somewhat cynical eye (often for a comedic affect), but also an intimate spirit and a dazzle that sweeps the audience up. You can't help but be moved by it, with those rich, warm echoes of Hank Williams songs on the radio and screen-doors squawking in the dusty wind. It's a touchstone movie, and has stood the test of time. Superlative performances by an amazing cast; Cloris Leachman and Ben Johnson won well-deserved Supporting Oscars. Bogdanovich revisited these lives in 1990 with ""Texasville"". ***1/2 from ****",The Last Picture Show
12,Quinoa1984,"a film that plays even better long after it's been seen, for its unforgettable characters and classic mode of subversion",9,23 June 2007,"Peter Bogdanovich obviously loves the old Hollywood films, Hawks, Ford, Sturges, Hitchcock to a degree, but has also claimed that ""there's Renoir, and there's everybody else."" This can be seen, in a sense, in how he treats the material of Larry McMurtry's source. The Last Picture Show deals frankly with sexuality, but more impressively, and with more of a lasting impact, on how not being able to deal with emotions leads to a kind of nakedness and vulnerability that is shielded away, particularly in a small Texas town such as Anarene. Not much goes on- sometimes the only thing to do is to split town and see if it'll be possible to take an aimless trip to Mexico in the middle of the night- though that is just on the surface of a tiny town such as this. There's a sense of sexual paranoia, of loneliness, that gets tapped into very well by Bogdanovich on his two main plot-lines: one involving teens (i.e. Cybil Shepherd as Jacey, Jeff Bridges as Duane Jackson, the Bottoms brothers), and their escapism into movies, sports, and sex, and a middle-aged woman (Cloris Leachman) and her lack of companionship, mirrored in her sort of loneliness by the barren side to the town itself, as people move out in droves.From the opening shot- one of the best of any film of the 70s- to the final scene with the screening of Red River, this is a near classic of the period, where there was an overlap between the past films with more of an emphasis on the proud and beautiful side of Americana, and the not exactly darker side but the one people usually wouldn't put on film. It's sometimes very funny (how could finally 'making it' with Jacey go wrong?), and a little surprising in how it gets explicit (pool scene is actually very steamy for a black and white movie), but there's an undercurrent that Bogdanovich doesn't play up too much into the last act, which has been building steadily through the film. Featuring other good supporting work from Burstyn and Ben Johnson, alongside the outstanding Leachman and promising Bridges (Shepherd works best in the role when she has to quietly subvert, as Bogdanovich does more often, with the material), and a true sense for period as well as reality, the Last Picture Show has been fresh in my mind for years now, and I look forward to seeing it again like few other American films of 1971.",The Last Picture Show
13,tavm,I'm glad to have finally seen the entirety of The Last Picture Show just now!,10,4 February 2021,"Previously, I had seen parts of this critically-acclaimed film on TNT back in the '90s. Now I have watched the whole thing with Mom who was surprised at all the nudity and sex depicted as she's been used to more old-fashioned movies we've seen recently. Me, well, I'm just glad to have finally watched the entire thing so now I can see what the big deal was about concerning story, tone, and creative output mainly on the director's part. The black-and-white photography is the perfect choice to present this particular story in and the actors chosen by Peter Bogdanovich are aces through and through: Cybill Shepard in her debut, Jeff Bridges, Timothy Bottoms, Randy Quaid, Eileen Brennan, Ellen Burstyn, and especially, eventual Oscar winners Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman. The depiction of a dying town as many of the characters are growing up is quite a compelling drama to make. So on that note, I definitely recommend The Last Picture Show. P.S.

16,preppy-3,Fascinating but VERY depressing,10,9 March 2004,"Film depicts life in the small Texas town of Anarene in the early 1950s. It follows three high school teenagers--Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms), Duane Jackson (Jeff Bridges) and Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd)--from their senior year to a few years after.Some people said this is like a soap opera. That is true, but it's a GOOD realistic soap opera. The script is just wonderful (Larry McMurty adapted from his book along with director Peter Bogdanovich) and the characters are like real people. It deals with all three of them coming of age, their first sexual encounters (all of which are played awkwardly--as they should) and dealing with a dying town. It's (appropriately) filmed in beautiful black and white--the cinematography by Robert Surtees is exceptional--it brings the whole film to life. This would never have worked in color.The acting varies. Bottoms, Bridges and Shepherd are just OK--but that's understandable. It was one of Bridges' first films, it was Bottoms' second and Shepherds' first! They were all still learning. Everyone else though is great. Ben Johnson as Sam the Lion is just wonderful and won a Best Supporting Actor for this. Cloris Leachman is heart-breaking in her role and won Best Supporting Actress. Ellen Burstyn has the best lines and is also very good (and was nominated for Best Supporting Actress also) as Cybill's mother. And Timothy Bottoms' brother (Sam Bottoms) has a small part as Billy. It works in the films favor--Sonny and Billy are supposed to be best friends and the affection the two brothers had for each other comes through on the screen. I'm giving this a 10. It's just great--I didn't want it to end. But it is VERY depressing. You probably won't notice until the film is over. A must-see.Avoid the commercial TV print--it's cut to ribbons.",The Last Picture Show
17,writers_reign,Traumae In A Texas Town,8,30 April 2018,"It's clear that virtually everyone involved with this film both behind and in front of the camera was aspiring to a definite Chekhovian feel but Russian melancholy is the wrong colour for Texas so the best you can give it is 'E' for Effort. It's steeped in melancholy and there's not too much wrong with that but what over-eggs the pudding is the unrelenting bleakness of thr small,, decrepit town, dying before our eyes; Chekhov's Russia was far from opulent but affluence was certainly hinted at and in several cases it featured aristocrats who had fallen on hard times whilst in TLPS only one family is seen as anything like prosperous (Cybille Shepherds') and even Sam The Lion, who owns more or less half the town is seen as more like a vagrant than an entrepreneur.

18,grantss,Good examination of 1950s rural America,9,4 July 2015,"Good examination of 50s rural America, and the death thereof. Interesting character- and relationship-based plot. Direction by Peter Bogdanovich is solid. The black & white cinematography is irritating at first, as you feel that the main characters, in the primes of their lives, deserve colour. However, the B&W becomes more relevant the further into the movie you go.Great performances, from then-unknown actors in their earliest roles: Jeff Bridges, Cybil Shepherd (debut role), Timothy Bottoms (2nd movie). The veterans - Ellen Burstyn, Ben Johnson, Eileen Brennan, Cloris Leachman - are superb too.Only negatives are that the movie drifts a bit in the middle, and it is only the very powerful ending that makes it great. This, and the soundtrack - every song seems to be by Hank Williams. Didn't they have anything else on the radio in 1950s Texas?",The Last Picture Show
19,Boba_Fett1138,Good portrayal of American small-town-life of the '50's.,8,24 May 2006,"It's 1951 and there isn't a lot to do in the small Texan town Anarene. Basically in the whole town, there only is a cinema and a run-down pool hall for entertainment. So basically all the characters have in the movie is each other. Which makes it all the more difficult for the outcasts and those who don't like each other in the very small town. Especially the youth is the victim of this boring place. They are torn between several issues, which all have to do with the transition between puberty and adulthood and they come to the point at which they have to make some life-changing decisions.""The Last Picture Show"" is a real character movie that is driven by its actors and subtle directing from Peter Bogdanovich. There isn't a real plot in terms of having a beginning, middle and ending. It more is a character observation of several different persons who are all forced to make several decisions and all have in common that they all live in the same small Texan town, in which they can basically only fall back on the run-down pool hall and cinema. By the time the pool hall is closed and at the cinema the last picture is shown (hench the title), all the characters have to make the choices what to do with the rest of their lives.The movie is shot entirely in black & white and made in the same style as movies from the 40's/early '50's. It's quite risqué to make a movie in a totally different style and 'old' style of movie-making but in this particular case it suits the story and movie well. It perfectly captures the mood of the depressing, boring '50's. There are some awkward unusual moments in the movie because of this style (especially in its editing) but I just took those moments for granted, since the style suited the story and the movie so well. Also the cinematography from Robert Surtees, who perhaps in my opinion was the best cinematographer of the '40's/50's and early '60's, is quite perfect.The movie is however a bit too slow at times, even for my taste. Perhaps not really slow in terms of pace but more slow in terms of story-flow and consistency. Not everything that happens in the movie seems to serve a purpose for the movie but then again, life is filled with moments that don't seem to serve a purpose. So you can say that the movie is realistic, just not always interesting.This movie really launched the career of several actors, such as the still very young Jeff Bridges and Randy Quaid. Also Ellen Burstyn is present as well as many other well known and respected actors of that time period.It's a cliché but they don't make them like this anymore. This movie is a monumental one that is realistic and powerful but unfortunately not always totally interesting to follow, which regretfully prevents me from rating this movie any higher, even though this multiple Oscar nominated movie certainly deserves to be seen.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Last Picture Show
20,evanston_dad,"Whiling Away the Hours in Abilene, Texas",8,9 April 2007,"Peter Bogdanovich created a sombre and quietly devastating film from Larry McMurtry's coming-of-age soap opera about a bunch of teenagers stagnating in a Texas backwater in the years following WWII.Sam Bottoms and Jeff Bridges play best friends who wind up duking it out over the small town's resident spoiled and bored rich girl, played by Cybil Shepherd (pretty but vacuous, just what the role calls for). A host of other sad characters populate this glum story: Cloris Leachman's wall flower coach's wife, who begins a tentative affair with Bottoms when the coach is looking the other way; Ben Johnson's world-weary cowboy, who serves as a kind of sage to the young boys; Clu Galager's stud, who takes Cybil Shepherd on a pool table (or is that scene in the book only?); Eileen Brennan's salty diner waitress, who I wish was in the movie more; and, best of all, Ellen Burstyn, as Shepherd's reckless mom, who makes us see exactly from whom her daughter inherited her wayward tendencies.Filmed in stark black and white, the film has a brooding atmosphere, and Bogdanovich's no-frills direction perfectly captures the feeling of a forgotten place in which nothing ever happens and nothing ever will. Children and parents alike waste their days away in bored ennui, and both turn to the same things to fill their time: sex, booze and brawling. The children have two choices: turn into their parents, or run away and never come back.It's a shame that Bogdanovich never directed anything else as accomplished as this, because he proves himself to be a director in complete mastery of his medium.Grade: A",The Last Picture Show
21,Wuchakk,"Bleak, trashy B&W drama of life in a fading Texas town in the early 50s with several strong points",7,29 October 2018,"Released in 1971, ""The Last Picture Show"" is a B&W drama of several teens and adults in a dying Texas town on the windy plains in 1951. Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges and Cybill Shepherd play the main high shoolers while Ben Johnson, Cloris Leachman and Ellen Burstyn appear as the adults. Randy Quaid and Clu Gulager have peripheral roles.Sam the Lion (Johnson) is the minor mogul of the town, the father figure of several of the boys, who are fatherless in practice, if not reality. Despite wallowing in a dreary pall (which ties-in to the theme), the movie conveys many insights about real life and has some genuine warmth. A couple good examples are when Sam looks at Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane (Bridges) before they leave for a wild weekend in Mexico or the final scene between Sonny and the coach's wife (Leachman); Sam's reflections at ""the tank"" is another. Furthermore, I respect a movie that has the confidence to take its time without feeling the need to rush to the thrills and titillations.""The Last Picture Show"" is slightly infamous for its sleaze quotient, but it's interesting what little sex actually goes on in the story; and the quality of some of that sex is dubious, e.g. Duane (Bridges) and Jacy (Cybill). As far as the nude pool party in Wichita Falls goes, it seems that these kids were older than Jacy, except for the little brother swimming in the pool and Lester (Quaid). I'm assuming they were college age; in other words, about 1-4 years older. Regardless, they were the offspring of rich libertines from the Big Oil business in Wichita Falls. Jacy was a rich girl from backwater Nowheresville and wanted to fit in with these bigger city kids.Regarding the realism of the nude swimming, the story takes place in 1951; a mere 18 years later teens were publicly skinny dipping in Woodstock, NY, which is documented in the film of the same name. Do we seriously think a few teens weren't doing the same thing a mere 18 years earlier? For comparison, it's 2018 as of this writing. Do we really think teens today are all that different than teens 18 years ago in 2000? Besides, teens on the wild side were skinny dipping in the 1800s, 1700s, 1600s, etc.At the end of the day, this is a decent adult-oriented drama about the kinetic experimentations & aspirations of youths in the early 50s juxtaposed with the sometimes sad reflections & practices of the adults.The film runs 1 hour, 58 minutes and was shot in Archer City, Texas, as well as nearby Olney, Holliday and Wichita Falls.GRADE: B",The Last Picture Show

Cybill Shepherd made her film debut in this black and white classic. There are a number of great performances by first rate cast. Ben Johnson played Sam the Lion and won a worthy Oscar for it. Cloris Leachman earned her Academy Award as Ruth Popper, a lonely wife who has an affair with one of her son's players. She is unforgettable and sensational in this role. Timothy Bottoms and Jeff Bridges played best friends in this small dying town where not much except football games happen and they see a movie at the picture house before television. Other great performances are Ellen Burstyn who played overprotective mom of a teenager with a history. The film is memorable as it is nostalgic for a different time.

24,JamesHitchcock,Behind the Van of Time,8,26 June 2019,"The title, ""The Last Picture Show"", refers to the final screening to take place at the only cinema in the small town of Anarene, Texas, before it closes. The significance of this event is that Anarene is a slowly declining settlement where there is little to do and little to keep the townspeople from drifting away; once the cinema is gone there will be even less. In Larry McMurtry's novel on which the film is based the town was called ""Thalia"", but director Peter Bogdanovich borrowed the name of a genuine Texan ghost town.The action takes place over about a year in 1951 and 1952 and tells a coming-of-age story about Sonny Crawford and Duane Jackson, two teenage boys in their final year at high school. Other important characters are Duane's girlfriend Jacy Farrow, Ruth Popper, the middle-aged wife of the school's football coach, with whom Sonny begins an affair, and ""Sam the Lion"", the proprietor not only of the cinema but also of Anarene's pool hall and café which constitute the town's only other facilities for entertainment or social interaction.Bogdanovich described the film as homage to Howard Hawks' ""Red River"", which is the film shown in Anarene's ""last picture show"". It also struck me as an homage to Martin Ritt's ""Hud"", also set in a small Texas town and also based upon a McMurtry novel. The two films have a similar look, both dominated by shots of the wide-open Texas plains. Both films were shot in black-and-white, something still quite common when ""Hud"" was made in 1963 but which had become very unusual by 1971, only eight years later.The film might look like a movie from the fifties or early sixties, but it doesn't sound like one. Something else had changed in those eight years in that American society had become a lot more permissive, and with the end of the Production Code film-makers could be franker and more open about sex. As one might imagine from a film about teenagers, sex is the major preoccupation of Sonny, Duane, Jacy and their contemporaries and something much discussed. There are some scenes, including one in which a mentally handicapped boy loses his virginity to a prostitute and one in which a preacher's son reveals an unhealthy interest in young children, which could never have been included in films made only a few years earlier.It is sometimes said of Bogdanovich that his early career as a director was harmed by his insistence on casting his then girlfriend, Cybill Shepherd, in roles which were beyond her acting ability. I have not seen all his collaborations with Shepherd, but I must say that this theory is not borne out by ""The Last Picture Show"". Shepherd, in her film debut, gives a fine performance here. Jacy, who comes from a well-to-do family, is popular and described as ""the prettiest girl in Anarene"", but this makes her no more than the biggest fish in a particularly small pond. She knows that she is expected to marry a boy from an equally well-off family and settle down as a housewife and mother, but is looking for more than that, in terms of both love and of life in general. She knows that her mother Lois did just what was expected of her and yet has ended up unfulfilled and miserable, failing to find happiness in either her marriage to Jacy's father or in her frequent affairs with other men.Shepherd's is not the only fine performance here. The whole film is well acted, with too many good performances to single them all out, but mention must be made of Timothy Bottoms and Jeff Bridges as Sonny and Duane, Ben Johnson as Sam, who becomes a sort of father-figure to the town's youth, and Cloris Leachman as Ruth and Ellen Burstyn as Lois, both in their ways lonely, frustrated women.Films, especially coming-of-age films, made in the seventies and eighties about the fifties and early sixties- ""American Graffiti"", ""Diner"", ""Grease""- tended to take an affectionately nostalgic look back at the earlier period, seen as the time of a kinder, gentler America before the trauma of Vietnam and its accompanying loss of innocence. There is little affectionate or nostalgic about ""The Last Picture Show"". We are reminded that if the young men of the early fifties did not have Vietnam they had their own Asian war in the shape of Korea; in the course of the film Duane joins the army before going away to fight. Yet in a way the Army allows him his only chance of escape from Anarene; most of his contemporaries can see few appealing prospects for themselves in the town, which is in a state of both economic and social decline, yet lack the educational qualifications or the financial means to find work elsewhere.I would not rate the film as highly as ""Hud"", one of the great films of the sixties; the action can sometimes be difficult to follow because of Bogdanovich's fondness of a non-linear style of storytelling with scenes presented to us out of chronological order. Yet when we bear in mind that this was the work of an inexperienced director in his early thirties, ""The Last Picture Show"" can be seen as a considerable achievement. The teenage coming-of-age story can at its worst descend into sentimental cliché, but here the format is used to examine the American Dream, a dream which can all too often prove illusory for those living in little towns behind the van of time. 8/10",The Last Picture Show
25,blanbrn,"An excellent film of the drifting of small town America it showcases raging hormones, yet it takes you back to your traditional days of growing up.",10,11 June 2009,"Just after watching ""The Last Picture Show"" I must say I'm clearly impressed it's now a top classic on my film list, as just not one of the best of the 70's but one of the best of all time. The film is really a winner for it's realism and truthfulness that has occurred with so many small towns in America I for one know because being from a small town saw the changes of how things drift from people moving away to the old timers passing away and seeing how love relationships come and go. Many may say this film is not their style as they feel put off for it being set in a small town, and many feel the film is controversial as they think it in ways was a sexual exploration film. And true in many ways for 1971 director Peter Bogdanovich did push the envelope with many of the scenes by showing frontal skin nudity. Still so much more can be taken and learned from this acclaimed social drama that's direct and outspoken.The time and place is 1951 in the small town of Anarene, Texas and this film was adapted from a screenplay by author Larry McMurtry(who's the king of Texas literary stories that get made into hit films, ex:""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Terms of Endearment""). As in many ways aside from this being a film of social change it's a good film of character study as the film focuses mainly on the towns youth. And as you see in many of the scenes from the old country store, to high school athletic games, and parties this reminds anyone who grew up in a small town just what it was like as they see so clearly in the scenes. The most bittersweet themes touched upon in the film are the times we most remember of peer pressure the way it related to love. As the films take on sex from having sex the first time to one night stands and having an affair with an older woman was displayed in such a blunt frank manner. As all of us dealt with those issues growing up being in a small town as most of it was discovered for escapism. Most important this social classic teaches us that nothing last forever in a small town still memories will last forever.The cast is star struck and talented with good turns from Jeff Bridges and Timothy Bottoms and veterans Cloris Leachman, Ben Johnson, and Ellen Burstyn give good supporting performances. The most notable standout was the introduction of the stunning and smooth beauty Cybill Shepherd as her scenes of skin are very memorable and her character as the all American girl can have any viewer think back to a girl of that kind that they knew in high school. Overall the ""Last Picture Show"" in my opinion is a film that's a treasured classic for it's realism that in ways was ahead of it's time as anyone knows being from a small town the drifting changes that takes place among people and the community and escapism is many times the only hope. Mainly the escape is found thru memories and love with friendship yet this film took the theme of sex and used it as an escape tool for small town America which really pushed the envelope the way it showed it in 1971 still that was one element that made this an unforgettable classic gem.",The Last Picture Show

27,sddavis63,Why Is This Considered A Classic By So Many?,3,16 February 2008,"Many people see this as a classic, but I obviously must have missed something. Life in Anarene, Texas in the early 50's is pretty dull - which means that a movie about life in Anarene, Texas in the early 50's will be pretty dull too! What is it that so many people see in this? Once the last picture show in Anarene closes there really won't be anything to do in town. Duane (Jeff Bridges) makes that point at the end of the movie. But even before it closes there isn't much to do, so basically everything revolves around sex. High school students make plans for how to lose their virginity - sometimes with each other and sometimes with some of the equally bored adults in town. You see, there's not much for them to do either - except to have sex (sometimes with each other and sometimes with the bored teenagers) or to whine about the local high school football team. Three times something happened that I thought was going to add some spark of drama to the movie. Sam (Ben Johnson) dies unexpectedly, but nothing really happens because of that, Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Jacy (Cybill Shepherd) elope, but nothing really happens because of that, Joe Bob (Barc Doyle) kidnaps a little girl, but nothing really happens because of that. The only thing that added anything of dramatic value to the movie came at the end with the death of Billy (Sam Bottoms) which really points out the emptiness of life in this pathetic little town, as the men stand around looking at the body debating where to go for breakfast.Peter Bogdanovic filmed this in black and white, which is intended I suppose to point out how grey this town is, but the only thing I found interesting was the early look at actors like Bottoms, Shepherd, Bridges and Randy Quaid. (As an aside it was terrifying to see how much Quaid - in 1971 - actually looks like his character of Cousin Eddie in the National Lampoon Vacation movies.) Classic? I don't think so! 3/10",The Last Picture Show
28,sol-kay,What's Playin!,7,13 August 2011,"***SPOILERS*** ""The Last Picture Show"" is Peter Bogdanovich's black & white bittersweet classic of life in the little town of Anarene Texas circa 1951. The film involves a number of people in Anarene who's lives are intermingled with each other centering around the only movie theater run by the big man in town Sam the Lion or better yet Lion hearted, Ben Johnson.At first sight Ben doesn't look like nothing much in his ah shucks folksy and almost country bumpkin like demeanor but don't let his looks confuse or fool you. As we soon find out Ol' Sam the Man is the kind of guy whom women just can't get enough of with him having had affairs with almost every female, young old blond tall dark & small, in town! Now in his twilight years Sam's still going as strong as ever even though he's almost out of gas and in danger of breaking down if he keeps on pushing his luck. It may well have been Sam's extra curricular activities, in and out of the bedroom, that leads to his sudden death of a massive stroke & heart-attack halfway through the movie. There's also the hot as a firecracker Lois Farrow, Ellen Burstyn, who's or was, until he found someone better, one of Sam's many lovers from way back when she was barley out of her teens. Now middle age but still very attractive Lois has been cheating on her husband the richest man in Anarene Gene Farrow, Robert Glenn, in getting it on with one of his employees on his oil rig the town stud, that's after Sam the Lion, Abilane, Clu Guager. The hottest member of the cast is the blond pretty and still a virgin, but not for long, Jacy Farrow played by Cybill Shephard in her debut film role. Jacy who unlike her free living and swinging mom Lois tries to keep her virginity intact until her wedding night but with the horny crowd of males in town that's, as it soon turned out, almost next to impossible. It's the handsomest and most popular guy in town Duane Jackson, Jeff Bridges, who first catches Jacy's eye but when the two got down to business in a local motel room Daune in coming up short,by not quite measuring up for the task at hand, proved that he wasn't the stud that Jacy thought he at first was. Feeling both hurt and disappointed,you can just imagine how Duane felt, Jacy dumped Duane like a sack of horse manure over a Nebraskan cornfield. Duane did in fact redeemed himself later when he got a second chance with Jacy but by then she now having experienced sex was looking for someone better and more on the ball. In no time at all, in her wanting to make up lost time, Jacy cast her eyes on Duane's good friend the very introverted, with girls, Sonny Crawford, Timothy Bottoms. Sonny's a man of few words and even fewer sexual experiences; All this sex going on around in town just bored the living hell out of him . That all lead to a fireworks display or explosion with Sonny getting his head based in with a beer bottle when Duane found out that his best friend who always liked to keep to himself was in fact fooling around with his girl Jacy.There's also in the film middle age lonely and ignored, by her high school macho football coach husband Bill Truman, Ruth Popper, Cloris Leachman, who gets the very confused, in what he's supposed to be doing in the movie, Sonny Crawford to start up a hot and heavy affair with her that builds up Sonny's confidence in making it with the opposite sex. But the on and off affair soon turns out to be a total disaster for Ruth in Sonny treating her like a sex toy instead as an equal partner in and out of bed.The film goes on and on with everyones hang ups in town brought out in the open until Duane in him trying to get away from it all, the craziness going on in Anarene, joins or is drafted into the US Army and then slated to be shipped off to fight the dirty rotten Commies in Korea. ***SPOILERS**** In a touching farewell scene between Duane and Sonny,now back as the best of friends, with Duane handing Sonny over the keys to his band new Mercury tragedy strikes again with Sonny's kid brother the mute and mentally challenged Billy, Sam Bottom's, getting hit and killed by a cattle truck as he was sweeping up the town's garbage! The movie ends more or less like it began minus Ben, who's dead, Jacy, who went to collage in Kansas, and Duane, who shipped off to Korea to fight the Commies, with only Sonny left to pick up the ball and keep the show going. But by then there's almost no one left in town for him to play with.",The Last Picture Show
29,Lejink,The Kids Stay In The Picture,8,16 November 2020,"I came back to this movie by way of film historian and journalist Karina Longworth's excellent podcast series ""You Must Remember This"" which recently featured a ten-part profile of Polly Platt, who although credited only for Design on the film, was, according to Longworth and many of her interviewees, in reality more like an uncredited co-director / writer / producer given that she was also Mrs Peter Bogdanovich at the time of the shoot. The Longworth series by the way is entitled ""The Invisible Woman"" which reflects not only Hollywood's attitude at the time to aspirant women in film-making but also her own deference to her then husband allowing him to be seen as the main driving force behind the film, the auteur theory and all that...To be fair, if she actually had just been responsible for design, she'd still be worthy of high praise, as the dramatic monochrome and location work make plain. The movie is set in that austere, grey, post-war era, just before America changed presidents, came out of a ""crazy Asian war"", to quote Kenny Rogers' song and finally saw the back of Senator Joe McCarthy, plunging full tilt into a consumer boom, with the rise of TV and movies having to become much larger and more colourful on the screen with CinemaScope and VistaVision. Set in what almost looks like a frontier town literally DeepintheheartofTexas, there appear to be only three outlets for young folk to have fun, a cafe, a pool hall and a small cinema, all run by Ben Johnson's Sam The Lion, who besides this, seems to impact on the sensibilities of many in the town, especially some of the women and young folk.The main focus of the film is indeed on three teenagers, Timothy Bottoms's sad-eyed Sonny, Jeff Bridges' boisterous Duane and the girl who comes between them, Cybill Shepherd's haughty Jacy, the prettiest girl in town. On the sidelines, literally, is Clovis Leachman's neglected middle-aged housewife Ruth Pepper, who seeks solace with Sonny but who in the end can't compete with Jacy's youth and good looks, despite being a more sympathetic person.The film well captures the slow, empty existence of the townsfolk, all of them trapped but in some way trying to escape the drudgery of their everyday lives. However the only ways out appear to be either death, if you're a boy, signing up to the army (which probably means death again) or if you're a girl, marrying some rich kid in the next town. Bogdanovich's favourite directors were John Ford and Orson Welles and the influence of their stellar cameraman Greg Toland is clear in the deep-focus, monochrome cinematography employed. There are fine naturalistic performances by the large ensemble cast, both young and old, the latter, besides Johnson and Leachman, including Ellen Burstyn as Jacy's faded Southern belle mother and Eileen Brennan's worldly waitress.It's a beautifully shot and played movie, with a near constant stream of country and western music, especially featuring Hank Williams, in the background, only adding to the languorous atmosphere of the place as its citizens go about their mundane daily existences. For its young folk, already struggling with their hormones, the symbolic closure of the cinema shuts one more escape door in their empty lives. They will inevitably turn into the cynical, world-weary, dissatisfied older people around them and doubtless share their regrets at missing out on the bigger picture in life.A deserved multiple nominee at the Oscars, where Johnson and Leachman won for their supporting roles, ""The Last Picture Show"" is a memorable evocation of a way of life I actually suspect is still played out in several similar small towns in Southern America even today.",The Last Picture Show
30,ElMaruecan82,"Crude, Audacious and Modern Masterpiece about a Lost Era, a Lost Innocence ...",10,5 January 2011,"It's a time that the Internet generation can't relate to ... where human relationships were based on eye-contact, skin-contact, words, guts, emotions. This time was already far away from the year ""The Last Picture Show' was released. Now, it seems gone, forever ... Yet there is something incredibly modern and universal in Peter Bogdanovich's masterpiece. It works like a kaleidoscope of all the emotions guided by sex ... The movie follows a group of teen-agers, at a time where the ""notion"" of teen-agers was new. In the old times, you were either a man, either a kid. In between? you went to the war, you started to work ... no studies, no spring-breaks, no disco parties, no fast-foods, no easy sex and all that bullshit. Sex was just marital routine.Those were the old times. The young generation in ""The Last Picture Show"" is luckier. Not young enough to be treated as kids, not adult enough to think of another thing than kissing, hugging each other, and more. This ""more"", Sonny's (Timotthy Bottoms) girlfriend wouldn't allow it, ending a pathetic amateurish relationship where she's being kissed in the theater by a boy who looks at Liz Taylor on the screen or Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd) the beautiful girlfriend of his best buddy Duane (Jeff Bridges). Whores and sluts were still owning the monopoly in the sex business. Sex was mystery.In this black and white film, sex is the shadow. It hides, and feelings are hidden inside. When Sonny looks at Genevieve, the good-hearted waitress, you know what he might think of, the looks exchanged between the same Sonny and Ruth Popper is of a mysterious body-devouring appetite ... even Jacy's eyes playfully shine like a little girl with her doll. Boys are her doll. Sex is mystery for her, as she needs to 'know' then to be known as a girl 'who knows'. Sex is publicity. This desire of publicity serves a selfish goal : to be seduced by the right guy, Jacy use sex like a cop uses handcuffs. Jacy is beautiful, and beauty is the least likely quality to inspire humility. And this is what sex is all about : control, pride, for the guy who's done it and for the girl who ... forgive the phrasing, who had been done. And when it's done, it's done. The mystery's gone. And the girl too. Jacy followed her mother's advice, to have sex with Duane, to realize it's not that ""magic"". Jacy's mother, Lois (Ellen Burstyn) is perfectly aware of the delusional aspect of sex ... and for one thing, she was wrong. Sex is magic for a girl like Jacy. So magic she makes it the second time with Lois's boyfriend in a less conventional place than a bed. The irony, a pool table, the very game, her poor dumped Duane was good at. Jacy indeed learns how to play with men. Sex is power.Meanwhile, Sonny, the main protagonist, lives after his break-up an extraordinary hidden romance with the most touching and heart-breaking character of the film, Ruth Popper, the gym coach's wife, brilliantly played by Cloris Leachman. He drives her to the doctor, she comes back shaken, desperately needing an arm to grab, a heart to feel. We get the point, Sonny doesn't, what makes him even more touching in Ruth's eyes. The relationship that grows between them is so sincere, so powerful. He doesn't just fill a gap, he provides Ruth what she needed the most, trust in her ability to be loved. Not as a friend, not as a mother-like figure. True love expressed through these shy movements on a squeaky bed, in a dark room. Sex as its purest, most fragile form. Sex as the expression of tenderness, of desire, of this mysterious sensation that transcends generations. The tears in Ruth's eyes say it all. Sex is catharsis.Yet, this sweet, tender relationship is almost destroyed by Jacy who turns Sonny's head. Jacy is too pretty not to be loved, even though Sonny doesn't love her as he loves Ruth. Ruth gave him her heart, but Jacy caricatured himself by becoming the quintessential trophy girl since she lost her innocence during that nudist party. But it's nothing compared to the pastor's son who showed another extreme: how the lack of sex can lead to more immorality. Sex is perversity. Those are the risks due to too much or not enough sex. Like Ruth and Sonny who'll finally get back together, the movie swings between two generations. And the characters of Lois Farrow and the charismatic pool and cinema owner Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson), are the soul of the film. A man and a woman who knew what sex is about. Lois shouts to her daughter ""Oh, don't be so mealymouthed"". Sex is as eloquent for her, as a finger gesture while Sam, who lived a passionate romance with Lois, is nostalgic. He had his time, now it's gone. Sex is disillusion. Yeah, this era is gone. Hearts are as deserted as this little Texan town. Sam the Lion embodies this era with his old cinema where youth kisses in the dark, watching ""Red River"" ... TV is conquering America, there's no time for innocence anymore ... even the dim-witted, good-hearted Billy can't survive this world. Indeed, it's the ""Last Picture Show"". The black and white combined with Hank William's folk songs paint this old classic feeling, the poignant scene between Sam and sonny even has this 'bad' quality that makes the film look older than real 50's movies. Beautiful cinematography incarnating the lost innocence ... which makes ""The Last Picture Show"" so modern, without being cynical, so sincere without being sappy.So, what is sex eventually all about? Well, as would say Sam the Lion, maybe sex is like fish, something we like to eat even if we must spent half our time picking out bone ...",The Last Picture Show
31,dromasca,"history, twice",9,1 August 2020,"It's 2020 now. Peter Bogdanovich's film 'The Last Picture Show' was made in 1971. The action of the film takes place in 1951 and 1952. It was, therefore, a historical re-enactment of a period from which almost two decades had passed. During this time not only America had changed radically, but also the art of cinema. The sentimental or heroic productions of the 1950s left place to directors' movies in the second half of the 1960s, and a generation of formidable young film directors had emerged, a generation that would dominate the American dream industry for the next half century. Peter Bogdanovich was one of them, and 'The Last Picture Show' was the second feature film after a promising debut with 'Targets', or the third if we count the oddity called 'Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women'. The achievement is impressive. Bogdanovich not only makes a film about the early '50s but also directs the film in the style of the early' 50s. We could say that it is a radical homage brought by the young director to the classic genres and style in American cinema.The story takes place in Anarene, a tiny town in Texas, probably founded during the oil boom, which begins to experience, in the early '50s the decline caused by the passing of the peak of this economy of exploitation of finite natural resources. Winds and dust dominate the landscape. The main institutions of Anarene are a restaurant, a billiard room and the cinema hall, all owned by Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson), who is also a kind of model and mentor for the local youth. The three main heroes, two boys and a girl, students in the last class of high school live their coming of age with the first loves and first sexual experiences, and especially with many questions about their future that include escaping the atmosphere of the dying city. We accompany them for a year, a year in which their destinies are decided, a year in which the town's institutions disappear, the last being, symbolically, the cinema where the heroes embodied by Jimmy Stewart or John Wayne appeared on the screens and where the first kisses were stolen.The use of black and white film was an aesthetic choice in 1971, but for director Peter Bogdanovich specifically it was an aspect of his decision to use the cinematic tools of the era in which the story in the film took place. The universe of the Texan town, a whole universe with its landscapes, houses, objects are reconstructed with meticulousness, respect and attention to essential details. Each character is credible and many of the performances are exceptional. The youth trio consists of Timothy Bottoms as Sonny, probably one of the best roles of his career, Jeff Bridges as Duane, the first consistent role of a brilliant career, and Cybill Shepherd at her debut, who as the girl which all the boys in his promotion dream of is unforgettable. Ben Johnson plays the key role of Sam the Lion, and Cloris Leachman the role of a mature woman, who compensates for her limited and failed life with a hopeless relationship with one of the young boys. Both received well-deserved Academy Awards for supporting roles. The remarkable soundtrack of the film is composed of tunes of the period, played by prom orchestras, by jukeboxes in the billiard room or in the restaurant, by car radios. On this occasion I found out that the song 'Blue Velvet' did not appear for the first time in David Lynch's 1986 film! Viewed from the perspective of 2020, 'The Last Picture Show' is a snippet of history in history, the history of America and the history of its cinema. For today's spectators it is a trip in time with two stations. Highly recommended!",The Last Picture Show
32,gbill-74877,Evocative,9,8 July 2020,"Evokes an era and a small town in dusty Texas with brilliant black and white cinematography and all those old Hank Williams tunes, and it also evokes the end of an era in life, that time in high school and just beyond it when you're finding your path, trying to find love, and maybe increasingly disillusioned by the world. People move on and people die of course, but maybe saddest of all, people selfishly use each other, and we see that in so many ways here. Even the moments of connecting in sex are far from what we imagine in fantasies; instead there's a lot of bungling and fumbling. It's all very forlorn and sad, even with the strain of friendship running through it. Great cast from top to bottom, great direction from Peter Bogdanovich, and a film that you can see was highly influential.",The Last Picture Show
33,g-bodyl,Surprisingly Poignant and Realistic!,9,23 October 2015,"The Last Picture Show is a very poignant coming-of-age story set amidst a dying Texas town, culturally and economically. That adds a sadness to the story. A sadness about changing times and the new way of life replacing the old way of life. That is a recurring theme in the film. I loved the use of black and white photography, which helps those themes. The film explores many things all teens go through such as exploring their sexuality, keeping friendships intact, graduating high school, and moving on to the next stage of life. The film explores all of those very well. The film is set in a town where everyone knows each other, which in turn enables the viewers to get to know the characters better.Peter Bogdanovich's film has a plot that is hard to describe, other than to say it is about growing up in a town that weeps of the past. Sonny Crawford is the main character here. He was a co-captain of his football team along with his best friend Duane. Sonny just broke up with his rather tasteless girl, while Duane dates the hottest girl in town. Sonny enters an affair with the middle-aged wife of the football coach, thus showing how far this town can get you.The film has many fine actors in it. Timothy Bottoms does an underrated job as Sonny. I really loved Jeff Bridge's performance as Duane, the guy who seems to have it all. Other performances to keep an eye on are Ben Johnson as the fatherly figure and most important man in town, Sam the Lion. And Cloris Leachman as Ruth, the wife Sonny has an affair with. She has quite a few powerful scenes.Overall, The Last Picture Show is a better film than I expected. A beautiful, poignant film about the pains of growing up. The tone is often bitter and sad. We don't often see happiness in the picture, from beginning to end. But we see our characters make most of their lives and that is what matters. All of the sad moments or in other words, the realism influence just how powerful this movie is, set against the 1950's Texas background. There are many great scenes, but I loved the funny scene involving running away from Texas just to head to Kansas. If you want a movie about growing up, this should be your first film to watch.My Grade: A",The Last Picture Show
34,secondtake,"Nuanced--a wash of subtle sensation, character, and sad determination",9,12 August 2010,"The Last Picture Show (1971)This is a miracle of a little big film. It's small in the details, it plays hard with nuance to the point of losing any sense of plot, and ends up creating better than almost any film of this type, a place and time, the whole mise-en-scene. Director Peter Bogdanovich, often now seen as a film commentator on DVD extras, is a real film devotee, a scholar but also an insider with a feel for ""the movies."" And he has made several remarkable films, some of which do nothing for me, like ""At Long Last Love,"" and at least one other masterpiece, also in black and white, ""Paper Moon."" At his best his films are both penetrating and oddly weightless, in the sense that they keep you floating through an imagined world without apparent effort. They are virtuosic without seeming virtuosic.You'll never doubt anyone here, their motives, their inner viability. And you won't question that this place exists, this small, wide street town with almost no one left, a true ghost town in the making. The cast is made of known but not famous actors, and as you watch you appreciate how beautifully, and with what fluidity, they are pulled together. The cameraman is Robert Surtees, a veteran from the 1940s and 50s, and who had recently pulled off the astonishing photography in ""The Graduate."" You can feel the influence of all of Bogdanovich's film-loving, film-going days, and his deep friendship with Orson Welles. Most of all, ""The Last Picture Show"" feels relevant. It's a metaphor about finding meaning amidst futility, about the escape from troubles and confronting them, about superficial beauty and the real thing, about sex in a way that seems appropriate for the period (the early 1950s), and about community in the that Spoon River Anthology kind of interwoven way. Remarkable on every score.Does all this make for a compelling experience? Do we normally want to sit and watch life go by and a parade of different characters, none of them heroic, none of them criminal, none of them especially singular in a cinematic way? Maybe. It depends if you're the type to take the window seat in a diner, or a bench in the park, or the corner of a busy room, and people watch. You can't participate, but you can pay attention. And watch, and watch again.",The Last Picture Show
35,851222,A terrifically acted coming of age story in a dying place,8,14 March 2017,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Last Picture Show"" (1971) is a good coming of age story set in a gods forgotten place. The place itself is like a character in this movie - it is a dying, dusty little town with no hope. And then there are people, living in it, or should i say surviving in there, as there isn't really much of a hope to look forward to in that place. And still they want to love, have sex, to cared about, no matter the age or social difference.I loved the performances in ""The Last Picture Show"". There are some many great performances here: Ben Johnson as ""Sam the Lion"", who won Oscar for his performance. One of my all time favorite Ellen Burstyn gave a great performance as well, much more complex then it appears at the beginning. Then there is Cloris Leachman who also won Academy award. The national treasure Jeff Bridges - great performance as well. I also loved Eileen Brennan (Genevieve) acting, every time she appeared on a screen i could take my eyes of her. And Randy Quaid should have stayed on the screen longer. Timothy Bottoms and well, everyone - this is a one terrifically acted movie. Script was also good as well as solid directing.Overall, ""The Last Picture Show"" is a terrifically acted coming of age story in a goods forgotten place. This is a very atmospheric movie, which looks so fragile at the times, like life in that place itself. Good movie all around.",The Last Picture Show
36,Bored_Dragon,Cybill Shepherd (naked) debut,7,13 July 2019,"At the beginning of the fifties, a group of teenagers, in a small dreary dying town in Texas, graduates from high school and is forced to face a gloomy reality. The film does not have any particular plot, but rather tries to present the grayness of everyday life of people in a hopeless environment. This atmosphere is largely contributed by the black and white technique and the absence of a music background. Music in the film only occurs when the characters listen to it on the radio, jukebox and the like. In the seventies, it caused controversy because of, for its time, explicit nudity and teenage sex as one of the main motives, but the movie is so depressing that even a sex desire is cut off at the root.The film won two Oscars, out of eight nominations, as well as many other awards, and is considered one of the best American achievements of the seventies, but, although intellectually I realize its greatness, it did not leave a particularly strong impression on me. Although I had already seen it a few years ago, I had the impression that I was watching it for the first time, and I believe that in a few more years I would not remember anything again.7/10",The Last Picture Show
37,sol-,My brief review of the film,10,10 January 2005,"A heartfelt, unbelievably frank film on teenage sexuality, it manages to capture the intensity and tumult of the feelings of its depicted young characters superbly well. The cast is excellent, playing each character out in a realistic and moving manner. Timothy Bottoms in particular displays one of the most earnest performances of all time, and the rest of the actors and actresses are so good in general that it is hard to single one particular one out. The film is superbly shot in black and white, which helps depict the entrapment of the characters' emotions, and to really purify the desire to express their feelings. Without doubt this is one of most honest character studies ever filmed, and it just gets better on a second viewing.",The Last Picture Show
38,poe426,Lust in the dust...,10,19 August 2014,"THE LAST PICTURE SHOW is a moving snapshot of Times Past, faithfully recreated and honestly portrayed. There are none of the over-the-top performances that often mar this kind of movie; the characterizations are low-key and down-to-earth and ring true. Likewise, the filmmaking itself: the camera is an unflinching observer, recording for posterity the life and loves of all the characters involved in an almost documentary style. That it's done in black and white is yet another plus: this was how the world WAS before Color came along. Timothy Bottoms as Sonny is Everyguy, a boy entering young Manhood and hoping and wanting something BETTER out of Life. His final scene, which dissolves oh-so-slowly into a shot of the dust-choked main street of town, where the camera pans to a last, lingering shot of the Royal (the town theater, now closed due to the death of owner Ben Johnson), is quite beautiful.",The Last Picture Show
39,funkyfry,but not for me,3,27 June 2007,"It's sort of hard for me to say it, because I so greatly enjoyed both ""Targets"" and ""Paper Moon"", but I thought ""The Last Picture show"" was a somewhat fascinating but overly self-indulgent film. Its main positive, as far as I'm concerned, is the stunning photography. But for me the film had nothing to offer beyond surface beauty (and a kind of hidden beauty, at that). The characters were very hard to relate to or to care about. Basically you had this very slow pace and this naturalistic style of acting, but it was all there to prop up a very formulaic and predictable story, complete with all the trappings one would expect from any small town melodrama -- everything from the boy cheating with his teacher's wife to the handicapped kid who everyone picks on. It was like ""American Graffiti"" without the joy of life.Some might say this film is more realistic -- nowadays a lot of people seem to think that realism is the only virtue a film can possess. But for me the film was simply oppressive, and I want to see it again about as badly as I'd like to spend a few hours in that miserable town the characters live in.Maybe this film really just belongs to its time -- perhaps if I'd seen it in 1971 I would have been impressed by its novelty, just by seeing something different on the screen. But that would basically assume that I had never seen anything like, say, Godard's ""Breathless"". Maybe the overt references to classic films would have appealed to the movie geek in me and helped me to overlook some of the film's weaknesses. But in the post-Tarantino world that hardly seems unique or special either.It is interesting though how he uses the films in the film to give his own film more depth. We see 3 films as I recall in the picture show. First we see Vincente Minnelli's ""Father of the Bride"" -- Liz Taylor's exquisite looks provide a contrast to Sonny's girlfriend and Minnelli's studied upper-middle class milieu contrasts to the character's ""real life"" surroundings in a similar way. Later, clips from Howard Hawks' ""Red River"" emphasize the theme of a broken friendship between a mentor and a protégé. It really just reminds me that Bogdanovich is kissing his own mentor's butt, much as he did if I remember correctly by selecting a Hawks film as part of his own on-screen reverie with Boris Karloff in ""Targets"". I guess in 1971 this kind of thing was new but looking at it today it just seems self-indulgent, like so much of the rest of this film.Ultimately, I'd rather see another film by Hawks, Ford or Minnelli than to have Bogdanovich's film remind us of why they were so striking in such a less-than-subtle way. Maybe he intends to remind us of the giants whose time had passed -- all he really does is remind us how small he and most of his contemporaries are in relation.",The Last Picture Show
40,videorama-759-859391,One of the best picture shows,10,24 July 2014,"I fell in love with this film, like I thought I wouldn't, as having seen Texasville earlier. To put it bluntly, The Last Picture Show is a cinematic, flawless masterpiece, steered by a ensemble of great actors, who come together like one big family as working so well off each other. Even a young Bridges, already showed so much great talent here, as a rebel town kid, Duane, best friends with Bottoms, who is a lighter natured boy. Duane is going out with the hottest girl in this small out of way Texas town (Shepherd) who's never looked hotter as the virginal sweetheart. Her timidity in the skinning dipping scene with a young randy, Randy Quaid, another acting asset as Lester, the town clown, is so cute. Set at the start of the good 'ol seventies, we follow the lives of these late teens, going through the normal changes in their life and passing into manhood, where they're a lot of moments we familiarize with reality. Times are getting tougher, the picture theatre closing down for one thing, where Duane ends going in the army, and an older Cloris Leachman becomes a sort of Mrs Robinson to a young Bottoms, after her husband Sam The Lion (Ben Johnson) passes, which I must say was a turning point. The last goodbye Duane and Sonny gave Sam, before heading down to Mexico before death took hold, made that memory more affecting Johnson's is the most memorable performance, an Oscar richly deserved, where Bridges was still getting started as an actor, as many others. Every actors great, every character leaving a visual impression on ya. The black and white choice for this film, couldn't of cut it more perfectly. The dry arid landscapes, the dusty shots of the town, the cold lake shots, are visually beautiful and memorable, reminding me of my own Northbound towns in the dry Summer heat. None was a more affecting moment than the hit and run of the young dumb sweeper kid, (Sam Bottoms). The friendship between Sonny and him, I really liked. In a mature screenplay, TLPS is just one of those unforgettable films, with unforgettable moments, some amusing, where really what I loved about it, was the characters, steered by such heavyweight performances, which was the real strength that drove this movie.

Filmed in glorious Black and White (at the suggestion of no less than Orson Welles), it chronicles the lives of various townsfolk and their interrelationships with each other.Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane Jackson (Jeff Bridges) are best friends and members of the school football team that apparently didn't know how to tackle. Duane is dating hottie and town rich girl Jacy Farrow (Cybil Shepherd) the daughter of Lois (Ellen Burstyn) and Gene (Robert Glenn) Farrow, oil rich citizens. Sonny is in envy of his pal. Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) owns the local picture show, pool room and diner. He looks after the simple minded Billy (Sam Bottoms).One day, the football coach (Bill Thurmon) asks sonny to drive his wife Ruth (Cloris Leachman) to an appointment. Unexpectedly, Sonny falls into the arms of the bored housewife and an affair ensues. Jacy meanwhile, accepts an offer from the nerdy Lester Marlow (Randy Quaid) to attend a swimming party where everyone skinny dips. Duane is visibly upset.Later, the 'boys"" including Sonny and Duane decide it's time for young Billy to have his first ""experience"". They set him up with the local ""pillow"" which doesn't work out. When they take him back home, Sam is infuriated and bans the gang from his establishments. Duane, who hid in the back seat of the car is not among the blamed.In a very poignant scene at the local swimming hole, Sam reflects to Sonny on his youth describing his affair 20 years ago with a fair lady who was married. We later learn that that lady was Lois Farrow who chose money over love instead of him. We also learn that Sam once owned the large tract of land around the pond but had lost it over the years.Duane becoming bored with life goes off to work in the oil fields On returning one weekend, he and Sonny go off to Mexico for the weekend. On returning they learn that Sam had died the previous day leaving his pool room to Sonny and the café to waitress Genevieve (Eileen Brennan). Sonny takes on the task of looking out for Billy. Jacy meanwhile is seduced by local oil rigger Alelene (Clu Gulager) on a pool table. Ashamed , Jacy having lost her rich boyfriend begins to play up to Sonny. Sonny stops seeing Ruth and she becomes despondent.Duane goes off to join the army. On his last night home, he and Sonny go to the last picture show before the little theater closes down for good. Then one day, young Billy is killed in a traffic accident. (""He was just sweeping"") Sonny having lost Jacy to college goes back to reconcile with Ruth and.........................Excellent performances from the largely unknown juvenile cast particularly Timothy Bottoms and Jeff Bridges. .

42,mjneu59,Bogdanovich peaked in his first major film,9,30 November 2010,"It could have been little more than an impeccably produced soap opera, but this moody portrait of a dying Texas cow town remains, instead, one of the essential Hollywood films of the 1970s. The timeless isolation of the American West has rarely been more vivid: that sense of lonely, desperate lives caught in a limbo of suspended decay, victims of terminal boredom and frustrated libidos. Sometimes it seems as if the only action in town is motivated by raging hormones, but the more each character yearns after gratification the more they find only heartache and pain.The screenplay (co-written by Larry McMurtry from his own novel) is relentlessly downbeat, and made to seem even darker by director Peter Bogdanovich's inspired decision to shoot the film in black and white (something almost unheard of in American movies at the time). The often stark photography by ace cinematographer Bruce Surtees removes all the joy and artifice from the setting, leaving only a bittersweet feeling of alienation and loss.",The Last Picture Show
43,robfollower,The Last Picture Show presented a nostalgic look backward,8,3 March 2019,"Produced by Hollywood iconoclast BBS Productions, film critic-turned-director Peter Bogdanovich's 1971 film pays homage to Hollywood's classical age as it chronicles generational rites of passage in Anarene, a fictional one-horse Texas town. In 1951, high school seniors Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane (Jeff Bridges) play football, go to the movies at the Royal Theater, hang out at the pool hall owned by local elder statesman Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson), and lust after rich tease Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd in her film debut). As the year passes, Sonny learns about the pitfalls and compromises of adulthood through an affair with his coach's wife Ruth (Cloris Leachman) and a thwarted elopement with Jacy after she dumps Duane. Following two tragic deaths, and with Duane gone to Korea and Jacy packed off to college in Dallas, Sonny is left behind in Anarene, wise enough to absorb the life lessons of Sam the Lion and Jacy's mother Lois (Ellen Burstyn). He is determined to honor Sam's legacy as the town's conscience, despite a telling sign of incipient communal disintegration: the closing of the Royal Theater after a final showing of Howard Hawks's Red River. Paying tribute to classical Hollywood directors like Hawks and John Ford, Bogdanovich used old-time cinematographer Robert Surtees and shot The Last Picture Show in crisp black-and-white, with a restrained style devoid of the kind of ""new wave"" techniques (jump cuts, zooms, and jittery hand-held camerawork) used by such contemporaries as Arthur Penn, Robert Altman, Mike Nichols, and Martin Scorsese. As in such Ford films as The Grapes of Wrath (1940), Bogdanovich relies on careful visual composition in deep focus to help communicate the regret over the passing of an era. Hailed as one of the best films by a young director since Citizen Kane (1941), The Last Picture Show premiered at the New York Film Festival and went on to become a hit. It was also nominated for eight Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay for Larry McMurtry's and Bogdanovich's adaptation of McMurtry's novel. John Ford stalwart Johnson won Supporting Actor and Leachman won Supporting Actress, beating out their cohorts Bridges and Burstyn. For an audience steeped in movie history and caught up in the chaotic 1971 present, The Last Picture Show presented a nostalgic look backward that was not so much an escape from the present as a coming to terms with what the present had lost. Its 1990 sequel Texasville, in which Bridges and Shepherd played later incarnations of their original characters, was not as successful.",The Last Picture Show
44,MBunge,Not my cup 'o tea,5,3 January 2012,"A tale of emotional desolation in a one horse Texas town, The Last Picture Show is extremely well made but did nothing for me. I don't know if it's my age, the age I live in or that I grew up in a small town, but my reaction to this story and filmmaking is ""That's all?"" While I can admire the well drawn themes and characters here, I need more structure than this to really get involved in a movie. Not everything has to be Die Hard or Memento. I just prefer something more than people desultorily floating through an amorphous, narrative cloud.In the early 1950s, Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms) is a teenager in a small town so barren, many of the residents seem more like ghosts than living human beings. His life is dominated by his oil rig roughneck friend Dwayne (Jeff Bridges), the imposing local pool hall owner Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson), Sam's slow witted son Billy (Sam Bottoms) and Genevieve (Eileen Brennan), the quietly defiant waitress at the local diner. The story basically follows Sonny as he drifts along through Dwayne's troubles with his country club girlfriend, the flighty drama queen Jacy (Cybill Shepherd), and into a relationship with Ruth (Cloris Leachman), the wife of Sonny's high school football and basketball coach. There's also Lois (Ellen Burstyn), Jacy's frustrated mother who hopes her daughter can avoid following in her empty footsteps.It's hard to get too much more than that into The Last Picture Show because this is one of those films when time passes and stuff sorta happens. Sometimes you can't tell if days, weeks or months have elapsed between scenes. This is also one of those films where you wait, wait, wait, wait around for one of the characters to have a big emotional explosion. I only managed to wait and wait before losing my interest in seeing that happen. The acting is very good, especially Jeff Bridges, Ellen Burstyn and Cloris Leachman, and I could appreciate the depiction of people trapped in lives of regret. After about 45 minutes of that, though, I was in the mood for something more. While legitimately artistic, this motion picture isn't all that entertaining.Compounding matters is the passive nature of both the character of Sonny and the performance of Timothy Bottoms. It's easy to see why Bridges and Cybill Shepherd emerged from this as stars and Bottoms didn't, but he wasn't done any favors by being given a role that mostly asked him to cycle through a series of expressions that went from mournful to plaintive and back again with little else involved. You can see the problems with the role clearly in how Sonny engages in a month's long affair with the coach's wife, yet the physical and emotional intimacy with her has no discernible effect on anything about Sonny. If nothing else, the sexual experience should meant something when things turn to Jacy enticing Sonny into a furtive relationship.If you've enjoyed other work by Bogdanovich, you'll probably love The Last Picture Show. If you're just young enough to identify with the kids but still old enough to be intrigued with the humanity shown by their elders, you also might get more out of this than me. I'm not sure there's enough here to elevate it over more recent work with a similar style and temperament. And yes, that includes Shepherd's nude scene.",The Last Picture Show
45,Lechuguilla,A Sense Of Realism,10,29 January 2006,"This is a character study wherein the main character is a small West Texas town, circa 1951. In the U.S., the early 1950s symbolized a transition from nineteenth century agrarian values to twentieth century urbanism. In the film, various people who live in the town must confront the reality that time moves on. Things change. Assumptions of previous generations give way to the untested assumptions of the future. The film's theme is thus American cultural change, and the personal disillusionment that such change can bring. It is a powerful theme, and the film imparts that theme with logical clarity and emotional frankness.In the hands of lesser talents, the subject matter of unimportant people doing unimportant things might have yielded a tiresome soap opera. But the film's script is poetic, the direction is skillful, the B&W cinematography is artistic, the casting is perfect, and the performances are superlative.The story draws heavily from early American individualism. Life here is mostly physical, not mental. Human relationships are direct, immediate, one-on-one. Except for schools, which are given some prominence, cultural institutions exist in the film only vaguely or not at all. For entertainment, people listen to radio, which features the mournful country-western music of Hank Williams. Or, they go to the town's decrepit picture show, where an elderly Miss Mosey kindly returns money to the kids who got there too late to see the cartoons.If the film has a weakness it is in the presentation of a realism that is incomplete. We see mostly stifling bleakness, though that is ameliorated somewhat by humor. What we don't see are the uplifting influences and the optimism that sustained agrarian generations through hardships and rough times.Nevertheless, within the film's story parameters, the film does convey an accurate account of what life was like for ordinary folks in West Texas in the early 1950s. I doubt that this film could be made today. Contemporary audiences have been conditioned to expect non-stop action, loudness, glitz, and overblown special effects, all of which are absent, mercifully, from this film.Low-key, perceptive, bleak, and melancholy, ""The Last Picture Show"" easily makes my list of Top Ten favorite films of all time.",The Last Picture Show

Bogdonovich was an absolute genius with this film. Too bad he hasn't matched it since. There were a number of things that were different in this film, like using no opening credits, no soundtrack, just music played through the characters' radios, etc. and of course being in black and white. Black and white really brings out the bleakness of the area, reflected in the bleakness of the characters' lives. I also thought that black and white is very evocative of the times, seen through the lens of someone around 40 years old. This is a must-have movie.",The Last Picture Show
47,jimbo-53-186511,The critics seem to love this film but sadly I simply cannot share their enthusiasm,2,29 January 2021,"The Last Picture show focusses on a bunch of high-school students coming-of-age in a northern Texas town in early 1950's America. As is to be expected in this kind of film we get to witness the usual pitfalls and disagreements that are to be expected with a bunch of youngsters approaching adulthood, but I'm sorry to say that I just didn't care all that much for it.The Last Picture show has a metascore of 93 out of 100, but this average metascore should really be taken in context now that we are in the year 2021. For a start, those high scores and reviews would have been penned in the early 70's when a film like The Last Picture Show may have perhaps been seen as being unique and different. However, watching it today I got very little out of it; Jacy is the prom-queen type of girl who can have any guy she wants and gets bored very easily; the type of character Jacy portrays in this film has become tenapenny over the years, but even taking that factor out of the equation Jacy is hardly an interesting character. The same can be said for much of the supporting cast who either seem to play shallow/one-dimensional people or the stereotypical dumb hick types that a person may envisage lives in the southern US states. The only character of some interest in this film is Sonny, but even his story arc is rather weak and almost feels incomplete by the film's end.Slight plus points with the film lie with some of the acting (particularly from the ever reliable Jeff Bridges). The black and white cinematography is good and Bogdanovich captures the era well. Unfortunately, that's where the praise ends as far as I'm concerned; I found the pacing of the film to be appalling, nearly all of the characters were either unlikeable or uninteresting and despite its 2 hour running time the film seemed to have very little to say for itself.Like I say, back in 71 this film may have been unique and different enough to cut the mustard, but nowadays the glacial pacing, mostly one-dimensional uninteresting characters and the somewhat messy storytelling make the film feel like a relic of its time. Judging by the way the critics have gushed over it and its rather respectable current IMDB score of 8.0 out of 10 there is clearly still an audience for this type of film, but it's not for me I'm afraid.",The Last Picture Show

49,drystyx,Quantity over Quality,4,8 August 2011,"In 1971, I was 14 years old until mid December, in the ninth and tenth grade. I certainly recall this film spoken of in high terms by those wealthy enough to see all the new films.And I always thought I would enjoy it. I just recently got a chance to watch it.I knew it would be about small town life, and be a drama. The photograph of the swimming scene where some beautiful nude people are supposed to tease a plain but young girl into stripping. That was the only image most of us ever saw. Later on, this plain young girl would develop as a very sexy mature actress. And even then, she had a good body.So I found it in the library, and checked it out.I probably expected too much. Still, it was very disappointing.It was full of all the clichés and stereotypes of the early seventies.Kids grown up in a small Texas town near the start of the Korean War.The performances and production are top notch. It reminds me very much of what was very common, and still is. Poor script with lots of money spent on it, because directors like to prove a point.The biggest trouble with the story is that everyone seems to be the same person, and the person doesn't ring true. It's more like a narrator saying every person is him (or her), unless the person is not to be trusted.A huge trouble with this movie, which will ultimately put it in the waste cans in an hundred years, when the self righteous ones who push this movie down other people's throats are finally gone, is that it doesn't even come cloe to a realistic depiction of small town life. I wasn't around in the early 1940s, but did live a town of about 3000 in the late sixties and early seventies, fifth through twelfth grade, and this was nothing like real life, especially with the characters. The characters in the movie all come across as very civil to each other, like a happy family, and that's a pipe dream. Not a single believable scene in the entire movie. Very disappointing.The movie is very predictable, even for 1971. It also lacks coherence for the first half. We don't know who is who, or what they are doing. It is confusing and looks botched.Sometimes confusion is good, or okay, but since this is a drama, a story, it comes across as poor directing and/or writing, which it is.The story is just a poor story. The only ones who seem to have any soul at all are the ones who are called ""slow"" or ""retarded"". The others all come across as people who think they are in a seventies movie, which looks goofy since they live in the early fifties.The movie is made with a lot of hatred, and makes great pains to contrive things to look like nothing abnormal happens, almost like a writer is contriving a story to show there is no god, but in doing so makes it so barren that only a divine spirit could possibly make it so barren. Like a pair of dice that are rolled a thousand times and never come up ""7"".It looks like an atheist preaching a sermon, which of course means it will be loved by the American public, but it is lame.I give ""3"" to movies that aren't bad, but just bore me to sleep. This one came close, but not quite, so it rated a ""4"".Too bad, because a film about nostalgic eras, about small town life, should have been much better. We're given the huge ""quantity"" here of a big budget, mostly good acting, small details paid attention to, but no ""quality"" of writing or directing. Typical seventies preaching.Mildly disappointing. Perhaps, if you expect the worst, you may be a bit more pleasantly surprised. Mediocre, by any standard.",The Last Picture Show
50,valleyjohn,"Stands the test of time,",8,24 June 2020,"To say The Last Picture show is like a 1950's soap opera doesn't really do the film justice but that's exactly what it is , even down to the closing credits .It's all about the lives of high school friends Sonny , Duane and Jacy who's relationships overlap in a dying 1950s Texas town.Being shot in black and white it really does help with the feel of desolation . The Town looks like it's on it's last legs and you certainly feel it because of the brilliant country soundtrack that is almost permanently in the background.At 9 minutes and 54 seconds, Ben Johnson's performance in this movie is the shortest to ever win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Cloris Leachman , who played Ruth Popper , also won an Oscar.You can see why the two boys fought over Jacy because Cybill Shepherd was absolutely gorgeous and was brave to do a nude scene at the age of 20 .This isn't a film that's mentioned too often when 1970's movies are spoken about and I'm surprised because it certainly stands the test of time .",The Last Picture Show
51,Movie-ManDan,A Coming Of Age Film Of Importance.,10,26 August 2019,"There was a boom of up-and-coming directors in 1970s America which included Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Woody Allen trying to make names for themselves. The first to make this impact was Robert Altman in 1970 with his ant-war film, 'M*A*S*H'. But the first masterpiece to be released in the decade was Peter Bogdanovich's second feature film, 'The Last Picture Show'--the film said to be the finest work by a young director since Orson Welles and 'Citizen Kane' thirty years prior.'The Last Picture Show' is a multi-person character study about residents in a dying town from 1951 to 1952. Shot on location, Peter Bogdanovich chose to make the film in black and white (a move he was surprised the production company allowed him to do) because shooting it in colour made many shots look nice and beautiful. The town is decaying and has no reason to exist. A nice look would have taken away from the whole idea of this town being blank. (Despite the drab look, it also succeeds in making it look like a movie from the 1950s since it is in black and white.) Bogdanovich succeeds in making this Texas town seem as blah as can be.The first two characters we are introduced to are Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane (Jeff Bridges)--the co-captains of the high school football team. Duane wants to marry Jacy (Cybill Shepherd) and Sonny's girlfriend dumps him. Sonny then starts to have an affair with the coach's beautiful wife (Cloris Leachman). Getting to know Jacy a bit more, she's a virgin that wants to get sex out of the way as fast as possible. There's even a scene where she accompanies a very young Randy Quaid to a nude pool party. Her mother is played by Ellen Burstyn, who has fallen out of love with her husband and is unfaithful to him. The last of the major character we get to know is the wise Sam ""The Lion"" (Ben Johnson). Sam owns most of the businesses in the town including the movie theatre (called ""The Picture Show""). Upon his death, he leaves many things to each of the characters we get to know, including the pool hall to Sonny. Each of these characters are in search of bigger and better things in life. They just don't know what these things are or how to achieve them.The two films that I would compare this to are Spike Lee's 'Do The Right Thing' and 'American Pie'. It is like 'American Pie' because of the abundance of sexual content that drives the characters. And it is like Spike Lee's breakout hit because of its ambiguity in its message. 'Do The Right Thing' is obviously about racism, but 'The Last Picture Show' gets people wondering even more. (Peter Bogdanovich agreed to direct this film because he had no idea how he would make it, which is an odd paradoxical approach.) We get that the film is trying to tell us something, but what? My guess is the pursuit of happiness. Each character strives for something greater in the residents of a dead-end town. Regardless of what the overall message is, each character is deeply and honestly fleshed out. Because of this, the movie is fascinating. Why not show simple honesty in people? Character-driven films are always great.None of the characters are perfect. The town is dead. The message is muddled. But what Peter Bogdanovich captures is the essence of emerging adulthood in its finest form.4/4.",The Last Picture Show
52,fntstcplnt,The Last Picture Show (1971),9,4 December 2019,"Directed by Peter Bogdonavich. Starring Timothy Bottoms, Cybill Shepherd, Jeff Bridges, Ben Johnson, Ellen Burstyn, Cloris Leachman, Eileen Brennan, Randy Quaid, Clu Gulager, Sam Bottoms, Joe Heathcock, Sharon Taggart, Bill Thurman, Barc Doyle, Gary Brockette, Jessie Lee Fulton. (R)Sharply-observed mosaic of individuals living (trapped) in a small North Texas town in the early 50s, some eager to come of age and either get out or cling to tradition, others well past that youthful prime and stung by a paralytic desolation. Director Bogdonavich, who also wrote the brilliant script with Larry McMurtry (author of the novel on which the film is based), correctly chooses black & white for his canvas, not just because it feels so appropriate considering the era and starkness of the location, but because of the Orson Welles/""Citizen Kane"" influence, where deep focus is much more easily achieved. Not much of a plot, per se (which is kind of the point for these aimless souls); has as much a sense of place as nearly any film before or since, its setting becoming the dominant character in a film full of memorable, deftly-realized figures. Put many of the young cast members on the map; the adults are even better, with Johnson and Leachman both winning Oscars for their work (each one gets--and nails--a show-stopping scene, one of wistful nuance, the other of frustrated fury). Followed almost two decades later by a sequel, ""Texasville.""93/100",The Last Picture Show
53,bandw,There are few perfect movies and this is one,10,7 March 2006,"Here is a movie that perfectly captures a time and place. The time is the year between November, 1951 and November, 1952 and the place is Anarene, Texas, a small town in north central Texas. The screenplay was written by Larry McMurtry, in collaboration with director Bogdanovich, based on McMurtry's novel of the same name. Anarene is just south of Archer City, McMurtry's home town where the movie was filmed. McMurtry knows whereof he speaks, the movie has the feeling of total authenticity.The story centers around two best friends, Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane (Jeff Bridges), as they pass from being high school seniors into adult life. Given their backgrounds, coming from broken homes and living in boarding houses, there is little idea that they will go to college. The movie details how the two handle this pivotal and bewildering time from being on the high school football team one year to being on their own without much of a safety net the next. In a wider context the movie is about larger transitions: from youth to adulthood for the young people, from a frustrated and bored middle age to an even less promising future for the older folks, and from a town with some social cohesiveness to a town dealing with the isolating effects of a bankrupt economy and the advent of television. The rather bleak prospects that Sonny and Duane face parallel the prospects of the town. You are made to think about transitions in your own life.The movie is populated with many finely drawn characters, all acted with supreme skill. There is not a false note struck in the entire movie. By the end we know the characters so well that they seem real. Jeff Bridges was nominated for an Oscar, and I don't understand why Timothy Bottoms was not nominated as well, since his performance is of equal quality. Bottoms plays Sonny with such genuine good-natured charm and honest sincerity that it is hard to believe he is acting. And Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman both won well-deserved Oscars. Kudos all round to the entire cast. The movie is beautifully filmed in black and white befitting the stark settings and story, and the time period. It is filmed as if it were made in the period portrayed.If you have ever lived in a small town or if you grew up in the American heartland in the 1950s, this movie will evoke overwhelming nostalgia. But the story is so powerfully told that I think that for everyone it will evoke nostalgia for a time and place, even for that which they may never have known.The town, as well as the movie, is held together by Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) who owns the movie theater, the café, and the pool hall. In fact he owns just about everything there is to do in Anarene, except for watching the hapless Anarene High football team ... and sex. It is no wonder then that sex, in its many faceted varieties, plays a big role in this town, and in this movie.There are so many wonderful and memorable scenes that it would simply require a small volume to recount them. One scene that grabbed me was when Sam and Sonny are at a lake outside of town, ostensibly fishing, and Sam reminiscences about old times, about when he came to the lake twenty years earlier with a lover. Sam makes the comment, ""You wouldn't believe how this land has changed."" The camera pans the surroundings and it is hard to see how this area could have changed much in the last thousand years, but Sam is clearly attuned to the subtle changes, since memories were impressed on him in a time of strong emotion. We all have clear memories from when and where we have been happy, even if it is a small lake in a desolate flat land. And Sam's specific comment can be taken to apply more generally to the basic theme of the movie. This incredible scene ends with Sam's saying, ""Being a decrepit old bag of bones, that's what's ridiculous,"" and anyone who is not close to tears at that point will never truly appreciate the beauty of this movie.Seemingly this movie should be depressing, but the effect is more of a melancholic look into the lives of ordinary people who are just trying to play the hands they have been dealt in life.It wasn't until the movie was over and I was reading the credits that I realized how cleverly the music had been woven into the film. All of the music is from the time period and is a part of the action and not background music. It is played on home radios, car radios, truck radios, 45 rpm players, jukeboxes, and at a community Christmas dance. The Hank Williams song, heard on the radio in Sonny's old truck in the opening scene, ""Why Don't You Love Me Like You Used to Do?"" sets the tone for the music as well as the movie. There are great songs taken from over a dozen country and western classics from the era. Ruth (Cloris Leachman) is listening to Johnny Standley's quirky, ""It's in the Book,"" (a unique and strangely satirical offering to be popular at any time, let alone reach the pop charts and sell a million records in 1952) during the final scene between her and Sonny.Why is this movie so special? That's kind of like asking why one likes a certain piece of music or a painting. Everything comes together here in one of those magic moments - the acting, the filming, the story, the music, the editing - to create a simply-told and remarkably affecting work of art.",The Last Picture Show
54,DeeNine-2,An American classic,10,31 October 2001,"In this nostalgic, atmospheric study of small town life in the fifties as seen a decade later, filmed on location in Wichita Falls and Archer City, Texas (from a novel by the incomparable Larry McMurtry), the force of slow, inevitable change is symbolized in the showing of the last picture at the local movie house. That last picture show, incidentally, is Howard Hawks' celebrated Western, Red River (1948) starring John Wayne and Montgomery Clift.Well, the movie houses came back to life as multiplexes charging eight bucks a pop, but the Western movie died out, and the boys watching that movie went their separate ways into manhood.Peter Bogdanovich's direction is episodic and leisurely, naturalistic with just a hint of the maudlin. We get a sense of the North Texas prairie wind blowing through a cattle town where there is not a lot to do and a whole lot of time to do it. Hungry women and a sense of drift. Boredom, gray skies and a lot of dust. You could set 'Anarene, Texas' down any place in southwestern or midwestern America, circa 1951, and you wouldn't have to change much: a main drag, a Texaco gas station, a café, a feed store, flat lands all around, old pickup trucks and a pool hall, youngsters with a restless yearning to grow up, drinking beer out of brown bottles giggling and elbowing each other in the ribs, and the old boys playing dominoes and telling tales of bygone days.Robert Surtees's stark, yet romantic black and white cinematography, captures well that bygone era. The wide shot of the bus pulling out, taking Duane off to the Korean War with Sonny watching, standing by the Texaco station with the missing letter in the sign, was a tableau in motion, a moment stopped in our minds.Cybill Shepherd made her debut here as Jacy Farrow, a bored little rich girl playing at love and sexuality. Part of the restorations in the video not shown in theaters in the early seventies includes some footage of her in the buff after stripping on a diving board (!). She is as shallow as she is pretty, and one of the reasons for seeing this film, although in truth her performance, while engaging, was a little uneven.The rest of the cast was outstanding, in particular Timothy Bottoms whose Sonny Crawford is warm and forgiving, sweet and innocent. Jeff Bridges's Duane Jackson is two-faced, wild and careless, self-centered and probably going to die in Korea. Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman deservedly won Oscars as best supporting actors. Leachman was especially good as the lonely 40-year-old wife of the football coach who has an awkward affair with the 18-year-old Sonny, while Johnson played a lovable, crusty guy that the kids looked up to. Sam Bottoms played the retarded Billy with steady, tragic good humor. Ellen Burstyn as Jacy's terminally bored mother, and Eileen Brennan as the wise waitress with a hand on her hip were also very good.Memorable, but perhaps too obviously insertional, are the medley of country, pop, and rock and roll tunes from the late forties/early fifties jingling out of car radios and 45 record players throughout the film.Peter Bogdanovich followed this with some hits, including the comedy What's Up Doc (1972) with Barbra Streisand, Ryan O'Neal, and Madeline Kahn, and the excellent Paper Moon (1973) with Ryan and Tatum O'Neal, but then tailed off.I don't think he ever lived up to the promise of this film, an American classic not to be missed.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)",The Last Picture Show
55,sme_no_densetsu,Powerful and passionate,9,15 July 2008,"""The Last Picture Show"" is a coming of age story set in Texas in the early 50's. It deals with sexuality in a frank manner with much of the plot revolving around the romantic entanglements of the main characters.The acting is excellent, with four cast members receiving Oscar nominations in supporting roles (Jeff Bridges, Ellen Burstyn, Ben Johnson & Cloris Leachman). Johnson & Leachman both won and in my opinion Leachman's performance in particular was nothing short of awe-inspiring. I also feel that Timothy Bottoms was worthy of a nomination.Peter Bogdanovich's direction is well-handled throughout but it's the subtle touches that impress me the most. For instance, shooting in black & white was an inspired choice. Also, several times I was struck by the way that he focused on body language rather than dialogue to convey a character's emotions. Additionally, the authentic country & pop soundtrack (rather than a score) really adds to the atmosphere.In the end, what we have is an admirably directed, impressively acted film with a story that will captivate you for two hours and haunt your thoughts long after the screen has faded to black. Do not miss this film.",The Last Picture Show
56,frankde-jong,Never was desperation so convincingly played as in this film by Cloris Leachman,9,16 March 2021,"""The last picture show"" shows us America in the '50s, just before the Korean war. It does so with excellent black and white photography (Robert Surtees) and the music of Hank Williams.It is not just average America we see, but a one horse town somewhere in Texas. Nothing special happens in ""The last picture show"" and according to Time magazine the film succeeds in making ennui interesting.Only one person (Sam the Lion played by Ben Johnson) is still trying to organize some kind of social / public life. In this respect he is comparable with George Bailey (James Stewart) in ""It's a wonderful life"" (1946, Frank Capra).After his death boredom supremely reigns. This is indicated among other things by the fact that the question ""Who is doing it with whom?"" is occupying the adult population as much as it is the teenagers (for whom this is a normal phase in their development).Apart from grown up with grown up - and teenager with teenager relations there is also an affair between a grown up and a teenager. This affair plays a remarkable role in the movie. We are accustomed to view the younger person as the victim of such a type of relationship. Not in this film! When the teenager is tempted by the beauty queen of the village, he promptly forgets his grown up lover. In a heartbreaking scene we are witnesses of her desperation. This scene is really top class acting of Cloris Leachman.",The Last Picture Show
57,johno-21,Good film making,8,11 March 2006,"Peter Bogdanovich's Last Picture show is the best of is erratic directorial career. This was his first major film and he hit big with it. He would go on to make only two other films of any note, Paper Moon in '73 and Mask in '85. Veteran cinematographer Robert Surtees brought a lot of experience and talent to Picture Show. He had done cinematography for many big films in his career including The Graduate, The Summer of 42, Ben Hur, Quo Vadis, Oklahoma, Doctor Doolittle, King Soloman's Mines and many more. Bogdanovich uses his cinematography wisely in this production and he also did a fine job directing this large ensemble cast including veterans and newcomers in Ben Johnson, Cloris Leachman, Ellen Burstyn, Clu Gulagar, Eileen Brennan, Jeff Bridge, Cybil shepherd, Timothy Bottoms and Randy Quaid. An astounding four actors from this film received Academy Award Nominations in Ben Johnson and Jeff Bridges for Best Supporting Actor and Cloris Leachman and Ellen Burstyn for Best Supporting Actress. Johnson and Leachman both won in their only nominations and wins in their careers of an Oscar. This film also received nominations for Picture, Director, Cinematography, and Screenplay. Based on the novel by Larry McMurty and adapted for screen by McMurty and Bogdanovich this is a great coming of age story while paying tribute to small town Americana of days gone by. Great music from the late 40's early 50's era and a great look to this film with fine acting and an interesting story shot in black and white I would give this an 8.5 out of 10 and recommend it.",The Last Picture Show
58,vitaleralphlouis,A Drama Worthy of the Hank Williams Soundtrack,10,26 October 2005,"Intertwined tales of life, love, sex, heartbreak in a small Texas town; a film worthy of having a soundtrack featuring Hank Williams --- the greatest writer-singer in the history of country music --- the greatest in the history of music; period. Peter Bogdanovich created a dramatic masterpiece with this the first of his two (and only two) screen classics; the second was Paper Moon. This multi-Oscar honored picture had characters and interactions which spellbound the audience, and you could hear a pin drop at the capacity Fine Arts theater while this picture played. No talking, no rest room breaks, no way you'd miss a minute of it. Look it up on eBay or at Hollywood Video on VHS, cuz they just do not make pictures of this quality anymore. Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman took the supporting actor Oscars, and nobody ever deserved them more. 10 stars are inadequate to evaluate this movie. Columbia Pictures was the second line studio that set records grabbing off the top Oscars such as Best Picture from the major studios, time and again for decades --- until purchased by Coca Cola and resold to Sony. Both new owners remain clueless on making quality pictures; and eventually made Spiderman, the greatest negative force in movies in 20 years. Sure, I enjoyed Spidy; but in the aftermath the coke sniffers of Hollywood dumbed-down their movies into a steady output of stupid and pointless comic book films. As of 10-26-05 Hollywood has yet to recover and there are no films made for adults. Adults defined as ticket-buyers aged 14 or older.",The Last Picture Show
59,TOMASBBloodhound,An American classic.,10,24 April 2006,"The Last Picture Show is an outstanding and overlooked masterpiece that continues to impress to this day. Peter Bogdonovich directed this incredible adaptation of Larry McMurtry's daring novel. It tells the story of a small town in the oil country of west Texas, and the lonely; desperate people who live there. The brilliant b&w photography of Robert Surtees along with the Hank Williams-rich soundtrack capture the early 1950's about as well as you could imagine. We are told the stories of some average folks having difficulty coping with the hands they've been dealt, as well as the emotional damage they do to one another. The film is moody, and it requires an attention span. But if you open yourself to it, you will find it a rewarding experience.Most of the action revolves around a high school senior named Sonny. He's played very well by Timothy Bottoms. He's a quiet and easy-going sort. His best friend Duane (Jeff Bridges) is a rambunctious alpha-male. Duane's girlfriend Jacy (Cybil Shepherd) is the town beauty who loves to tease the guys. These are three confused kids who get along great one moment, then are at each other's throats the next. Like so many young people, these kids are really at the mercy of their emotions and desires. They make foolish decisions at every turn and at times cause a great deal of hurt to those around them.The adults in town are an interesting bunch, themselves. The town's centerpiece is a man known as Sam The Lion. He's played by veteran actor Ben Johnson who won an Oscar for the role. A little speech he gives along the shore of a pond basically won it for him. In the DVD commentary, Bogdonovich notes that it was an overcast day, then miraculously the sun came out right as he was getting into the speech. They almost got the scene in one take, but Bottoms forgot his line about marriage and they had to include a cut. Too bad! Ellen Burstyn, who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, plays Jacy's bored mother. She spends her spare time romancing one of her husband's employees and dreaming of a more interesting life. Cloris Leachman, who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar, plays Ruth Popper. She's the neglected wife of the local high school football coach. She has an affair with Sonny who can't seem to find the right gal his age to date. Both of these women give amazingly real performances.We follow the lives of these individuals for the span of about a year. We share their secrets, we feel their emotions, and we understand their desires. Things come to a head in a shattering final sequence of events. Duane, still distraught over being dumped by Jacy several months earlier, boards a bus with a tear in his eye. The bus will be taking him away to the army, and certain combat in Korea. How about the shot of the bus driving out of town leaving Sonny all alone in the street? Next, a mentally challenged boy (played by Timothy's little brother Sam) is hit by a truck and killed moments later. Sonny and the boy were very close, and nobody else seems to give a damn. Sonny carries the boy's body off the street as a group of indignant adults simply watch. That scene was filmed in one take, and Bogdonovich himself was brought to tears after it was finished. Sonny then attempts to drive out of town, then realizes he has nowhere to go but back home to Ruth who he'd blown off months ago. He sheepishly shows up at her home and Cloris Leachman proceeds to win her Oscar with a tirade about his abandoning her. Notice how it merely takes one sideways glance from Sonny to melt her anger away....We get one last shot of the movie theater, now forced to close. Times they were a changin', but nothing has changed about this film. This is an American classic! 10 of 10 stars.The Hound.",The Last Picture Show
60,gab-14712,"Sad, But Incredibly Powerful Movie!",9,18 October 2017,"I really loved Peter Bogdanovich's The Last Picture Show. This was a film that was never on my radar, but then when I heard about the talent behind the film, I knew that I should check it out. Everything about the film is nearly perfect from the spot-on performances to the masterful direction to the technical side of the film. I very much enjoyed how the movie was filmed in black-and-white. It added to the surprising realism the film showed us. The film is about life and how people try to figure out the meaning of their lives in the rather desolate town of Anarene, Texas.There is no denying how depressing the film can be. It's certainly moody and there is no happiness to be found. The lives of everyone is like living in an empty void. People move on from one thing to the next with nothing to look forward too. This is one of the factors that make this movie so powerful. Also adding to the depression of this dying town is the changing times. The town resembles an old Western town way past it's due date. You understand the reasons the tumbleweed rolling through town. The film points out rapidly-evolving urban centers nearby as people flock to these towns to start new lives. But for the people remaining in town, the old-timers fondly remember the happy days while the young people wonder what to do without being so bored. After all, downtown only consists of a diner, the pool hall, and an old-fashioned movie theater all owned by one man known as Sam the Lion.Something that really surprised me is how much of a factor sex plays in the film. Of course, sex is necessary in everyone's lives. But this film really pulls the strings with that sentence. People have sex with each other in the film because there is nothing else to do. They use sex as a way to get through their rather meaningless day. Except for a few cases, there is no sense of eroticism in the sexual activities. There is this one girl named Jacy who uses her looks to seduce every man in town and there is the relationship between our main character Sonny and the older wife of the local gym teacher, Ruth. After Sonny cheats on Ruth with Jacy, there is a very powerful scene between Ruth and Sonny (that involved chucking a coffee pot at Sonny's head) that shows the deep, real feelings that people did have. The feeling that love actually existed inside of these people.It's 1951 in this small, hapless town of Anarene, Texas. The only person who seems to enjoy life is Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson), a father figure of almost everyone in town. Life does not hold much of a future in this town for the younger generation. Two kids the film keeps an eye on are the co-captains of their terrible high school football team; Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane Jackson (Jeff Bridges). Sonny is more of the sensitive kind of person while Duane is a brash, outgoing man-but they happen to be best friends. Duane also happens to be dating the best-looking girl in town, Jacy (Cybill Shepherd), the daughter of an oil baron. Meanwhile, Sonny just broke up with his long-time girlfriend who only were together for the lack of anything to do. Jacy begins a pursuit on her mother's Lois (Ellen Burstyn) to find other men that could give her a future. Meanwhile, Sonny begins an affair with the older Ruth Popper (Cloris Leachman). These events show exactly how much of a future is left for the younger generation in Anarene.The film has a very strong cast, whom many would go on to have strong careers. There really is not a single standout because everyone gives an incredible performance each depicting their own sense of sadness. If I had to choose the best performance in the film, I would pick Cloris Leachman as the unhappy wife who begins an affair. That fore-mentioned scene in the argument with Sonny is very powerful. Ben Johnson would be a very close second as Sam the Lion. He's a stern man content with life in the town, but he understands the plight of the young ones. His scene where he takes Sonny out fishing and reminisces on his younger life concerning love actually brought a few tears to my eyes. There is Jeff Bridges, who gave a very steady performance and despite his young age, he already held a commanding presence on screen. Cybill Shepherd was an unrecognizable name at the time, but her sexual turn as Jacy opened up some eyes. Ellen Burstyn likewise as her mother.Also, I have to mention the cinematography, which was used in black-and-white. That gave to the overall realism of the movie. But it is the little things on camera that showed the emptiness of the town. Whether its the tumbleweed, the dust blowing the air, the sad faces of everyone, the broken-down cars, etc. Everything that was shot, in some shape or form, showed what life was in this town.Overall, The Last Picture Show is a bleak, sad movie that is nonetheless a very powerful feature that is masterfully directed by Peter Bogdanovich and brilliantly adapted to the screen by Bogdanovich as well. He gets powerful performances from everyone in the film, and that is a rare feat for a young director. It goes to show that growing up is not all golden and wonderful as some people struggle to live because of the area they reside in. This is surprisingly a very powerful film and one of my favorites from 1971.My Grade: A",The Last Picture Show
61,SmileysWorld,A classic in terms of cinematography and acting.,7,27 June 2009,"The striking element about The Last Picture Show is the fact that it is set in the 1950's,filmed in black and white to add emphasis to that fact,yet is given a heavy dose of realism that,by the early 1970's when it was filmed,was finally allowed in Hollywood.Though I had heard a lot of good things about the film over the years,I was surprised to find that it was much more sexually charged and graphic than I thought it would be.the film's best points are it's actors.Veteran heavyweight Ben Johnson gives what is regarded as his best performance here,and though I have not seen all of his work to date,it is definitely the best work I have seen from him so far.I have grown somewhat long in the tooth for watching films this sexually charged,but The Last Picture Show is a bona fide classic in terms of cinematography and the performances of it's actors,veteran and young alike.",The Last Picture Show
62,Angry_Arguer,Celluloid Waste,1,7 December 2003,"This is your only spoiler warning.  What a sad state of our cinema when unprofessional junk like this is considered ""Oscar worthy"".I divide material into three levels.  The first is the stage theatre.  Here the viewer is stagnant and the power rests in the presentation of the actor and, most importantly, in the power of the writer.  A good playwright is better than a good screenwriter because he or she knows the ways of words better.  The best playwrights know how to create imagery that the barren stage cannot show.The second level is film.  In this medium, a weaker writer can be used, but the viewer is not sitting in one spot the entire time.  With film, the context can take the qualities of visual poetry and meaning in addition to strong writing.  Furthermore, film can manipulate everday elements like sound and color in ways that are almost surreal.The final level is literature.  In this context, everything is imagined by the author, translated onto paper, and then re-imagined by the reader.  Far more detail can go into a novel than is conceivable for a film studio.This is why adaptations can go up, but never down.  Novelizations are never better than the base film (see the dime-per-dozen ones at your local book store), whereas the film cannot convey the same power as the original book (Catch-22 and LotR).  Movies can rarely be made into plays and plays can always be made into movies.As for 'The Last Picture Show', it fails.  It is a film that should stick to the stage because the director is too stupid to shoot anything right.  The characters talk the same and act the same, it's pure futility.  Add to that an obnoxious soundtrack and you have an entirely unwatchable film.I saw this in my high school drama class with about 20 other wannabe thespians.  The instructor raved about how sad the movie was.  What is sad is how such stagnant work is considered depressing when the material itself is hilarious.  Had this been in color the scenes of impotence, the pool party, and the old hooker would be considered great comedy.  Look what Lucas did with 'American Graffiti' a few years later.The American secondary education system needs to start teaching ABOUT film rather than trying to teach WITH film.  Two visually powerful downbeat films: Apocalypse Now and Barry Lyndon.  Rely on them, not this.  It's the 'Last' I want to see of it.  1 out of 5.",The Last Picture Show
63,gelman@attglobal.net,A Totemic Movie,8,28 November 2011,"Texas seems to have more little towns out in the middle of nowhere than any other state, and they've been a staple of movies, novels and country music for generations. ""The Last Picture Show"" -- both the novel by Larry McMurtry and the film directed by Peter Bugdanovich -- are landmarks of the genre: The stifling confines of local life contrasting with the vast open spaces beyond the town limits, the palpable desire of young people to escape, the social and sexual tensions. What makes ""The Last Picture Show"" so memorable is the stellar cast and Bugdanovich's skilled direction. In addition to the stars, Timothy Bottoms and Jeff Bridges, the cast includes Cybill Shepherd (in her first movie), Cloris Leachman, Ellen Burstyn and Eileen Brennan. All the major characters in the film are finely etched, people you really get to know and understand. Shepherd was 21 when ""The Last Picture Show"" was made, as beautiful as the sexy heart-breaker she portrays. She was a star from the first moment she appeared on the screen. Leachman, Burstyn and Brennan were at the height of their powers which were considerable. Bottoms and Bridges, high school buddies and townies, handled their roles convincingly. A lesser known actor, Ben Johnson, played Sam the Lion, owner of the local pool hall, the movie house and the burger joint -- and a very important figure in the film.Forty years later, it is still worth seeing.",The Last Picture Show
64,Pedro_H,Minor classic of black and white cinematography and patient cinema,8,25 May 2003,"In the rural Texas wasteland the last cinema is closing due to the rise of television.Nothing more than a nostalgic character study of nearly-grown people and dignified (if not always perfect) older people in an ""anywhere"" 1950's Small Town. From the screen time we are supposed to be more interested in the young rather than the old - which is the first of its flaws.It effects more than most by being ringing true and featuring a cast of likable - but as history has proved - dramatically limited newcomers. In this small world sex seems to play an extended role and is too much of a feature. Indeed I found myself asking ""what do these people really want besides sex?""Shepherd plays the town high school talent with a reasonable amount of gusto, but her part relies on her looks rather than her acting. While not an actress (characters are beyond her), she is always a pleasing personality on screen. An ex beauty queen that doesn't take herself too seriously.There is no real need for the nudity and besides, it cuts across the values of the times. Have you ever met a teenage girl who would take their clothes off in front of children (the staring boy doesn't even have pubic hair!) on a diving board? This is the 1950's for Christ sake!(One of the lesser support actresses is shown fully in the buff (point for period pubes!) and the lingering camera shows the Peter Bogdanovich could have directed Porky's in another life!)Hard to knock director, writer and performers for a success story and a film rightly getting over 8 on the IMDb ratings; but we are living in the land of small talents getting lucky. PB went on to make Paper Moon which builds on from what he learns here - but to call his career patching would be generous. Even returning to today's characters in the sequel Texasville - a really wretched film that tries to cover its piffling nature by claiming to be a comedy!There isn't enough lines or character development to know anyone all that well; especially the older cast member. Randy Quaid is hardly given any lines at all - presumably his hangdog face tells us all we need to know about him. Timmy Bottom (what a show biz name!) seems to be acting the role of the visiting poet and I have no idea what his intelligence level is. However he does set the downbeat tone.(I don't think the author does either - in the film sequel (set in 1985) he reappears as a wide-eyed cloud staring moron!)This film deserves its place in the IMDb all-time charts and I doubt time will drag it down. It is a film that moves people and it comes to a touching, although tragic, ending.",The Last Picture Show
65,RonellSowes,Dismal And Philosophical,8,13 September 2021,"Technically The Last Picture Show wasn't Peter Bogdanovich's debut film, but the sparse credits he had before this are so insignificant that it might as well be. Anyway, it makes a better story if this was a young director's first movie that he knocked out of the park. Even from an initial glance its apparent as to what this film is about, but Bogdanovich doesn't just leave it with a theme in mind, he uses every moment of the film to pursue it and by doing so constantly seems to reveal yet another layer to the film. However, I don't think Bogdanovich's vision would ever have been brought to fruition without the cast. The story lies in the heart of its characters, making them the heart of the story. The picture received two nominations in both the Supporting Actor and Actress categories, prevailing in both. Though snubbed in terms of awards, the finest performance may have come from the film's lead, Timothy Bottoms.If you're willing to commit to The Last Picture Show you'll find that its not seeking to entertain you in the conventional sense(not to say that it's boring which I dont believe it is)but expects you to appreciate it as art.",The Last Picture Show
66,barryrd,Gritty realism on the Texas plain,9,5 April 2007,"Peter Bogdanovich assembled a great cast of the up and coming generation for this film, made in the early 1970's. It is almost anti-Hollywood in its grim and gritty portrayal of life in a small Texan town. Ellen Burstyn, as one of the characters, points out that the place is flat and empty. The town is about to lose its movie theater. Time is moving on and this place is being left behind.The human element that Timothy Bottoms, the main character, brings to the film is the counterpoint to the melancholy of the film. More than another kid in a forgotten town, he rises above the others. His affair with his coach's wife, Cloris Leachman, gives her a new joy in life, albeit temporary. There is the bond with his buddy and rival, played by Jeff Bridges. Finally, there is his anger for another friend who lies dead on the street as the townsfolk stand around his dead body, making idle talk.This is a very sad film but one of the most human and touching of the films to come out of the 1970's.",The Last Picture Show
67,RJBurke1942,"Where, for all of us, love's illusions live and die.",9,13 February 2012,"This is a film about icons: small town America, Hollywood movies, the local cinema, country & western music, classic Cadillacs and Fords, and a graduation class in the town of Anarene, Texas, in 1951 (Anarene is the fictional name given to Archer City, the actual locale for this movie – and incidentally, where the shell of The Royal cinema still stands).The noise of WW2 has faded, it's now the second half of the 20th century and America is on the move – internationally and nationally. The world is changing, and the winds of changes are not limited to dust squalls only down Main Street, especially for two young high school students in their final year: Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane Jackson (Jeff Bridges).Like other small towns across the west, Anarene is dying – financially, culturally, socially and emotionally. Nothing much happens each day. Traffic is virtually non-existent; heck, there's not even a traffic light. Those who can, leave; those who can't – like Sonny, Duane and their school friends – must make do with whatever game in town there is...Which means they spend a lot of time in the pool hall and picture theater owned by Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) and the diner across Main Street run by Genevieve (Eileen Brennan). If not there, they're off sparking around town and maybe getting into trouble with the local prostitutes; or testing their mettle, so to speak, with their own girl friends, Duane's Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd) and Sonny's Charlene Duggs (Sharon Taggart).While Duane's difficulties center upon keeping all other males away from Jacy – she being the prettiest girl in town – Sonny and Charlene break up, thus allowing Sonny to innocently fall into a situation with a much older married woman, Ruth Popper (Cloris Leachman), and with the inevitable complications of such a lopsided affair. Hovering around them are Jacy's mother, Lois Farrow (Ellen Burstyn) and father, Gene Farrow (Robert Glenn); a local stud and serious womanizer, Abilene (Clu Gulager); Billy (Sam Bottoms), a mentally-challenged helper in Sam's pool hall; and Lester Marlow (Randy Quaid), who introduces Jacy to skinny-dipping at some rich dude's place, much to Duane's displeasure. How they all interact to resolve their emotional troubles forms the basis of the second and third acts.But the focal point is Sam, Sam the Lion, and you'll find out how he got that name when you see this movie. Everybody comes to the pool hall at some time, and all the kids go to the movies at The Royal, where Sam shows great movies from the 1930s and 1940s. Ben Johnson, better known for his many roles in westerns, deservedly won Best Supporting Actor as the serious, sage and sentimental ol' timer. Equally, Cloris Leachman won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her work as Ruth Popper.When I first saw this movie in 1972, I knew I had seen an American classic: picture perfect mise-en-scene, heart-breaking script, beautiful black and white photography that virtually puts you in that time and place, and a group of mostly young actors who acted and melded flawlessly under the direction of Peter Bogdanovich. Wisely, Bogdanovich avoided canned, moody music, allowing instead local radios, juke boxes etc to provide the perfect pitch of Hank Williams and other greats to keep this timeless illusion alive.Forty years after I saw it for the first time, I still think that TLPS is one of the finest American movies ever made.And just like the old saw says, they just don't make 'em like this any more.

68,Dan1863Sickles,Flawless Adaptation of A Classic McMurtry Novel,10,11 May 2018,"I love this film -- it has so much sadness, but there's nothing weak or self-pitying about any of the characters. They just carry on, even without a purpose in their lives. Larry McMurtry is a genius at taking stuff that would be unspeakably horrible if it weren't so funny, and then making it really funny. Peter Bogdanovich focuses more on the sadness than the laughter, but he also gets a glowing sensuality from Cybill Shepherd (as Jacy) and a warmth and humanity from Ben Johnson (as Sam the Lion) that are only hinted at in the book. One obvious issue no one else has mentioned is the irony that this book (and film) appeared long before the LONESOME DOVE mini-series, yet it deals with the Texas that rangers Call and McRae sacrificed so much to create. One of the themes of LONESEOME DOVE is Gus asking plaintively, ""was it worth it?""And of course, the answer is contained in this film. Because these characters are living such stunted, joyless lives that it seems very hard to believe that the buffalo, the Comanche, and the Mexicans all had to be sacrificed to make way for the town of Thalia. And more than that, you feel that somewhere Buffalo Hump and Kicking Wolf are actually laughing at these people. And that if a war party of ghost Comanche could come back and destroy the whole town it would be more of a mercy killing than anything else. And none of that makes the book itself any less poignant. Just the opposite, in fact.",The Last Picture Show

Peter Bogdanovich's character study of the different citizens of a small red-neck town in Texas is still a cinematic delight with solid writing and amazing performances. Timothy Bottoms gives his very best performance as the film's main character, while Ellen Burstyn, Jeff Bridges, Eileen Brennen, and a very young Randy Quaid are spectacular. Cybill Shepard does a decent job as the film's heart breaker, while Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman steal the entire show with their equally powerful and heart-wrenching performances. If you are looking for a film with good writing, masterful directing and incendiary acting, and don't mind a slow-paced flick, definitely add 'The Last Picture Show' to your to-rent list.

I was blown away! The film will never leave my memory because of the brilliance of the script as well as the brilliance of the actors. That brilliance was in no small part as a result of Peter Bogdanovich and the remarkable casting that he did for the entire collection of roles in the film. I am sitting here thinking about what would have happened to the film if even one of those roles failed to jell. But they didn't fail! It was a remarkable feat to, first of all, assemble the cast and then to get such tremendous acting out of them. And for the most part the actors were so young. All of these comments are the product of an older man-I wonder what my thoughts were 34 years ago? The morose feeling of the film; the palpable sense of decay and death were feelings I had in '72 and last night they were simply condensed into admiration for the movie totality that Bogdanovich assembled. The choice of black and white; the choice of locations and the superb screen production-all made for an unforgettable cinematic experience.Juxtaposing the extraordinary decrepitude of the setting with the youth of the actors made for a truly harrowing story. The nature of small town America as well as small town Australia is something that must be experienced to understand properly. I only found out that Larry McMurtry was responsible for the novel from which this script was taken as well as the contemporary screen play for this year's academy award nominated film, Brokeback Mountain, after watching the DVD last evening.

Cybil Sheppard was seductive in her debut (and you can tell that Peter Bogdanovich was in love with her), Cloris Leachman carries her scenes and is beautiful in her late 40's, Ellen Burstyn is hella sexy as Cybil Sheppard's slutty mom, and Eileen Brennan is great as the diner waitress and possible sex interest of Sonny.

72,bix171,Sublime,10,23 April 2002,"Peter Bogdonovich's great love of film, combined with Larry McMurtry's superior storytelling (he wrote the novel and both collaborated on the script), is in glorious evidence in this elegiac study of life in a small Texas town in the early Fifties. Bogdonovich pays a heartfelt tribute to the America of John Ford and Howard Hawks but the subject matter is contemporary, anguished, appropriate for the time in which it was made. Filmed by the great Robert Surtees in a flat black and white that perfectly evokes the bleakness of rural Texas life and peppered with a fine soundtrack of the popular country hits of the time, Bogdonovich creates a mise en scene understated and keenly observant of the details. It's also filled with McMurtry's trademark mix of humor and pathos. The cast (including Jeff Bridges, Timothy Bottoms, Cybill Shepherd, Ellen Burstyn and Cloris Leachman) is letter-perfect but it's Ben Johnson as Sam the Lion who gives the film its center: in an overwhelming (yet masterfully restrained) performance, Johnson unforgettably absorbs the town's despair, loneliness and regret; his short monologue about lost love is delivered with such deceptive simplicity that its power sneaks up on you unawares.

77,antagonist117,The women steal the show in a racier rehash of familiar themes,6,30 June 2013,"Aesthetically, this adaptation of Larry McMurtry's story about disaffected, sex-crazed teens could hardly have been less designed to appeal to that demographic when it came out in 1971. Set in a shriveled-up Texas town in the early 1950s, filmed in black and white with a soundtrack of Hank Williams songs, and featuring homages to old John Wayne and Spencer Tracy movies, there were few hints that the movie contained some of the raciest content possible in a mainstream release. Which is not to say that its content was entirely new or cutting-edge; the bleaker and more mature ""Hud"" (1963, also based on a McMurtry novel) had shown a boy's coming-of-age in a dysfunctional, dying Texas town, and the more fashionable ""The Graduate"" (1967) had depicted a multi-generational love affair involving a younger man and an older woman. What ""The Last Picture Show"" brings to its treatment of these themes is a larger, more diverse cast of characters who each embody a different facet of the community. Some are unsatisfying archetypes and ciphers, like Ben Johnson's ""Sam the Lion,"" and ""Billy,"" a mentally- disabled child. Most, though, are sufficiently complicated and believable, particularly the women played by Chloris Leachman, Ellen Burstyn, and Cybill Shepherd.

79,brefane,Admirable film.,7,12 July 2007,"This is the film that put Bogdanovich on the map, and it's probably his most notable film. The dead-end existence in a small town is well conveyed, and the film shows how sex is used as an escape and for a sense of connection. The sex in the film pointedly lacks eroticism, and the only couple that finds warmth and connection is Sonny(Timothy Bottoms) and Ruth(Cloris Leachman). Bottoms and Leachman are persuasive and moving, and the film belongs to them. Ellen Burstyn, Eileen Brennan, and Ben Johnson are fine but their characters are too often made to spout life's lessons. Shepherd in her first role looks right as Jacy, and Jeff Bridges is likable and convincing as Duane. Though I find the film a bit too drab, the film has integrity in its refusal to romanticize, and rightly avoids the glossiness of Peyton Place(57). However, not all of the characters or situations here are particularly interesting or adequately explored, and many of the townspeople seem to exist only when the principles are around. Jacy's father is barely glimpsed,and ditto Duane's mother and Sonny's father. Though many of the situations and types portrayed here are familiar from TV and film, The Last Picture Show is admirable in that its portrayal is without judgment or glamorization.

80,coop-16,The remembrance of things past.,10,24 April 1999,"One could say that this film was the most stunning debut of any American director since Orson Welles, however there is a problem with saying this, as The Last Picture Show was, in fact, Bogdanovich's SECOND film, after the chilling, but obscure B horror film, Targets. Having made that bow to pedantry, let me say something else. Rarely has any American director created a film as moving and as unforgettable as The Last Picture Show. Let me go even further and say that this is, in fact the film that The Magnificent Ambersons  COULD have been if RKO had not butchered it. Just as Ambersons is, in large part, a meditation on the changes wrought by the advent of the automobile, The Last Picture Show is a meditation on the changes wrought by the advent of  Television. In addition, it reflects on the death of the old, heroic west, symbolized by Sam the Lion, and the triumph of mediocrity and conformity. It is also one of the most moving accounts of adolescence ever put on the screen, surpassing almost any American film other than Rebel Without a Cause. Let me also commend the lustrous, black and white cinematography, the perfectly chosen score of classic pop and country songs, and the exquisitely  modulated acting. It goes beyond its dusty rural West Texas setting, and succeeds in reflecting the universal human condition. In short, it is more than a great film; it is a supremely moving work of art. One would have to be a space alien not to find it moving.",The Last Picture Show
81,Artimidor,Marking the end of an era with a milestone,9,3 January 2013,"If there ever was one movie capturing a certain place at a certain time, then it might very well be Peter Bogdanovic's ""The Last Picture Show"". It fulfills the function of a time capsule into times long gone like no other film. Where are we heading? To the fall of 1951, the date is the eve of the Korean war, and the place we plan to stay for a year is the small American town in Western Texas called Anarene. One might call ""The Last Picture Show"" a coming of age film, but this is true not only for the teens who are becoming men and women, but also for the adults who feel the weight of their past lives, their hopes and dreams and passed opportunities on them. It is the dawn of a new area. Times are achanging for everyone, economically, culturally, socially, in every respect. Things won't stay the way they have been, and it's inevitable.One of Bogdanovic's very first and best films, ""The Last Picture Show"" has become an iconic depiction of American small town life rarely achieved again in such perfection. Even the director's very own continuation of the story made twenty years later cannot even be compared to this cinematic highlight. The film's forte aside from the strong cast (Ben Johnson, Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges, Cybill Shepherd and others), lies in its melancholy, in sketching the shadows that linger below the surface, in the tragedies buried there, in lives they shape and form, along with the aspirations the characters have. All these things are shown without going over the top and thus turning the picture into a melodramatic, overly nostalgic or sentimental elegy. These elements are all there of course, but the emphasis is different - on the realism of it, which makes us sympathize with the people involved, lets us feel at home for a while. Until the moment arrives when the very last picture is shown in Anarene's local cinema, a moment where we might be overwhelmed by a feeling of loss we cannot quite explain. Time then to head back in our capsule, endowed with the indisputable knowledge that things will never be the same again. Fortunately - thanks to this film - you can always come back to pay a visit.",The Last Picture Show

Jacy eventually chooses Duane and Sonny then actually drifts into an affair with the lonely wife of his football coach (Cloris Leachman).Filmed in beautiful black and white, this movie evokes a period feeling and teenage sexual awakenings better than just about any film that came out of the 70's. Bogdanovich pulled rich performances from his cast with Bottoms giving a star-making performance as Sonny, Ben Johnson won a Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as Sam the Lion, the local businessman who pretty much runs the town and Leachman won supporting actress, though, personally, I think that award should have gone to Ellen Burstyn, who is just luminous as Jacy's mother.A beautiful and lovely drama that will entertain and haunt.",The Last Picture Show

I remember watching this one at a semi-art theaters in Birmingham, Michigan. And being a 22-year-old firebrand Randian libertarian at the time, I blithely pigeonholed the movie as ""naturalistic,"" which was close to ""behaviorism"" in Rand's basement of epithets.I must say—and just the other day has been my first true mature viewing of the film, having now some experience in the reviewing profession—very few aspects of the movie do not completely blow me away as esthetic qualities of the highest order.

86,robb_772,A milestone in film drama,10,30 April 2006,"Director Peter Bogdanovitch directed this harrowing adaptation of Larry McMurtry's novel of same name (McMurtry also penned the film's screenplay), THE LAST PICTURE SHOW has been unanimously cited by nearly all major critics as one of the undisputed milestone's of American cinema. Nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, the film is a gritty character study focusing on seven or so lead characters trying to find their true selves amongst the rigidity of the pretend idealism that ran rampant in the 1950s. Filmed in grainy back-and-white, with intentionally harsh contrast, Bogdanovitch never romanticizes nor judges his subjects. He simply allows views to enter their world, and share the pain, enjoyment, and frustration that they experience.The entire ensemble is terrific, especially supporting actor Oscar winners Cloris Leachman as the lonely wife of the homosexual high school basketball coach and Ben Johnson as the town patriarch known as ""Sam the lion."" Academy Award nominations were also deservedly handed out to Jeff Bridges and Ellen Burstyn (both of turn in some of the best work of their highly-acclaimed careers), and the non-nominated actors Cybill Shepherd, Eileen Brennan, and especially the heart-breaking Timothy Bottoms are also no less than brilliant. The entire cast, both major and minor players, weave their craft flawlessly in this searing motion picture that deftly exposes the tangle of hypocrisies, fear, and bitterness that often underlie extreme conservatism. Even when viewed with the highest of expectation, THE LAST PICTURE SHOW is one film ""classic"" that truly delivers everything it promises and more.",The Last Picture Show
87,StevenKeys,The Last Picture Show,10,5 July 2020,"It's like watching an old photograph come to life. Not just a great 70s Western and range-noir, but one of our great films, period.Though it wouldn't go over well today as audiences are much less sentimental, less searching than days past, Peter knew in 71 what Billy knew in 59 and convinced Marilyn of in Hot, that some scripts must be shot in B&W for full desired effect. That effect was an armload of Oscar nods, receipts and critical acclaim for both. The tale of a year in the lives of a small, fading Texas town that centers on two classmates and the knowing adults who shape their lives. Think of a dustier, more interesting Peyton Place.More best parts than the big bucket at Kentucky Fried Chicken. Scenes like Sonny standing in the deserted doorway of the pool hall, wind whipping through the emptiness; every shot Ruth is in; Sam's water-tank testament while Crawford listens like it's a voice from above, knowing he's in presence of greatness with no Super-Bowl rings in sight; the speechless cafe patron (Brown) standing over the boys in plumb digust after their football fiasco; the little girl rescued who almost gets left behind as they haul off the twisted teen and the old guys just keep jawing; Gen letting Sonny back into the cafe and Sam happily signing on and Peter's use of Howard Hawks' Red-River for the Royal finale as a nice closing touch. There are not enough digits on my hands and feet to recount all of the moments, human, humorous and heart-warming.Picture Show is peerless, with Oscar-caliber acts all around, including 1946 Miss America hopeful Cloris Leachman as Ruth-the-Wildcat (BSA-Oscar), Tim Bottoms starring as Sonny (Johnny-Got-His-Gun), Jeff Bridges his best friend (Fat-City Lebowski), Clu Gulager the town Don Juan (The-Tall-Man), Cybill Shepherd (Taxi-Driver) is the good girl with ""a cold cold heart,"" Ellen Burstyn is Jacy's ""smell good"" mom and Mr Farrow's bored wife, Lois (The-Exorcist Alice), Eileen Brennan is the femme swell café sage, Genevieve (The-Sting), Texas-native John Hillerman is the teach (Paper-Moon Chinatown), Jessie Fulton as Miss Mosey who does her best to keep the lights on (Royal) and real cowboy Ben Johnson as Sam-the-Lion who reminisces at the water-tank like he exhales rolled smokes, nice 'n easy (BSA-Oscar) (Shane The-Getaway Mighty-Joe-Young). The teens get top billing and perform like pros, but it's the grown-ups who bring this one home, their stories, their dreams turned to dust that'll strum your heart-cords.So, thank you Bogdanovich & Company, including author Larry McMurtry (book), Sal Mineo for pitching the paperback to Peter and his then wife, Polly Platt (The-Bad-News-Bears), Orson Welles who recommended black-&-white print, Columbia Cufflinks (Steve Friedman), BBS, Archer City (""Anarene""), the federal District Court which ruled the film not obscene (pool scene) and the grand State of Texas (4/4).",The Last Picture Show

90,ereinion,One of the saddest movies ever,10,2 March 2007,"""The Last Picture Show"" is Peter Bogdanovich's greatest work. What does that say about him? Well, he is a master of drama and a director that doesn't shy away from showing the whole picture, no matter how painful it can be. Thats what he does here. A period piece about loneliness and being trapped in a small desert town, it is at the same time a true picture of the 50's and what life was like back then. Timothy Bottoms and Jeff Bridges play Sonny and Duane, two boys on the verge of manhood who are stuck in a tiny Texas town of Anarene, dreaming about life outside of the dusty desert town while watching the picture shows. Sybill Shepherd in her big screen debut plays Jacey, the beautiful girlfriend of Duane who likes to play hard to get. Ben Johnson is their friend and mentor, an aging cowboy who talks about his only true love to Sonny and Duane and explains to them that even though it could be difficult to love her, she was still worth it.It is a strong candidate for the saddest, most depressing movie ever and the ending only strengthens that. Timothy Bottoms, practically unknown to me, gives a strong performance as a young boy/man who is left alone in a practically-deserted town after Duane, played equally well by Bridges, leaves for Korea and Jacey is taken away by her parents. Chloris Leachmann gives another strong performance as Sonny's unwanted but ultimately needed partner. The last scene was beyond words, I've never seen something so strong and poignant before. The cinematography adds a lot to the film despite it being in black and white. It all leaves a feeling of emptiness and despair, a feeling that was not uncommon in small towns in the 50's.",The Last Picture Show

Others merely escape to the world of the last cinema in town which is about to close down. The story incorporates the adults of the town as the high school graduates are forced to finally coexist with them on more than a student/teacher relationship. It usually ends in disparity. Found this at the school library. I liked this film a lot. I thought of this film as what George Lucas was trying to achieve through the kids in American Graffiti but without all the 60's pop music and muscle cars. Some people assimilate well, which is what American Graffiti is all about, but then there are some who screw it up, which is what The Last Picture Show is about.",The Last Picture Show

The performances of Ellen Burstyn, Ben Johnson, Cloris Leachman, Timothy Bottoms and Jeff Bridges are just flawless. Even Cybill Shepherd is very good. This is only Peter Bogdabovic second feature and he already knew how to stimulate his actors to get the best out of them - and then catch it on beautiful black & white film. Every shot is wonderfully composed and sometimes, I have to cry just by looking at it. When Miss Mosey announces to the boys that nobody wants to go the movies anymore, I normally can't stop it and cry until the end - for no particular reason actually: It's not just the sad things that happen towards the end, it's more the tone of the movie, its melancholy.That said, ""The Last Picture Show"" is one of the best American movies of the early 70's and definitely Bogdanovic's best.

94,Hotwok2013,Peter Bogdanovich's masterpiece.,10,6 May 2013,"Peter Bogdanovich's career as a movie-maker has had the misfortune to start brilliantly at a level there was no way he could possibly maintain. The only way was down &, unfortunately, it nose-dived spectacularly. The Last Picture Show & Paper Moon were two of the very best movies of the 70's, especially TLPS. Shot in black & white for dramatic effect it also enables the viewer to really believe it was filmed when it is set, circa 1950, in the small mid-west town of Anarene,Texas. It is a really brilliant character study of a dying community & their interaction. The two principal characters Sonny & Duane (Timothy Bottoms & Jeff Bridges) are on the edge of manhood & do what all late teenage boys do, play football, drink & chase girls.The only other recreations open to them are the local café, pool hall & cinema all owned by Sam (Ben Johnson) a somewhat dour but down-to- earth, honest, & decent man. When he dies & the picture house has to close it is a metaphor for the death of the community. The towns characters are often delineated by the use of Hank Williams country & western music which was contemporary with the films time setting. The local young, treacherous & selfish beauty Jacy (Cybil Shepherd) is dating Duane. ""Cold,Cold Heart"" is played in the background to her introduction. Another Hank Williams song, ""Why Don't You Love Me Like You Used To Do?"", is also used to imply a situation. Jacy's mother Lois is played by Ellen Burstyn. We learn later on in the film after Sam's death that as a young woman she had an affair with Sam & like him she is also a very down-to-earth type. She doesn't think much of the future prospects for the young man Duane her daughter Jacy has in tow & asks her bluntly, ""Have you slept with him"". Jacy tells her mother, ""Oh! Momma it's a sin before marriage isn't it"". Lois tells her, ""Don't be so mealy-mouthed. If you slept with him a couple of times you might find there isn't anything magical about him"". She ends the advice to her daughter by telling her, ""Remember beautiful everything gets tired If you do it often enough & if want to find out about monotony real quick, marry Duane"". Another of the movie's more interesting female characters is Geneveive (Eileen Brennan) who waitresses & runs the cafe owned by Sam. She too is a very down-to-earth, truthful, middle-aged lady with a somewhat world-weary manner. Sonny has an affair with a lonely older married woman Ruth Popper played by Chloris Leachman. Her husband is the local high school football coach but he has little time for his wife & their marriage has gone stale & loveless. Ruth Popper is also basically a good sort & when Sonny, inevitably, fails to show up one day you really do feel for her. Jacy (for her own selfish reasons) wants to lose her virginity & when Duane fails to do the business for her she decides to dump him. She then has a brief dalliance with Duane's best mate Sonny which causes an argument between them leading to Duane punching Sonny & breaking his jaw. Genevieve knows of Duane's violent streak & tells Sonny that he would be best off joining the army, which just before the movie's end he does. Sonny returns to Ruth Popper's house & in a very moving scene she vents her anger & frustration on him but takes him back because her life is so lonely & empty. To fully appreciate TLPS it simply must be seen.",The Last Picture Show
95,eddiez61,It's the Original that So Many Stole From,9,20 June 2010,"The Last Picture Show is the treasure chest of breakthrough cinematic style that so many top rank film makers would shamelessly loot in their personal quests for identity. Its sparse, barren ambiance and coincidentally occurring simultaneous story lines can be found nearly equaled in the lighter, frothier George Lucas classic ""American Graffiti"" just two years later in 1973. The setting of a restrictive, if not dying home town is unmistakable. The ingenious technique of incidental music was lifted intact and Lucas, bizarrely, is often credited as its originator. I was amused at the similarities I found in David Lynch's stunningly disturbing first feature, ""Eraserhead."" Its odd rhythms and anachronistic use of black and white are direct quotes of Bogdanovich's offbeat western. And more recently, speaking of offbeat westerns, PT Anderson's remarkable ""There Will be Blood"" owes more than a casual thanks to Peter. The curiously intimate yet somehow startlingly remote feel of all the relationships in both can not be mere coincidence. And, at the risk of sounding paranoid, or delusional, I even attribute much of Scorsese's towering triumph,""Raging Bull,"" directly to ""The Last Picture Show's"" gritty realism, natural character speak, and intentionally voyeuristic perspective. Marty merely substitutes extreme violence for Peter's awkward sexuality.And going the other way, TLPS bares its pedigree fairly openly, giving a big nod to such genre defining picts as 1963's ""Hud"", with its bitter disillusioned inhabitants, or 1956's John Wayne revenge classic ""The Searchers."" That one might be a stretch for some, but I found the iconic desolate imagery of Monument Valley echoed in the feeble but equally iconic profile of ancient, desiccated 1951's Anarene, Texas. It's a man made monument to slim chances and existential futility. This attribution is made sensible when you remember that TLPS's writer, Larry McMurtry, was a huge fan of John Ford, and ""The Searchers"" stands out as a particularly bleak example of his sublime talent.So, if you're fond of tracking lineages and progeny, ""The Last Picture Show"" is a rich vein that can be mined for a couple more generations. It's open, vague narrative style and coolly detached demeanor can serve as worthwhile instructions for so many of today's overly earnest, hyperactive, exceedingly self involved, absurdly myopic movie makers. There's always been a shortage of truly original vision in Hollywood - it gets immediately diluted and corrupted - so paying your respects to the few genuinely fine examples we have is no crime. More people should steal from this extraordinary film, if that's what it takes to achieve anything worth my time.",The Last Picture Show

How perfect this is. No grand farewell as the inspiring teacher rides into the sunlight, a la ""Mona Lisa Smile."" Jeff Bridges has gone into the Army, Cybill Shepherd has left town and Timothy Bottoms has nothing to do but take up with the coach's wife and hold the chains at the football games. Sam the Lion is dead already, and we don't even get to see him die, but we know he was the lost love of Shepherd's mother, as they rode their horses across the tank many years ago. If you can watch Ellen Burstyn recounting this to Bottoms and not get a chill, then I don't want you in my house. ""I'm the one who gave him the name, 'Sam the Lion."" The thought goes through the mind that perhaps Sam rode off to help Captain Brittles with a little scouting.

97,Supachewy,An Extremely Powerful Story About the Loss of Innocence,10,6 December 2010,"The drama The Last Picture Show is directed by Peter Bogdanovich and starred by Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges, and Cybill Shepherd. The film takes place the small town of Anarene, Texas during the 1950s.Sonny Crawford (Bottoms) and Duane Jackson (Bridges) live in the small Texas town of Anarene and are typical teenage boys. The film starts during their senior year of high school and both have girlfriends. The boys spend time at the local pool hall or going to the picture show with their girlfriends until Sonny loses his after the two basically got bored with each other. Duane's girlfriend Jacy (Shepherd) is the prettiest girl in town and at the start of the film she is a good girl but her mother (Burstyn) really wants her to break loose of Duane and explore the other men of the town. The film revolves around Sonny, Duane, and Jacy and how they experience sexuality in many ways from many suitors.Larry McMurtry and Peter Bogdanovich wrote one of the most spectacular screenplays of all time for this film. Never have I seen a film flow so brilliantly throughout and it does not have an ordinary structure of a film, it just continues through the characters' experiences. I find that the majority of great screenplays throughout history are character driven rather than plot driven because if you don't know and care about the character why should you care about the plot? The three lead roles in the film were so comprehensively built it was absolutely wonderful. I loved seeing when Sonny and his father had about a ten second conversation, in those ten seconds I was able to understand Sonny's entire family life. The theme of loss of innocence in this film was also absolutely wonderful, the screenplay was just terrific.Peter Bogdanovich's direction matched the brilliance of the screenplay that he co-wrote. There were hundreds of shots in this film that were so simply beautiful and were able to get me inside the characters mind and into a deeper level of the film. The scene with Jacy going to the naked pool party was wonderfully shot and will ironically be remembered. It just showed the curiosity of a young person trying to become an adult. Also I really loved the final scene of the film, but I will go into no detail in order to not spoil it for those who have not seen it. Sadly Bogdanovich has not directed another film as wonderful as this one.Not only did Bogdanovich write and direct a great film, he got two Oscar winning performances from his actors. One is not from Timothy Bottoms, but I thought he gave an amazing performance as an innocent young boy trying to become a man. Some of this best acting would have to be with Cloris Leachman when they are having an affair. His simple expressions are just magnificent in showing his confusion about the world that surrounds him. Jeff Bridges was nominated for an Oscar for playing a simple teenager on the outside but a boy longing for love on the inside. Definitely one of the best performances of his very successful career. Cybill Shepherd's character Jacy was definitely one of the most interesting characters in this film in how she wanted to experience pure lovemaking and bliss, and not end up like her mother. She was absolutely stunning, like the rest of the cast. Ben Johnson won the Oscar for his role as Sam the Lion. The scene in which he showed why he deserved to win was when his son came home with a bloody nose and he told the other boys to leave him alone as a tired old man who was done fighting. That was one of the most effective scenes in the film and will also always remain in my memory. Cloris Leachman won an Oscar as well for her performance as a woman who is depressed with her marriage and has an affair with the young Sonny Crawford. The weakness in her face while performing was just enchanting, everything about her was so real. This film definitely has one of the greatest ensemble performances of all time.The editing by Donn Cambern was spectacularly done, I really liked how the film was in black and white making the simple town even simpler. If this was in color I could not really see myself liking it as much and that is why this decision was extremely well executed. The film flowed seamlessly going from character to character. I was completely engaged the whole entire film and never was the rhythm broken. Many films with multiple stories don't work out well because the editing makes it like a break in the film and that takes you out of the film experience.I really loved the country music that was used throughout the film. It added another layer of simplicity to small town and the black and white appearance. Music is key to making a film flow like the editing and this film did it wonderfully letting the songs express the language of the film.Overall I give this film a 10/10. It is one of the greatest films of all time and is wonderful in every aspect of it. There is nothing I could say that is wrong with this film, I absolutely loved it. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys extremely powerful dramas about the loss of innocence because this is one of the greatest ever. Ever. Go see it right now.",The Last Picture Show

The film follows Larry McMurtry's novel almost word for word and the result is a sad b&w valentine to lost dreamers and the awkward, stumbling journey into adulthood.  Peter Bogdonovich keeps his camera in place -a trick that separates the 'men' from the 'boys'-  and captures some majestic skies and outstanding performances  (most notably Ellen Burstyn as Lois Farrow and Sam Johnson as Sam the Lion) leaving you with a feeling of slight devastation and meloncholia.

100,cormac_zoso,One of the best American films,10,2 July 2013,"There's little debate I think about just how good this film is. If you grew up in a small town especially this film hits chords you feel more and more as you get older. I took those walks into town and the local greasy spoon to hear all the 'experts' comments on why we'd lost or not won by enough. Plus with nothing to do. Mind-numbing small town malaise I suppose is what it's called.I'm not going to go through the entire movie as most everyone here has done that. But one character that I think of more often as I get old is Ben Johnson's portrayal of Sam The Lion.Honestly, I can't think of many other characters in American film history who have had more of an impact on me than Sam. Wise, low-key, and noticing everything and saying not much about it, he is an amazing character. You can see The Lion in him even at this late date in his life when we meet him, when he's swigging cough syrup to fight a hack though still rolling his own cigarettes. Still not a man you'd want to tussle with at all.The scene at the water hole when he takes Billy, the mute young boy he takes care of tho it's never explained why, and Sonny fishing is a scene that comes to my mind often. He expels enough of life's wisdom in that scene to last you a lifetime.Johnson was the perfect choice as he was a real cowboy in Oklahoma before lucking into a horse wrangling on a Howard Hughes movie and found that it paid a whole lot better than the real cowboying he'd been doing. So you knew he was tough as nails to start with but still a warm and welcoming man on any movie set from what I've read.Sam The Lion ... worth the price of admission alone.",The Last Picture Show

Demographics show that it appeals particularly to older male audiences.I didn't like the black-and-white cinematography. PARIS, TEXAS looks much better.

I'd seen bits of Picture show, but never watched from the opening shot of the abandoned movie theater to the closing shot of that selfsame theater - I think I avoided mainly just because I find Bogdanovich an insufferable filmmaker other than his first hurrah, Targets (in which he co-starred with Boris Karloff), another film framed by a movie theater (in that case a drive-in).Must admit Picture Show is a fairly brilliant work, and I didn't realize he did it in black and white at a time when 95 percent of new movies were in color. Nice way to pay homage to the fading world it depicted! Having all the music be heard via on screen players (radio, turntable, etc) was a nice touch, as well as a cool way to personalize a sound to fit each character's personality.Bogdanovich may be the most irritating twit in Hollywood (no small feat!), what with the stupid ascot and indoor shades, not to mention getting Playboy Playmate Dorothy Stratton killed by her husband by moving her into the bedroom of his Bogdanomansion, but I must confess he made at least two fantastic films: Targets and this one.",The Last Picture Show

Fifty years later, however, it merits a resounding ""meh.""It is a very dark tale, conveying the ennui and misery of small-town (very small town) Texas in the early 1950s. Everything is sex, sex, sex, and none of it good. The lead character has a sordid affair with a coach's forty-year-old mentally ill wife. An intellectually disabled teenager is forced into a pitiful encounter with an obese prostitute. A ravishing Cybil Sheppard seems to devour everything and everyone, and none of it is appealing. A minor character, for no apparent reason, tries to kidnap and molest a toddler. How's that for entertainment?But in the end, because it's so dark and lurid, this is one of those Hollywood sacred cows that will be worshipped for all eternity. It's worth viewing just to see these remarkable actors (Jeff Bridges, Timothy Bottoms, Cloris Leachman, and the stunning Cybil Sheppard among others) as they were 50 years ago, but don't buy into the hype. I'm sure this made heads explode in 1971, but unfortunately, there is nothing special about this movie.",The Last Picture Show

This is very little more than a black and white excuse to bore the hell out of the audience even as the egotist Bogdanavich (who did way better with TARGETS) gets ""great performances"" out of a ton of hams in their debuts. Lots of teenage sex clichés come out of this movie, such as Doing the Teacher's Wife, Impotence, Doing the Ugly Prostitute(which is very awkwardly shot and grinds things to a complete halt, not that things were really going anywhere anyway) and skinny dipping.I suppose this movie is supposed to be funny because of all the sex nonsense, to me, it was just annoying.

108,Carrzinho,50's setting but why shot in 50's style?,7,18 September 2019,"Unusually takes the route of filming its early 50's period piece by using black and white and indeed filming in a style more akin to the 50's.
The movie focuses on a dying town in the dust bowl of Texas. Our high school leads therein have nothing to do and little to keep them in this coming of age drama.
The film, because of its feel, kinda shocks with its overt sexuality. We are not used to seeing the seedier side of 50's life writ large across our screen. However, it is the sexually frustrated characters of the next generation up that prove most intriguing. There's more depth to Burstyns use of her sexuality as a desirable (albeit married) 40 year old or Leachmans repressed and feared urges of an unhappy and more staid housewife than the bumbling around of horny teenagers. Only Ben Johnson the owner of the local diner, picture house and pool bar can match the female characters depth, as he reminisces about how America has changed and how he has gotten older.
Cybill Shepard radiates any time she's on screen, as manipulative as she is beautiful, she's learned a trick or two from her mother (Burstyn) although still a work in progress.
Jeff Bridges doesn't really convince of the outstanding actor he will become and is outshone by Timothy Bottoms who's more thoughtful character and garners more of my attention.
The mundanity is well represented here so much so at times the movie labours. It could have found a better balance between it and the kitchen sink of deaths and affairs. I felt the 50's style of shooting held the movie back and while there was realism, it affected the impact of the events.
Still the characters themselves are compelling and you will be fascinated by this raw glimpse at anecdotally modern themes in a rarely visited and more vintage world. SEVEN",The Last Picture Show
109,daviddaphnered,Excellent nominee for Best Picture of the Year? Not quite,6,5 September 2016,"In this 1971 Columbia Pictures Peter Bogdanovich-directed screen version of the novel written by Larry McMurtry, I could not see enough reasons to justify it being nominated for any top award, though I will qualify that to an extent: Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges, Ben Johnson, Cloris Leachman, and the beautiful and drawing icon Cybil Shepherd were very capable in their individual roles. Also, an excellent job was done with the nostalgia effects, and since I entered the first grade in 1952-the year Jo Stafford's song ""You Belong to Me"" was one of the number one hits of the year-I did receive an adequate idea of what the early '50's was like in many ways, so I do think this was a great film from that standpoint.It was appropriate that the movie was filmed in black and white, for it indicated a basic fact about movies of that era: most movies were filmed in black and white, and thus there was a scarcity of movies filmed in color at that time. The story line was simple: a small Texas town is dying, and toward the end two boys go to the last picture playing in the local movie theatre.But where was the plot? There basically was none. Concomitantly, where was the substance? Young people go skinny-dipping and have their big fling at sex. The movie was something of a collage, since too many pieces (brief scenes representing different types of persons, different ideas being represented) were simply thrown together. There was no plot present. Therefore, for the Best Picture of the Year award it hardly qualified.",The Last Picture Show

I've been around small West Texas towns my whole life. This movie's depiction of small town Texas life is a very skewed version of reality.

With that one line, we are instantly filled with apprehension about the future, and nostalgia for the past.  The cinematography is reminiscent of Ford; the dialogue, which seems as if it might have been written the morning the scene was shot, is reminiscent of Hawks.

Slightly sentimental, slightly ""European,"" this movie about life in small-town Texas in the 1950s has excellent performances. Ellen Burstyn, Jeff Bridges, Cloris Leachman, Ben Johnson are all fine.Unfortunately, the story of Genevieve (an equally fine Eileen Brennan) the waitress, is not tied up. Why doesn't Sonny turn to her after the demise of his friend? And the sequence of the discovery of the body and the moving of the body is somehow awkward. The subsequent sequence of Sonny's attempt to leave town is made to be awkward as well.I don't really think of these criticisms as spoilers, since I have read them elsewhere.In spite of these flaws, the movie is very engaging and mournful. It ends on a hopeful note, which is a relief.The thing that jumped out at me the last time I saw this movie (on DVD) is Cloris Leachman's very vague suggestion that her husband might be homosexual.

From the salty small town bartender to the guy who brings his own pool cue to the bar to the men placing bets on the outcome of the high school football game. It presents a great snapshot of a '50's town with one main drag and characters who are on a treadmill to nowhere.A majority of the ""moral decay"" referenced in the film's synopsis deals with people getting naked and particularly with a May-December relationship between a high school boy and his gym teacher's comely wife. The main plot centers on a love triangle between a youthful Jeff Bridges, Timothy Bottoms and the lovely Cybill Shepherd, whose beauty is only slightly diminished by the rottenness of her character.The movie definitely has one of the top 5 deflowering scenes I have ever witnessed. It happens on a pool table with close shots of Shepherd lacing her fingers through two leather latticed pool pockets and kneading at them in the manner of a cat.The soundtrack ladles up a ton of Hank Williams, which is really pleasing, and the final 15 minutes feature some outrageously literary moments that are very fun to watch.",The Last Picture Show
115,uscoa,An Incredible Film,10,24 October 2000,"`The Last Picture Show' is a complex analysis of American values and institutions hiding under a simple guise. The film is about teenagers growing up in a rural Texas town during the 1950s, but `The Last Picture Show' is more than a dime-a-dozen coming of age tale. The film is more about life as the young characters face the decline of their small town at a time when security is a necessity. The sudden death of the town's most beloved citizen, Sam the Lion, strikes audience and character alike; due mostly to the passive energy of actor Ben Johnson. His death leads to a shift in morality in a town that leaned on him.The cast couldn't be better. New-comers Bottoms, Shepherd, and Bridges give the genuine performances that their roles demand while veterans Cloris Leachman and, especially, Ben Johnson give the performances of their careers.Director Bogdanovich's daring is a blessing to the story in which the actions of the characters must be earnestly portrayed despite the wolf-whistles that accompany the film's nude scenes by default. In Cybill Shepherd's controversial `stripping' scene at a nude pool party, one can see her hesitation and acknowledge the necessity of what she must do to conform. A lot of pluck from director and starlet alike contribute a great deal.Top-notch on all fronts, but avoid the sequel `Texasville' like the plague. 10/10 stars.",The Last Picture Show
116,barhound78,A film that gets even more spellbinding with each viewing.,10,13 January 2006,"""Disparate souls"" is such a perfect way to describe the multitude of characters in this film. They are people with the most genuine of human qualities and frailties, filled with frustrated ambition and world beaten regret. The town and way of life is dying around them and they are going down with it. Escape can come only through fighting and dying in Korea or through the luxury of inherited wealth.The central protagonist is Sonny (Timothy Bottom's), an awkward, sensitive adolescent who, resigned to life in this small town, embarks in an affair with an older woman (Cloris Leachman) in order to fulfil his sexual yearnings. In his spare time he hangs out with his reckless, roughneck best friend, Duane (Jeff Bridges) and a mute child (Sam Bottoms) at the local pool hall, burger bar and two bit picture show - all run by the grizzled heartbeat of the local community, Sam The Lion.As Sam, Ben Johnson puts in a magnificent performance. Wily and weather-beaten, he brings an over bearing physical and moral strength to the character. His monologue at the fishing tank as he talks of his past and of having no regrets is one of the most perfect moments of cinema. Beautifully framed, he evokes the great cowboys of the past. He is the eulogy of a dying age. It is Sam who is the spine of the film and the man who really binds all the other characters together.Coming between the two friends is Duane's spoilt girlfriend Jacy (Cybil Shepherd) who longs for sexual experience yet is at the same time frightened by her own sexuality. She turns to other men to fulfil her needs, including a wealthy dullard (Randy Quaid) and an older man. As frustrating as her character is, it is impossible not to feel sympathy for her as we realise that she is nothing more than a confused adolescent in the middle of a sexual awakening. Her mother (the magnificent Ellen Burstyn) see's much of herself in her daughter and tries to help her, yet she too is rendered powerless by her own boredom and regret.Bogdanovich's direction is faultless, being at once claustrophobic yet at the same time giving the characters time and space to develop their nuances. The stark black and white cinematography adds a beautiful elegiac atmosphere (not unlike The Misfits ten years previously) whilst picking up the dusty, decaying surroundings in which these decaying lives are being played out. His use of early 50's country music standards only adds to the sense of longing.A bleak and honest look at the underbelly of Americana and the dying American dream, the films foreboding outlook is tempered only by its wonderfully sympathetic characterisation, sexual eroticism and wit. The final scene of the film sums up the previous two hours perfectly... An emotional train wreck dulled by the soft hand of reconciliation, comfort and humanity. Beautiful.",The Last Picture Show
117,mido505,"Once a hack, always a hack.",3,7 January 2013,"I switched off Paper Moon. I didn't laugh once during What's Up Doc?. I abandoned The Last Picture Show around the time Sam the Lion croaked. Why bother?Has there ever been a more overrated director than Peter Bogdanovich? The above pictures are his acknowledged classics, films that swept both box office and Oscars in the early seventies, making Bogdanovich's name, and all three are tedious. Last Picture Show may be the most tedious all.Take away the wide-screen and Robert Surtees's competent but inexpressive b&w photography and Last Picture Show exhibits all the style of an ABC Movie of the Week, circa 1968. John Ford, Howard Hawks, or Orson Welles this is not. Bogdanovich has no sense of camera placement, blocking, or spacial dynamics within a shot, and his cutting wouldn't pass muster in a Hal Roach short circa 1921. Horrible ""big head of Pola"" reaction shots are cut into every scene for no apparent reason, other than to get Bogdanovich out of the master. Cybill Shepard's big strip scene at the pool party is a prime example of directorial ineptitude: Bogdanovich seems to have had one or two shots of Shepard, a couple of badly posed reaction shots of the nude skinny-dippers watching her remove her clothing, and a medium-close shot of Shepard fumbling with her bra clasp. This paltry footage is then cut together with no sense of drama, suspense, anticipation, eroticism, or any thing else for that matter, and goes on forever. I ended up laughing far harder at this sequence than at anything in What's Up Doc?. Hitch and Ford could get away with shooting cleanly, simply, and with little coverage because they knew what they were doing, and how to get maximum expressiveness out of minimal footage; Bogdanovich, clearly, does not.Most of the acting is good, and some of it is terrific: the Bottoms brothers, Ben Johnson, just about all of the women. Johnson, giving an excellent performance is, unfortunately, not helped by Bogdanovich and writer Larry McMurtry's penchant for hanging a figurative ""vote for me"" sign around his neck during his big dramatic ""scenes"", which had the effect of taking me right out of the movie.Cybill Shepard is, of course, a stump.There is lots of nudity and sex, but no eroticism; all the sex is bad sex, and bad bad sex at that. The sex scenes play like a virgin's idea of what bad teen sex would be like, if you understand my meaning. Typically, once he found success, Bogdanovich dumped his incredibly talented wife, Polly Platt, who later worked successfully with Robert Altman, James Brooks, Louis Malle and others, for the sublimely untalented Shepard. Fittingly, his career then nosedived after a string of cinematic atrocities such as Daisy Miller and At Long Last Love.

The townspeople are all quite down because the town has nothing left to it and its not exactly how it used to be. There were only two things that brought this town together, the football team and the movie theater. Sadly, the movie theater was closing and the football team was no longer any good. Timothy bottoms was in love with the girl who dated his bestfriend, so instead he started to become a thing for this basketball coaches wife. That didn't end up working out. In this movie no one can seem to find love or even leave the town. The young kids are trying to find who they are and what they want in life. The movie truly is sad and upsetting. It shows how life can be for people in a small town who struggle. I think there are definitely people out there who could relate to this movie.The acting in this movie is phenomenal.

I had heard about it through IMDB and was interested in seeing it. However, due to the fact that my local Family Video did not carry the film it drifted into the back of my mind. I joined Netflix last week and seized the opportunity to see this film. The Last Picture Show is a film about a small town in Texas in the 1950's. Anarene, Texas is desolate and on the verge of becoming a ghost town. The teenagers in the town only have movies to keep them entertained. However, since the theatre is closing there seems to be a lot less to do. Timothy Bottoms is Sonny Crawford, the innocent teenager who is given the town's poolhall and finds himself becoming a lifelong citizen of Anarene. Jeff Bridges is Duane Jackson, captain of the football team and dating the prettiest girl in town. Duane and Sonny are best friends and are both sick of the small town. Cybill Shepard makes her career debut as the beautiful Jacy Farrow. Jacy is the popular homecoming queen who is changing into the woman her mother has become. All the performances are great and really get the point across. This is a very character driven film and the lives of the characters are handled with care. As the story progresses through football and basketball seasons and then towards graduation the characters change. They make choices that effect their futures. Sonny is the main focus of the film as he goes through losing a mentor, having an affair with his coach's wife, and nearly distroying his friendship with Duane. You feel sorrow for Sonny as he ends one chapter of his life to begin another in the same place he was before. He is trapped in the town with no clear way of escaping. The script was adapted by Larry McMurtry and Peter Bogdanovich from a novel by the former. Bogdanovich also directed it. The direction in this film is as engrossing and interesting to watch as the story being told. All the shots, save for one, were filmed at eye-level which I think makes the film more personal and small.
Overall, I enjoyed the film. It was a well made character study that portrays the loneliness and boredom that surround the characters as they are confined to the small town. I rate it *** because it feels real in it's portrayal of small town life in the 50's.",The Last Picture Show

121,jmcsween90,Cinema Paradiso,9,7 July 2001,"Peter Bogdanovich's adaptation of Larry McMurty's novel is a beautifully crafted look at life in a Texan backwater town in the 1950s. Featuring the entangled lives and loves of a bunch of teenagers as they come of age, it was one of the first American films to examine the complexity of life in a small town without painting it in shades of a Norman Rockwell white picket fence utopia. The town, once a part of the stable old west is slowly slipping into a new age, and the last picture show of the title represents the end of an era when the town's picture theatre closes down and its former patrons venture off into a life of uncertainty.The film is slow but evenly paced, featuring a strong cast of unknowns, fledglings and established veterans. Timothy Bottoms and Jeff Bridges are Sonny and Dwayne, two boys who enjoy an elevated status in the town due to their positions on the high school football team. Cybil Shepherd plays a manipulative female who strives for amusement by playing all the boys in the town off each other. Cloris Leachman  who won an Oscar  gives a sterling performance as the neglected middle aged house wife of the basketball coach, who indulges in an affair with Sonny out of boredom and frustration. The character of Sam the Lion played by Ben Johnson (who also won an Oscar) represents the spirit of traditional western values. His death in the film symbolises the end of an era and the passing of a way of life.
In the true spirit of 70s film making, this film was mature, truthful and innovative, while at the same time it harboured a deep respect for the tradition of American cinema that preceded it. This film is a eulogy to the American Western that pays homage to John Ford's similarly styled The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence'. It examines a world that is caught in turmoil, where the defining values that once guided the people are disappearing and a lost generation is emerging. Bogdanovich and many of the cast members struck career peaks in this film, but sadly many of them were never to recapture that form again.",The Last Picture Show

The high-school senior Sonny lives the monotony and boredom of a desolate city, seemingly unimportant and without a future. The young man seeks sexual adventure, but his girlfriend is christian and observes the outdated doctrine, so she's not willing to premarital sex. The boy then shows attraction towards the girl of his best friend Duane (role that has consecrated the beginning of the career of Jeff Bridges), Jacy. At school, Sonny's coach asks him to go to his house to pick up his wife from a commission. The woman, named Ruth, is extremely sad, unsatisfied by the married life with her husband and suffers visibly, weeping and alluding to a betrayal by her husband. So, after some time, she finds a good lover in Sonny and the two start a relationship.
End of spoilers.Comment:Bogdanovich's first and perhaps greatest masterpiece, a movie that reflects an american period, conditioned by many hopes and dreams, difficult to reach by staying in a restricted reality like the one of Anarene. It's a place where everyone seems to yearn without succeeding or satisfying themselves: everyone wants to be at the center of attention and no one is happy with what he or she has (especially the lovers dimension) but, in parallel, no one behaves or does something with the requested commitment to achieve one's goals. In particular, it seems that no one really has ambitions: they all seek the mere social recognition by fulfilling their standards, depending on the situation, then transgressing them, even just to avoid monotony.
Sonny seems to be the only one who suffers, or still who feels emotions, for someone other than himself, contrary to the rest of the characters. The exception, in addition to the young man, is made by the owner of half the city, Sam ""the Lion"" (Ben Johnson), and his son, Billy, with obvious psychological and therefore social deficits.
The movie revolves around betrayal, opportunism and the desire for sexual adventure but it does it vehemently, using as means the transition from youth to adulthood. In addition the title (referred to the last projection at the movie house of Anarene, which is Red River by Howard Hawks, starring John Wayne), reflects a pessimistic view of contemporary cinema and has the will of affirming the cultural decay idea. The whole matter is accompanied by the hits of the time, played by tools such as jukeboxes or radios.

I squirmed in the ""famous"" skinny dipping scene because it is so over-the-top self-conscious. In the period in which the film is placed, skinny-dipping would have been the norm at any YMCA and co-ed nudity was probably not much of stretch in a small, backwater community. (Note to film makers: If you can't just let nudity happen naturally in a scene, then set the scene somewhere else! Don't distract us with coy posing to deliberately hide the parts you'll think we'll be embarrassed about). Bogdanovich tells the story of how he picked up the book ""The Last Picture Show"" read the liner notes then put it down thinking it sounded boring. He was correct and should have left it at that.

It is slow and boring, and I never developed any emotional connection with any of the characters. I simply did not care what happened to them. Everyone gets their moment when they speechify to a (usually younger) character about life, love and the meaning of the universe. I really hate that kind of ""set-speech"" moment.

Yes, it is a well written, well acted and a beautifully shot film, but I still don't know why this film found such a deep niche in my mind? I wasn't from a small Texas town, in fact I have only lived in big cities. I wasn't born in the 1940s or 1950s, but in the 1970s. And I sure as heck never went through what Tim Bottoms or Jeff Bridges characters did. Yet this movie has struck a cord in my heart and I think it is one that any fan of ""New Hollywood"" should see because it works as almost a precurser to the fall of that group of directors.The film itself looks so wonderful in an airy black and white feel that sweeps over you like a gust of wind in the dry Texas heat. The young characters (Bottoms, Bridges, Sheppard, Quaid) are so wide-eyed and dopey, that it's like they aren't acting. And the older characters (Johnson, Leachman, Burstyn) are so bitter and jaded that you resent them for getting old and letting the world beat them. There isn't a false moment in the film. The last few moments of the film are so gut wrenching and pained that it was a wonder that the sequel (""Texasville"") was so light-hearted and weak.There isn't much fanfare for this film outside of movie buffs and Bogdanovich fans, which really amazes me because I think it was the high water maker of the decade (peaked too soon, I suppose) and of Bogdanovich's career.

As everyone knows, the title refers to the closing of The Royal, the movie house in downtown Anarene. The location is becoming a ghost town as Mrs. Mosey, the theater's operator, reveals to best buddies Sonny & Duane her intention to shutter the place after one last unspooling of ""Red River."" It's the night before Duane goes off to fight in Korea.The deeper, subtler meaning of the title refers to the process of growing up mentally, which means seeing beyond Hollywood-fueled fantasies about what life is supposed to be in favor of clear-eyed visions of what is your own real life in actuality.At the center of the story is the trio of Sonny, Duane & Jacy, the girl. There's a late-blooming triangle of competition between the two boys seeking the love of Jacy, their (and everyone else's) dream girl in the flesh. Duane gives everything he's got to the winning of Jacy, whereas Sonny, who never expected to get his chance with her, finally does, but only after falling in love with Ruth Popper, the forty-year-old abandoned wife of the macho but gay high school physical education teacher.Jacy is the villain of the story because she's a very smart schemer who tries, almost diabolically, to realize in the flesh the dreamy scenarios that fill her head in the wake of countless trips to the matinée. Her real life is her enemy because it keeps refusing to conform itself to her Hollywood-laced mental picture of how things are supposed to be. She's the most beautiful girl in town and she's a seductress and yet, actually, she doesn't even like sex, that is, not real sex as sharply distinguished from what she's seen in the movies.Duane, a mostly good-natured guy with strength & athletic prowess, in accordance with the standard movie scenario, figures to be the best match for Jacy. Throughout most of the story, he's got a white-knuckle grip on this dream & his insane jealousy where Jacy's concerned turns him into a violent loose cannon who almost wrecks his bff connection to Sonny.Sonny cherishes the same sort of dreams that animate Jacy & Duane, except that his sharp mind makes him too observant of what's in front of him to be as completely enchanted (and distracted) as the other two. This openness to immediate reality over celluloid dreams delivers him into a real life love relationship with Ruth Popper, a good & vital woman who outperforms Jacy in every important category of womanhood.Picture Jacy & Duane facing the prospect of an unfashionable lover more than twenty years their senior. Neither would consider saying yes because the reality is too far removed from what they've seen on screen. Sonny almost makes the same mistake with Jacy until he sees that her marriage proposal was just a temporary movie scenario playing in her head. Awakened from the picture show in his head, Sonny returns to his lover in real life, Ruth Popper.",The Last Picture Show

131,dlaferriere,sam v sonny,7,23 February 2006,"In The Last Picture Show there is a striking resemblance between Sonny and Sam the Lion. Sonny is headed down the same path of life that Sam lived. When Sam dies and Sonny inherits the pool hall from Sam, he basically turns into Sam. Sam lead a pretty dull and lonesome life mostly because he was trapped in the town, and by giving Sonny the pool hall it causes Sonny to get trapped in the town too because he can't leave the pool hall. He tries to leave after Billy dies, but he can't he is trapped.When Sonny, Sam, and Billy go fishing Sam tells Sonny the story about his affair with Lois Farrow many years ago. He tells Sonny they were wild and they loved each other and it was his true love but it ended because she grew up. He also said that they used to come out to the 'tank' where they were fishing and swim (naked) and be crazy together. Sonny then lives this story out with Lois's daughter Jacy. He has a fling with her and they go out to the 'tank' and get a little crazy and then they decide they are going to get married, but Jacy changes her mind. She purposely leaves her parents a note so that they will find them and stop the marriage. She does this because she has grown up and doesn't want to have the fling anymore so now the affair between Sonny and Jacy is over the same way that Sam and Lois's affair ended. And much like Sam Sonny will probably never find another girl to really be with because the one he really wants got away. The movie begins with the empty town and the wind blowing through to show how really empty it is and then we see Sonny going to the pool hall and Sam is there. Sam has no one except for the kids that come visit him and play pool. He was wild in his day like Sonny because of the story he tells and because when Sonny and Duane go to Mexico you can tell Sam wants to go, but he has grown up and matured. When Sam dies Sonny starts to take his place and live his life. He inherits the pool hall, he takes care of Billy, he has the same affair, but most of all he matures and becomes lonely. Duane goes to Korea to fight and maybe never return, Billy dies, Jacy goes to college, and his affair with Ruth Popper ends. In the end when he goes and visits Ruth she tells him he has finally grown up so that shows he has matured and his wild days are over. He is going to live the same dull lonely life as Sam did. Then the film fades out the same as it started. The camera pans back out of the empty town and this shows that the story is repeating itself because Sonny has taken over Sam's life. Sonny will live to tell the same story that Sam did to a young man someday and he will live the same life as Sam did. The story could start over with Sonny as Sam's part and another young man as Sonny because of the fact that Sonny is living Sam's life. The ending is the same as the beginning.",The Last Picture Show
132,kwalsh2-1,Small Town Life,10,24 February 2006,"Peter Bogdanovich direction of small town life in the fifties is a reflective overview of the slowly dying community. As the people of the town move on to bigger cities or better opportunities, Bogdanovich shows what was left behind: a gas station with missing letters on its sign, people yearning for something more than the town can offer them, an old pool hall, a café with the ""regulars"" and a movie theatre forced into showing its last picture show as it declines in popularity with the population.Based on the novel, The Last Picture Show imagines life as it must have been at the Royal theatre. While the Western genre was alive, a small town in Texas could thrive, but as soon as that way of life dies out, the town goes with it. Bogdanovich displays this by matching the color schemes with the attitude of the place. The black and white cinematography captures the bleak atmosphere of the film. In the scene of Billy's death, a moment is caught in your mind as Sonny looks over to see tumbleweed floating by in the wind while a crowd of ignorant adults argue over the dead body. However, the true passing away of the Western comes with Sam's death. He was the thread of hope that this town offers something for rising generations, the diner and theatre. His entertainment drew in the teens, and kept them out of trouble. Without him around, the youths are forced to find amusement outside of the town.The slow movement within The Last Picture Show is presented in a true to life manner. Our lives are full of embarrassing, discontinuous episodes. Bogdanovich merely does what Andy Warhol once experimented with, the direction of life as it really appears to us. So while it may be slow moving, it expresses the same concerns that we face daily. How do we know if we will ever find that one person for us? Jacey offers a stereotypical high school girl caught up in the affairs of live and sexuality with confusion as the basis for her thoughts. She does not know what she wants in life, which is similar to the fact that we do not know for sure what we want in life until after we have found it. The affair that Leachman engages in as a 40-year-old further demonstrates the desperation that the people feel who are trapped within their lives with no way out. Ellen Burstyn dejectedly abandons all hope for love when she gave up Sam years ago, and we see the air let out of her life.The cast was outstanding in their performances, but especially Timothy Bottoms who played Sonny. His portrayal of a warm and fun loving adolescent on the verge of adulthood is endearing to his audience. His innocence, even in his guilt of an affair, is forgivable. There is a connection between him and the viewer that allows them to accept whatever he throws at them. All-in all the cast presents a memorable film to be enjoyed from all generations.",The Last Picture Show
133,gleebs75,Last man standing,9,23 February 2006,"Set in a fictional town in Texas, this film is full of imagery of the dying west and the way of classic American life that people in the small town had become so accustomed to. It opens with the shot of a run down movie theatre, then spans the length of the whole run down town, and ends up focusing on a young kid in a run down truck. The situation appears very grim and rather hopeless.The film focuses on the life of Sonny, the kid in the run down truck that we are introduced to in the opening. Sonny is a poor boy, who has been somewhat abandoned by his parents. He's friends with the other poor kids in the townDwayne, and Billy most notably. Billy is deaf, and a bit on the slow sidehe's Sam the Lion's son and Sonny has a real soft spot for him. Sam the Lion pretty much owns the town. We find Sam and Sonny to have a complex relationship, and one that will end up providing a circular theme for the film. Sam owns the town's pool hall, movie theatre, and café and is well-known and loved by everyone. What Sam says, goes, and we get this image of Sam as the kind of old cowboy ruling over the land. The town has a kind of old glory day feel about itthe teenagers go to the movies at night and kiss in the back rows, they make out in cars and all seem rather innocent in their naiveté. However, there are more secrets to the town than are made apparent at first and we realize that this town is far from the perfect image of the west that we have been accustomed to in films up to this point.For example, Sonny gets into a sexual relationship with his basketball coach's wife when she gets too sad for anything else to make her happy. Jacy, the town's classic blonde, ends up being very sexually confused and troubled due to the odd relationship between her and her drunken mother, who is having an affair. The town rich kids are all messed up, having naked pool parties and sleeping with one another. Basically, it's a town that is the result of a changing society with changing ideals. There are a number of times in the film, where the noise from a television is the only sound the audience hears. It seems as if television is part of the changing values of the townespecially after Sam the Lion dies. Once Sam dies, everything seems to take a turn for the worse. He leaves Sonny the pool hall and leaves the theatre in the hands of the old lady who had basically been running it before. Eventually, she needs to shut down the theatre, and even blames television as the reason why people don't want to go to the theatre anymore. Dwayne goes away to the army, he and Sonny get in a fight, and the preacher's son is even arrested for attempting to molest a little girl. It appears that with the death of the cowboy figure of the town, the whole town goes downhill, and at the same time, Sonny seems to be taking his place. He starts rolling cigarettes like Sam had, has his wild days with Jacy (coincidentally the daughter of Sam's old lover), runs the pool hall, and seems destined to simply follow in Sam's footsteps. The last scene, where Sonny returns to the house of his 40 year old lover, there is a loud laughter coming from the television. The conversation is serious, Mrs. Leachman is on the brink of nervous breakdown, Sonny has just witnessed the death of his friend Billy, Dwayne had just left for Korea, and Jacy was off at college. Sonny is the only one left, the last one standing. And the only sound of laughter coming from the sad house where Sonny is destined to spend the rest of his days with a married woman is coming from the television. The wild, wild west has been reduced to people in their houses wishing to be as happy as the people on the television. Instead, they have been doomed to live unfulfilling lives that will never live up to the standard of life in the old time western films in the closed down Royale theatre.",The Last Picture Show

The early 1970s produced ""real movies"" like this one, Bob Rafelson's ""The King of Marvin Gardens"", ""Five Easy Pieces"", ""Carnal Knowledge"".  They were heavy for their time, but if watched recently one wonders ""whatever were we & they thinking?""  They just don't hold up that well.  Still, the scene with Sybill Shepard emerging naked from the swimming pool still gets my heart pumping.  Ben Johnson's portrayal of Sam the Lion is among his best work.Are audiences are more jaded and find it harder to access the simpler life of west Texas?

135,FilmFanatic09,The Last Picture Show,7,1 December 2006,"Much like the black and white movies of the 40s and 50s that the characters of ""The Last Picture Show"" attend, the film itself is one of shadows and the ever-present contrast between light and dark. In this film about adolescent sexual awakening, it is only appropriate that the first sexual encounter in the film take place in a darkened movie theatre. It is a sad piece of irony that the teenagers of this dead-end town, seem not to care, or are oblivious to, the escapism movies can provide. Instead, they utilize the cinema as merely another alternative to the backseat. The characters here are so confined to their homes, they seem unaware of the bigger world out there, even in the context of motion pictures. One of them, Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd in her film debut), will escape off to college, so we later understand why she is the quickest to embrace more worldly pastimes, such as the film's now-notorious salacious pool party. If the film gets off to a slow start, we forgive it. Surely it is less tedious for the viewers than it is for the residents of the town, who have been forced to endure its monotony for the better part of most of their lives. Particularly saddening is Jacy's mother (Ellen Burstyn), a woman who allows herself to remain trapped by a failed romance and uses alcohol as her escape. It is Cloris Leachman, however, who gives the film's best performance as Ruth Popper, wife of the high school football coach. The resurgence of her sexuality, in the context of an illicit affair with high school athlete Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms), is in a way purer than any of the couplings of the film's adolescent characters. The most heart wrenching moment occurs in a quiet shot of Ruth alone on her bed, all dressed up, but sitting in the knowledge that her lover has abandoned her to become the latest conquest of high school vixen, Jacy. ""The Last Picture Show"" is one of those films where we care less about what happens, as opposed to how it happens. Very, very honestly is the manner in which events transpire here. Director Peter Bogdanovich skillfully avoids melodramatic elements that would have resulted in a Texas-set ""Peyton Place."" When the film ended, I felt at though not a great deal had really happened. Perhaps that's the point. In one sequence near the end of the film, while Sonny Crawford is watching an athletic practice at his former high school, an old man approaches and remarks on how much better the team has become since Sonny graduated. Sonny remarks that he graduated one year ago. He too, like us, knows that not much has changed in that year. Anarene is a town that time just happens to. It will always have its Sonny's and Jacy's. Only now, it won't have a picture show for them to go to on Friday nights. Does this really matter? They never seemed to watch it anyway.",The Last Picture Show
136,jcoolum,A Classic,7,23 February 2006,"Peter Bogdanovich's signature film, The Last Picture Show, which earned him an Academy Award nomination for directing, encompasses many different themes prevalent in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The film touches on many different subjects, such as the youth counterculture and friendship. The film follows the residents in the fictional small town of Anarene, Texas in the early 1950s. The main action revolves around Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and his best friend, Duane (Jeff Bridges). Right from the beginning of the film we realize that the town is small and there is no a lot to do. The kids hang out at the local pool hall ran by an enigmatic man called Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) and the local theater, which is also owned by Sam. We find out that Sonny, Duane, and their classmates are getting ready to graduate soon and each kid is having trouble deciding what they want to do after school.Duane goes out with the most popular girl in school, Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd), who enjoys the popularity she receives considerably. Things begin to change in the town for all the kids in town. The coach of the basketball team asks Sonny if he could drive his wife to the doctor's office. We see Ruth Popper (Cloris Leachman) as a very unhappy woman. Sonny notices this also and the two begin an affair. Meanwhile, Jacy tries to find a man to whom she can lose her virginity. It is apparent that she really does not want to be with Duane anymore after she ditches him on Christmas in order to go to a skinny-dipping party at another guy's house.All the characters, one way or another, want something more than what they have. Sonny wants a relationship, which he gets with Mrs. Popper, Duane wants his relationship with Jacy to last, and Jacy wants always to be the center of attention. The older characters in the story, Sam, the waitress at the local diner, Genevieve (Eileen Brennan), and Jacy's mother Lois (Ellen Burstyn), reminisce about how things used to be when they were younger and how much things have changed since then. Sonny's world is turned upside down when he learns that Sam has died. The boys always thought Sam to be a kind of mentor. Sam leaves his pool hall to Sonny, who continues to run it. After Duane leaves town, Sonny decides to break off his relationship with Mrs. Popper for a relationship with Jacy. Sonny even gets in a fight over Jacy with Duane when Duane returns. This results in Sonny being injured. Sonny even marries Jacy when she asks him. The marriage does not last long though and we soon find out that Jacy only married Sonny to get attention.In the end, Jacy leaves to go to college, Duane decides to go into the service to fight in Korea, and the last local business, the movie theater, shuts down. Duane, Sonny, and their friend Billy (Sam Bottoms) watch the very last showing of the very last movie shown at the theater, Red River (1948), a John Wayne Western. At the end of the film, Billy is killed when a truck hits him. Billy was a deaf mute, which is why he never heard the truck coming. Sonny is very distraught because everyone around him has either left, like Duane and Jacy, or died, like Sam and Billy. Sonny gets in his truck and drives away from town. It seems as though he might leave but then he turns around and drives back to town. He goes to see Mrs. Popper, who seems to be the only constant in Sonny's life. First, she rejects him, but eventually decides to forgive him and comfort him.This film seems to have all the themes of the movies of the time. It has the rebellious counterculture theme that was so prevalent in films such as Bonnie and Clyde (1967) and Easy Rider (1969). It also contains the affair theme also found in The Graduate (1967) by showing Sonny's affair with Mrs. Popper. It has the theme of friendship also found in Easy Rider and Midnight Cowboy (1969). The film also contains the theme of alienation, which pertains to all the aforementioned films. In the end, Sonny is left alone. The only person he has left is Mrs. Popper and his relationship with her is not stable nor is it moral.The Last Picture Show is a film about changes and how people react to those changes. The town changes so much throughout the movie as do the characters. Sonny does not react to change well at all. He seems very devastated when Sam dies, and he is even more devastated when Billy dies. He does not want Duane to leave and he even marries Jacy in order to keep something constant in his life. The only thing that seems constant to Sonny is his relationship with Mrs. Popper. When things get bad, he goes to her. The film is also about the death of the old west. The last film at the theater shown is a John Wayne western, which signals the end of that fictitious and glorified way of life. The film also deals a lot with nostalgia. Most of the characters have feelings of nostalgia. Duane wanted to keep Jacy and marry her, Jacy wanted to stay the center of attention, and Sam wanted to be young again. All of these characters come to terms with the changes occurring in their life while Sonny does not. When he gets scared, he runs to Mrs. Popper for comfort. The film is very interesting and well worth watching. It has interesting and unique characters, which the actors portray well. Just as the Greek philosopher Heraclitus said, ""There is nothing permanent except change."" This quote seems to describe the central issues in The Last Picture Show to a tee.",The Last Picture Show
137,tpion,"Sonny and ""Mrs. Robinson""",8,27 February 2006,"The Last Picture Show was filmed in 1971 and was directed by Peter Bogdanovich. The movie takes play in a tiny town called Anarene, Texas and takes place between World War 2 and the Korean conflict. Sonny Crawford who is played by Timothy Bottoms is the main character and his best friend Duane Jackson played by actor Jeff Bridges go through the small town as teenagers and go through the ups and downs of normal teenage lives. The two boys played on the local high school team and were the talk of the town, only in the bad sense. Throughout the movie we saw many of the old timers stop the boys and harass them about how bad they were doing. We see when Duane and Sonny are throwing the bag of quarters around the street like their playing football. Then they get stopped in front of a few of these older guys who make fun and poke jokes at them, saying they could catch but couldn't throw a block to save their life.We see Sonny as a young adult struggling to find what he is really looking for, which right now seems to be either love or lust. His coach told him if he drove his wife to the clinic that Sonny could get out of school for a little bit. He ends up by taking her and she offers him back in for a soda. She breaks down right in front of the boy and he is taking back by her emotions and isn't sure what to do. From the start we can see these two people have a physical attraction towards one another. Sonny finds out from her that she isn't really seeing the coach anymore. When this is found out Sonny and her start to have an affair with one another. Each week when Sonny was suppose to be driving her to the clinic, he was actually going over there to make love instead. It reminded me a little of Mrs. Robinson in the move The Graduate. The older more mature woman somewhat takes advantage of the young naive boy.",The Last Picture Show
138,rhall-14,"3,2,1",6,24 February 2006,"A film that came out in the early 1970's, Peter Bogdanovich's The Last Picture Show is a far different movie than the other films we have studied in this course. It is a film set in a different time period, but instead of being a time of excitement, it is a time of confusion between the Second World War and the Korean War. Bogdanovich shows us the small town of Anarene in Texas, and in particular the fragile lives of some of the younger people who live there. It is true that this movie contains no big car chases, no murders, and no truly exciting scenes. However, through the realistic portrayal of these mundane lives by the director and cast, the viewer can see how awkward things can be in a small American town during a time in history that has been disregarded.The film mainly focuses on the character of Sonny, and his interactions with the characters of Duane, Jacy, Sam the Lion and Ruth. All of these characters help us to realize what life is like in a small town, and what it is like to be unsure of one's future. Right away we can get a glimpse of a typical night for these teenagers, as Sonny meets his girlfriend at the picture show, where most people his age go on weekend nights. Sonny, who has been ""going steady"" with this girl for a year, forgets their anniversary, and then, after getting rejected in the front seat of his car, breaks up with her. This is our first sign that Sonny is tired of the typical life he leads and is interested in a change.Then, Sonny is given a new opportunity for change, as the wife of his football coach, Ruth, throws herself at him. They begin to have an affair that lasts for some time, and it appears as if Sonny has realized that the future he wants is with Ruth in Anarene. As their affair continues, Sonny's best friend Duane gets dumped by his long time girlfriend Jacy. His world is turned upside down by this, as he believed that Jacy was his future. Jacy is changed as she begins to look for a new future husband, and considering the possibility of going to college to get away from her small town life.As all this is going on, Sonny's mentor and friend Sam the Lion passes away while he and Duane are in Mexico for the weekend. Sam leaves Sonny his old pool hall in his will, and suddenly, Sonny's future seems totally mapped out. He'll stay in town, work at the pool hall, continue his affair with Ruth, and look after Sam's son Billy. However, Jacy, still looking for her future husband, moves Sonny's interests away from Ruth toward her.In the end, Sonny and Duane have a fight over Jacy, and ultimately make up before Duane is shipped out to Korea. Jacy goes off to college in Dallas, and Sonny goes back to Ruth, realizing that he is going to be living in Anarene the rest of his life, and he has to get to used to his mundane life. The film ends in confusion.In general, the Last Picture Show is a film that is difficult to look at in sections. The best way to understand and realize the greatness of this film is to take it as a whole, and look at the film for what it shows. Despite being set in a small town, during a forgotten time, the people who live there are real people, with real emotions and real hearts, and their lives, although not as exciting as others, can still be moving and empowering.",The Last Picture Show

Was stationed in Texas and the scenes looked perfect for the area, still towns that look exactly like that.

I think it's the single greatest ""Telling Him Off"" scene in film.  I am absolutely spellbound by her work.  In this final scene, she completely is this woman in the dingy bathrobe, with the uncombed hair and unkempt house. But the appearance is only the icing.  The true strength of the performance comes from the words.  Her voice is at first passive and compliant, but after a moment of awkward politeness, the coffee cup shakes in her hand, and She unleashes this woman's anger, hurt, frustration, and sadness not only for her failed affair with the young Timothy Bottoms, but for all the years of whatever disappointments she has known in this dying Texas town.  The anger passes to calm and a resolution of sorts between herself and Bottoms develops, and she gently takes his hand.  Just moments after unleashing her pent-up fury, she has again become a sort of surrogate mother to this messed up boy.  Leachman seamlessly careens through a scale of emotions, culminating in one of the most deserved Oscar wins of all time.

141,rogus2006,Historically Funny,9,27 June 2020,"Director / Writer, Peter Bogdanovich nailed ""location as a character"" with the timeless theme of teen and grown-up angst in a dried-up dust bowl of a town in Texas, that has a unique charm of its own. Larry McMurtry's original book with the same title was destined to become this film. And it makes sense it would be shot in black and white to provide the depth of the characters and town, coupled with Bogdanovich's close ties to John Ford and Orson Wells, masters of black and white film.
The isolated charm of Archer City is shattered by the main characters' desires you feel in your gut. Dwayne's desire to go steady with Jaycee is overshadowed by Jaycee's path to explore her sexuality with a variety of partners and not just Dwayne, who either has no clue or will not admit the truth. As a result, Dwayne's loneliness is as desolate as the town. In a moment of frustration, Dwayne and Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) escape to Texas for the weekend and tell Sam the Lion with no shame (played by Ben Johnson, who said ""I can't do this picture Peter, there's too many damn lines"" and won the Oscar for his performance in this film). Here there is a pivotal moment of silence between these three characters, which portends Dwayne and Sonny's return to the silent deserted town that will now never be the same and mirrors the new hole in their lives. Sam the Lion has a big heart and protects those who need extra care. I fell in love with Johnson and his character, and as a screenwriter, strive to write characters as complex Sam.
Jeff Bridges plays Dwayne and Cybill Shepherd is Jaycee. Shepherd has a few nude-scenes she does alone with the extras edited in later, according to Bogdanovich and TCM's Ben Mankiewicz in The Plot Thickens podcast. The pool scene serves to bring a cast of characters together to escape the monotony of their deserted lives and life in the desert. Another character worth mentioning is Ruth Popper, played by Cloris Leachman who also won the Oscar for this film. Ruth has a guilt-free love affair with Sonny, who is a generation younger than her when her coach ""significant other"" pays little to no attention to her. The relationship between Ruth and her husband is as bleak as the town and the squeaky door to the pool hall, with an underlying reason subtly suggested, literally left in the dust when movie producers and audiences were forbidden to accept or explore (according to Bogdanovich interviews).
Other important characters include the lovable baseball-capped Billy (Sam Bottoms, Tim's brother in real life), Jaycee's mother (Ellen Burstyn), and Genevieve the waitress (Eileen Brennan). The main characters, like the desert, have no shame - the zeitgeist of the 1960s. I will not give away the ending but I will say, the desert wins.

142,Runinrider,Excellent Film; A definitive highlight of the memorable decade,9,20 June 2004,"1971 was a hell of a memorable year in film. William Friedkin re-invented action films with ""The French Connection"" (the film's car chase still remembered), and controversial films from Sam Peckinpah's ""Straw Dogs"" to Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" broke all the rules. It is fitting to start then, by saying that the year was one for the young directors. After all, this was the year that Coppola began work on ""The Godfather"", Friedkin won his Oscar, and Bogdanovich broke out with his masterpiece, ""The Last Picture Show"".Had he not had the freedom to make such a film, director Peter Bogdanovich would never have set out to make such a film based on a novel written in the 60's. The film itself barely escaped with a ""normal"" rating. After all the scene in the pool showed much more then the rape scene in ""Straw Dogs"", but it was all done with such a happy demeanor, nothing in here ever goes as far as to break the rules despite the nudity and colorful language.The film, written by Larry McMurty (who also wrote the novel), stars Timothy Bottoms as Sonny and Jeff Bridges as Duane. Both live in a dying town near Texas, and their lives are vividly shown as they survive through broken relationships and the death of a good friend. Both actors give amazing performances, and they are helped by an outstanding supporting cast that includes Cybill Shepherd, Ben Johnson, and Ellen Burnstyn.I really can't say anything more other then the fact that you should definitely watch this.

Not much goes on there so the young and young at heart are obsessed with sex.Cybill Shepherd is the prettiest girl in town, manipulative and an opportunist, but she desires more despite being limited by her lack of passion. She finally gets deflowered by the town stud and who is also her mother's occasional lover and he turns out to be as passionless as she is. Jeff Bridges is the future town stud if survives Korea. Tim Bottoms is the dependable kid the coach sends to his lonely wife (Cloris Leachman) who seduces him and fears that he will outgrow her. Ben Johnson is the mentor to the boys and has a past with Ellen Burstyn, Sheppard's mother. His death signals the end.Filmed in glorious B & W the dusty streets are a metaphor that the town needs to modernize besides paving the streets.

I really enjoy good character films, but I really just couldn't identify with the characters in this one. I'm not sure exactly what you're supposed to take out of it at the end. There just aren't any characters that I would consider compelling and the story just sort of meanders on without going anywhere or picking up any steam. It could just be that this represents another time/place that I can't identify with, but let me tell you that if you're looking for another Paper Moon (which the rating would have you believe), this isn't it.

145,rcy_filmtex,Genuine Texas.,10,9 July 2006,"I have read several of the blogs on this site knocking THE LAST PICTURE SHOW for various reasons, acting, plotting etc., and it is, as all movies, with flaws, but having been born 18 miles south of Archer City in Olney, Young County,where some of the scenes from the movie were filmed, and having grown up in the county seat of Young County, Graham, I have an appreciation for the movie that other people, especially non-Texans might not have. There have been hundreds of movies made about Texas and Texans and some of them have been filmed in Texas with Texas actors and none of them have captured the true feeling and soul of Texas as TLPS was able to do. The story first was based on an excellent book by Larry McMurtry and brought to the screen through the insight of Peter Bogdanovich. McMurtry's book, LONESOME DOVE, is in my opinion, the Great American Novel, but it's transition to the screen is nothing more than a three-star oat-burner. However, TLPS rises above all that, again in my mind, because having come of age just 10 years after the time of this story I knew all the people and incidents played in the movie. Not literally, but figuratively because the country, ranching and oil field people of rural Texas had not changed whether they were in Archer City or Olney or Graham or most anywhere in Texas save the foreign cities of say, Houston, El Paso, Dallas or San Antonio which are basically Third-World mini-countries plopped unfortunately down on Texas soil.I digress, my connection with the story begins with my childhood best friend, Charles Graham, who's grandfather, Charlie Graham, founded the now ghost town of Anarene, just south of Archer City, and according to Charles and his father, Hap Graham, old Charlie Graham named the town after his wife, Anna, and his favorite horse, Reno. The town boomed in the early days of the 20th Century with a train station, hotel, post office and oil refinery. The Grahams owned a large ranch in the vicinity of Anarene that was also established by old Charlie Graham. In the summertime and on spring and fall breaks and when ever we were needed, we cowboyed all over that country.Being teenagers who drank, and with spirits available in Archer County, that is where Charlie and I chased girls. When the movie came out, I could almost see Charles and myself as Duane and Sonny. The scene where they arrive back in town and the night watchman's car is parked in front of the courthouse with the night watchman asleep in the front seat with his feet sticking out the driver's window is authentic. I have seen that myself.Sam the Lion's Poolhall, I played pool in there, and the old men sitting around the corner gas station, I knew them. That is where we had flats on the pickups and horse trailers fixed.The tank where Ben Johnson as Sam the Lion gave his Oscar winning speech was a place where we swam on hot days. I could go on, but it would fill a book. One other mention I would like to make is had I not missed a telephone call, I would have been one of the nude swimmers in the Jacy pool stripping scene and I might have had a more enriching movie career than the middling non-career I had. I have learned in my life that country people be they in Texas, Iowa, Ohio or where ever are real people and not the hicks and rubes as they are so often portrayed in the movies. I will always be proud that TLPS portrayed Texans as people and not as cretins who are nothing but fodder for ridicule.",The Last Picture Show

This movie may have been extreme for it's time, (there is a little nudity, and wife swapping) but viewed today, this film is just dated.Cybull shipyard is terrible in this movie. Timothy bottoms career died after being in this movie.Larry mcmurkys writing is absolutely awful. does he drop acid before he writes? A small town in Texas in 1951, and the local teen-agers are having a nude pool party! Just take a look at the actual bathing suits people of the era are wearing. No one was showing any skin back then.And as for this movie having so many deep meanings and images, you people must be on crack! Ass Crack that is!Mcmurky doesn't have enough sense to do anything deep and meaningful. He writes western soap operas. and he's not very good at that either. Bigdogovitch may be an OK director, but he also doesn't have the intellect to do a deep piece. Any meanings or images that come out of this movie are accidental and totally inconsequential.This is just another movie that blinded everyone when it first came out. However, on further examination over the years, the story and the acting gusts falls to pieces.By the way, What's with all the starring that's going on in this movie? Did they have some extra film they had to use up and thought that starring at each other would be a good filler? The head shots are just as dated. who shoots that way? why Is bigdogovitch trying to draw our attention to the person in the head shot? They really don't have anything to say to advance the plot. The timing of the shots was also off. jumping from season to season without any notice or visual clues just leaves us wondering if the director was smoking the Jamacan Ganja man!On the stinky scale: I give it four unflushed terds.

Wow, she ended up both devious, yet intelligent. Not a villain, though definitely antagonistic. Pops to Shepherd. I loved Sonny, i think he was the best male character. Timothy Bottoms's performance was great, even though he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. I found his character always redeeming himself, truly a panorama of human emotion-much like the movie itself. Duane was also like-able, but much more small town than Sonny.Cloris Leachman's performance was beautiful, just tragic, and credible.

158,quigley-5,Possibly the best film ever made,10,13 June 2000,"Is this really the best film ever made?  In an artistic sense, does it advance the language of cinema?  Well, perhaps not as much as some other films have, but it did have a style of its own.  Some of the shots are simply marvelous, truly expressive without resorting to hammer and tongs. And the cinematography matches the subject beautifully.  While it's not Citizen Kane or Breathless, it certainly makes a contribution far above and beyond the call.What makes this movie great is its story--rarely has narrative film achieved such grandeur on a scale that is so small.  The Bicycle Thief is an apt comparison as far as squeezing so much story out of so little material. What could be so interesting about a bunch of hicks in a dusty, backwards Texas dot-on-the-map?  And yet the story is immense.  Comedy, tragedy, romance, desperation, treachery, love, death, infidelity, ennui, abandonment--it's all there, and portrayed with the loving caress absent in so much narrative film.Now, the power of the narrative certainly exists in the novel, but the actors and the director take the story to heart and lift it above mere words and into the sublime.  Everyone is note-for-note perfect in their acting. Everyone!  But Cloris Leachman--I don't know that I've ever been more blown away by a performance than by what Cloris Leachman achieves here.  I have no words that would do her justice--it's not even worth trying.  I guess all I can say is that repeated viewings have not dimmed the power of what she creates.  She still rocks me back on my heels.The art, the story, the apex standard of performance--it all comes together in this film.  Other movies may outclass The Last Picture Show in one area or another, but I haven't seen one that combines these elements with such gentle, overwhelming power.  I'm not absolutely convinced, but until I'm show otherwise, I have to consider The Last Picture Show as the best of what cinema has to offer.",The Last Picture Show
159,johnparris,Like Cybil,8,2 April 2012,"If you have ever lived in a small town or if you grew up in the American heartland in the 1950s, this movie will evoke overwhelming nostalgia. But the story is so powerfully told that I think that for everyone it will evoke nostalgia for a time and place, even for that which they may never have known.The town, as well as the movie, is held together by Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) who owns the movie theater, the café, and the pool hall. In fact he owns just about everything there is to do in Anarene, except for watching the hapless Anarene High football team ... and sex. It is no wonder then that sex, in its many faceted varieties, plays a big role in this town, and in this movie.There are so many wonderful and memorable scenes that it would simply require a small volume to recount them. One scene that grabbed me was when Sam and Sonny are at a lake outside of town, ostensibly fishing, and Sam reminiscences about old times, about when he came to the lake twenty years earlier with a lover. Sam makes the comment, ""You wouldn't believe how this land has changed."" The camera pans the surroundings and it is hard to see how this area could have changed much in the last thousand years, but Sam is clearly attuned to the subtle changes, since memories were impressed on him in a time of strong emotion. We all have clear memories from when and where we have been happy, even if it is a small lake in a desolate flat land. And Sam's specific comment can be taken to apply more generally to the basic theme of the movie. This incredible scene ends with Sam's saying, ""Being a decrepit old bag of bones, that's what's ridiculous,"" and anyone who is not close to tears at that point will never truly appreciate the beauty of this movie.",The Last Picture Show

It is definitely the incredible character performances which were amply rewarded come Oscar time that elevate this bittersweet Texan melodrama to its heights. Very satisfying and surprisingly sexy for its day and even today I don't see how any film lover could resist it. The female talent trio of sleazy Eileen Brennen, Cloris Leachman and the always incredible Ellen Burstyn lead the pack. Timothy Bottoms and Jeff Bridges are superb and surprisingly subtle for such young actors. Sit back, enjoy then hand out the awards!

162,CMurphy08,Great film,7,24 February 2006,"The Last Picture Show is, in my opinion, one of the finest films of the 1970s. The film is an illustration of life in small-town America of the 1950s. The film also examines the rise of capitalist dominance and the demise of American simplicity.The breakdown of the American family is one of the principal motifs of the film. The affair with the coach's wife exemplifies this theme. The coach was working many hours and not spending enough time with his wife, therefore she found it necessary to seek out another sexual partner to satisfy her desires.Another metaphor may be interpreted with Jacy's relationship with Duane. She is encouraged by her family to abandon that relationship for one Billy, a boy from a more affluent family. I saw this as a metaphor for the rise of cutthroat capitalism, quality being sacrificed for greater profits.One of the most compelling quotes was at the end of the film, when one of the cinema employees comments that the popularity of the picture show is declining in favor of television. This is a commentary not only on the decline of great Hollywood films, but also American entertainment itself. I believe the director, as well as Larry McMurty, wanted to comment on the demise of the content of American entertainment. In today's entertainment we see much more violent, sexual and generally immoral content. I believe that this quote and the film and general served to protest against that trend.",The Last Picture Show
163,EricH-9,A Movie Milestone,10,29 April 1999,"One of my favorite films is The Last Picture Show.   It is a film that was directed by Peter Bogdanovitch in 1971, yet almost 30 years later it still seems fresh and alive to me. There is a desolate, spare quality to the 1950's small west Texas town we are invited into and its desolation is apparent to us from the opening scenes.  It was filmed in black and white, which enhances the dramatic quality of the town and takes us back to a simpler time.  Just as our lives are discontinuous, with jarring scene changes and ridiculous episodes of embarrassing events, so is life presented to us in this small town.  The film's purposely jarring editing is transformed in our minds, as we watch, from a disjointed amalgam to a stream of consciousness effect that is very lifelike. One knows, then, that you are entering an alternative world just as real in its way as your own.  This movie pulls you in.There is no musical score in this film in the normal sense.  The only time you hear music is when a radio is on or a phonograph is playing in the background.  This lack of a musical score dubbed over the film enhances the illusion of reality.  Another aspect of this sound editing is the choice of music that is being played by the different characters.  Bogdonavitch uses song and artist selection to subtly comment on the character of the person or people who are listening to it.  In the case of Sonny the music he selects is always Hank Williams and it alludes to the hardscrabble life and down to earth quality of his character.   In contrast at JC's home, the manipulative teenager played by Cybil Sheppard, you hear a cover of a Hank William's song that has all of the life sucked out of it, similar to a Pat Boone cover of an Elvis Presley song.  It is a direct comment on JC and her family; her family has grown wealthy by owning oil wells and they pretend they are still the same people as before.  It is obvious they are not just by this simple musical selection.  It is eloquent in its simplicity.
The center of the film and the major theme  should you listen to your heart or your libido if the two don't combine in the same person?  Perhaps the saddest comment in this film is that too often these two halves to a whole do not come together as a package and people are forced to chose.   None of the characters are particularly happy with their mates.  Everyone is on the prowl for that perfect person they know they will be happy with. Time and again they think that they've found the perfect person based on their sexual attraction but when they begin to show their authentic selves are then rejected.   Those in long term relationships with an emotionally compatible mate but with no sexual interest face an equal dilemma  a lack of excitement and joy  and are destined to be the ones that reject.   It exposes both sides of this human dilemma, a duality that can become split and non-integrated, and does it in a sophisticated and lyrical way.   Most people experience this split at some time and in this film, as in life, there are no easy answers.  That's why I love this film.And there is Billy, the boy who continually sweeps the street in a hopeless gesture to turn back the inevitable, representing that demented and futile longing for a past that was never quite as good as you remember it.  He represents that longing for an illusion that disappears just as we are about to grasp it and the sadness of that.

The very first thing I noticed was the quality of the black and white. The tones were that of a fine Ansel Adams photo... the silver glowing at you with breathtaking gradations. It was one of the best I'd ever seen. In color, it would have been a completely different experience. Jump forward more than 30 years and something is wrong. Either the transfer to DVD cannot bring us the fine tones of the original, or the original had degraded over time. I realize that it may be impossible to see it in its full glory because of technical limitations. However, the image I see now is worse than that of most of the B&W movies I've seen transferred to DVD from any era. It should be much better than it is here. So, in that respect, I was disappointed, as were others I had spoken with who had also seen the original screenings. I do hope Bogdanovich or someone else will consider a restored release some day. Otherwise, most of you will never experience what can be done with the extraordinary dimension and depth found in fine B&W by a master like Robert Surtees.However, the story and most of the acting is as fresh as ever. Aside from Cybill Shepherd, who, unfortunately, appears to have been cast only because she was the babe of the times, Cloris Leachman's gripping performance is a reason to see this movie.

This is one of those rare movies that you can go back every five years and watch for the first time.

The cast are excellent, especially Timothy Bottoms as the sad eyed Sonny and Cloris Leachman as the coach's wife. The cinematography is also amazing and the black and white images really add to the tone, becoming almost a character in themselves.
