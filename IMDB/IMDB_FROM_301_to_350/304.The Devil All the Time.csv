0,SnoopyStyle,death and religion,7,19 September 2020,"The story spans from WWII to Vietnam War dealing with deaths in religious rural America. Willard Russell (Bill Skarsgård) returns home from WWII in the Pacific after suffering from trauma. He marries waitress Charlotte (Haley Bennett) and together they have son Arvin. Arvin (Tom Holland) would become an orphan. He moves in with his grandparents who have adopted Lenora Laferty. They are raised as siblings. Lenora falls for new preacher Reverend Preston Teagardin (Robert Pattinson). Oh, there is also serial killer couple, Carl and Sandy.This is a jumble. There is a lot here. There are some good performances. Skarsgård is especially good. The cast is terrific. There is a sense of places and times. It would be nice if the story could be simplified to just Arvin's life. There is too much story with too many characters although it's never confused. I love the themes of religion and death. I also love that this movie is going for something expansive. It's probably going for too much.",The Devil All the Time
1,nogodnomasters,Pick your time.,8,5 October 2020,"This is a drama with a lot of killing. The film first focuses on Willard (Bill Skarsgård) in 1957, a WWII vet who has seen horrors. It then shifts to his son. We needed Willard to understand his son Arvin (Tom Holland). The film shifts between small towns in Ohio and West Virginia and has a subplot. It also contains third person narration that was done by someone doing a light version of Sam Elliot. Next time just get Sam Elliot and don't call any of the characters ""dude.""It nicely develops many characters to give you a feel for the town folks. Most was done by narration, which I normally find annoying and poor substitute for a good scene. That was not the case here. It flowed.Guide: F-word. Sex. Nudity, mostly in B&W photos.",The Devil All the Time
2,kosmasp,All over the place,9,20 September 2020,"Well not all over, as the movie states right at the beginning, we do have a certain area that is being the center of it. Even if that area or rather the cities themselves do not exist. But that is of course for the purpose of the movie and to be as vague as possible as to people not being offended ... like if their town/village name was mentioned.Acting wise this is amazing. The script is also quite something. Having multiple characters, many timelines (or rather periods) and so much more to keep track of, this does warrant multiple views. Even so, it is a fine watch, with extreme violence and many other disturbing things to boost. Many have stated that they haven't seen Tom Holland like this, and I would agree Spiderman probably would not approve of some of the things he does here. Then again, Spidey would have a different set of attributes and possibilities.That aside, there are so many great actors in this, you may get dizzy after you watch it the first time! Really good stuff, if you are not too squeamish ...",The Devil All the Time
3,classicsoncall,"""It is our delusions that lead us to sin.""",9,20 January 2021,"This is a film in which the connections among multiple characters isn't fully revealed until late in the movie. There are also a number of people who you key in on as principal players who suddenly drop out of the picture, though for obvious reasons as it turns out. As such, you may have to concentrate just a bit more on what's going on than in your average story with a linear chronology, as a handful of flashbacks are utilized to provide background detail that becomes important later on. For some viewers the slow burn nature of the picture may prove daunting, and it's dark themes may not resonate with the timid, but for those who stick with it, you'll be treated to a compelling drama of a young man who's forced to straddle the line between good and evil in an often unsuccessful attempt to protect the ones he loves. Despicable characters abound in the picture, none more so than the wicked preacher Preston Teagardin (Robert Pattinson), although his forerunner Roy Laferty (Harry Melling) I would consider a close second. By the time this film is over, you'll come to agree with the ill fated Sheriff Lee Bodecker (Sebastian Stan), who states to a young Arvin Russell in a critical flashback scene - ""Some people were born just so they could be buried..."". Turns out, there's a lot of that going on.",The Devil All the Time
4,CinemaSerf,"Great cast, great scenery, rambling plot....",7,17 September 2020,"Whilst certainly a great looking film, the rather episodic depiction of the ultimately interweaving threads to this story is really disjointed and so make this a particularly pace-less film that really only comes alive in the last half hour. In as near to a nutshell as this meandering plot will allow, the gist is that we start off with Bill Skarsgård, happily married to Hayley Bennett until she becomes stricken with an illness that tests to the core the man's obsessive religiosity - a test he also subjects his young son ""Arvin"" to, too - with rather harrowing effects. Simultaneously, we are introduced to the rather curious pairing of Riley Keogh and Jason Clarke who spend their time trawling the highways trying to ensnare young men into their rather brutal photography sessions, Finally, Robert Pattinson arrives in their Ohio backwater as a somewhat puritanical preacher with quite a few flaws of his own. The story evolves over quite a long period of time as ""Arvin"" evolves from Michael Banks to Tom Holland - and it's really only once Holland appears that the story gathers it's pace and the menace and complexities start to conjoin. Pattison is super as the fervent pastor as is Skarsgård as the equally fervent father, and there are some decent contributions from Harry Melling and Sebastian Stan, but the thing all just takes far too long to get going and once it does there is an inevitability about it that, I found, made the whole thing more about assembling a strong box-office cast than about constructing a cohesive or compelling story. It certainly doesn't lack imagination, and the attention to the detail in the presentation of an immediately post WWII America is impressive but in the end it's all about the story - and for me that just fell well short.",The Devil All the Time
5,Wuchakk,Drearily fighting... the devil all the time,6,19 September 2020,"In backwood towns of West Virginia and southern Ohio during the mid-60s several characters converge around a disillusioned orphan (Tom Holland) devoted to protecting those he loves.""The Devil All the Time"" (2020) is a slow-burn Southern Gothic psychological drama with crime thrills in the mold of ""Undertow"" (2004) mixed with the dismal rural tone of, say, ""Winter's Bone"" (2010), ""Mud"" (2012), ""Joe"" (2013) and ""1922"" (2017).The bleak story emphasizes the deep mysteries of life, like man's brutality to fellow man, premature death, unanswered prayer, religious misbelief/error, justification of sin, corrupt authority figures, the downward spiral of a criminal lifestyle, divine justice (whether you perceive it or not), hope and, maybe, redemption.Some complain that it's ultimately pointless, but it's not. It may be meandering and ambiguous, but it's not pointless. You just have to be braced for a slow drama, degenerate characters, lots o' narration (by the author of the book), time jumps, convoluted storytelling and a muted emotional payoff. Another thing to consider is that the story doesn't become compelling until the last 50-55 minutes.The movie doesn't ridicule people who believe in Christianity, as some have criticized, but rather realistically shows how certain individuals with mental issues can misinterpret the Scriptures or the Spirit's leading, as well as use their position to serve their carnal interests rather than serve people.There are weird and disturbing aspects that are gut-wrenching or disgusting, but the author based these things on real-life cases.It's a quality production with convincing acting/costuming/sets/locations, but the snaky downbeat story isn't for everyone.The film runs 2 hours, 16 minutes and was shot in Alabama (Anniston, Montevallo, Birmingham, Oak Mountain State Park and several other points in the area).GRADE: B-",The Devil All the Time
6,trashgang,dark,8,27 September 2020,"So on many sites it became an issue about is this horror or isn't it or is it a drama with a dark theme. Well, horror it isn't for me that's for sure. For me it's a dark drama worth seeing if you like weird stories and movies that ask your brain to work it all out.The score used, the way it was shot, the lighting and of course the acting is all above mediocre. I can't go into the cmparing between the book and this flick but did I like it.The characters, the acting is so well done and casted that it becomes almost a master piece. The story is dark themed and here and there you will have some gory shots. For most the crucifixation scenes are the worst ones. But hey, as I said, this is not about possession if you think that the word Devil should give you that. It's all about the Christian belt deep south in the USA, I have visited it as the era of the hillbillies so I do understand it all. If you aren't into Christianity then you will have the devil all the time.And as many said, spiderman, sorry, Tom Holland is giving the best. Enjoyed it a lot. Give it a try but be aware, it's not your usual flick.Gore 1/5

7,deloudelouvain,If you like to watch religious idiots this movie is great.,8,8 December 2020,"Just by the title I was expecting a horror movie, but it's a crime/drama, even though you could concider it as a horror since it's very religious and what is more horrorful than religion? The Devil All The Time is a quite long movie but it doesn't feel like that because there are multiple stories that in a way are all connected to each other and they are all very captivating to watch. The cast is excellent, with a lot of good actors like Robert Pattinson, Tom Holland, Bill Skarsgård, Eliza Scanlen etc. Robert Pattinson, once an actor I didn't really appreciate (probably because of those dumb Twilight series) is a totally different actor now that did a very good job playing his character. This movie has different stories and they're all very religion themed, what makes it interesting to watch. As an atheist I always find it fascinating to watch very religious people believing the most idiotic things and in The Devil All The Time you get a lot of those scenes, if not all of them. There's a fair amount of murdering so it's more a crime than a drama and that's what makes this movie worth watching.",The Devil All the Time
8,blanbrn,"Complex film of flashbacks with journey, free will, morals and connections.",8,17 October 2020,"""The Devil All the Time"" is one film that as you watch you must pay attention to closely for the way it goes back and fourth with flashbacks. In fact to get more out of it and better understanding it may require at least another viewing. Set after the postwar the film intersects and travels thru the 1960's with it's focus of time events taking place in rural southern Ohio, and the rural backwoods sticks of West Virginia. Along the way the film involves sinister and crazy characters it's like their fates have all been cursed! The mood and tone is a mix of drama, suspense, and real life horror. The themes of sex, violence, faith and betrayal are well on display as the film is a menu of death, religion, corruption, serial killers that all intersect with morals and free will. It's compelling to see how time and these two towns connect the characters. The performances are all pro with Bill Skarsgard, Tom Holland, Riley Keough, and Robert Pattinson. Call it a Southern horror soap opera still the movie is compelling, complex, and interesting that has you the viewer thinking. I guess if one wants more insight and understanding read the 2011 novel from Donald Ray Pollock.",The Devil All the Time
9,FeastMode,why why why do i keep watching netflix garbage,2,10 May 2021,"I almost quit this movie after about 40 minutes. I was so bored i wanted to cry. Can someone tell these filmmakers that constant narration is awful. But the story just became a tiny bit intriguing so i kept going. Bad decision.This could have been a decent movie if it wasn't so unbearably slow. The general storyline is mildly interesting. And the performances are mostly awesome, especially robert pattinson, wow. Maybe if it was an hour and 40 minutes with zero narration, there could have bene something herebut, for the love of god, there has to be some sort of entertainment factor. I feel like you would only like this movie if you're a 70-year-old who grew up in that time and hates gosh-darn technology.

10,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Ambitious and engaging, but doesn't really come altogether",7,5 October 2020,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningWillard Russell (Bill Skarsgard) returns home from World War Two to his small rural hometown in America, only for his beloved wife Charlotte (Haley Bennett) to develop cancer, pushing his grip on sanity over the edge, and forcing his son Arvin (Michael Banks Repeta) to pray with him for her recovery, even sacrificing their pet dog in the hope, only to no avail, resulting in his suicide. Years later, the grown up Arvin (Tom Holland) looks out for his adopted sister, the devoutly religious Lenora (Eliza Scanlen), only for her to fall prey to the charasmatic, recently arrived Reverand Teagardin (Robert Pattinson), putting him on a collision course with serial killer pair Carl (Jason Clarke) and Sandy (Riley Keough.)The 1950's was a very transformative time, in the chain between the present day and the outwardly puritanical years before them, during which two world wars condemned a generation of men to an air of unresolved trauma. While 'Elvis the Pelvis' caused a stir in popular culture, those raised with the traditional values of years past struggled to adjust to the changing new world. And so, it has, and always will, provide a perfectly suitable, lingering backdrop for misty film noirs, such as this effort from writer/director Antonio Campas, and narrated with the dark, gravelly drawl (giving it a Big Lebowski vibe) by Donald Ray Pollock, who also wrote the novel the film is adapted from.The retro 50s soundtrack is almost identical to 1997's unforgettable L.A. Confidential (most notably Kay Starr's harmonious melody Wheel of Fortune), and invokes pleasing memories of that great film. They're both fairly similar, in their attempts to lift the lid off the still seemingly innocent and wholesome 'American dream' of the time, and TDATT certainly has the scope and potential to weave an intriguing and complex tale. It's downfall is maybe being a little over ambitious, and as such ends up losing it's narrative focus somewhat, leaving you with too much to take in and losing grip on the main arc it's exploring.Cast wise, Skarsgard capitalizes on his post Pennywise fame, and uses the first half of the film he occupies to broaden his range, while Pattinson, probably the second most high profile cast member, demonstrates a sharper range than another Twilight film, in a project where none of the cast, especially not Clarke and Keough's eerie serial killers, hit a bum note. But, ultimately, Derek Cianfrance's quite similar The Place Beyond the Pines nails the 'sins of the father' theme more successfully. ***",The Devil All the Time
11,MOscarbradley,Overlong and maybe over-familiar but it holds our attention nevertheless.,7,18 October 2020,"Religion figures prominently in this slice of American Gothic from Antonio Campos but it's the old time religion of the Old Testament rather than the New and it's the Devil who's in the driving seat in ""The Devil All the Time"". Covering a period of about twenty years and with a multitude of characters, most of whom come to a sticky end, it's a darkly funny piece of Americana set in the backwoods of West Virginia where murder is more common than a prayer before bedtime.We've been down these backroads before, of course, all the way back to the seventies. Scorsese cut his teeth on material like this as did Malick and Campos shows us you certainly can't keep a good genre down. It meanders a little and jumps back and forth in time maybe more than it should and it's certainly overlong but it's well-acted, (particularly by Robert Pattinson and Tom Holland), and very nicely narrated by Donald Ray Pollock, author of the original novel.",The Devil All the Time
12,Pjtaylor-96-138044,As interesting and well-made as it is long and clumsy.,6,4 October 2020,"'The Devil All The Time (2020)' is an incredibly uneven experience. At times, it's atmospheric and compelling; at others, it's dull and undisciplined. Essentially, it follows a few different story strands featuring characters who eventually cross each other's paths in relatively intricate ways. It also jumps back and forth between a couple of time periods to provide backstories for some of its major players, focusing on their parents in order to give you a better understanding of what makes them tick. The picture deals with things such as faith, sin, delusion, fate and family, positing that violence always begets violence but sometimes can't be helped anyway. Occasionally, it's interesting and well-conceived, but it's just as often uninspired and clumsy. This is frustrating, to say the least. There's persistent narration (from the source novel's own author) that initially seems like a way to add flavour and condense the flick's lengthy set-up (seriously, it's about an hour long) but eventually evolves into a way for it to simply tell us what its characters are thinking. It isn't awful and can sometimes be rather atmospheric, but it feels somewhat intrusive and, frankly, unnecessary. Sometimes, it's almost like the movie is supplementing the narration rather than the other way around. Another issue is that the film feels as though it lacks a solid through-line. Even its individual stories seem like a series of isolated events until they suddenly start to come together towards its conclusion. It's in its final movement that the affair finds its most success, as its stories start to satisfyingly intertwine and a strong sense of foreboding creeps in. You're never quite sure how things are going to end up, which makes for a fairly tense finale. Overall, the film is a mixed bag. It's atmospheric, well-made and often enjoyable. It's also long, unfocused and relentlessly grim. It could have done with a bit of tightening up, to be honest. However, the further away you get from it, the more fondly you remember the experience. Perhaps that's primarily because it has such a solid third act. It leaves a stronger impression in retrospect than it does in the moment. In the end, it's a good movie that's dampened somewhat by its flaws. 6/10",The Devil All the Time
13,Edvis-1997,6,6,26 February 2021,"Well... It was something that it's very hard to describe. It reminded of ""Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood"" but I liked this movie a little bit less. I can't even say from where to start because this movie keeps flashbacking scenes from the past. I liked that this film had cruel scenes,blood,visauls looked nice. I don't get it why this movie has 4 famous men actors and not even 1 famous woman actress.Acting was okay, but some roles maybe fit better to different actors. The plot was unique in one way but boring in other way. It's way too long, has too many scenes, accent they picked was very hard to understand. Maybe it's a good movie for someone but I didn't find this idea interesting for me. I wouldn't offer to watch this movie because it takes too long and it's not a masterpiece.",The Devil All the Time
14,Cineanalyst,Narrator Weaving Threads,7,17 September 2020,"This slice of Southern Gothic is certainly novelistic--even for a movie adapted from a book. There's the omniscient narrator in the voiceover untethered to any character. His narration jumps back in time and back and forth between various characters and subplots that at first seem unrelated but are eventually all weaved together. Some well-known actors anchor some of these threads, including Spiderman Tom Holland in the hero's arch. Also, sparkles the vampire Robert Pattinson plays a preacher, which should raise some alarm. Consistent themes, such as the sinful religious stuff and violence and, to a lesser extent, war, politics and crime, and thoughtful dialogue are further reflections of the prose origins. It's masterful storytelling, really, even if there's not much in it that's more appealing than the fascination with the grotesque and the pulp.Reportedly, even the murderous photography business is from the literary source, which is kind of shame. If the god-like narrator is the novelist (literally and otherwise) and Holland's character is where the spectator places their emotional investment, then the photographer is the filmmaker--posing characters in sexually compromising positions and killing them off one by one. Director Antonio Campos probably deserves some credit, too, if only for allowing the actors and pacing room to breathe.",The Devil All the Time
15,The-Sarkologist,Violence begets Violence,7,30 September 2020,"Well, this film didn't go down all that well with my Zoom watch party, so I guess it was a good thing that I wasn't the one who selected it. In fact, it was agreed that they would pretty much can it half way through, though a couple's Zoom connection went down and they continued watching it long after the rest of us had given up. Okay, I decided that I'd continue watching it afterwards, but that is because I'm one of those people that like to see movies through to the end.Like, I didn't think that it was too bad, though as others suggested it wasn't that the plot, or the theme, was all that bad, it was just that it could have been done much better. In fact, they suggested that there are much better movies that deal with violence and the backward nature of people who live in the Appalachians. Another criticism was that the female characters really didn't seem to have much depth, and were referred to as lampshades - you could replace the character with a lampshade and it wouldn't make any difference to the film.Another criticism was that the violence just seemed to be quite random, and character were killed off pretty quickly. I pointed out that this was also the case with Game of Thrones, but they argued that at least there was a point to the violence, and death, in Game of Thrones. There just didn't seem to be all that much point here. The thing is though that as the movie progresses things start to become clearer. Like, the guy that takes photos of people having sex with his wife, and then killing him - it turns out that he is a serial killer, and that he believes that the best photos are those of where somebody is dying.Mind you, the preacher was pretty weird. Like he kills his wife just to see if he has the power of resurrection. Yeah, you can probably work out what happens in that instance. On the other hand, there is this thing about the main character - like, who are they. But once again, it does come out as the film progresses. However, the tag line about a virtuous person fighting against a hotbed of violence isn't really the case with this film because all of the characters are pretty dark.I guess the main theme of this film is that violence begets violence, and this is clearly shown with the Luger. The Luger comes from the war, and as it is passed down through generations, it seems to just represent that violence can only be solved by violence. Another thing seems to suggest that this obsession with guns translates to an obsession with violence. It is almost as if people simply cannot be trusted with them. In fact, in this world it is pretty much a story of people taking the law into their own hands.However, the film did seem to be somewhat all over the place, though we were surprised that it was that popular, especially given the rating on the various sites. Okay, I liked it, but it certainly wasn't great, and I really had trouble getting into it as well. Sure, it is one of those films that tries to make you think, but in reality there are so many more films like that out there, that are done much much better than this one, that this one is probably best left alone.",The Devil All the Time

19,eddie_baggins,"Tough and confronting, Devil All the Time is one of Netflix's best",8,18 September 2020,"After a string of misses so far this year when it comes to original features, Netflix finally gets one right with the no doubt depressing but captivatingly put together adaptation of Donald Ray Pollock's atmospheric dramatic thriller The Devil All the Time.Set in the post war backwoods of America in the 50's and then into the Vietnam centric 60's, Devil takes us on a dark and depraved yet humanistic journey into the lives of inmingled characters whose various afflictions and trials in life converge in this harsh reality that is often seeped into the deeply religious mindsets of this era and place.Directed by Antonio Campos who helped bring well-liked TV show The Sinner to life (a story that shares similar DNA to this crime filled yarn), Devil is drenched in intrigue and ominous vibes in what is a multi-generational tale that features some of the best talent working today, including an against type and hugely impressive Tom Holland as unfortunate soul Arvin Russell, an orphan who intends to protect those close to him and ensure justice is upheld for any wrong that may be done to them.Initially Devil establishes us into the lives of Bill Skarsgard World War 2 vet and Haley Bennett's young couple, raising a home and family in a dead-end part of the country but after tragedy strikes in some extremely confronting and disturbing ways early on, the focus then shifts to Russell and his life with his grandmother and step-sister, that is directed by the guidance they find from new local minister Preston Teagardin, played by a menacing and detestable Robert Pattinson.There's also Jason Clarke and Riley Keough's unnerving couple, Mia Wasikowska and Harry Melling's god-fearing husband and wife and Sebastian Stan's local lawmaker Lee Bodecker for the film to deal with and arguably this is where Compos's film at times struggles to maintain its focus but Holland remains from the moment he enters the frame the most integral and well-rounded feature of the film that is moving and emotionally charged even when its taking its viewers and characters into some unapologetically dark terrain.So well known for clear-cut figures and everyone's favorite web-slinger, its great to see Holland play such a multi-layered character like Arvin and his presence is a guiding light to such a depressing tale that will find its fair share of viewers that may not be able to take its full assortment of misery and misfortune but Compo's and his cast have created a unique and unforgettable tale layered in trials and tribulations, and one of Netflix's best offerings of the year.Final Say -Tough going but filled with memorable performances and an unforgettable post war setting, The Devil All the Time isn't pure entertainment but it is essential viewing for those willing to endure its confronting subject matter and character development.4 picnics out of 5",The Devil All the Time

There's a corrupt cop, gangsters who buy him off, murderous religious nutcases, a serial killing couple, a perverted preacher.About the only two characters who register as decent are just born to be victims of this violence and corruption, and you know it is inevitable that they are going to start using it, either on themselves, or on each other.This is a movie where I kept looking at the timestamp on Netflix to see how much longer there was to go, not because I was bored, but because I wasn't sure how much longer I could stand the horrible bleakness.I stuck it out though. I'm glad I did. The strength of the performances carry you through, and I suppose we all have a perverse fascination in seeing just how much more messed up it can get.",The Devil All the Time
27,kevin_robbins,This is an Academy Award caliber movie and one of the more entertaining films I have seen this year,10,16 May 2021,"Jaz and I caught this masterpiece on Netflix over the weekend. This is more of a thriller than horror but focuses on sexual predators and the creation of serial killers. It reminded me of The Paperboy, Mystic River, Killer Joe and The Changeling (2008) in a lot of ways. The storyline evolves around terrible circumstances that happen to a family in the south and how it impacts the children in those families. The cast is absolutely outstanding and includes Bill Skarsgard (IT), Robert Pattinson (Tenet), Tom Holland (Spider-man), Haley Bennet (The Equalizer), Jason Clarke (Pet Semetary) and Harry Melling (Harry Potter). The directing and cinematography is also fantastic and is delivered by Antonio Campos (The Punisher and The Sinner television series). This is an Academy Award caliber movie and one of the more entertaining films I have seen this year (this and Tenet are probably my two favorites). I'd give this a 9.5/10 and a strong recommendation.",The Devil All the Time
28,alindsay-al,A Good Film With A Great Cast,7,21 September 2020,"So I am a few days late but I have now watched Netflix's new big film The Devil All The Time and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young man attempting to protect the ones he loved by going after sinister characters in his town.Main Character
Even though he doesn't turn up in this film till the 45 minute mark, Tom Holland is the main character here and he is fantastic. This is a really mature performance, his character is going through a crisis for the majority of the film and you sympathise with him as he attempts to stay good but protect those close to him. Holland is still a young actor and the future for him is huge and hopefully he can be a leading man for years and years to come.Supporting Characters
Robert Pattinson is a busy man at the moment, with Tenet and The Batman but he plays a preacher here and he is fantastic too. He has a different accent and he does it so well here, he is such a slimy person and just by looking at him you can see something is up with him and he plays this role so well, when you consider he is usually the leading man. Bill Skarsgard plays Holland's father here and he does a good job too, you can see where Holland gets his personality from and the two characters journeys really mirror each other and fit the tone of the film really well. Sebastian Stan plays a crooked cop and he is great, he is a charismatic guy and he fits the role well. Credit to Jason Clarke, Harry Melling & Riley Keough who also all do great jobs in their respective roles.Story
The story is interesting for sure, seeing the different characters and their stories are a highlight and made better by the great performances. This films story is all about crisis, mainly in faith and the film does a great job of portraying that and make some really interesting and characters and this film has a really great ending. But, sometimes I think maybe the film should have focused on a few less stories, it is clearly trying to be a film like Pulp Fiction that wants to have everything connect and it does an okay job and not great job at it.Script
The script for me was okay, The drama is here and the film is as dark as it gets which considering the subject matter, that is fine for me. But for a film that lies on its drama there weren't really any moments where the drama hits the highest level and is memorable and that is a let down. Also this films storytelling device of narration feels cheap and lazy and like we need our hands held throughout the plot.Style
The style fits its film very well, everything is dry and looks like a place you would never want to visit. It shows the worst of the worst and the way the film is made really highlights what the film was going for. But I also felt this film was a little long in the teeth, mainly the first act, which took a bit to get going, if this had been sped up a little bit this film would be a much higher level in the final rating.Overall
Overall, this is another good film for Netflix with a great cast that fails to hit the highest levels. I think if you like character driven well acted films then you will enjoy this film and it is a good watch.",The Devil All the Time

The concept of showing the town full of evil humans and events which lead to violence and something more evil is not often well executed. This film on the other hand was well done. Firstly, amazing cast, this film is full of A-listers, who did great performances. Secondly, this film does not try to be over-the-top hardcore as most films with such concept try to be. It's subtle, but strong does enough to feel very rough, but does not overtry. To be honest, I like this a lot more than There Will Be Blood or No Country for Old Men.",The Devil All the Time
33,Pairic,Hillbilly Gothic,8,17 September 2020,"The Devil All The Time: A dark thriller set in Ohio and West Virginia, this is Hillbilly Gothic at it's best. A couple of serial killers, Carl (Jason Clark) and Sandy (Riley Keough) roam the highways between 1945 and 1965, picking up and murdering hitchhikers. This sets the background for a tale spanning two generations of families living in the two States. We have a venial, corrupt and murderous Sheriff, crazed preachers showering themselves with poisonous spiders, lecherous preachers and people driven mad by grief. Some shocking scenes, perhaps the worse though is when Willard (Bill Skarsgard) relives an episode from WW2. His son Arvin (Tom Holland) carries on his struggles against bullies and those who harm his stepsister Lenora (Eliza Scanlen). Great performances from an ensemble cast which also includes Robert Pattinson, Mia Wasikowska, Sebastian Stan, Harry Melling and Haley Bennett.

35,masonfisk,WOULD THIS HAPPEN W/BUDDHISTS?...,1,23 February 2021,"A 2020 Netflix original starring a slew of non-American actors in this twisted melange of serial killers & religious hysterics. During the end of WWII a man, played by Bill Skarsgard (Pennywise from the It movies), returns home from war to settle in a quiet burg in Ohio meeting a woman, played by Haley Bennett, working as a waitress in a diner. They marry, have a child & try to do right by God by staying true to the church but unfortunately Bennett contracts cancer & Skarsgard does everything in his power (even sacrificing the family dog) to appease the Lord to save her but to no avail so he chooses suicide instead of stating the obvious. The boy grows up to be played by our current Spider-man, Tom Holland, who goes to live w/his grandmother & uncle & their adopted daughter, played by Eliza Scanlen (from the recent version of Little Women) who also had a checkered upbringing cut short when her mother, played by Mia Wasikowska (Alice from the live action Wonderland films), was murdered by her preacher husband, played by Harry Melling (last seen in Queen's Gambit) & hoped he could resurrect her but he bought it as well when a husband/wife team of thrill killers, played by Jason Clarke & Riley Keough, pick him up when he was hitchhiking & kill him while Clarke took compromising pics w/a scantily clad Keough. Not to mention we have a new pastor, played by Robert Pattinson, who comes to the area & has a penchant for playing around w/the underage parishioners while Keough's brother, played by the Winter Soldier himself, Sebastian Stan, is a local sheriff also up to no good. What does all this add up to...frankly a bunch of overheated nonsense (Tennessee Williams w/more than a dash of Jim Thompson) which shows a bunch Brits & Aussies can do a drawl w/the best of intentions & not much else. Adapted from a novel by Daniel Ray Pollock (who reads the 'too on the nose' voice over) it never elevates itself above the corn pone/Christian diatribe the film presents itself as, as the viewership has nothing of redeeming value to latch onto, making this a particularly unpleasant slog in the Bible belt.",The Devil All the Time
36,questl-18592,The Devil on The Screen,2,29 September 2020,"Good lord I hated this movie. This is a slow, near pointless, meandering mess of mediocre acting and over indulgent writing. It does teach us some things though.First, having a big cast of talent does not equal a good movie. This is especially true when you get a cast comprised of primarily European actors trying to do an ""Ohio"" accent. Pattinson is among the worst here and every time he spoke it was like nails on a chalkboard to me. Maybe it's because I've lived in the Great Lakes region and I know that's not how everyone talks! We also get Sebastian Stan who I'm guessing has cotton in his mouth because he is looking extra jowely and sounds awful too.Second, the overindulgence. This thing clocks in at 139 mins and frankly you could cut the first 45 off that and not change the movie. In most places, Holland is the top billed and he doesn't even show up until around the 47 minute mark. But no, this is far too pretentious and unfocused for that.Thirdly, there's an old film adage, ""show, don't tell."" This is clearly something Campos, the director, is unfamiliar with because the narration is near constant. It's so overwhelmingly throughout this movie in fact that as of this moment the IMDb has Pollock listed as top billed and when the narrator is top billed that's a pretty big problem.There's more I could get into here, the way characters are treated as lemmings, dying off constantly and seemingly without purpose. The plot convenience of an untested boy somehow never missing while simultaneously never getting touched even in the most absurd circumstances. Just... UGH! I couldn't wait for this to be over and if not for the completionist in me I would have turned this off about a half hour in.Bottom line, this may have been a great book, that I will never read, but books are not movies, no matter how desperately this wants to be just a visual book reading. Holland is the only decent thing here and he is surrounded by so much awful that even his performance isn't worth it. So, if you're desperate for something that tells you everything is awful and the world is a terrible place... Honestly, just turn on the news and save yourself the trouble.What a disappointing mess.",The Devil All the Time
37,fmwongmd,Kitschy,7,20 September 2020,"In the ""Fargo"" tradition this film is a delight to watch with all the corny music and irredeemable characters. Robert Pattinson and Tom Holland show considerable acting skills.",The Devil All the Time
38,jadepietro,"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?",6,15 October 2020,"GRADE: C+THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Not completely successful in its adaptation, the film still has many redeeming graces.JIM'S REVIEW: Except for a Bible-spouting grandma, there is nary a saint in Antonio Campos' film, The Devil All the Time, but the town sure has plenty of sinners to go round. All of these blue-collar townsfolk are desperately in need of some instant prayer and lots of diversity training. In this ambitious film adaptation, this poor and very white population from the areas of Coal Creek, West Virginia to Meade, Ohio certainly need God's intervention. Stat! It's not a town where one wants to hunker down and this film is not a movie one can truly enjoy either, with all of its flawed characters and violent codas. Call it a white non-privilege community, or a William Faulkner tragedy of errors, or a Lake Wobegon rural town gone mad. The movie wallows in their despair. In fact, the film has some wonderful narrative voiceovers delivered by the author of the novel, Donald Ray Pollock, which supplies more of the atmospheric gloom and fills in the gaps of the non-linear storytelling with his colorful and insightful prose, the film's chief asset.Ye sinners, take note! This just may be your kinda place. Sex and all sort of lurid acts run through the towns and its people, as we follow a multi-generational plot that spans nearly 30 years. This town is brimming over with fire and brimstone with its fair share of crazed evangelists, mean bullies, serial killers, corrupt sheriffs, and various forms of fornicators. There is much to ingest in this piece of deranged Americana. Perhaps, too much. Yes, there will be blood in this melodramatic hotbed for wayward travelers. But we all know that sacrifices must be paid onto the Lord and that is a foregone conclusion, right? Do I hear an amen, brother?The film is much lofty storytelling that never quite gels into a cohesive script. As a director, Mr. Campos captures the hopelessness and futility of the characters beautifully with his images of poverty and emotional distress. He also creates some violent tableaus that are sudden and highly effective. But as a writer, both he and his brother Paulo, are not very successful in condensing the multiple story-lines and dense plotting without the entire saga becoming contrived.We follow the film's main character, Arvin Russell (Tom Holland), and his tale of personal woe while meeting other secondary characters who fall into his orbit. His kinsfolk are introduced and quickly dispatched with shocking bloody glee. As Arvin's story continues to unfold, the jarring use of their backstories doesn't help much. Editing becomes very episodic and uneven. While the reasons for the characters' interactions become clearer and finally waylays any story confusion by tying up all the loose story threads nicely, the flashback plot device regularly interferes rather than structurally advancing the narrative. There is enough exposition for three movies with all of the excessive sub-plotting going on. Less would have been more.One cannot fault the actors who are very fine in their stock roles. Mr. Holland is excellent as the sad sack Arvin and he gets strong support from a cast that includes Bill Skarsgård in his far-too-short role as Arvin's father, Eliza Scanlen as his deeply-religious stepsister, Lenora, and David Atkinson and Kristin Griffith are his adoptive parents. Also on the sidelines are Robert Pattinson and Harry Melling as two seriously flawed preacher men, and Jason Clarke and Riley Keough as the aforementioned murderers are truly menacing. Add to that, Sebastian Stan who plays an amoral lawman well and Mia Wasikowska rounding out the ensemble by making her wounded character quite memorable as one of the town's few pious victims.The Devil All the Time telegraphs its sins of the father scenario a bit heavy-handedly, but one can easily admire the strong cast and the filmmaker's noble vision, even though I cannot fully recommend the film itself.",The Devil All the Time

47,gedikreverdi,Some people are just born to be buried,8,16 March 2021,"It's way better than most of those overly hyped crime thrillers. The actors were amazing but Tom Holland in particular is an amazingly talented actor. Arvin grew up with a father that came from fighting a war in the pacific islands and obsessed with religion (they were having praying sessions by the prayer log in the woods) and his mother got cancer and died. His father then took own life after prayers didn't save her wife, even the crucifixion of the dog didn't help. Then Arvin move to his grandmother's house and she's living with his uncle (it is some kind of incest or I didn't get it) and the Lenora the daughter of the church girl and the grandmother was expecting her to marry Arvin's father but Will had already fell in love with the waitress right after he got back home from the pacific islands. Lenora's mother was killed by his delusional father who claimed to have spoken to god and killed her to see if he could resurrect her. The congregation of his grandmother had a new preacher in their church who's a very sketchy man. He sexually abused Lenora and she got pregnant and when he denied his responsibility in this, she took her own life. Arvin had know about all this all along and he killed the preacher in his church and fled the town by hitchhiking. The bonny and Clyde of the Bible Belt took him. He noticed his gun and managed to kill him and officer's sister. She didn't stand any chance as her murderer husband changed her bullets with blanks. The officer knew it was him because he was called in after his father committed suicide, he knew where to find Arvin. Arvin buried the bones of his crucified dog and killed the officer as well. He then buried the gun which was the only thing from his father that he has, next to the remains of his dog. He hitchhiked again dozing off to a sleep where he dreamed of what to do next with his life. I guess the very observant religious people find it a bit unlikable because the movie is excellent from start to end. The narration reminded me of Pulp Fiction and it worked miracles with this movie too.",The Devil All the Time

50,Holt344,"The Devil All the Time, a dark story which is lifted by its incredible acting",8,20 September 2020,"The Devil all the Time is a very good movie but it's a dark one, not everyone's cup of tea. But bear with me here, it's an ensemble drama/thriller with bits of the psychological genre. It features an all star cast with so many well known actors like Tom Holland, Bill Skarsgård, Robert Pattinson and Harry Melling to name a few as there's so many well known and who did amazing performances. Tom Holland reinvents himself in doing a very dark character and its probably one of his best performances.In the movie we get to follow a couple of characters, most of them are crazy in some way as they are clearly suffering from some kind of mental illness. We have Bill Skarsgård's character named Willard Russell that is clearly suffering from PTSD of what he witnessed in WW2 and his son that is played by Tom Holland.
Other than that there are multiple of main and side characters that is played by Harry Melling, Robert Pattinson, Sebastian Stan, Jason Clarke and lots of other interesting characters.The production design is great, but the cinematography is the best part. There's some parts with the writing and storytelling that isn't really the best that it could be but I didn't mind it because of the great and believable acting plus the immersion makes. The story is messy at times but it fits the atmosphere of the movie and it's messy mostly because of all the characters, it could have easily been 30 minutes longer to really flesh out the characters.

""The Devil All The Time"" was just north of PG-13 into R territory, if you ask me, but then, with young faces in the film like Robert Pattinson and Tom Holland, the movie makers couldn't anger and turn the stomachs of those matinee idols' teen fans. In the end, ""The Devil All The Time"" simply falls in line with a ton of flicks where the preacher/priest turns out to be corrupt mas hell and religion was, once again, used as a weapon or cattle prod to keep people in line.

55,kuarinofu,138 minutes of faint themes and countless wasted subplots,4,7 February 2021,"This film packs quite a run time for one with no structure or story progress at all. Faint themes of anti-religion, post-war trauma, poverty, and hardships of life are all present. They don't really go anywhere with these though. The film has no ending and after some time it becomes evident that everyone is just going to die, and they do. The last scene feels like a cliffhanger to the first episode of a TV show, so I assume this was intended to be a series, instead, they made an excruciatingly slow film out of it.I think the core idea was that everyone has their own understanding of God and this is somewhat understandable (and that sometimes the devil takes advantage of you disguised as God, hence the title). I'm not sure if this was intentionally made to hit hard on religious people (I'm not), or they just assumed that all religious people are only either violent killing maniacs who want to take advantage of you or praying victims waiting to be abused. Cause besides Tom Holland's character, everyone else fits these descriptions in a way.The cast was great, they delivered good performances through long takes. I'm still curious though if everyone should have such a heavy accent (since I'm not American).There's not much substance in the film so there is not that much to talk about. I think the creators wanted to make an experiment where they would not cut a single scene from a film. I hope that their next film will be 4 hours long, because why not. You can cut a solid 30 minutes from this and not hurt the film.P. S.

56,msbreviews,Tom Holland shines in the undoubtedly divisive The Devil All The Time...,8,16 September 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Netflix has been able to deliver films with all-star casts pretty regularly. Whether people like the movie or not, that's a whole other subject, but as a convincing argument to make people want to watch a film, this type of casting is perfect. Almost every actor in The Devil All The Time is a fan-favorite due to their presence in cinematic universes, iconic sagas, or Oscar-winning flicks, so it's no surprise if this aspect alone gets audiences to sit in their couches for a movie with an almost two-hour-and-a-half runtime. This is my first time watching an Antonio Campos' film, and my expectations were moderately high, having in mind the synopsis and the genre itself.I didn't know what the movie was really about since the synopsis doesn't really shine a light on what the main narrative truly addresses. I only watch the first official trailer *after* I watch the film (so I know what I can write in my reviews), and to be honest, it's a bit misleading when it comes to the time certain actors are actually on-screen (Holland only shows up after forty-five minutes, for example). So, for the first hour-and-a-half, I found myself struggling to understand where the story was going. There are more than a handful of relevant characters and storylines, being this my main issue with the flick, but I'll get there.I'll start with the cast and their characters. The former group is impeccable, as expected. Tom Holland is undoubtedly the biggest surprise by delivering a part of him that no one had seen so far. Arvin's personality is shaped based on his traumatic, tragic, violent childhood. Transitioning from the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man to such a haunted character is not an easy task, but Holland finds a way of dealing with the emotionally overwhelming, dark path that Arvin walks. However, this is a long movie where every character has an important role to play, even those who barely impact the story until the last few minutes.Bill Skarsgård plays Holland's father, seamlessly incorporating a man whose blind faith in religion sets not only a horrible chain of events, but it also establishes the overall theme for the film. Riley Keough and Jason Clarke play a weird couple with a disturbing modus operandi, but the former is genuinely impressive. She's becoming quite an interesting actress by picking unique roles in unconventional movies. Everyone else is great, Robert Pattinson, Eliza Scanlen, Sebastian Stan, you name it, but Holland, Skarsgård, and Keough are my absolute standouts, as well as their characters. They're definitely most developed across the runtime than the others, which takes me to one of my negatives.With so many characters, the balance between the numerous storylines fails to be consistent enough to keep me engaged throughout the entire runtime. Antonio and Paulo Campos offer every character a good chunk of time, giving the viewer opportunity to understand the motivations behind said characters and connect with their story. Excellent storytelling method, no doubt about it. However, by the end of the film, some characters have close to zero impact on the narrative in retrospect. Contrasting with my standouts, a few characters feel one-dimensional, used merely either as a plot device to make the story go forward or as an object for gratuitous, gory, bloody killing.That last aspect might be a no-go for tons of viewers. There are dozens of sequences where a character is brutally shot or beat close to death, so you have my warning. It can go from entertaining to excessively gruesome in a matter of seconds. Nevertheless, the thing I love the most about The Devil All The Time will be the exact same many viewers will definitely hate: its take on religion. Similarly to Darren Aronofsky's mother!, this is a movie that doesn't shy away from depicting how blind faith in hardcore religiousness can be dark, somber, sinful, and take people through the most terrible of paths. It's the overall theme that connects every storyline.Throughout the film, almost every character's decision is made based on their religious beliefs in some shape or form. If they believe praying is the solution to cancer, they'll pray for days in a row and make sacrifices. If they believe God is giving them supernatural powers, they'll do everything to test his will. If they believe God is telling them to make the most illogical decisions, perform inhuman actions, and sin in the most awful way possible, they'll do it in the blink of an eye. This religious manipulation is depicted in such a realistic manner that it transforms The Devil All The Time into a pretty tricky viewing. For me, it felt so authentic that I can easily connect it to the state of the real world.From the moment I realized this underlying theme, the second half of the movie became much more interesting. Character arcs start to intertwine, previous questions being to receive their respective answers, and everything falls into place in the last thirty to forty-five minutes. However, the runtime still feels way too long and even though Antonio and Paulo Campos do a remarkable job by coherently joining the several storylines, some of these simply don't add anything to the narrative or to the protagonist's arc. Technically impressive across the board, standouts being Lol Crawley's lingering cinematography and the sweet score from Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans.The Devil All The Time is destined to be incredibly divisive. Antonio Campos and Paulo Campos conjured up a somber, dark, extremely violent screenplay, packed with numerous storylines and an underlying theme that's going to cause some controversy. With such a stellar cast, it's impossible not to have outstanding performances. The entire cast is impeccable, but Tom Holland (the absolute standout), Riley Keough, and Bill Skarsgård deserve the shoutout due to their genuinely impressive displays. However, the high number of characters and their respective arcs unnecessarily overextend the runtime. Too much time is given to characters who, in retrospect, barely have an impact in the narrative or in the protagonist. Some are used as mere plot devices or kill targets for the sake of entertainment. Nevertheless, the narrative's focus on religion is bold and audacious, showing how blind faith can negatively influence people's lives, taking them and others through the most painful paths. Depending on each person's view on religion, on how open the mind can be and the sensibility to bloody violence, I leave my warning that this film might not be for everyone. But, if it is for you, it will be hard to forget.Rating: B+",The Devil All the Time
57,SoumikBanerjee25,Brilliant Piece of a Work!,9,3 December 2020,"""The Devil All the Time"" preoccupies through a captivating narration. It circles around two generations over with a diverse set of people and their corresponding backstories. Stacked up with ravishing performances; the closing impression turns out to be rewarding.
The way this story takes over your subliminal self is truly enthralling. Speaking of all the vile intents we hide within our narcissistic minds. How we all comply to some degree of evil, in order to get our deeds done. Holding a righteous mirror; reflecting the true nature, we are so unmindful of.
As the title advocates, The Devil lives on.A star studded cast forming up with the likes of Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson, Bill Skasgard, Jason Clarke, Riley Keough and more. With that many renowned personalities onboard, the performances were destined for greatness.
Cogently bolstered by a felicitous Soundscore with a melancholic touch; resonating well with the on-hand script. A competent cinematography succeeded in maintaining the unsettling connotations.Beyond shadow of a doubt, this is not everyone's cup of tea. But those with unyielding cravings for social dramas would infallibly appreciate such brilliant piece of a work.",The Devil All the Time
58,mahmus,A really good movie with amazing performances,7,21 September 2020,"What a pleasant surprise this was. I knew nothing about this movie other that Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson were in it and I enjoyed the hell out of it.The entire cast is great, but Tom Holland and especially Robert Pattinson steal the show with some of their best work to date. This film reminded me a lot of the amazing The Place Beyond The Pines.This is one of those movies with many different plot thread that conect in the end, and so, it feels pretty aimless until the third act and I wasn't as invested in the plot threads that didn't involve Holland or Pattinson. Still, when it all does come together in the end, I was really satisfied.My biggest issue is the narration. It felt very unnecessary as most of the time it just explained things that really didn't need to be explained.Overall, this is a really damn good movie with fantastic performances. I definitely reccomend it.",The Devil All the Time
59,nathanmanson,Not for everyone but amazing acting all round especially Tom Holland,7,18 September 2020,"The film definitely isn't for everyone but luckily I enjoy films like this. I've seen people complaining about the length, for me personally it didn't feel as long as it is and I also enjoy long films anyway. I'll admit it took me a little while to get a hold of what's going on but as soon as I did I really enjoy it. It's hard not to enjoy a film with such a great acting display. You've seen it from everyone else's reviews but Tom Holland stood out massively put on a A star performance. The only thing that I wasn't a fan of was Robert pattinsons accent I thought everyone else's accent was a lot better then his. Other then that it was a great performance from him.",The Devil All the Time
60,RussHog,There is no God,7,21 September 2020,I liked this movie a lot more than some films I see in theaters - including several films nominated for Oscars. I liked the cinematography and the violence and the darkness and the moody atmosphere. The cast I felt was mostly decent. The narration of this movie bothered me a lot and I think the film would have been a lot stronger without it. I almost wish the film had taken more time to develop the characters instead of used the narrator to push the plot forward. However - it's a decent crime drama and it's super trippy that the Marvel and DC cinematic actors are in it.,The Devil All the Time
61,Alexander_Blanchett,This will make rounds,8,17 September 2020,"I love ensemble pieces, especially those that tell stories of people whose fates are linked with each other rather than the people themselves. It kind of reminds me on a larger version of ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" in some ways, although it tells a totally different story. The story is captivating. At the beginning you get introduced to a lot of characters but soon learn that those just are the base for what to come. It generally makes you think that all of that would not have happened if a character of the past just did another move. Its truly a story about fate and how fate defines our lives. And its a story about evilness and gives quite clear answers of the question if people are born evil or if they are made.
The acting is great. Tom Holland totally nails the role of the main character. Well, he is the main character but divided into two roles so its not like Holland is your typical lead actor here. Still he manages well and shows off some absolutely new facettes of his talent. Robert Pattinson is in a noticeably smaller role and wonderfully plays against character. There is one scene between him and Holland, where both actors are wonderful but where Pattinson still steals the show and owns the screen in the most perfect way possible. Riley Keough was fine and it was nice to see her in a character like that (its similar to the characters she usually plays but with a nice twist) Jason Clarke was the weakest point. You really could see the wheels turning in his performance and he usually can do better. Mia Wasikowska was rather wasted in a small but important role. Eliza Scanlen proved once again her ""interesting newcomer to watch out for"" status. I also liked Sebastian Stan who like most actors in this flick wonderfully played against his usual stereotype. Bill Skarsgard was very memorable but the role was shorter than expected. But the first third of the film absolutely belonged to him.
The atmosphere was fantastic. The score haunting and the screenplay perfectly crafted. I think it will really pay off to see it a second time around.",The Devil All the Time
62,CANpatbuck3664,"Mostly Uncomfortable, Deeply Dramatic and Brutally Bleak",7,3 March 2021,"Some movies add artistic flourish, saturated colours or unconventional cinematography to distract from the true inner workings or real setting in a film. That is decidedly not the direction they went with The Devil All the Time. This movie is grimy, sad and uncompromising. The environment reflects the tone of the movie. The way they chose to shoot it helps drop any pretensions of what kind of movie you're going to get. The costuming, the sets and the visual style feel period accurate and it helps you wrap your mind around why all these characters are all so dissatisfied and why they feel fated to their dismal ends. This is a terrible people doing terrible things kind of picture and its presented for better for worse in its muddy, blood soaked, back alley glory.The biggest takeaway I had from this movie was how Tom Holland isn't a flash in the pan. He's a great Spiderman (probably my favourite live action one) but he shows range and depth in this film. He's got the most interesting character and because there's so much disappointment and pain in his performance, I latched onto Arvin more than any other character here. Robert Pattinson's performance as Preston received some hype but I still don't get the appeal. I'll concede he has gotten better since Twilight but I still couldn't buy him as this Southern preacher with dubious morals. Sebastian Stan is in a really thankless role as Lee Bodecker, with his rise through the ranks, this kind of supporting part seemed like an odd choice. What was the appeal? I still haven't seen Jason Clarke hit the same high level since Zero Dark Thirty and Lawless, his success as a leading man might have conversely been fools gold. Riley Keough is good in her scenes and Bill Skarsgard get the job done in his role that don't feature a huge amount of screen time but casts a large shadow for Arvin.The Devil All the Time gets the job done but when considering its flaws, the first one that comes to mind is the pacing. This is a contemplative movie that spans decades and centres around different characters for different periods of time. It was never going to be a taught thriller. But it is SSSLLLLOOOWWW for long stretches and since I wasn't interested most of our main characters, when the movie went another direction, I was yawning and checking the time. The long run time doesn't always help either. Also, while I wasn't put off by the message of the movie, it hits you over the head repeatedly. I would have preferred a little more of a light touch or even some ambiguity but no one will ever accuse The Devil All the Time for being too subtle.The Devil All the Time isn't the kind of movie that stuck with me or left me pondering over days after. Its a heavy drama about extremely flawed people in desperate situations and while its not a copy or a rehash of another film, I've seen many movies like it. There's little joy in watching this movie. There's definitely no hope to hold on to or to keep you invested and that's a perfectly acceptable choice by the creative team. But I've seen other movies in the genre that I've like better or had more of a lasting impact. This movie seemed to be angling for awards contention but didn't have that standout/memorable scene or that unbelievable performance to earn that kind of consideration. But I also think its a good film and it obviously found its audience with the amount of love its being shown in the user reviews here. I'd give it a firm 7/10, I'd say check it out if you're interested but if you're not chomping at the bit, its not a must see kind of movie.",The Devil All the Time

Plenty of cinematic moments and compelling ideas too. But somehow it doesn't add up to a great movie. You need voiceover narration just to connect everything, and that narration has to try awfully hard to spell out the themes. There's a little too much telling and not enough showing (which is ironic considering how desperately the director wants to graphically show whatever he can). I still enjoyed the acting, but it might have worked better as a 7 episode miniseries than a 2.5 hour movie. There were lots of good parts that did not quite fit together into a whole.",The Devil All the Time

66,elicopperman,The Consequences of Pure Evil,6,9 October 2020,"When we think of movies dealing with the consequences of using religion to hide your faults, the perspective is usually told through one tortured individual. However, in the case of the film The Devil All the Time, based on the book of the same name by Donald Ray Pollock, the entire story is simultaneously told through the life of a disturbed war veteran, a serial killing couple, a false preacher and an anti-biblical young man in post-World War II Southern Ohio and West Virginia. Now that the film is on Netflix for all to see, how exactly does it fair out with an ensemble cast like Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson and Sebastian Stan?From the title alone, the main theme behind this movie is the internal evil that comes from within people based on how far they will go in their beliefs, especially if centered around their own religion. As almost everyone in the film is a Christian in some shape or form, they all fall into distinct yet similar rise and fall stories in which their individual demises all linger up to the end. Even though the plot does drag on at points to really get going, that's all intentional so we can let each character experience their own fates at the right time. What could have been overwhelming in any other movie winds up working so well in this film considering just how much evil there can be in even just a few people around the world. The shere darkness in all of humanity is not only shown throughout the film, but in multiple ways, whether it'd be around trying to resurrect a dead relative, or a sinful monster disguised as a spiritual priest, or even the abuse from one's power of the law. No matter how bleak the film gets, it's all done in a way to rightfully show perspectives we as viewers might not be used to in other thrillers.Now in spite of its unique structure, what does keep the film from being able to resonate with broader audiences is its lack of proper reasoning. While the film does show us all bad behavior from the individuals, it ends up spending far less time on what actually makes these sinners tick. Because of that, it makes any potential curiosity from a viewer almost sidelined for what ends up feeling like a narrative consisting of Sunday School lessons. If you're going to tell all of these different narratives, give at least somewhat of a reason as to potentially understand the other side of these characters so that the viewers could actually gain more substance from them. Yes, all these stories tie together in the end for a satisfying conclusion, but there should have been more depth into these narratives behind the darker sides of humanity. On the plus side, the authentic country dialogue, cinematography and music score do give off the intentional creepy aesthetic this thriller is going for, so even with the criticisms, at least you'll have some nice little details to take away from.In terms of other appraisal, the performances are quite spot on, especially from the main cast. Tom Holland's character of Arvin Russell is probably the most morally sincere of everyone in the movie, but even then one can feel for how hard he wants to do good in spite of terrible situations he's placed on. Robert Pattinson does such a good job at making even the most sweet looking people seem intimidating, especially as the dishonest reverend Preston Teagardin, as well as Sebastian Stan presenting the pompously shallow sheriff Lee Bodecker. Riley Keough and Jason Clarke have just as much pathos as they have chuckles playing Sandy and Carl Henderson, so their arc ends up playing a much bigger role than first expected. Given that the film takes place in America in the 60s, the more impressive talents come from foreign actors like Bill Skarsgard, Eliza Scanlen, Harry Melling and Mia Wasikowska playing southern country folk. Given that the movie is a character study on multiple individuals, the cast really knew how to make the most of these delusioned eccentrics.So in spite of its narrative shortcomings and dragged out pacing, The Devil All the Time has just enough thrills, solid performances and intriguing perspectives on natural evil doings to make it an intriguing watch, if nothing else. If you're looking for a flawed but still fascinating look into internal immorality, then this is a good recommendation for the month of horror on Netflix. It's a good thing we're still getting cool thought-provoking movies like this on streaming services instead of movie theaters. As of now, it looks like we're in for a wild ride for what's yet to come on the horizon.",The Devil All the Time

At first I wasn't because Robert Pattinson was in the Film. I was never a fan of his. But I watched it anyways. Oh my God this Film was Fantastic Roberts charactor as the Rev. Was great he was no ordinary Rev. He was a slimmy, creepy, idiot, of a jerk behind peoples eyes. Took advantage of the young ladies. He was a jerk he played it very good. As a matter of fact all actors in this film and actresses. They all where fantastic not to often you get a film with a perfect cast. In this film it is 100 percent a perfect cast.

68,ronakkotian,Would've worked better as a mini-series,7,19 September 2020,"I was really excited to see this. The stellar cast and story had me intrigued. After seeing it, I have mixed feelings feelings about it.The Devil All the Time has multiple storylines and follows a man who tries to protect those he loves from evil people he meets along the way in a town filled with violence and brutality.What I really liked about The Devil All the Time was its tone and cinematography. The film has a very dark and miserable tone to it which managed to stay consistent throughout. It gave the town a bleak atmosphere that fit really well with the story's themes. A major part of this film is narration and I don't think it was used that well. Whilst the narration seemed integral to this story, there were scenes where I thought it wasn't necessary. The narration would sometimes reveal traits of a character like Jason Clarke's too early. It would have been better if the film developed it as it went along instead of telling us when they're introduced. An editing choice which bothered me was when the film would reincorporate scenes from the beginning. Once again it didn't seem necessary to cut back to previous scenes as I think the film would have benefitted without it so we could establish the link between those scenes.The production design is really good. The old cars and houses matched the time period it was set in perfectly. I feel a big problem with this film was its runtime. The film is 2 hours 10 minutes long but it doesn't feel justified because of how many characters and storylines there are. I think it would have been a better decision if Antonio Campos adapted this into a mini-series so that every storyline and character get fleshed out completely.I thought the cast did a great job. Tom Holland impressed me and I thought his accent was well done. I hope he does more serious roles like this in the future. Riley Keough and Jason Clarke did a great job together. Eliza Scanlen and Harry Melling were also great and Robert Pattinson delivered another splendid performance. Sebastian Stan was fine but there wasn't much for him to work with.Overall, The Devil All the Time is a fine movie. I liked the bleak tone of it all but some of its editing choices, narration and short runtime didn't work for me. I don't think it's particularly memorable and it doesn't stand out from other hyperlink films in the past.",The Devil All the Time

70,trinaboice,Creepy story that sticks with you with an excellent cast,8,19 September 2020,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Netflix presents a new film directed by Antonio Campos based on the gothic crime novel also called The Devil All the Time. What's cool is that the movie is narrated by Donald Ray Pollock, the author of the book! Knockemstiff is a town featured in the movie that you'd swear was a made-up name, but it""s a real place where Pollack grew up. The movie is produced by Jake Gyllenhaal, which makes sense because the characters sort of feel like characters Jake has played in some of his former movies. Speaking of the cast, that's why you want to watch this movie. It's like attending an acting class. That being said, it's a bleak and gruesome movie that features the ugliness of twisted people. This is NOT a family-friendly film, nor one you want to watch with your grandma.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

The lives we touchTHINGS I LIKED:
Robert Pattison has been cranking out a lot of exceptional performances lately. Recently, he starred in Tenet and last year The Lighthouse. He uses an interesting voice for his character in this film, something he loves to do. He has stated before that he feels like a fake if he sounds like his regular voice. In fact, he wouldn't let anyone hear the voice he was going to use until the first day of filming.
The Amazing Spider-Man fans will love seeing Tom Holland in this. You'll be impressed by how Peter Parker disappears and a new character emerges, as Tom Holland uses his physicality to completely change his persona. Be patient...he doesn't actually show up in the movie until 46 minutes in.
Marvel fans will also enjoy seeing Sebastian Stan, although you might not recognize him. The MCU represents well in this movie.
Strong production values
All of the female actresses were great and did a lot with the small roles they were given. Kudos to Haley Bennett, Mia Wasikowska, Eliza Scanlen, and Kristin Griffith.
The scenes were shot on 35 mm film, which is rare for a Netflix movie.
Jason Clarke was good, but we've seen him be this kind of character before.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
When people today see religion portrayed like this in movies, it's no wonder they want nothing to do with Christianity.
Like horror movies, the characters are clueless and don't see what should be obvious.
Most of the characters are all the same age so there's not a wide range.
With a title like The Devil All the Time, you can bet that there are some extremely dark moments you'll wish you didn't see.
Time is supposed to pass, but the characters don't really age.
The story jumps forward and backward in time, which could make it difficult for some viewers to follow.You can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom channel!",The Devil All the Time

72,andrewroy-04316,"A pointless, horribly confused film with one of the worst scripts in recent memory",2,2 November 2020,"I cannot think of a reason anyone would enjoy The Devil All the Time. It has a great ensemble cast, and it's fun to see Tom Holland in a darker role, and Pattison is always good, but the script is so terrible that there's nothing the actors can do if their characters and motivations are utterly uninteresting. Maybe people like that it's a dark movie for the sake of being dark? It certainly doesn't shy away from violence, which I don't mind at all, but the fact that it's violent doesn't make the movie good in and of itself. There are so many problems with this film, but I don't want to spend more time thinking about this dreadful film than I have to, so I'll be brief. The biggest problem: the film is extremely dull and tedious. The characters are even worse than one-dimensional caricatures; they actually have no dimensions, no reason to engage with them or care about their journey. The violence serves no purpose, the characters don't have to wrestle with anything psychologically, and deaths have no consequence to anything that happens - they happen and then we move along as though they never happened. Campos clearly wanted to make this a story about Christianity gone awry, but when there is no hint at any character psychology and it's obvious the characters feel no inkling of moral misgiving about killing people, that message is worthless. The voiceover narration is terrible, adding nothing to the film and heavy handedly stating points that a competent filmmaker would show subtly in character actions. The nonlinear storytelling adds nothing at all to the story, as the nonlinear bits are edited together when they are completely unrelated, so when we come back to a scene we saw earlier there is no new information to consider, it was merely a pointless diversion. The dialogue is laughable, with very few conversations that could plausibly have taken place between real, normal people. I will say that the church scene between Holland and Pattinson was fun, though again it ended in the same silly, meaningless violence the movie is filled with. I also like the idea of Holland standing up for his sister, though the sharp dichotomy between the confidence of the boys by the school and then their fear and lack of fight later is a bit ridiculous. There are plenty of technical issues and frustrations, but more than anything this film is ruined by a terrible script devoid of thematic depth or any direction at all, which makes the film an absolute chore. I was so eager for it to end because I simply could not care less what happened to anyone in the film. I regret watching this movie as much as any I've watched all year and would encourage anyone who hasn't seen it to stay away.",The Devil All the Time
73,bgar-80932,Pretty good,8,14 January 2021,Multiple interconnected horrible stories come together to show a full picture a little bit like Pulp Fiction. There were some flaws in it I believe with it a little bit meandering at times but overall it's really good. Bill Skarsgard nailed it as did his son in the movie Tom Holland.

I feel like the first hour or so is a bit dragged out, could have been condensed slightly.The positives: well it's basically written in the title. The acting from everyone was fantastic, great cast and equalled with the performances. Tom Holland, special mention, can take a bow because he was excellent. And the story itself is an interesting tale and I think it's really well done how the ""separate storylines"" collide. It's a story that's pretty unique as well (well I've not seen anything like this).Overall it's a good watch. Worth the time you put into it.

I can't see any evidence of a oscar winning performance as there are so many characters flown across the screen none of them have any consistent time.It's a movie you'll watch but end up most of it on your phone, or cleaning the house, washing dishes and doing laundry. Then at the end you'll have a warm feeling of actually finished some chores and think that the cause is this crap movie.",The Devil All the Time
77,PyroSikTh,"Long, Disjointed, and Redundant, but Full of Great Performances",6,22 September 2020,"The Devil All The Time follows an interconnected cast of characters over a number of time periods. The film opens with Willard Russell, back from World war II, falling in love, buying a house in the middle of nowhere, and having a son. We see the effects the war had on him, as well as his sometimes ruthless (but barely abusive) treatment of his son Arvin, as they endure the sudden sickness of wife and mother Charlotte. Interspersed is the story of Helen who lost her parents in a fire, and Roy, an enthusiastic new preacher with a penchant for spiders, and their baby daughter Lenora, who ends up being looked after by Willard's relatives when both Helen and Roy go missing one day. Added to this is the story of Sandy and Carl, who meet in a diner and make annual road trips where they seduce, photograph, and murder young men. As the movie goes on the timeline jumps forward, focussing more on Arvin and Lenora as young adults, contending with an abusive preacher in Reverend Teagarden, as well as Sheriff Bodecker, older brother of murderous Sandy. The story grabs this large cast of characters and throws them together at various points in time, until the film's final act that sees Arvin on the run for an increasing amount of somewhat justified murders.There's a hell of a lot of story to this movie and it can be really hard to follow and piece together, especially early on in the film's runtime. I actually had to pause it once or twice to talk it over with my wife and make sure we were both following what was happening. It doesn't help that the film is told outside of chronological order, throwing scenes and interactions in way before they're actually relevant. For instance we see Helen leaving Lenora with Willard's relatives before her and Roy drive off, while the narrator tells us that that's the last time anyone saw her, and her body was discovered seven years later. That's fine. Maybe a bit before it's relevant, but fine. The problem occurs later on when we jump back to Helen and Roy prior to, during, and after the incident that left her missing presumed dead. It makes the earlier scene not only needlessly confusing, but also completely redundant. The very minimal aging of the older characters certainly doesn't help either, making the story of Sandy and Carl a bit tough to establish precisely when they occur in the grand scheme. They meet before Willard even meets Charlotte, but are still around and killing, seemingly unaged, nearly twenty years later.The movie clearly has something to say about the effects of religion on us, from Willard's desperate pleas to god, and crucifixion of the family dog, to save his wife, to Reverend Teagarden exploiting his church for lustful gains, to Roy's delusions of god's power, from Carl treating his murders as a religion unto themselves, to Arvin's complete unacceptance of religion as an impactful part of his life at all. But ultimately it feels too on-the-nose and like it's being whacked over your head. Religion is bad, or at least the people who become obsessed with it and exploit it for their own gains are bad, and that's pretty much where the film's exploration of religion ends. There's no grey area, no questions asked. Just, look at how terrible these religious people are due to religion's role in their lives.Another big problem with how the movie presents its story lies in its pacing. It is a real slow movie, meandering around seemingly without point for a good hour and a half. So much time is spent on Willard and his raising of Arvin, short-changing the debatably more interesting characters. How and why did Sandy and Carl start killing people? This is something that's apparently filled in by the book, but the book shouldn't be necessary for full character development. Sheriff Bodecker also lacks much of a personality at all, and his little sub-plot is completely irrelevant to everything else that happens before or after. Helen and Roy have interesting things going on, but the movie's done with them in the first half hour or so. And despite all the character building we get of Arvin, his relationship with Lenora is surprisingly hollow.
That said the acting is fantastic pretty much across the board. I didn't notice any weak links at all, which shouldn't come as a shock considering the absolutely stacked cast of talented actors. Tom Holland shows the wealth of potential range he has beyond Spider-Man (something that was never in doubt, might I add), taking on a much rougher and more morally ambiguous role. Robert Pattinson shines as possibly the most detestable character of the film, single-handedly elevating the entire movie once he gets introduced. Bill Skarsgard carries the film's first act on his shoulders, fully embracing the PTSD-fuelled desperation and careful to toe the fine line between sympathetic and antagonistic. Harry Melling is probably the biggest surprise for me. We all know him as Dudley, and his recent role in The Old Guard didn't exactly show a new side to him, but here he managed to give us a crisp and fully developed character in his performance alone. He's still not a particularly nice guy, but this time it's through genuine madness and tragic delusion, rather than just flat-out villainy. I never thought I'd see him be so convincingly sincere and apologetic. Haley Bennet (as Charlotte), Mia Wasikowska (as Helen), and Riley Keough (as Sandy) are also all great despite their limited screen times, but up-and-coming Eliza Scanlen really impresses as Lenora, torn between doing the right thing and pleasing those around her. Sebastian Stan, Jason Clarke, and Douglas Hodge round out the impressive cast, all of them bringing some pretty decent performances as well.There's a lot to The Devil All The Time, but at the same time there isn't really much at all. It's a complicated and intertwining story of multiple characters through multiple periods of time, but it lacks direction for much of its run time, and interactions between different sets of characters are so few and far between that each separate story can feel super disconnected, until they crash into one another by chance and happenstance. The theme of religion loosely ties it all together, but as forcefully shoved into our eyeballs as it is, some of it feels shoehorned in just to make it all feel connected (Carl's murders apparently being a religious act for him, despite nothing actually being shown to imply this at all). I didn't hate this movie, I can't say I was ever particularly bored, and there are some damn impressive performances on display here, but it lacks in almost every area it matters most; badly paced, sloppy narrative structure, disjointed sub-plots, character favouritism, and beaten-over-the-head themes. I give The Devil All The Time a strictly fine 6/10.",The Devil All the Time

79,sweidman-28016,A Very Investing Complicated Story,8,26 September 2020,"""Some people were born just so they could be buried.""There are elements that hold the movie back from being great. But that doesn't take away from how divisive it is. It's dark, gritty, and difficult to watch at points. Though technically not horror, it feels very much like one. Some of the imagery and awful events feel right out of a drama-horror. I don't want to say that it doesn't go full out with gore/intensity, but I wanted them to go full out. A few shots of gore last less than a second where I questioned what I actually saw. Minimal gore works to an advantage in occasion, but with how fast the movie goes and with so much to cover in the story it would've been nice to slow down to take everything. Unlike a common criticism from most audiences, I would've like the runtime to be just a little bit longer. It's already 135 minutes which is long enough but I would've liked more.Like I stated before, the story has some much to cover. The three different acts follow a different story that's connected to a stacked cast. Starting right of the bat, the movie introduces many characters. Honestly, it was hard to keep up. Already I knew everything would be connected. It's not till the second act where it makes more sense. To help explain, a narrator is there for the audience. If I could change one thing about the movie it would be the narrator. Voice overs dumbing down there story for the audience irritates me. Not everything is simplified, but most of what the narrator says is a given. One of the most emotional (intense) scenes is somewhat ruined by the voice over.A few of the scenes fall flat due to narration or other aspects, but the ensemble give it their all. If the competition weren't so high for other upcoming movies, this easily could've won awards. Though some characters don't even meet it feels as if there's a strong relationship whether it's characterization or acting-wise. A few actors don't get as much screen time and I wish they could've had more. Either their acting is just that good or I wanted more development. The best performances come from the closest characters: Eliza Scanlen, Tom Holland, and Robert Pattinson. Scanlen already has had a great year with Babyteeth and is now a must watch actor. She has an emotional role and makes it believable. I'm sure you've heard of how proud Tom Holland is of this role and movie. He proves that he can do something other than action/superhero movies. His return to drama since The Impossible is impeccable. Every minute spent on screen is a minute well spent. Holland truly immerses himself and the audience into the movie. If either of those performances didn't invest you, Robert Pattinson came and have another career defining performance. Ever since Good Time, or even going back to The Rover, Pattinson full sends his role. I wouldn't be surprised if he will be considered for awards at the end of the year. All I'll say is ""DELUSIONS!""Antonio Campos directs well. With how tangled of a story if is, the end result untangles and ties itself together nicely. There are ruts along the way. The portrayal of how evil the characters are goes a little overboard with some characters, especially if they aren't developed enough. Many people will be turned off by how overboard the whole thing can get at times. But I found myself so invested that I couldn't look away. I checked my phone maybe once but the movie finished in a flash. Maybe a rewatch will reveal more flaws but for now I'll enjoy what I remember.",The Devil All the Time

The problem with the film, apart from being grim, well I just didn't care about the characters, despite the acting, why should you?

That said, it's done through a distanced, fairy tale-like approach that prevents it from ever reaching emotional dramatic excellence despite solid turns by the whole cast.

86,Lebowskidoo,Devilishly Great,9,26 September 2020,"There's a great deal to be said about going into a movie completely blind. All I knew beforehand about this movie was it was set in the south in the 40's, 50's and 60's, Tom Holland was in it smoking a lot of cigarettes, and it appeared to be a dark story of some kind. I didn't even look up the cast list online, so when actors like Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska started popping up, I was pleasantly surprised.The Devil All the Time is a dark, spiritual, generational southern epic tale that you just know is going to go down certain dark country roads and the characters will do some suffering. Yeah, it's not a happy tale. There's a married couple that serial kills together. There's a scene with spiders that will give you arachnophobia even if you didn't mind them before this movie. Someone eats deep-fried chicken livers, which sounds absolutely disgusting. This movie has a lot going on.Tom Holland is pretty intense as Arvin, more so than I've seen him before. Riley Keough always seems to be playing the same confused, lost white trash girl in every movie, but she is good at it. Robert Pattinson plays a smarmy southern preacher like he's Elvis just getting back from the prom and wants to get laid.The movie unfurls steadily, with some cool narration by the author himself, Donald Ray Pollock, in a storytelling manner that eases you in like you've been greased up for a spontaneous proctology examination at the last minute.

I did think it dragged on at points but the cast and elements of the story kept me wanting more. Robert Pattinson is incredible in yet another supporting role and Tom Holland drops his Marvel charm for this big boy role like you've never seen him before.

92,coreyjdenford,The Devil most of the time,6,16 September 2020,"When you see a young actor go into the harder, often violent, often hard to take film it's almost certain for a barrel of question with most of the answers heading towards, can they really pull it off? Tom Holland is that young actor in question, now 24 years old and acting since he was a kid (not that long ago) and the lead actor in a major MCU franchise, well it's almost as if he might not pull it off, the film being mostly set in Virginia the accent might've been hard for a British actor to pull off. Well he does it all in spades, here he is Arvin Russell the only place The Devil All The Time goes as for a good guy character (though not really that good if his past has anything to do with it), Holland's performance is exceptional his co-stars are good especially an always on form Robert Pattinson as the untrustworthy preacher. But it's Holland's performance that really gathers all the plaudits, and yes he pulls it off in a film that's so violent so unforgiving in places that it's almost punishing, it's very hard hitting. And Holland is remarkable through it all, in fact you could almost say The Devil All The Time was made for him. But unfortunately the cast and the stellar performance seem to be the film's strong points sure it packs a punch, but when it comes to the narrative it could be better. It sometimes goes from one place to another really quite quickly and it seems that when it deviates between characters it seems a little rushed. And that, unfortunately is the film's fall point, the atmosphere is good as director Antonio Campos really sets the tone for the gothic presence but unfortunately with the tonal shifts and missing narrative it seems like The Devil All The Time is really just a film to watch maybe once. 3/5.",The Devil All the Time

Film starts with a detailed childhood of the protagonist with other subplots too establishing the characters and setting. Talking about the acting, i liked bill skarsgard, riley keanough and robert pattinson's performance. I don't know whether stan put on weight or used prosthetics for the role or not.
Film's cinematography and art direction was impressive capturing the essence of 1950-60s.

95,fciocca,Expect the unexpected.,7,2 July 2021,"When I approached this movie, I did not know what to expect. I have found a very nicely narrated movie with an interesting plot that keeps you on the verge. The script is pretty simple and straightforward, connections between different story lines are very well done. Nothing feels forced, or out of place. The Campos brothers managed to write a good screenplay and they clearly had a cohesive vision. Their efforts were well rewarded. Most of the time you know what is going to happen, but you have no clue how a certain event is going down, which is the main strength of this production. How the director built tension, creating an unsettling feeling, that kept me company for the whole length. There are a lot of explicit images and it is really gruesome. I have really enjoyed the narrator's voice, which is always placed at the right moments, to properly explain some crucial details or to empathise certain passages. I wish Netflix would release more stuff like this, they should really pick quality over quantity.The cast is composed of real professionals: Tom Holland, who I mainly know for playing ""Spiderman"", and who I have always considered a mediocre actor with just a pretty face, showed his true skills, and I have reconsidered the guy positively. Robert Pattinson, despite his small part, delivered a nice performance. Not his best work, but he was very versatile and convincing, at least for me. Sebastian Stan, handled this dramatic part greatly. Not to mention Bill Skarsgard, Jason Clarke and Riley Keough.This is a small project but yet it delivered.

97,DeBBss,Uninteresting for the Most Part,6,20 September 2020,"The only interesting parts about The Devil All the Time is its title and the third act; everything else was just flat. For nearly two hours, the movie was building up for a grand finale, but those near two hours could've put almost anyone to sleep.There were so many subplots and characters that the movie didn't have enough time to develop one good solid character. So for most of the time, I was just watching these characters that I don't care about being depressed. There was only one notable subplot, and that subplot being the one with Carl, the serial killer. The slow pacing also doesn't help the film whatsoever, because I'm already stuck with underdeveloped characters, and now I have to watch them do the most subpar things.The acting was the best part about The Devil All the Time; it's just unfortunate that the actors did a better job at playing the characters than the writers actually creating them. Like, why did everybody have to be the stereotypical 50's character; where they praise God for almost everything. And I know that this movie is about religious people, but why didn't they just give a reason for every character to believe in God so passionately. That's why Arvin Russell is such a good character when compared to everyone else; he has reason on why he's not religious.The Devil All the Time is a slightly above average movie. I don't know if it's just me, but The Devil All the Time feels like it's Oscar baiting all the time. This movie feels bland and lifeless. The only time that I could see/feel passion was in its performances.

Director: Antonio Campos
Starring: Tom Holland, Bill Skarsgard, Robert pattinson, Sebastian Stan, Harry Melling, Jason Clarke, Eliza Scanlen, Haley Bennett, Riley Keough, Mia Wasikoswka etcOverall rating 26/100The devil all the time is about a group of sinful and sinister people who all are linked, and target one young boy devoted to protecting his family. The devil all the time for me was just nasty and horrible to watch and there were not many good elements for me sadly, let's talk about this more in detail.Let's be nice and start with a few positives, I liked the narration, character background and the performances were particularly good. The use of narration was done well to make you understand how the characters were feeling as well as adding some background and development to them as well. I also thought the movie spent a decent amount of time on most of the characters backgrounds. The movie spent a lot of time developing characters pasts to make you understand where they were at the present time which was well done and a good amount of time was spent on it making it not seem rushed. The cast and performances here was also very good, I have to say the cast was very impressive, and despite me not liking any of the characters ( which we will get into later ) all the cast did a good job with what they were given, with intense and unsettling performances that I haven't seen from some of the actors involved here before.However, my first few negatives would be the unlikeable main character, slow pacing, and disconnect from the plot and characters. The movies main character was incredibly unlikeable, the director somehow thought that him killing a load of bad people would make him likeable or someone to connect with but no it achieved the complete opposite. Making him just as bad as the other characters despite Tom Hollands commendable performance. The movie was also very slow paced. The movie in general was just very dull and slow paced, and I often found myself losing interest, due to the lack of anything really going on in parts, the interesting things that happened in the movie weren't consistent enough at all. Next I had no emotional connection to the movie or any connection to the plot and characters. The movie had so many deaths that it was hard to keep up, and due to how sudden they were with practically no depth, development, or real reasoning I didn't care about any of them. I just found the character work and the plot terrible and not something that I could connect with at all, and the movie did nothing to make anything positive or after a while interesting to watch.My next few negatives would be the poor roles for women, how over the top the movie was and the overly dark tone that didn't work. The roles for all the women in the movie was terrible, I get it was set in the past but so many movies like this still give substantial roles for women, they were all killed off, had no development or depth for them and were practically just there to please and look after the men, the movie was also incredibly over the top, no offense to some of the actors involved here but a lot of the accents were terrible, I was often laughing out loud when I wasn't supposed to and they had so many dark moments that it just got too much and more and more ridiculous that they just lost their impact completely. The movie also had a way too dark tone that did nothing. The movie was incredibly dark and disturbing and if done right can be great within a movie. But in this case they served no purpose to the overall plot whatsoever. The movie was just going for shock factor but failing to link it to the actual movie, making it basically just a load of messed up people killing each other, it was just really poor.My final few slight positives would be the set pieces, the equal amount of time and connections between characters as well as some chemistry between actors. The movie did a good job at making the set locations look like the desired time period shown throughout, and in general there was some interesting and visually pleasing filming locations. I also thought the movie did a good job at splitting it's time equally with all the characters, giving everyone an opportunity to have their stories told, and also I liked how a lot of the characters were linked together in some way despite it not always being enough to justify them being connected I appreciated the effort, and some of the actors had believable chemistry that worked well on screen especially from Tom Holland and Eliza Scanlen.However, my final few negatives would be lack of depth to the plot, as well as it's lack of cohesiveness. And finally, the dull ending. The movie had no depth whatsoever apart from surface level karma and people fighting demons. The movie didn't even attempt to go deep into the characters, and the plot just lacked any form of cohesiveness, it felt like separate stories that were lazily linked together just for the sake of it. The ending was also extremely dull and left me feeling nothing for the movie, they didn't have any satisfying character arcs hardly any of the characters were alive and it was just an unpleasant hard to watch final act that never went anywhere beyond a few mediocre kills.Overall, despite boasting an impressive cast with great performances. The devil all the time is a bland, lifeless, depressing, over the top and overly dark film. That has nothing likeable or compelling going for it and was honestly hard to watch until the end due to the lack of effort put in.",The Devil All the Time

It is about religious fanaticism, about the abuse of the leaders of the sects, the naivete, the search for revenge and justice, the fetishisms.
Narrated, in fact the story is being told to you.
Although it is quite extensive, the film does not fall.
The sex scenes well carried out and cared for.
The murder scenes neat and well directed.
Tom Holland steals the screen.
Robert Pattinson is doing great in the movie.
Despite touching on a delicate subject such as religious fanaticism, it is masterfully addressed.

103,MogwaiMovieReviews,Well-Made but Seemingly Pointless and Empty,5,23 September 2020,"Well-made in almost every department, The Devil All The time somehow remains just a little meandering, distracted and dull the whole way through, which must be hard to accomplish with such dramatic source material. There didn't seem to be any reason to tell this story, other than Netflix wanted another movie: at no point did I ever connect with, warm to, or become intrigued by any of the characters, or care about what would happen to them. They all just seemed like temporary props I was looking at while waiting for the actual story to begin, and it never did.The wheels really start to come off towards the end with a conversation between Tom Holland and the preacher that feels entirely out of character and thoroughly unbelievable, given the time, the setting and his character's age. A twist to do with a gun shooting blanks is also far-fetched and unneccessary. An obtrusive voiceover continually attempts to link up and explain what the script and performances can't be bothered to. It's all lazy and boring and, as usual, half an hour too long.I've been trying to fathom the factors at play in what has gone so wrong in the cinematic age we're all living through - obviously there's the increased valuing of political virtue signaling over story, character and believability, but I've been wondering if another one of them is the amount of time people are spending in the world of video games, where they are becoming accustomed to 'story' being just a series of busy, exciting moments with no connective tissue. When someone tries to kill you in a first person shooter, it's not considered at all important why that person is doing it: no energy is given to trying to understand the internal causes of any actions or behaviours, past simple fight or flight level responses. What any of it means. To do so would actually be detrimental to the mission and just slow the game down.So there is increasingly zero depth or reflection expected, no space to breathe, contemplate, think... but this absence of actual story is what more and more people are becoming accustomed to calling story, to the degree they don't really realize there's anything missing. This was also the great flaw in Joker, an otherwise gorgeously made and acted series of moments that never added up to anything that made sense or meant anything. The essential impression with all these films is that they are colourfully painted empty shells: there's no ""there"" there.It's a trend I've been seeing more and more, especially since the lines between film and TV have become so blurred - I first remember noticing it with shows like Boardwalk Empire, which had fantastic production values, acting and period detail, but seemingly no idea about what story to tell: it simply meandered along from one situation to another with no real point for existing other than to be an entertainment product that looked like a movie. Well, now it's ever more common to see movies that don't seem like movies, and The Devil All The Time is sadly just another one of those.",The Devil All the Time
104,deepfrieddodo,Flawless Thriller,10,2 April 2021,"Really unexpected, and I find it very difficult to find any faults in The Devil All the Time. Flawless acting, especially considering many of the actors aren't American and put on superb accents. Incredibly dark, without a light-hearted moment in the entire film, but so well connected. Many different characters all come to interlink, and although it is a long film and a real build until we even meet the main character, everything is necessary and paints a perfect picture for the landscape and context. Gripping at all the right times, engrossing and thrilling, the emotional perception of each character is perfect whilst showing how awful the chain of events are. Of you don't like dark films, then no, don't watch this, it'd be distressing to say the least. But a really brilliant piece of cinema nonetheless.",The Devil All the Time

106,noahgibbobaker,"""some people are born just to be buried""",8,17 September 2020,"This quote sums up the devil all the time perfectly. It's a story about people, good people still do some bad, and bad people who do some good. It is a realistic, human film I think everyone can relate to in some way. Written by Antonio and Paulo Campos and brilliantly directed by Antonio this is one of the best films of 2020 so far. I've been keeping my eye on Antonio Campos since I saw simon killer a few years ago and I think this is his best film yet.The devil all the time is a very well crafted film with beautiful shots riddled throughout. It is technically great. The editing to keep each story flowing in a way that is engaging and makes sense is fantastic. The cinematography is amazing, I love the long takes, I love the wide shots, I love every single shot in this film, it's stunning.I love the story being told, on the surface it's about the first eighteen years of Arvin Russell's life. But it's more than that, it's about religion, it's about family, it's about growing up, it's about grief and it's about manipulation, how people can be manipulated and how people can manipulate. Everyone in this story is manipulative at some point or another, some more blatantly than others. Everyone is manipulative except for Arvin, his step-sister Charlotte and his grandparents. Arvins dad Willard manipulates Arvin into religion and Preston Teagardin manipulates girls into sleeping with him. But most of all, everyone in the story is manipulated by God, more specifically religion, except for Arvin. People go to extreme lengths to please God and show God that they are worthy. Growing up in a christian family I can confirm that people do go to extreme lengths to do what they believe they must do. No one around me has ever done anything so severe, but it happens nonetheless. I should add I don't think this film is derogatory to religion or christianity, I think it is just a interesting way to tell this story and present the themes at the same time. I don't want this review to drag on for too long but the themes of this film are very complex and interesting, I could talk for a long time about them.The characters are complex and feel like real people. They are, like the rest of the film, very well written and interesting but most of all they are all entertaining to watch. I loved getting to see so many different perspectives on different situations, it gave the audience an understanding of the people we consider bad, this rarely happens and I am always very glad when it does.I have but one kind of big complaint about this film and honestly I don't know it matters all that much. I think this story is impossible to tell without a narrator, but unnecessary narration is something that really bugs me. It was used well most of the time, but when the narrator tells the audience exactly what certain characters are thinking it annoys me. I mentioned I don't know if this criticism matters very much. This is simply because I don't think the film would have improved without the narrator saying what characters thought. I think it would have bugged me less but made for a worse overall experience. I have a few smaller issues as well, there was one flashback that was very unnecessary and was only used to remind the audience about what happened earlier. There were a few moments where the CGI was distracting. And the pie that was left at the Russell family's doorstep had no note or anything saying who sent it, obviously this is extremely minor, just a little thing that irked me.Finally I'd like to acknowledge the action scenes. All of them are remarkable and particularly intense. Arvin's encounter with Preston is one of the more intense scenes I've watched for a while. During these scenes I am really worried about the characters involved. They were excellently executed and I was impressed by them.Overall I loved the devil all the time and recommend it to everyone. So far it is my second favourite film of 2020 only topped by Charlie Kaufman's I'm thinking of ending things, a near perfect movie in my opinion. I'll be surprised if anything is better than that film by the end of the year.",The Devil All the Time
107,thenolanfan,Review - The Devil All the Time,4,28 November 2020,"The Devil All the Time is a pointless and poorly directed ultraviolent telefilm with the retention of being an intelligent criticism of war and religion.What is memorable about this film is how well Antonio Campos, by miscasting, wasted the talent of some good actors. Especially, Tom Holland, who simply can't get the accent properly. In general, you aren't gonna turn a British actor Ohioan by putting ""ain't"" at the beginning of his sentences.This movie tries to be A River Runs Through It and a good thriller at the same. Ultimately, it fails at both.",The Devil All the Time

Robert Pattinson must be hard up on quality scripts to appear in this C-grade millennial charmer. It's funny how in one of the few mainstream flicks of these times where the entire cast is white you got characters straight out of the Twilight Zone.

111,TheCorniestLemur,DELOOOOOOOOOSHUNS,7,12 May 2021,"People seem to be a little down on this, and I'm not sure I entirely understand why. It's not a masterpiece or anything, but unless it's the violence or Marvel fans watching just because Tom Holland's in it, then I don't really know what people's beef with it is.I have small cuts of beef with it, for one thing the narration is bloody obnoxious quite a lot of the time, doing no more than spelling something out that you could already easily pick up on or even spoiling what's about to happen, and for another thing, it does take a while for you to realise where it's going.Not that I found everything before then boring, but it does maybe spend a little too long on the first act, and a little too long before letting you realise where it's going.Once it does though, there is a lot to love here - the cast is absolutely stacked with great actors and they all deliver great performances. I already knew most of them were great from other things they've been in, but I'm happily surprised that Tom Holland is more than capable of playing more than just Spider-Man, cause my biggest concern about this film was whether or not he could pull off dramatic roles.If you're curious about what this film is about once it does get going, I'd describe it at its core as being about how religion can negatively impact people, and if you are willing to be a little patient until that point, then I'd recommend you watch it, it's really well shot, the story goes in some interesting directions, it has a great soundtrack, and some well fleshed out characters.In short, I think it's been judged a little too harshly. Give it a try.",The Devil All the Time

115,GomezAddams666,Southern Gothic at its best,10,17 September 2020,"This movie is a magnificently crafted piece of the Southern Gothic genre, full of mysteries, suspense, and the evil of humanity at its core.The film takes place in Southern Ohio after WWII, in a well-written story where most of the character's stories and tribulations are intertwined flawlessly between one another, which will inevitably lead to some cathartic encounters.Some plots and twists are easily decipherable, in the sense that you know what's going to happen next, but the filmmakers manage to still shock the audience with astounding performances from all star-studded cast that includes Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson, Jason Clarke, Haley Bennet, Mia Wasikowska, Bill Skarsgård, and Sebastian Stan. But it is Tom Holland who deserves to be named MVP in this astonishing production, as his performance is not only beyond perfect, but also his character is the one that connects to the audience, and one of the most well-balanced person in this story full of darkness and horror.This movie definitely deserves all the praise, it is well shot, amazingly acted, and to be a movie that´s longer than two hours, the pacing is perfect.",The Devil All the Time

High expectations, huge disappointment. The cast is certainly talented, but with such a dispersed and somewhat linear narrative there is no place for any memorable interpretation. One of the problems of the film is the excess of information without the proper background, which leaves the characters incomplete, without the depth needed to understand their true intentions. Having a narrator (the author of the novel, in case you didn't know) throughout the film does not make sense for the story, and is a distracting factor at times. It is a kind of modern 'Magnolia', but pretentious and poorly directed. Netflix needs to step up their game, fast.",The Devil All the Time

118,Lewis_Heather787,Stellar acting across the board !!!,7,17 September 2020,"This is the sort of level that Netflix needs to be hitting more often than not because this film is one of the best that is has produced.......or put out to the world. Saw the trailer and was immediately drawn in by the fantastic cast and the interesting story, however I was hesitant because Netflix hasn't always delivered.I am very pleased to say that ""The Devil All the Time' is everything you could want in a modern day thriller. We have to start with the cast because it is the biggest draw and the main positive of the film, so many names I unfortunately might forget some. The best for me is Robert Pattison who is just a chameleon of an actor, plays this super creepy preacher extremely well and that accent is impeccable. He is in a strange way a pivot point of the film and triggers a lot of events that unfold towards the end of the film. Tom Holland, great to see him in something that isn't a comic book film. Definitely an extremely talented guy that has a lot of potential and has a bright future ahead of him, played the role really well and was easy to get behind and route for. Next I would say is Eliza Scanlen, who I up until this film had never heard of........but boy am I going to look out for her now. Superb in the role of ""Lenora"" actually looks a bit like Mia Wasikowska who portrays her mother in the film. She definitely delivers a small but very effective performance that you won't forget. Lastly I would say Bill Skarsgard, who sets the tone for the film and you could say is the heart of the film. Again delivers a very powerful although small performance. The rest Jason Clarke, Riley Keough, Haley Bennett, Sebastian Stan and Mia Wasikowska are all great in the film as well.The next major positive of the film is the narrative or how its told through multiple jumps in time and characters. This film could easily have been very confusing with the amount of characters and story threads it has, however some how it manages to balance them perfectly. At not one point in the film was I confused or trying to figure out what meant what. Obviously towards the end of the film when all of the threads combine together, every single one of them gets a rewarding pay off. A very interesting and nice way of telling a story over many years and generations, kept it fresh and engaging to me as the audience.Overall I was really really impressed with this film and it did not disappoint with the outstanding cast it had at its disposal. I would say this film is a 75% out of 100 or a 7.5 out of 10 it is so so close to being a 8/10 but I just feel the film takes a while to get going, thats the only real criticism I have. However when this film does start going it doesn't stop all the way until the end with plenty of twists and turns. Would definitely recommend to anyone how loves Thrillers but also someone who loves character driven stories.",The Devil All the Time

The stories build hope for the express purpose of slaughtering it on the floor kicking and scraping. The story largely works on making the Christian faith out to be evil itself, I think that's a clear message here.I would give it a 8 or 9 for overall quality but I'm conflicted because it has an agenda that's disgusting.I see a lot of people praising this film.

122,Jared_Andrews,A Big Bummer All the Time,5,30 October 2020,"Depravity and delusion coarse through this movie. Radical religious figures suffer punishment. Decent folks in unfortunate situations suffer punishments. Murderers suffer too. In this story, there is only pain and suffering. That, and death.I suppose the movie delves into the troubles that arise when faith morphs into fanaticism. The story also examines blasphemy, religious corruption of the highest sort. Some of these explorations appear deep and artful, but I'm not so sure. After doing some exploration of my own, I could not find any clear messages, lessons, or meaningful conclusions. As far as I could tell, the religion-laced intertwined tales do nothing more than present brutality and misery for the sake of... entertainment? This is no wise sermon. It's unpleasantness for unpleasantness' sake.Ultimately, the move suffers from its overstuffed plot. The effort put into establishing multiple characters whose fates eventually intersect years down the road is all for naught. The moment when the characters crash into each other is meant to serve as the ultimate payoff, but since not enough time is given to the supporting subplots, the climax feels a little undercooked.There are times during the movie when I believed I understood the meaning, when I felt I grasped when the writer had in mind.

The cinematography is spectacular in framing everything just right with the pace and direction spot on too with nothing too flashy which keeps the tone of the film consistent.It is engrossing and captivating for the entire run time and it is not a short film so that is to it's credit also as well as the writers.

Bill Skarsgård was also a pleasant surprise, as a troubled man instead of the notorious Pennywise. The plot and how ""dark"" it gets, which I read excessively mentioned in every other review, was pretty straightforward and laid out in front of you after the first 15min. There's no ""horror"" to it and hardly any suspense or thrills, just dramatic developments. My biggest gripe was the narrator, ironic because it was the source novel's author, which I greatly respect but not when the narration literally spoils what would have been a suspenseful scene before we even get there, and then put me to sleep in the ""epilogue,"" AKA five minutes after the movie should have ended.

In three Bill boards the tragedy of murder is passed from person to person and we have a similar situation in The Devil all the time.But this films lacks the subtlety of inferred meaning. The murder, moral hypocrisy and misogyny are thrown in our faces and it's all a bit obvious what's going on.I kind of wished there was a supernatural element to this story, something esoteric and inexplicable bit for me it was all a bit obvious. The bad guys all eventually got what they deserved and so everything is neatly wrapped up and we can move on in peace.It's a bit of a shame really because there's are some brilliant performances and essentially there's very little wrong with the script, narrated by Donald Ray Pollock who wrote to book upon which this film is based.The profound message that runs throughout the film, that is a search for some inner truth extends beyond the microcosm of small town parish life to a deeper meditation on peace. The plot takes place as the US transitioned from the Second World War to Vietnam via the Cold War. Global events are a background noise to the relentless murder and death, the moral infection spreads to to smallest corners of the USA.This is not a bad film, it just kind of left me non-plussed.

137,Condemned-Soul,A solid crime drama with strong performances,7,17 September 2020,"A depressing plunge into post-war backwoods territory, 'The Devil All the Time' produces a grim web from various plot threads, but that web is sometimes too fragile to hold its weighty themes.It's a film littered with strong performances, but the narrative is bit too unfocused for the first hour; a result of its structure and characters, jumping between different people in different time periods. There's almost too much story trying to be crammed into its 130-minute runtime. Fortunately these characters begin to converge soon enough with some satisfying developments.This crime drama has dark subject matter throughout, tackling all sorts of themes such as religion, violence, corruption, and abuse. The characters find themselves entangled in these themes, reflecting the setting and time frame, and the film doesn't shy away from brutality.

Not in a good way.Everyone is just so ""bad"" all the time in this film it just becomes ludicrous and unbelievable. No, in history there never has been a ""Bonnie and Clyde"" serial killer team where one is a necrophiliac, and the other is a pretty girl who acts as ""bait"". Every time I saw them on screen I just rolled my eyes.Looking back, I still don't completely understand the broken timeline, and the inclusion of a narrator highlights the fact that how the story was told was to its detriment, because a narrator had to be included solely to help the audience understand what was happening (even worse, when a narrator tells you what a character is thinking, it's a failure in the narrative itself, as a film should never have to do that for you to ""get it"").It's a mostly boring and predictable ride that takes itself way too seriously, and I gained nothing from seeing it (other than now being very nervous about Pattinson's take on Batman).",The Devil All the Time

141,theredsky,The Devil All the Time Review,8,20 September 2020,"To be completely honest, I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did. Obviously I had issues but it doesn't take too much away from what the film did well. An issue I had with the film is the pacing. Certain plot points in the movie feel rushed as if it was a check in the box and not something the Director cared a lot about it. It was a lot worse in the first 45 minutes because everything happens so fast that it's hard to care about some of these characters. Once Tom Holland shows up though, the film gets drastically better. Tom Holland does an excellent job here and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed his performance. This is easily his best performance to date. This is the same for Bill Skarsgård. I love him as Pennywise in IT but I found his performance here to be much more engaging. Robert Pattinson is excellent as always and he did a really good southern accent here. This is definitely a Top 5 performance from him but not my personal favorite. Everyone else here did a good job but it was harder to care about their characters than Holland, Skarsgård, and Pattinson. Some people might be put off by the narration but I didn't mind it because it was narrated by the author of the book that this film is based on. It gave the film a book like feeling which worked for me. The directing by Antonio Campos is pretty great. He definitely has a great visual style and voice here and he is great at showing these themes of religious extremism and trauma. The cinematography and score also really added to the experience here too. Go check this out on Netflix if you want but beware of it's very dark themes and violence.",The Devil All the Time
142,Rino_Bortone,THE DEVIL WENT DOWN TO CREATE HIS OWN MASTERPIECE,8,7 October 2020,"The Devil All the Time is to be appreciated in every comma, angle and expression; a film that walks its own path without any effort among the greatest films ever told in this genre. The picture makes us delve into human stories, understanding their problems, fears, emotions, tending towards salvation and destruction, or vice versa. Antonio Campos immediately shows himself with great taste in the shots, in treating the various scenes as ""to be inserted in a frame"", telling us a story as if we were reading a book, with tact and crudeness; everything enhanced with the narration by the writer of the book himself Donald Ray Pollock (which gives guaranteed goosebumps). Tom Holland excels from every point of view, proving to be a dedicated and talented actor, flanked by a Pattison always on a clean, methodical and intriguing, delivering a strong performance, both pushed also by a Sebastian Stan who for the umpteenth time proves to be a actor not to be underestimated, who can give so much in films of this caliber. In conclusion, this is a film that offers unique emotions, a shot towards an apex of power and at the same time of sadness, collecting in the viewer every single piece of his emotions, putting them back in their place, in the form of an opera.",The Devil All the Time
143,joshbarton15,Netflix with yet another film for the best of 2020 pile.,9,16 September 2020,"So there's this new film on Netflix where Spider-Man, Batman and the Winter Soldier make up only a few of the oddball characters in the bleak and unforgiving crime thriller, The Devil All the Time, from Antonio Campos. Now, I'm going to stop right there and tell you that is a ridiculous way to approach this film yet it seems some just aren't ready to relate the actors in this film to anything other than the superhero films they've either already graced or about to. The three respective actors are only a small part of an ensemble cast that may just be the most imipressive of the year.Arvin Russell (Tom Holland) is a young man devoted to protecting the ones he loves in a postwar backwoods town in Ohio but when a number of sinister characters converge around him, he faces a true test against corruption and brutality.Our lives can be shaped by a number of varying aspects at such a young age, whether it be through how we are raised by our parents or what we see in the outside world. Amidst the backdrop of a small backwoods town in postwar America, The Devil All the Time is set when both family and religion had a major imprint on people, Arvin Russell in particular being exposed to a childhood of violence carried out by his father on others.Antonio Campos' film is quite an experience, taking time to settle into its surroundings and many characters but it warrants being a bit of a slow burner with a neatly woven narrative that doesn't shy away from violence, catching me off guard a few times throughout. It's an important part of the narrative though as Arvin struggles with finding a path in life that doesn't lead down the same route his father's took.Campos has quite a cast at his disposal and he really does get the best out of the film's major players, Tom Holland giving one his finest performances to date in the lead role that showcases a real sense of vulnerability amidst the responsibility to protect those he loves. Robert Pattinson is the scene stealer of the film as a rather unholy preacher that once again proves how electrifying a performer he really is. It's a film made up of many characters that we don't particularly spend a lot of time with but it's testament to Campos as director that he can get such good performances from his cast no matter how minor their role.The Devil All the Time is a meandering crime thriler that will hold you in a vice-like grip for large parts of its runtime before releasing with quiet but unflinching moments of brutality. It's most definitely one of the best films of the year.",The Devil All the Time
144,troy-daniel-bush,Second Favorite of the Year!,8,9 October 2020,"I will begin this review by saying that I think this is one of the best movies of the year and that it is one that is not for everybody because it is very dark, depressing, morbid, and the structure of it is pretty unconventional. It's for these reasons why the film has received mixed reviews. Anyway...The characters are distinct and interesting.All of the acting is phenomenal especially from Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson.Something that surprised me about this movie was how well-written the dialogue is. There's a line from Sebastian Stan's character that I absolutely loved. It's screwed up but honest. You'll know which one I'm talking about when you hear it.The violence in it is super effective. None of it feels cheesy, it's all incredibly brutal.The fight choreography is pretty much flawless.The movie is two hours and eighteen minutes long but it feels like it's an hour and a half!The cinematography is absolutely fantastic!Everything in it looks very accurate to the time period.There were moments where you could see some noticeably bad CGI, but when I say ""moments"" I mean they're very brief so it doesn't distract you at all.The narration does not throw the movie off track at all. It only helps it. Fun fact: The narrator of the movie is the writer of the book, and he's never done narration before.I love the hidden ""Screw you"" at the end of it. I'm not gonna tell you guys what it is. Look it up, it's awesome!Even though the film has a jumbled structure it's never hard to follow.Honestly, the movie feels kind of Coen Brothers-esc. It is by no means a rip off, it totally feels like its own thing.",The Devil All the Time
145,ssvfolder-1,A real taste of different era,8,20 September 2020,"This movie is an unexpected treat. I stumbled onto it accidently before going to sleep and I just kept on watching till the morning. It leaves you with a mixed feelings, the plot is messy and there are some coincidences that it's just a bit hard to swallow. Never the less this movie gives you a real taste of that era between 1950 - 1965 in the middle states, and in my opinion, it worth a lot. Most of the characters are much less touchy about matters of life and death, violence and gender relations as they pretty much accept that this is the way of life. Main protagonist view of life is much closer to ours, but still some may call him a sociopath nowadays.
This is a great movie, and obviously there won't be a follow-up, but I would definitely like to see more of the same kind, as this movie, for lack of a better phrase ""keeps you real"".",The Devil All the Time
146,douglasmcbroom,The Devil Made Me Do It,5,30 August 2021,"This film is about 45 minutes too long. It's also rather pointless and tedious. That blame goes to Antonio Campos who wrote and directed.

There is something very deeply unsettling and tragic about this movie. The violence is not gory but more melancholy. Every character is lonely in their own sense. Although, all of this have been picked up from the novel but this film picturizes those emotions very well.

Overall, a really nice film.",The Devil All the Time
150,chloegalley,Great acting !!,6,27 September 2020,The devil all the time is an American psychological thriller. The film was very slow and boring at first but it does getter better if you can persevere for 2 hours of watching a movie. The acting from Tom Holland and Robert Patterson was outstanding and was very believable. I would say there was not much suspense but I started to enjoy it more as it got better. A bit of a weird film and it depends on what you like. The devil all the time has mixed reviews so watch it for yourself and see if you like it. Not the best film I have seen but I did enjoy it eventually,The Devil All the Time
151,maanikroda,"A Bleak, Scattered Slow Burn That Only Works Part Of The Time",6,16 September 2020,"If Antonio Campos had adapted The Devil All The Time into a sprawling epic fit for TV, or even a three and a half hour tour de force, the material would have been better suited for adaptation. Conversely, even if Campos had dropped some of the subplots that populate Knockemstiff's dark and tragic history, and focused in on the section that shows Arvin and Reverend Teagardin's plotline, this could have been a lightning quick story of humanity's connection faith, and just what qualifies as good and evil.It's the most troublesome sort of dichotomy, as The Devil All The Time slips through the cracks and into the lukewarm waters of mediocrity. While the film is still enjoyable to a degree, the finished product sits firmly on the fence of either requiring a good trim to tighten up on one story, or a more free range approach to let the multiple plots build themselves more freely. Either choice could have made for a better feature, and in a movie all about the choices we make, the most devilish thing about it is that it chooses to do neither, dooming it to be damned by audiences and critics alike. It hurts to talk about how ok it is when the talent and resources available could have made one hell of a time.",The Devil All the Time

153,DennisBergkamp10,I think its quite overrated,6,2 October 2020,"I honestly thought that I would like it but truth be told its a largely underwhelming movie. I don't mind movies that are over 2 hours long as long as there is enough content to keep you engrossed over the long run time. The problem with the movie is that a few thin plots are stretched quite a bit to near boredom.I am quite surprised that Jake Gyllenhaal produced the movie but chose not to act in it. To be honest he could have played the part of Tom Holland better than the end product from Holland. Not that Holland is bad, but to me he is the Kristen Stewart of male actors with a one expression face. Personally I felt that Robert Pattinson was dreadful. His acting was cringeworthy at times but he has a face fit for a sociopath and so a lot of people think that he did great. If you like Bill Skarsgard I would recommend his recent movie, Villians. That was an entertaining, engrossing movie that doesnt stretch till eternity.I thought I would like it considering all the positive reviews but personally I think its quite overrated. The quality of the production and the cast improve what is nothing more than a very ordinary novel.",The Devil All the Time

155,mbhgkmsgg,Tough but powerful,8,1 November 2020,"Man, that was tough. Campos' The Devil All the Time is a heavy and difficult film to watch. It's long, it's slow and it's filled with one horrible character after another. Yet for some reason, I couldn't turn my eyes away.I really don't know what it was. This is exactly the type of movie that I would nine times out of ten, find to be extremely boring. It's almost excruciatingly slow throughout. Nearly every character just becomes worse as time goes on. This film also lacks a clear ending and beginning. The story begins in the middle of an already ongoing story. And it ends without giving any closure. Indeed, this movie is nothing but a mere 138-minute snapshot of the lives of a few characters living in rural America with nothing but themselves and their faith to live with.It's not just the slow-moving story, or the long runtime, or the awful characters, that make this movie a difficult watch. The Devil All the Time is full of disgusting acts committed by nearly everyone. It's brutal and real with how it deals with these acts. Yet for some reason, I was glued to the screen and I can't tell you why. Perhaps it was the amazing performances by the unbelievably star-studded cast, or perhaps it was the beautiful cinematography or the score that seemed to make every scene that much more powerful. Whatever it was, it affected me. It made me appreciate this movie against all odds.I really don't know who I would recommend this film to. Like mentioned, it is a hard watch. It takes its time and never really satisfies you, but I found it to be powerful. And I think that this is going to be a very hit or miss film. Either you are going to like it, or you are absolutely going to hate it. I would take that chance though, because if you do end up liking it, it will be an experience, to say the least.",The Devil All the Time

157,manuel_medeiros,"Brilliantly acted, slow paced, noir thriller",8,19 September 2020,"I jumped straight to this Netflix's thriller The Devil All The Time when it debuted, and it didn't disappoint me one bit.I was drawn by the impressive cast - Robert Pattinson, Bill Skarsgård, Tom Holland and other familiar faces - especially when those same actors clearly step out of their usual range by taking on a regional American accent.The film is staged in post-World War II America, namely between two rural towns in Ohio and West Virginia. We start by following Willard upon his return from the Pacific front, but the story stretches until the Vietnam war - it is, ultimately, a noir thriller that turns into a family-driven saga almost.Based on Donald Ray's Pollock novel by the same name, published in 2011. As for the script, it was written by brother Paulo and Antonio Campos, the latter is also the director.Having not read the novel or heard of Campos before - to be fair, he has few credits as a director in feature films, and his most notable directing work is on Netflix's series The Sinner - I went completely blind into this tale.I was very pleasantly surprised.The Devil All the Time is a thriller where the tension is always growing until the final climax, so it depends on actors to be able to transmit that emotional escalation to the viewer. The cast delivers perfectly on that.Starting with an emotional depiction of a war veteran Willard (Bill Skargsgard) in which we get to see a slow dive into despair tangled with religious belief, we then get rewarded with two memorable performances by Tom Holland (Willard's son) and Robert Pattinson (the new preacher in town).Pattinson in particular is spell-binding. He is very convincing as a Southern preacher who is as passionate in his speeches as he is flexible in interpreting God's word outside his church.
This movie might not be for everyone.This dark thriller is slow building, and you might not be able to pinpoint where the story is headed for the first hour - Tom Holland's character for example only shows up after 45 minutes for example.But the time it takes in the first half is crucial to explain the actions of characters later on. Only through this attentive look at their past experiences can you truly understand their dark, tragic actions as the plot unfolds.In that sense, the director Antonio Campos does a brilliant job of showing you the building blocks of those characters' character (no pun intended) and progressively speeding up the action and the tension in the story.With The Devil All the Time, Netflix adds another excellent movie to its pile of originals. A brilliantly acted, involving noir thriller where tension is ever rising.Definitely worth watching.",The Devil All the Time

159,punisherversion1,Wolf in Sheep's Clothing,5,5 December 2020,"The Devil All the Time
Directed by Antonio Campos. Written by Antonio Campos and Paulo Campos
I will say in the spirit of Not Christmas(Don't blame me for the lack of creativity, it was a black out kind of night) I was aware of my first and second picks. Antonio Campos is a fascinating director who likes to pick apart characters piece by piece. He did this tremendously in 'Christine'. Rebecca Hall helped fill out what might have only been between the lines of Christine Chubbuck, the script and the real life events.The Devil All The Time is a horse of a different breed entirely. It is no longer focusing on one particular character. It is focusing on generations of family members and the evil that might be drawn to them in their efforts to live a life according to God while also trying to push down their human emotions and desires. They live in an extremely small town. Everybody congregates at the church and everybody knows each other's names. It seems less like there are opportunities there and more like obligations. You stay because you have to and you stay because you know nothing else. Simplicity can work to declutter one's life.However that is not necessarily the case. Evil lurks behind seemingly innocent people. Evil lurks within the confines of the church. Death can be random and chaotic. One action trying to save your family only manages to put them in danger elsewhere. This really feels like a series of vignettes. They are interconnected and we have a folksy narrator there to put things at ease but ultimately not enough is known about any of them outside of the illusion of civility. Something we on the internet are all too aware of. The illusion of civility.The performances are all as good as they can be. Most of the women in this film are quite meek and subservient. The culture presented in the story lends credence to that way of thinking but they do push back when they're forced to and there is a calm and beauty in their eyes and their simplicity is something that is being strived for by the other characters particularly in Eliza Scanlen's character Lenora. She was born from violence but she has a hope that you just know is not long for this barren place. Barren not in scenery but in hope and joy. Everything creaks and groans. The salt of the earth permeates every article of clothing and in the bare bones homes they maintain.Tom Holland(Spider-Man) is taking his inherent boyish innocence and his bravado to a quiet place. He takes in these tragedies and he is trying his best to protect his family what is left of them. He is sacrificing his own potential future for them. A future he doesn't even know he has. He is quite good at showing the turmoil inside of him and with each decision he is forced to make.This is a quite long movie especially because of the episodic nature of the plot. It runs over two hours and we don't spend a significant amount of time with anyone. You learn just enough about them to understand the position they're in and whether they understand why they're there. If they're hiding behind the veneer of a preacher, or friendly travelers or the law, they're holding back some force of evil. They prey upon people who simply wish to live their life.I give this one a C.",The Devil All the Time
160,Dannyboi94,Very well made....but boring!,4,19 September 2020,"The Devil All the Time is a well directed, acted and shot movie. But it wasn't the movie I expected it to be. I thought I would see a film along the lines of Lawless (2012), as the movies appeared to be similar. While this film is wonderfully made, it is, so........boring. I found myself drifting off around half-way through. The pacing drags, and at times it can be difficult to follow. The plot bounces around, and it isn't until about 30 minuets or so from the ending, the film begins to pick up pace.
The cast is great, every single actors brings their all to the table, with the stand out being Tom Holland, even though he is barely even in the film. Robert Pattinson,is also brilliant here, with a very convincing accent, but he is underused and doesn't appear until far into the movie.
This film will appeal to a certain viewer, but I found it to drag at places,and found the plot to be boring and uninteresting.

Then we have the cast, each and every one of them deliver a stellar performance and to single anybody out for individual praise would be wrong - its pretty much an acting masterclass.

164,randymcbeast,You don't come across many classics like this one these days,9,25 September 2020,"I had no idea what this movie was about going in but quickly realized that I was in for a treat.The first pleasant surprise was seeing Bill Skarsgård appear. He was brilliant in Castle Rock and equally so in this film. The role fit him perfectly and his performance took the movie to another level. Harry Melling, Pokey LaFarge, Eliza Scanlen, and Mia Wasikowska were also perfectly cast and delivered many memorable scenes along with Skarsgård. There are elements of a movie that distinguish it from being bad or good or a classic. This is a classic thanks to the amazing job these actors did.Of course, the writing and production deserve equal, if not more, of the credit. This is a long movie but it flew by. There were so many surprises, twists and turns that I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through. The time period was captured brilliantly and the feel of the movie was deeply authentic. It's such a beautiful piece of work. I put it in the same league as 'There Will Be Blood', 'Miller's Crossing', 'The Green Mile', or even 'The Shawshank Redemption'.My only negatives are that I don't think Robert Pattinson and Tom Holland belong in this movie. They are just too well known (victims of their previous successes). Let's face it, a vampire and Spiderman should be nowhere near this movie. Thankfully though, the rest of the cast saved it. Along with the previous mentions, Haley Bennet, Sebastian Stan, Riley Keough, and Jason Clarke were also fantastic.You have a great one here so set aside some special time and enjoy every moment of it.",The Devil All the Time

If the film saw a different cut, with altered soundtrack and music to support the atmosphere and story it'd be four to five star film.

Willard is a man disillusioned and war torn, one who has a very unhealthy belief in the Bible and takes it to a sacrificial level once we learn Charlotte has cancer and dwindling chances for survival. Everything the young boy Arvin faced at a young age truly sets deep seeded violent tendencies despite the good hearted nature he possesses. Years later Arvin has grown up orphaned but has become a man with integrity above else. His path intersects with a Bible thumping preacher Roy, whose hardcore beliefs in the Bible drive a fine line with insanity which proves to be the mans outright downfall, and Carl and Sandy Henderson, both drifters of the sort that over the years have committed gutless atrocities as a couple. After the slow burn these three stories come to a face off and a high speed collision. As the saying goes, 'It's a small world' , as far as this conclusion is concerned we learn that that saying proved to be way closer to the truth in this small rural town.The decent into darkness we bare witness to in this film can very troubling to watch at times as it certainly doesn't pull any punches. The cast was utterly fantastic quite honestly and every piece plays a vital role. The direction of the film is beautiful as ugly as it gets at times. The long runtime is needed to build a solid foundation so that the end is ever more so gripping that it really leaves an impression once the credits roll.",The Devil All the Time
175,TheCasualReviewer,Jesus! These performances are nuts,7,17 September 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
Arvin Russell (Tom Holland) has had a very rough upbringing and eventually when he's older, decides it's time to take matters into his own hands. However, things don't go as smoothly as he'd hoped.REVIEW:
At the very beginning of this film, a waitress tells Willard (Bill Skarsgård) he has a ""nice face"" and I've always wished that a woman would just make a blatant indication of her interest to me like that. No I haven't considered the fact that maybe I don't have a nice face. Enough roasting, let me review this film.In The Devil All the Time, we start off getting a feel for the path this film is going down. We're focused in on different groups of people who reference God in one way or another and you get a true understanding of the title of the film. Anthony Campos has this way of making very beautifully dark images. He can throw it right in your face or it can be very subtle and it makes for some very good shots. The film moves at a very smooth pace and keeps you invested with either the story or what's happening in the moment. Now, it is a parallel telling, so we're going back and forth between different people and they're stories and there are some more interesting than others. The storytelling does make sense, however, I felt parts of it could've been done in a more clever way. It did feel towards the end, they got tired of writing and just decided to make things very coincidental and a lot less organic. I know people have mixed feeling about ""Crash"", but I do feel the stories converge in a much more natural way. Maybe I'm being too heavily critical, but I just think it could've been cleaned up slightly. To me, the best story is between Arvin and the new preacher, Preston (Robert Pattinson). You have this established friction between Arvin and faith and when Preston comes in, you can see the validation of that distance in Arvin's eyes. That scene between Arvin and Preston was... intense and perfectly acted. Replay that scene please and thank you.Moving on to the performances. Oh my goodness and gracious Robert Pattinson. Wait... let me wait to talk about him. You have maybe one of the best actors to never win an Oscar in Jason Clarke. Him and Riley Keough as this messed up couple was a joy to watch. One very disturbing image had me cringing. Then we have Harry Melling as Roy Laferty and in his very limited screen time, he's fantastically disturbing. Sebastian Stan was good, but I would have to say his part as the dirty cop was least intriguing to me. Wasn't fully invested in his part. Then getting into Eliza Scanlen as Lenora and Tom Holland as Arvin. Those two did a very good job in their roles and created a real emotion to both. I felt the essence of every scene they were in and I was always interested in both paths. The two standout performances to me were Bill Skarsgård as Willard and Robert Pattinson as Preston. Bill Skarsgård needs to get more opportunities. He could possibly be one of the better character actors we have today. With what he does as Pennywise and what he does in the film can't be ignored and needs to be appreciated by those in this space. You don't just watch his character, you feel it. You feel every decision he makes and when he does something it affects you on a deeper level. Truly amazing.ROBERT PATTINSON:
Now, Robert Pattinson. Oh my dear baby Jesus, Robert Pattinson. I have never been more #TeamEdward in my life. He gives one of the best performances in the last few years in this film and it's his best performance of any film I've seen with him. Woah woah except for Twilight I get it. Us non teenage women just don't understand what he did with that role, sureee. Anyway, other than Twilight, Pattinson gives the performance of his career. I was watching and laughing at it. First of all, where did he muster up that voice? What is it about a tone of voice that can really make you disgusted at a person? And I mean to add to an already weird experience you have with that person. It puts it over the top. If he came out talking like Morgan Freeman, I wouldn't have felt nearly as uneasy. Probably, would've been put to sleep to be honest. But then add that weird energy he gives off. This is before finding out more about him. Basing off of a first impression, you just know something is off about this guy and you immediately don't like him. He does act like a total ass to a sweet woman which I guess helps push you toward a distaste for the man. With every word that comes out of his mouth you hate him more and more and it's insane how believable he was in this role. Absolutely stellar.In conclusion, this film carries with through with intrigue and pacing. I was never bored with the film. I do feel it could've been tweaked and could've ended up a better film than it was, but I still loved moments in this film and could see myself revisiting it. 7.6/10.",The Devil All the Time

It's no use wrapping them up in art, murder is murder. In our example here, you lose track of the corpses you see. Somehow everything is intertwined and then again not. The story, which is held together by a narrator, is supposed to suggest something like art. In reality, ""The Devil All the Time"" is a pompous and boring film, and in parts badly played - Robert Pattinson is an imposition - that makes you wonder why it takes a film so long to tell its minimalist plot. All this would have been accommodated in an hour. And it still wouldn't have made a good film because the story is full of holes and is far-fetched. Without a motive, people are murdering each other through the landscape. Because they are evil? Yes and - why make a film about it?",The Devil All the Time

The Spiderman kid (that's him, right? Sorry I don't watch crap) gets a phenomenal opportunity to showcase his skills in a real film & he nails it. As does Robert Pattinson who has been on a roll off late, I guess. He really is carrying that Ed Norton/ Christian Bale torch forward. The theme basically revolves around men being absolute filth. It's a slow burn & has varying degrees of sadness in almost every frame. I suggest watching it in two sitttings (140 min long). Professional critics don't look too impressed (Metascore 57!), which these days, is a reliable sign of a great film devoid of the usual sickening tropes.",The Devil All the Time

I was surprised about the acting, good cast(!) And it was okay, patterson felt 'forced' at times trying to nail the accent and his character, but again it was ok. For some reason, this movie hit a nerve with me, with the whole God worshipping folks and people taking advantage of one another""in the name of the Lord"", but that was the point right. A lot of realistic bad things that can happen in your life and subjects you can relate to. Movie was nicely shot and the nice quiet places (woods, lake, etc...) Just adds to the sickness.

183,pronitmallick,The acting alone is enough,7,19 September 2020,The Devil All The Time checks out as a movie that starts with a slow and steady pace and goes on with it. The film follows a straight narration that shows different situations and acts at different times. Some of the acts will make you curious where others will make you feel kind of bored. The performance of the actors gave a good push to the film especially the performance of Robert Pattison and Tom Holland.

194,blackoutH,"The acting is top notch, but that's it",5,15 February 2021,"A dark and sinister movie, set on a village where apparently all the sadistic religious hypocrites choose to live in.As an atheist myself, and although I highly respect everyone's religious beliefs, I have a big problem when those religious values are taken out of context and used to take advantage of people, and also the ""false religious"" that claim to adhere to their belief system yet breaking it at every turn - so this should make me gravitate towards this movie right? Well not so much...The movie is set in small villages both in Ohio and West Virginia, and follows multiple stories that eventually converge throughout the years - the main one is of Willard (Bill Skarsgård) and his son (Tom Holland). William is a war veteran with some obvious traumas from his recent time on the war and a very religious individual (mostly due to his education) and his unbalanced personality, will for sure set the tone for the dark events that suddenly take place when the health of his wife hangs in the balance.While we see the trauma affecting Willard's family we are also presented with a secondary dysfunctional couple, one of them being a preach, another third couple who happen to be serial killers on the run and a final creepy new reverend played by Robert Pattinson.
I won't give much of the story to avoid spoilers, but its major problem is the amount of issues it tries to bring to table: violence, sexually motivated atrocities, religion in is worst form of fanaticism taking people to make very dark and awful decisions (that dog scene..), war veterans mental health and non of these themes seems to be actually that much explored, it somehow feel that they are simply mentioned.And another issue that complements the above is, it always has a very dark tone and includes often graphical violence which without a proper developed message seems to me quite unnecessary and without much purpose other than to weird out the viewers. Personally I believe the graphical violence should state a point, to shock to bring awareness to a specific theme, maybe that was the director's goal unfortunately it falls short since we get little to no exploration for the themes it depicts, it's a superficial narrative with a slow pace and a pitch of Hollywood action to it.
The only good thing about it is the acting, both Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson showcase their skills, as well as the Skarsgård, Bill - the movie doesn't make it for the great ensemble it has.",The Devil All the Time
195,Mcnabbbeasty,A Stylish and Beautifully Orchestrated Gem,8,1 March 2021,"""The Devil All The Time"" is an unconventional gem. I don't think this film got nearly the recognition or adjulation it deserves. In short, they need to make more films like this. These 138 minutes will make you lose faith in humanity. I had no idea what I was getting into but I was left shell-shocked. It is as sinister a non horror/thriller film I've ever seen and the acting was simply sublime. Holland and Pattinson displayed emphatic performances but from top to bottom the acting was sensational.

It's violent and tough to stomach at times, but it's also brilliantly acted and has some of the most intense scenes I've watched in a while.The best part of this film is Tom Holland. He gives an incredible performance, and this will definitely be a turning point for his career. The rest of the cast is top notch as well. As far as the story goes, I think this is a great exploration of the trauma and hardships that can get passed down from generation to generation. It also explores the monsters and psychopaths that live right next to us who uses religion, sex, and power to take advantage of people.The only criticism I have with this film is that it could've been longer. There's so many characters and storylines to the point where its 2 hour runtime isn't enough to give this movie the impact it wanted. I know this is unimaginable to people who can't watch a movie for more than 2 hours, but I wish this film was 3 hours.

198,sagetwo,Devilish good...,7,20 September 2020,"The movie revolves around Arvin who grew up with a traumatic past, and is surrounded by people blinded by darkness and/or religious delusions. Two of these delusional people are his father and his sister's biological father. His sister's biological father, a preacher, believed that God can cure his fears. He dumps a jar full of spiders on his head, and later stab his wife in the neck with a screwdriver. Again, he believed he can raise her from the dead. Similarly, Arvin's father is also a religious man who believed in God and the power of prayer. He killed Arvin's dog for sacrifice and abuse his son into praying intensely. Since prayers and the animal sacrifice did not cure his wife of cancer, he committed suicide.As an orphan, Arvin was later adopted. And like his father, he is violent and protective of his family. He brutally inflicts physical harm to his sister's bullies. And even killed the preacher who was responsible for her pregnancy and suicide. The movie ends with him killing three more sinister people.The movie is dark due to the deaths that Arvin witness as a child; and the deaths he is responsible as an adult. It is also dark because of the vile people filled with religious delusions. I read comments by religious people who claim these vile people heard the voice of the devil, and Arvin is acting out God's judgement. I think the moral of the story is religious indoctrination and delusions rots the brain. We should be taking accountability for our misdeeds. And Arvin taught me that we should protect our family at all costs. Sometimes, self-defence and killing vile people for love are justifiable. Until you can provide factual evidence of God and the devil, there is no rational reason to justify anything with religious faith. Arvin is the least religious person in this movie.",The Devil All the Time

202,andrewburgereviews,The density all the time,7,13 October 2020,"To be blunt, Antonio Campos is intense. Not only did he direct, but he also adapted to the screen a book so rich in content, that this was just begging to be a mini-series. Then again, what he attempted here is not impossible. Just look at masterpieces like ""Crash"" or ""Babel"". Needless to say, it's hard to pull it off. Those movies are what they are because they are wrapped in a greater idea, this is not.The movie takes place in a timeline spanning decades after the Second World War. It is cruel not only to its characters, but to their children too. It is a movie of fathers and sons, and how ignorance and aesthetic beliefs can destroy men, women and children alike. But this is not a greater idea. There is no discussion in this. Instead, it's just actual physical actions directing natural selection. The movie is labeled as a drama--and it definitely is--but it also has countless moments of humor. They are all topped off by Donald Ray Pollock as a narrator. At first, this felt like a cliche, but the way he delivers the ridiculous actions done by some of these characters which an unbridled seriosity, feels like something straight out of a Coen Brothers movie. And I swear I could mistake him for number 1 mustache man Sam Elliott.I will not go into the details because I don't want to spoil anything. The point is that while the first generation, fresh out of the Second World War is hellbent on religion, the second one is on its own survival. It makes sense. Campos takes a trip through the American badlands, both in terrain and spirit. Yet by stretching out this trip across not only space, but also time, he is missing out on a lot. Then again, he does get his concept across. Death surrounds everyone. But everyone had it coming. While the post-WWII Americans were killed by their own obsession with religion and ignorance, their sons and daughters were also killed by their own evil.This death-cause-evolution is a welcoming addition in a movie which began by seeming like a parody to Christians--it isn't. The pandemic of evangelism that swept rural America in the 1950s was not surprising for a world who just a few years earlier had a brush with mortality. Campos respects their beliefs and respects its characters, but they are made in such a way that they cannot help but getting into trouble. This seems more of a test of what actual faith implies. No extremism and no stupidity--it is a well-known idea among millenials and gen-X-ers yet one which hasn't been presented in movies until now.Well, there you have it, as much as it brushed past nearly everything, this movie at least slows down from time to time to make sure we get its point. But it's abundance of events sadly does not allow it to sit down and ponder over it just enough to achieve greatness. It's being chased by itself. The best part of it, though--Tom Holland in his least Spider-man-esque role humanly possible.",The Devil All the Time

205,Diablo1616,I didn't expect this to like it this much.,8,30 September 2020,"I think I may have loved it. I just don't understand the unnecessary critisism towards it. There's just so much to appreciate here. The length or the pace never bothered me. Rather I was taken into the film right from the start and that intrigue towards the story and these characters reamined throughout the film. I loved the tone and feel of the film and the lived-in quality to the film which works so well mainly because of the methodical and atmospheric approach the film took, without any rush, taking its own time to tell such a rich and expansive story spanning decades with so many characters that it becomes almost overwhelming to take it all in at once. But that's necessary not a bad thing. In fact, I loved this film partly because of that. Once you start sinking into the story and the characters, it becomes such a rewarding experience.The cast is absolutely great. Each one of the actors played their role with such honesty and sincerity that you just couldn't help but admire all of them. They are all brilliant. But the one that stood out for me was Robert Pattinson. I thought he was just sensational and a revelation. He has a small role but definitely a 'meaty' one. I loved and hated him at the same time. I also strangely felt that his performance was also a bit comedic particularly towards the end of his role. He delivered an excellently energetic performance. Tom Holland was great too. His performance was quite mature and unlike anything he's done before.The music fitted well to the film. It came in during just the right scenes and that made it's impact felt much more than it would have. I personally loved the narration in the film. It really helped to understand what was going on inside the characters' minds and also helps us get a sense of the larger picture of what's going on. I never thought it would complement a film so well but surprisingly this is a perfect example of why a narration is required. It isn't in the past tense, it's happening right then and is almost like an additional character in the film. The film is very unexpected and you'll not be able to anticipate what will come next. Things happen so quickly and so suddenly that you'll not be able to anticipate the characters intentions. I loved how the film came all together as the film came to an end, in such a neat manner. The direction and the cinematography were so carefully done and it helped a great deal in achieving the tone and the feel of the film.The themes are so complex and asks such deep and unsettling questions and I can see why many people may not like this film that much. The Devil All The Time is a southern gothic tale about faith and fate. It's dark, twisted, bleak and fascinating. It's a film that demands your full attention. It's a film that makes you think about yourself, question your beliefs and whether it's all just randomness or a divine intervention.",The Devil All the Time

The actors were great. The shots were beautiful. The story? Twisted and original. The slow pace (which fit the movie) and the lack of humor made me not enjoy the movie too much, but I was impressed! It deserves to be watched. Netflix had me watch some stinkers in the past (Six Underground, Love Guaranteed, etc.), which made me almost doubt the future of cinema.

The only good people in the movie get murdered or die. People in this movie commit heinous acts in the name of God or as a sacrifice to God to have their prayers answered. I really don't understand all the high marks. I stuck with this for an hour and my husband kept watching. He never stops watching a movie once he starts even if he hates it. I'm still in the same room listening to this garbage. I am not a girlie movie girl. I like action movies and thrillers with violence. There must be a balance between good and evil for me.

Holland seems a good, young actor...and some of the others appear to, perhaps, be good in another film. BUT this waste of film clouds over any sense of the basic who-what-when-where-and why.

217,Hex_0mega,Very interesting and drawing. Never really gets boring.,8,10 October 2020,"I'll explain the plot of this without revealing any spoilers, as I definitely think its worth a watch. Some people might look at 2 hours and 15 minutes as too lengthy or drug out, but when it is a movie like this that is done right and uses every minute of it's run time effectively to create a very compelling story, its really not.The movie jumps back a forth a little bit from different points in time for about the first half or a quarter and follows 2 main characters. The first one being a troubled man who just came back from war, and then a little later it focuses on his son. A lot of intense and tragic things occur throughout the film, and it always leaves you filled with anticipation to see how the next part will play out.The movie touches very heavily on the ways that religion can really corrupt people's minds, too. It gives prime examples of how some of these people who claim to be these big holy rollers and preachers and what have you use their reputable status and/or twist their own beliefs to preform very malicious acts and use God as an excuse to do such things to help them sleep at night. That is one thing I really took from this movie and appreciated.Its got quite a star studded cast too. Its one of the 2 or 3 movies I've seen so far with Bill Skarsgård besides the recent IT movies, in which he played Pennywise (and did a freaking phenomenal job!). Very impressive performance from him in this film as well, along side Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson who both delivered very strong performances as well.

The acting was a 10/10 from Bill Skarsgard to Robert Pattinson to Tom Holand and yes Tom Holland's acting was simply stunning . There were things though that the movie was lacking . Firstly , the tension . I wasn't anxious while watching and I didn't care that much for the characters (because everyone was a psycho) . Secondly, the movie is a bit too long and sometimes boring so I think the ideal runtime should be between 1.45-1.55 . But the movie ties the characters so nicely . In the end you understand everyone is connected somehow with someone else . I must say I went in with wrong expectations . I thought it will have more action and less drama .

He even spoiled a great subversion. Movie was really badly edited, could have shown those parallels much better with both old & new story playing at same time.The movie draged with little stuffs, high inspiration from Godfather 2 but that had heavy material to play out over the runtime, but this didn't.Acting was best thing about this, love the thick southern accents. I was so uninterested in the middle that I didn't care about Sebastian character and thought his sister was his side chick.There were 3 different ending, they decreased in importantness. Pattinson was important for Tom Holland, wierd couple with Holland had great thrillers but it felt rushed (best scene was rushed where previous once was draged).Could have been executed much better by having overlapping to timelines and fleshing out Sebs character with something better, his scenes felt like it was blocking the flow, transitions were bad.Violence doesn't bother me and I loved the gritty darkness of the subject matter.",The Devil All the Time

225,MackMonMay87,No Country for Old Plotlines,6,23 September 2020,"""The Devil All the Time"" just barely squeaks by with a 6 out of 10, only because I can't give 5.5's out on IMDB. And I give it that because of the satisfying cinematography and outstanding performances. But other than that, this isn't that far above average, and the 10 out of 10 raving ""OMG"" reviews are way too much.Like many, I was curious because of the stellar cast, but even the first 45 minutes with Bill Skarsgard's character could be cut out entirely, with all of what he taught his son and what he did in the past being condensed into a gripping monolouge delivered by Tom Holland's character speaking about his past.I get that this is a bleak story, but the likelihood that the area around ""Knockemstiff"" is *this* filled with corrupt, sociopathic lunatics is a lot to believe and very convenient. We get it: everyone around here is an awful person. Nobody has dreams, ambitions, defining traits or characteristics, or anything else much significant about them aside from their worst tendencies, which makes every character feel flat regardless of how great the acting is.
Spoiler alert, but the (arguably) film's only sympathetic character of course still gives into grief and tragedy, regretting her suicide attempt only to accidentally kill herself, which again, completely defines her by the most bleak, depressing thing the writer could think of. On top of all of the other constant misery in the story, it gets a little silly at that point.The movie shows us that faith can be abused and misused, but even from an atheist's perspective I felt this went too far. Like I said earlier, I get it. Now try to show us a three dimensional argument or viewpoint about religion, or how it affects character development. Nope, it's just used to make the characters do bad and crazy stuff.A lot of storylines such as Sebastian Stan's corrupt sheriff character only meagerly contribute to the plot and overall feel. If the scenes of him interacting with the local crimelord were cut from the film entirely, it would still make sense and still give the same conclusion. A slick con-artist of a preacher manipulating a town with one man knowing the truth, a pair of married serial killers, a corrupt sherrif trying to do the right thing, any one of these ideas could have been fleshed out into a whole movie, and this one gives us flat versions of all of them at once.Don't get me wrong, this isn't a total waste of time. The stellar and committed cast bring this imitation, dollar-store brand No Country for Old Men (an actual nihilistic crime thriller with a credible protagonist) up a notch, and like I said, the camerawork and soundtrack bring it up a few more notches also. No Country for Old Men or Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri, or even Lawless with Tom Hardy and Shia LaBeouf are all far superior rural American crime thrillers that have much more human characters and coherent stories.Devil All the Time? Nah, I think even Satan takes an off day every now and again.",The Devil All the Time

Positives ✅ :
The performance from both Bill Skarsgard and Tom Holland was really profound and persuasiveThe gloomy , bleak tones were a power point for that movie , that enabled the implementation of the idea well enoughThe soundtrack was Appropriately gloomy, more forebodingThe different ideas presented by the film such as abusing power , Striving to overcome obstacles to noble endeavors , the terrible consequences that could occur to someone because of their previous faults , The punishment of tyrants, the state of some people being in a psychological suffering and misery that prevents them from seeing things as they areNegatives ❌ :
-The voice-over was really unnecessary 😅 the only possibne reason for this is that the novel writer required to be part of this movie to let them adapt from his novel
-Some storylines are just there to serve only one purpose
Some talents are wasted on such a small roles with brief scenesThat was an overacting from Robert Pattinson , he really needed some supervision to guide him to perform perfectly , and Improvised accent wasn't suitable at allThe course of events depended heavily on coincidenceSome storylines didn't take long to build properly, just scrambling to move to the next step.",The Devil All the Time

Basically, the wheel is not reinvented, you have already seen a lot of things, but the shown is still convincing and everything is well and valuable staged.Religion and its influence on people is a central part of the film (is not everyone's cup of tea). Several storylines tell the story of individual characters, which are brought together in the course of the movie.Some of the storylines are predictable and due to the short screen time of some characters their backgrounds will only be scratched. Nevertheless, the characters are interesting and well set in scene.I was skeptical at first and did not have high expectations.

236,d_carlotaj,The Devil Never Sleeps!,10,11 October 2020,"""The Devil All the Time,"" (2020). Directed by Antonio Campos. Written by Antonio Campos (screenplay) and Paulo Campos and others. Starring Donald Ray Pollock as the narrator, Bill Skarsgard, Tom Holland (Arvin), and Robert Pattinson as Rev. Teagardin. As this film opens, the viewer is directed to a map of a part of West Virginia, the area around Nitro. Immediately we sense that the setting for TDATT is an impoverished area whose inhabitants are denizens of a culturally backward class of Anglo people. A narrator makes an appearance and introduces us to and informs us about the characters in this story in much the same way that Chaucer uses the Prologue of his Canterbury Tales to setup the structure of his verse. In TDATT, the narrator gives us glimpses into the narcissistic/supply paradigm through various vignettes or tales such as The Friar's Tale, featuring a specific character or characters. The predatory instinct of the narcissistic personality type is revealed through cunning and lethal imagery, both psychological and physical. Religion and prayer are tools in the community arsenal used to guide the pilgrim and restore order. Both tools enable the community to rein in the terror foisted on the community by the Devil, or in this case malignant narcissists preying on the innocent. So we have an enlacement (complexio) of the prey/pray adnominadio running throughout. When Arvin, the protector of his family, is trying to figure out to restore order to his community, he contemplates what his aunt, the elder in his family, would advise him. She would tell him ""to pray on it."" So Arvin decides ""to have prayer"" with the predators. He preys on them. He stalks them. Watches them. Reveals to them that they have been unmasked. And that he will seek justice. And deliver it. So in effect, it is the men of right action who enable the rights of their people. Men who are able to use common sense and analytical powers restore order because, you know, the Devil nevers sleeps!
This is one of those very special tour-de-force movies with all the stops pulled out. Excellent in every way. Screenplay, direction, acting, art production. And most of all...a message. A message which tells us what is the meaning of prayer. I give this film 5 of 5 stars. It's on Netflix. Enjoy!",The Devil All the Time

240,BestBenedikt,A bleak and vicious circle of violence,7,17 September 2020,"Antonio Campos' THE DEVIL ALL THE TIME is the newest star-studded Netflix Original and the kind of film we don't get to see often nowadays.Campos tells a dark and dramatic saga set in rural West Virginia and Ohio in the 1950s and 60s. Pretty much all of the performances are great and the narrative balances the characters' relations nicely and never looses sight of the bigger picture, even if the first act might seem a little overblown and it certainly takes some time until Tom Holland's protagonist even appears on screen.My main problem with the film - and that's somehow strange to say - was its gruesome and bleak tone. I'm usually all for dark dramas, but basically every character here is morally corrupt and acts reprehensible to an extent, where it can become implausible. The one-dimensionality of most characters, who are solely defined by being hypocrites, rapists, murderers or psychopaths, and the excessive use of voice-over certainly add to this overall impression.I would ultimately suggest watching THE DEVIL ALL THE TIME because of its obvious merits. But the film's goal of depicting a vicious circle of violence cannot avoid the impression of being an end in itself.",The Devil All the Time

243,smithpaulusmc,Netflix's Best in 2020,9,12 October 2020,"Netflix's 2020 drama thriller The Devil All the Time is a near perfect novel adaptation. Drawing its plot from author and narrator Donald Ray Pollock, The Devil All the Time is a visceral presentation of life in rural America in the years following the second World War. The film stars a host of powerful actors including Bill Skarsgård, Tom Holland, Riley Keough, Jason Clarke, and Robert Pattinson in perhaps his most intense role outside of The Lighthouse (2019).The film bounces between time, place, and character, drawing a horrifying yet undeniably believable look into the effect war, religion, and poverty have on small town society. I found the film undeniably beautiful, with every shot purposely underexposed the deliver a darker tone with a deeper color pallet. Equally impressive was the manner in which the film presents itself nonlinearly while still keeping the audience from becoming confused, an ode to strong editing.The Devil All the Time is a must for anyone who has a Netflix subscription and is worth opting into their free trial for those who do not.

Unfortunately, this isn't anything new and sort of lost me.

253,thatfilmperson,A true Gem.,9,26 September 2020,"If you liked:
Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri
Mindhunter
First ReformedMy longest review so far. This is the newest (2020) drama-thriller from Netflix, and it's a true gem. I don't understand people who complain that Netflix creates crappy things lately and disregard it as a film source completely, while still wasting their time to watch those crappy shows. Learn to filter. A billion-dollar company has to produce all the time, and obviously only a small percentage of that will actually be watchable. Now to the film.
First of all, it's a tough film that definitely not be for everyone. It deals with religion, violence, and death, so if you are sensitive about these topics and can't keep an open mind - you shouldn't watch it or read my reivew. The first thing that jumps into your eyes is the all-star cast. I thought that 3 famous actors (Holland, Pattinson, Skarsgard (Pennywise)) were enough, but I also knew e v e r y single supporting actor which almost never happens to me. At first it was hard for me to even understand who the leading actor was, because the performances were so good. Tom Holland finally taking a serious and morose role for once (and delivering!), and my admiration for Robert Pattinson just keeps growing, as he added another great unusual performance to his piggy bank of acting. Mark my words, this man will get an Oscar during the next 2 years, unless the Academy keeps screwing up the eligibility rules.
The word of the day here is delusions. This has actually been on my mind long time before I watched this movie: what happens if you lock yourself in a plain room for a couple of months, with nothing in the room except for food, water, and a bathroom. White walls, white bed, white everything; no books or tv, no phone, no interactions with other people. Just you and your head. Your mind becomes so bored and lonely, you start talking to yourself. You start to sometimes hear yourself answer, without actually opening your mouth. Maybe you get a football as a friend and name him Wilson. You can now have full complicated arguments with nothing but your own brain. Now what if you had a book, and that book was The Bible? You also start hearing voices, but this time you interpret it as God. And whatever now comes to your mind, no matter how absurd or horrible it could be; it becomes The Word of the Lord that you must obey.
I've always found the fact that people need ""guidance"" and interpretations to properly read the Bible kind of strange. God essentially wants everyone in heaven, so shouldn't everybody have the same opportunities to understand his book and his teachings by themselves? For an extreme example, how are you supposed to even have heard the name ""Jesus"" if you were born in 2020 in an uncontacted tribe (and those do still exist) in the middle of the Amazon rainforest?
This movie deals with extremes of religion-based delusions, some of which (like Christian all-forgiveness) are usually not even viewed as such. The main question here is: If the world around you is rotten to its core, is ""pray, love and forgive"" really the answer? If someone you love got murdered, and the murderer was left unpunished, should you still forgive, and pray that it doesn't happen to someone else? When both God and the Law are neglecting their duties, should their work stay unattended?
This film did not get universal acclaim because people do not like to think about these things. They consider it too dark an ""unchristian"", thus missing the point of the film completely. But for me this was one of the best films I've watched this year, and it would be my pick for the Best Picture Oscar.",The Devil All the Time

The story is awesome, the photography as well as the acting.All the actors performed fantastically, especially the gorgeous Riley Keough, grand-daughter of Elvis. Riley is not just a pretty face.Young British actor Tom Holland does it flawlessly, including a great accent. His two scenes fighting for his life were top notch, couldn't be better.Holland can really act, he is not just spider-man, and he showed it.Sweedish actor Bill Skarsgård as that returning soldier who wife dies, totally breaking him, is really commendable.The film develops in west virginia post WWII, taking us deep into each character, its motivations, and makes us think if it is ok to kill an evil person. of course it is not, but the film pops that question.Hollands character went on to kill in cold blood the priest who did bad to his little sister, prompting her to end her young life. how to deal with that situation given all surrounding factors.I loved the movie. and i would recomend it to anyone, and this effort from new york director antonio campos is worthy",The Devil All the Time

Um, not quite there...For a start, there's quite a handful of narration, which I didn't like (personal preference).A dark story plot, when not handled well, ends up just being another boring & dull movie. By the 40th minute I was already thinking of switching it off. I don't know why I hung on to it, probably hoping for some last minute surprise that could bring the movie to an exciting level, or if not, at least some proper closure to all that'd happened earlier in the movie. But nope, at the end of it, it was the same, just as dull as it was at the beginning. I'm impressed with Tom Holland's performance though.

264,mattmusko,Beautifully shot but senseless killing is still senseless,6,13 October 2020,"I can't say that I'm a huge fan of movies about senseless killing but I have seen my fair share of them over the years. The casting for this film is excellent and was shot beautifully. A dark sense of dread lingered throughout to help keep the creep factor set to high. Nonetheless, it's just another flick about senseless killing in a cruel cruel world. Tom Holland's performance and a decent ending within the last 30 minutes saved this film for me. The director is clearly a fan of this genre and has refined his approach over the years. I prefer a previous work of his titled ""Simon Killer"".If you have Netflix or can view this movie for free then give it a go but I personally wouldn't have felt satisfied had I rented it for a few bucks nor do I think that I'll ever watch it again someday.

I just cannot put my finger on it though. And I am not sure if I was happy or sad or angry after I finished my watch. However, I was intrigued throughout!

It wasn't a unique story it had been done and seen before. ""The small town where everyone knows each other then murders start happening etc etc"". The setting and costumes was great, really aesthetically appealing to look at. Good music as well. The acting is why my rating is high. Robert Pattinson is finally being recognised for more better performances than Twilight. Tom Holland is the same as well.

It's full of misery, loss, and irredeemable characters placed against a southern gothic background. Tom Holland's portrayal of a good man whose actions send him on a cascade of increasingly worsening situations is at the heart of this well-made flick. Good pick for an evening's entertainment if you're a Netflix subscriber.",The Devil All the Time
269,deandsouza15892,"Well against type, but worth the watch",8,1 October 2020,"Coming to you from the psychological thriller section of Netflix, The Devil All The Time aims to answer a question that audiences have had for years - Can Tom Holland play an adult male? This film throws the actors, in a very dark and depraved story-line, to show the audience that they have range. And before you dismiss it, I'd recommend giving it a chance. It should come as no surprise that this film is not for everyone; be aware of what to expect before you watch it.The story interconnects characters over two decades, around a few small towns in Ohio (think Fargo meets The Departed). The film also explores really lewd and corrupt themes, centered around cultist depictions of religion and a patriarchal abuse of power. The time jumps can initially be hard to follow, but I found that it didn't affect the overall viewing.Tom Holland portrays Arvin Russell, as he goes through a traumatic life as a child,and a hopeless one as an adult. He is surrounded by an ensemble cast,
all playing against type, which could leave you either intrigued, or cringed. There is a very sinful and vile aura that surrounds everyone in this film; there are no happy endings here.Regarding the acting, I'm still not sure if I can buy Tom Holland, who plays a 16 year old superhero, take up roles as a small towner, who smokes and swears. Robert Pattinson also goes into the extremes in his role as a sexually deviant preacher; with his accent and personality, there were times I thought he was lip-syncing, because the voice didn't seem to come out of him. The supporting cast is quite good as well, especially with Bill Skarsgard, Sebastian Stan and Eliza Scanlen.Even though I watched it after a heavy lunch and fully expected to doze off, it kept me in the loop. I don't really have anything negative to say about this film. The writing is consistent, the actors sunk into the roles, and the cinematography suits the tone. The only flaw, is that film is not meant for everyone, but I'd argue that its by design. Its quite long (clocking at 2.5 hours), but I found this to be a good one-and-done film; It was interesting to watch, but I don't think I will ever need to watch this again.",The Devil All the Time

271,CyricTheCynic,An Interesting if Unevenly Paced Movie,8,1 October 2020,"This movie kind of reminds me of a Stephen King movie in the way it portrays religion and terrible people. It is a veryyy slow-paced movie that sets up a lot of characters that take awhile to pay off, but it does pay-off in the end and shows how everything is connected. It is fairly well acted, however (Robert Pattinson just hams it up with his own bizzare accent though).

274,Lockout_Salties,Simply Horrendous,2,10 December 2020,"A movie as blatantly offensive, mind-numbingly boring, and downright ugly belongs in the darkest corner of 70s slasher movies, not anywhere near Netflix. The Devil All the Time is a cruel and nihilistic film that only exists to give the appearance of saying something, as opposed to actually saying something, which is a truly awful combination. Take, for instance, the movie's seething hatred for Catholics. All of the Catholics in the movie are either horrible people, or have multiple ridiculously depressing things happen to them. It's almost a bit comical: Catholic father? Crucifies dog for some reason (we'll delve into this one more later). Catholic couple? Serial killers. Elderly Catholic couple? One of their children dies, the other becomes a serial killer. Catholic teenage girl? Gets impregnated with the rape baby of a Catholic priest, and commits suicide. I could go on and on about the movie's clear hatred of religion, but I only have so much time. Instead, let's go back to the father mentioned before.In the movie, a man serves in World War II and is traumatized by a crucified corpse he sees in the war zone. He eventually returns home, starts a family, and becomes a faithful Catholic. When his wife contracts cancer, despite it making very little sense at all, he decides to... crucify the family dog, of all things. Now, a good movie would've clearly shown him have some sort of mental illness that led him to commit something so bizarre and disturbing. But not the Devil all the Time. All we get is that he loves his wife, he got PTSD from a crucified guy, and he's Catholic. Do I really need to say how disgusting the implication is that religious war veterans can't live a normal life? Because it absolutely is. When you handle with touchy subject matter lIke religion and PTSD, you have to be very clear about the message you're trying to send. Unless this film is trying to send the message that Catholics are inherently evil, then the movie has failed miserably.Moving on, let's address the thing that most people will be watching the Devil All the Time for: the performances. Whilst none of them are atrocious, none of them, save for the serial killer wife, are particularly good. Tom Holland is very miscast as a morally ambiguous youth that I believe was supposed to be the main character. I'm not inherently against actors being cast against type. In the film Melancholia, Kirsten Dunst plays the exact opposite character she normally does, and I thought that her performance in that film was the best of the decade, if not the century. But Tom Holland? A British twentysomething playing a Southern murderer? It's very distracting and strange, to the point where I had to suppress laughs whilst watching him beat up some people with a crowbar. And what's even weirder is that the makeup department doesn't make any attempt to make him look remotely believable. Not a fleck of dirt touches his face in the entire movie, as if he's somehow impervious to uncleanliness. Y'know, like real people! But in terms of acting, he does... okay, I guess. He just really wasn't right for the role. The rest of the cast are filled with people overreacting to high heaven, particularly the priests. I get that they're priests and supposed to be loud, but they are taking it WAY too far, to the point where they're teetering precariously on the edge of comedy half of the time. Have I made it clear that I don't like this movie yet?I suppose I shall finish with a particularly offensive line. Basically, the innocent girl character is planning to kill herself because of the aforementioned priest. But right as she's about to hang herself, she decides that she can make it. But it doesn't matter, because she slips and accidentally hangs herself anyways. The family finds her, and as they weep over her dead body, the narrator chides in with the statement ""they didn't know she was alright with her maker"", implying that suicide would've made her not okay with God. Again, do I really need to spell out how offensive this is to people? How harmful the ideology that depression is not okay in the eyes of God is? Moments like this are riddled throughout the film, but the two that I've highlighted here particularly irk me.Films like the Devil All the Time are incredibly hard to get through, because once you realize that this is the sort of movie that purely exists for the sake of shock value, the film has nothing left to offer. So you sit there, bored out of your mind, the movie only occasionally piquing your interest when the narrator comes in with his hilariously unnecessary narration as a substitute for good storytelling, or when the mildly interesting serial killer couple is on screen. I have not read the book this film was based on, but if it is anything like this train wreck, then I shall avoid it like the plague.Final Score: 19/100.",The Devil All the Time
275,davidjaldred,Dark.,8,26 November 2020,"I liked this for a multitude of reasons - reasons which I am sure others have expressed far better than I ever could, so here's my additional nugget: I love the narration (spoken by the actual author of the source novel) and the reason I love it is that the narrator will sometimes provide an obituary prior to a character's death, which both explains and makes pitifully irrelevant their actions, motivations, whole existence.

I was disappointed with the massive storylines they chose to leave out, but as far as the rest, I felt it mostly did the boom justice. I will say, Robert Pattinson was severely miscast. Being that he's associated with a tween series, he did not come across as dangerous and vile as his character truly is.

The ensemble cast, as expected, were excellent. You got Bill Skarsgård (Pennywise), Robert Pattinson (Batman), and Tom Holland (Spider-Man), but all with southern accents. Yes, this is a slow burn of a movie, but by the halfway point, things begin to heat up. It wasn't until the last 30-45 minutes that everything started to come together in a largely satisfying conclusion. But I admit, the movie is too long, and would have probably made for a better miniseries. And at times, it can feel like you're watching a book, which isn't necessarily a good thing. Besides an unfocused first half, the characters were interesting, the setting was haunting, and I had a better time than I thought I would.Score: 7 out of 10

293,chinmayarawat,A breath of fresh air from the burnout of Netflix films,7,26 October 2020,"TL;DR - A slow burner that manages to keep its script tight, and delivers more than expected.It's a slow-burner - a genre that I am a fan of, and picked it up initially because of this sole reason but was soon delighted to watch how they've fused the 50s and 60s era with a somewhat modern and refreshing story that doesn't have long pauses. Sure, Tom Holland looks a bit young for his role, but this instills a greater faith in his acting spectrum than his Marvel journey.Robert Pattinson, like always, is a delight to watch as he gives his 100% to every role that he takes.I liked how the subplots were woven together by the end and it was a nice and subtle ""ah!"" moment for me.The women in this film are very beautiful as well and reminded me of Kelly MacDonald's role from No Country for Old Men.",The Devil All the Time
294,BlizzyFoxTF,Great direction. Great script. Bad ending. Messy themes.,6,6 October 2020,"Great direction. Great script. Great cinematography. Feels like a Coen brother adaptation of a John Steinbeck novel in the first half. I was thoroughly impressed until the third act, which I think the film loses its focus and resolves weakly. Quite a shame because the final product shows a lot of potential. Had the ending been better, and the focus on established themes continued into the film's final moments, this could have easily been one of the best films of the year.SPOILERS
While heavy handed in it's delivery, the film shows from many perspectives how corrupted religion can become and how it destroys lives. At the end of the film though, the main theme somehow becomes fighting the evils in the world in general. This peculiar shift in focus is the film's major problem, and it also applies to Tom Holland's Arwin being the centerpiece at the end while shunned for a more sprawling narrative for a big portion of the movie. While I'm not against Arwin surviving, I'm certainly not in favor of the direction it takes to keep him alive. The film does not want to kill their prized star. They make it very obvious and it is a tad bit disappointing.Another gripe I have is how the film explains it's plot and themes to it's audience - it holds your hand instead of letting you decipher the ideas yourself. ""This person is no good, and also that person."" Look, I get it, you clearly showed it in your many other scenes. Why articulate it out loud? Those short flashbacks are also superfluous. Not everyone in the audience has goldfish memory, although the director thinks we do.Overall, Tom Holland's performance is good but rather inconsistent. Patterson did an excellent job as the pastor, although his terrible accent did stick out at certain moments. This pretty much sums up all my major problems with the movie. I still like it a lot though, because the direction and dialogue are truly above average.

296,blakestachel,Divine Violence,5,22 September 2020,"I found some of the themes and concepts to be compelling: violence begetting violence; eternal recurrence; the fatalistic structure of the plot; and the powerlessness of being a slave to some divine blueprint. But alas, the film tries so hard to replicate the magic of Miller's Crossing and the Coen formula. Ironically, it probably would've worked better if it had been more like its inspirations and doubled as an absurdist comedy. Its nihilistic tone felt flat without any semblance of dry humor to augment the violence. The lack of psychological depth made the characters and events seem cheap. The film's lack of insight into what makes psychopaths tick, hurt its attempt at a profound narrative.",The Devil All the Time

298,chiefjournalist,More films like this please. (Listen-up Hollywood!),8,17 December 2020,"The Devil All The Time is the type of Film Hollywood should be making more of.It's currently streaming on Netflix.The story arc ranges across decades, two generations of family, neighbors and hundreds of miles of Appalachia backwoods country in the center of our nation.There's lots of very familiar damaged characters here. Great performances by established actors and unknowns alike.Three Brit's turn-in flawless performances complete with southern tinged American Accents.Tom Holland (the current spiderman) is the central character. He play's Arvin we follow him as a boy raised by a hard man who becomes a cursed orphan and grows into young man in his grandmother's home.Harry Melling (Dudley from the Harry Potter films), plays an evangelical tent revivalist. His screen time is short ... but oh so very memorable.When Arvin arrives at his grandmother's his granny introduces him to his half-sister Lenora (really his cousin?). This relationship is central to the remainder of the film.Lenora is a pious young girl, picked on by school boys for her religious nature, she falls in love for a troubled young preacher played by our third brit ... Robert Pattinson.Saying much more would be giving too much away. But it's Arvin's defense of his sister that drives the rest of the film; and that defense has repercussions.This film is moved along by a serial killing couple and some of the most judicious use of story teller narration I've seen in any film.Director & screen writer Antonio Campos weaves a tightly wound yet never forced Appalachian Gothic tale. If this film is any indication he has a very bright future.I look forward to his next effort.",The Devil All the Time
299,porcgi,Overlong....but just about ok.,4,18 September 2020,"It reminded me of Fargo & O Brother where art thou? Though not to that standard it has a quirkiness similar to both. Whilst the acting is good in most places, the story doesn't explore the motivations of the characters...the reasons for their actions etc. I thought the soundtrack was great...lots of songs from the past. Tom Holland was the stand out actor...underplayed yet spot on. The film lacks pace...excitement etc....and as such just ambles along. The worse thing about this movie is it's length. It is way too long ....especially after the first hour...you're Thinking...what another hour to go! Best to watch in two or three viewings in my opinion. I won't be watching it again...it is ultimately forgettable.",The Devil All the Time
300,benmundie,Only Enjoyable Thanks To The Huge Cast!,7,1 November 2020,"'The Devil All The Time' is Netflix's most recent thriller with a fantastic ensemble cast, the standouts being Tom Holland as 'Arvin', Robert Pattison as 'Rev. Preston Teagardin' and Bill Skarsgård as 'Willard'. Pattison's accent is very interesting and differentiates him from the rest of the cast. The film tackles some very tough themes (religion, sexual assault and suicide) and gives each one enough time for them to be depicted sympathetically. Some scenes are very gory and messed up, especially with Willard when Arvin is a younger child. The writing and directing are fantastic and Antonio Campos (the Director) creates a realistic look at southern America in the late 60's. Nearer the end of the film the main protagonist (Arvin) starts to find himself going down the dark path that his father previously went down which led to his demise and nearly does the same with him. The final interaction between Arvin and Deputy Lee Bodecker (Sebastian Stan) is incredibly intense and really gets the blood pumping, which is another instance of the writing, directing and acting all being flawless. However, this isn't a perfect film with the end of the first act / the start of the second act being quite slow which leads to the film dragging. Also, I feel like at least a fifth of the film could've been shaved off in the edit.
Overall, the huge cast makes this an enjoyable thriller and I recommend if you have a spare two hours.",The Devil All the Time
301,allanwatts-02122,Crossroads for my rating,6,17 September 2020,"Brilliant story telling, great acting. My only issue was that the ENTIRE movie was orientated around one BAD male after the other, it was relentless. There was one bad blonde woman but she tried to come good in the end so that was neutral. So a brilliant movie which could had been a solid 8 I rated at 5 but settled on 6.

(Not everyone comes to a bad end, so no spoilers here.).
As others have mentioned, the acting was top notch. I've seen Robert Patterson in a few movies recently and I've been surprised with his acting skills. I've had it in my mind, as likely many others have, that he's just a one trick pony vampire teeny bopper heartthrob. But that's not him at all.

The first half of the film is slow pace, with the direction seemingly going to no where. The second half started with interesting turn of events filled with drama, tension, intensity, madness, and wickedness that led to a worthwhile ending. Too much score had been used throughout the film that gave mixed feeling, with some score being out-of-place and the others are just fine which granted a good view towards the show. Actors did a very good job, with Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson, and Hary Melling being the best performers from the film.

317,tarynabryant,Amazing Performances,8,17 September 2020,"Though it could be a bit slow at times, I thought this film was overall very compelling and impressive. Its' greatest strength is definitely the cast, as there were impeccable performances on all sides, especially from Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson. It's a dreary, dark slow-burn that studies the ways in which religion can corrupt a person and how dangerous such beliefs can be to a community. It gave me 'There Will Be Blood' vibes, another great piece of cinema carried by extremely talented actors. I'd recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of slow-burn thrillers with intense moments and deeper meanings. I can understand some of the negative reviews on here, as there were elements that were a bit lacking such as character development, but I was willing to overlook that as the film was interesting enough to keep me watching until the end. It's not for everyone, but there's definitely plenty to appreciate with this one. Worth a shot.",The Devil All the Time
318,cloudbuster63,Standard Hollywood narrative,1,16 September 2020,"When a leftist director who has no personal experience with Appalachia sets a movie in Appalachia, what do you expect? If you answered anti-religious depiction of troubled misfits, then this movie will meet your expectations. Anti-religious sentiment is such a heavily-mined concept in film today that if you really want to be brave and edgy, you'd write a pro-religion film. And setting dark, depressing films in ""darkest Appalachia"" is also beyond stereotypical. I think it says far more about the psychology of the writer and director than it does about the inhabitants of Appalachia. Darkest Appalachia is where urban directors locate their own darkest fears. Hollywood's Appalachia only bears a superficial resemblance to actual Appalachia, because it's not an actual place to them. It's where those ""others"" live, and they populate it with their bigoted stereotypes of what they imagine those others might be like.",The Devil All the Time
319,sebastianschlicht,The devil has left his mark everywhere!,7,21 March 2021,"In 2020 director Antonio Campos adapted Donald Ray Pollock's book ""The Devil All the Time"". From the title alone, I suspected that this might be a supernatural horror movie. Without spoiling anything, I can say that fortunately this is not the case. Instead, Campos presents us a pretty dark drama with thriller elements.The story takes place in the fictional Coal Creek in West Virginia, after World War II. Willard Russell returns healthy, but his internal scars are unimaginable in size. But he starts a family with his wife and son. But luck soon will leave him...What makes this film so special are the many other characters that later connect with the story. There is no real, central figure, even if it looks like it. Fates clash again and again in bizarre and disturbing ways. And the title of the film is omnipresent. As a result, ""The Devil All the Time"" is not a film for a cozy evening. There´s still a lot to appreciate: For example the nice camera work by Lol Crawley (yes, the guy calls himself ""Lol"") or the convincing actors. Especially Tom Holland, who is otherwise known as the funny, awkward Spider-Man. He proves how diverse and multifaceted he can be as an actor. I also really liked Jason Clarke and Sebastian Stan (who is also from the Marvel Cinematic Universe). And even Robert Pattinson can be seen as a disgusting pastor. The cast is very good and enjoyable to watch!In my opinion, the film portraits very nicely the dark side of radical, religious ideas and how these are often used against socially weaker people.
The narrator, who mostly tells the plot, didn't bother me. However, I found some moments a little too forced. The movie could have used a better balance between the dark moments and the lighter ones. It´s all very well acted and executed, but the bleakness oft he story can become a little exhausting and and not in a way the film apparently intended.The score by Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans was composed very well, but in my opinion it weakened a few scenes.Conclusion: All in all, ""The Devil All the Time"" is a strong movie. Here and there there is a slight lack of subtle balance within the narrative, but a convincing cast easily makes up for it. An entertaining, dark work about the depths of mankind and his beliefs.",The Devil All the Time

The movie showcased several sad, hopeless lives that culminate in death. There was an overtly religious tone that portrayed godless churches and preachers who preyed on the needy rather than praying for them. It was a sad movie without clear direction. The message may have been lost on me and seemed to only want to convey that sadness, violence and death is genetic and follows families for generations.Tom Holland's performance saves this film and makes it worth watching.

I gave it a 5 score, because it was very effective at doing this. It was like gawking at a tragic, bloody road accident without the ability or even the desire to assist. I feel disappointed for allowing my imagination to be captured by such degenerate material. Although this sort of material is commercially popular, it definitely isn't healthy. I couldn't feel empathy for those, who suffered, because rather than containing their suffering, their immediate reaction was to lash out with violence at those they believed was the cause of their suffering.

I really appreciate the efforts made by Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson to convey the dialogue in East Virginia cowboy accents which made it interesting to see these people on screen. The plot focuses on 3 stories which are basically interconnected among each other to create an atmosphere of mystery surrounding each one's death. It mainly focuses on people who are orthodox Christians whereas some are against it. The interesting thing of the movie is how preachers and reverends twist certain facts of the Bible and make it comfortable in fulfilling their personal purposes like sex or resurrection.

356,ryanmoynihan,Pretty Darn Good,7,22 September 2020,"Looks like this movie is getting a lot of mixed reactions and I can understand why. The themes in this story have been explored in very similar execution before. The idea that the sins of our parents can be passed on to us and create a sort of cyclical effect is not a new one. The Place Beyond the Pines comes to mind. Where I think this particular movie excels is, for one, in the performances. Robert Pattinson is definitely a stand out for me. His accent makes his voice so interesting to listen to. It's smooth yet slightly high pitched and weasily at the same time. He was totally believable as a slimy preacher who could charm a crowd with his words. But the performances are rock solid across the board. Tom Holland is great as an angsty teenager with a strong sense of right and wrong and a resentment for religion. Jason Clarke as a creepy photographer/serial killer was great. Bill Skarsgard, Haley Bennett, Sebastian Stan and all the other side players are perfect for their roles. There's not a weak link in sight. Not even the child actor.The music is consistently forboding, which I love. It builds the tension in every scene so well.And although these themes have been explored in more or less the same way in the past, it doesn't make some of the scenes any less impactful. The violence is brutal but it never feels pornographic (aside from the pornographic serial killer subplot of course, but even then it's played as unsettling rather than ""cool"") And of course there is the idea that violence begets violence. And that's here too. But I think Antonio Campos is a very capable director and in his hands these scenes play out with such a human touch that I can't help but imagine their worlds and lives outside of the scope of the film. They feel like genuine people to me.The way Antonio Campos frames the beginnings of these intertwining lives in the 50's feels nostalgic and deceptively calm. This is all of the love and happiness that preceeds all of the tragedy.I loved Christine. I really enjoyed this. And I look forward to seeing what Antonio Campos does next, especially seeing as he's able to pull in much bigger named actors now.",The Devil All the Time

There's extremely unnecessary narration through out the film that reminds you of a cliche 90's or early 2000's movie, it just doesn't fit at all. The direction of the movie is confusing for the first hour and 20 minutes, it's like the director was either trying too hard or not confident in what he wanted to do. All the waisted time in the beginning could've been used to develop certain characters but it wasn't so certain events felt rushed/forced and the main characters felt hollow. Also the story ultimately could've done without the excessive religious stuff, it ended up doing nothing for the plot. This film had a lot of potential because of the great cast but fell extremely short imo.",The Devil All the Time
358,meaningbird,The Best Movie of 2020 so Far,9,21 September 2020,"So I just watched The Devil All The Time and it is my favorite movie of the year where to start on this movie the cast I was a bit skeptical going into the movie because of Tom Holland who I love as Spider-Man but in other movies like The Impossible and Edge of Winter he was alright but nothing special and in this movie he is great I would actually say he gives the best performance in the movie which is especially impressive considering no one in this movie gives a bad performance. In this movie there are a lot of characters and they are all pretty good especially the most important ones and although there are so many that it can be hard to keep track of all of them they all are important and add something good to the movie. The action in this movie is very exciting when it happens it is brutal and unpredictable and that makes it even more exciting. Like I said when talking about the action in this movie this movie is far from predictable and that made me like the movie even more but I think another thing that made me like it even more is the serious tone and it constantly stayed that way which makes this not a movie for everybody but I really liked it.
Overall The Devil All The Time is my favorite movie of 2020 so far and I'm giving it an A.",The Devil All the Time

Gotta admit it's quite depressing and there's little space for joy in this movie, but I didn't really care to be honest. The movie is stuffed with great actors and this makes the movie a very enjoyable ride. Even though some of the movie might feel like a crime-tv-serie, there are more than enough great scenes to make up for it and get rid of that same feeling. The Devil All The Time has been judged for the boring storyline or the depressing vibe, but just look for the details during a second watch and i'm sure you'll see what makes this movie great (acting, ost, even just pause a few of the 'heavy scenes' and really take them in before moving on).It's a movie which has a lot to tell, and even wants to scream it from the top of its lungs. A movie which functions as a critical note on religion and the action that rise from it. A movie which holds a mirror in front of you.In short; it's heavy but its great",The Devil All the Time
362,adriano-40012,A drama & thriller movie you have to watch !,10,26 September 2020,"This movie was so good it would easily make it on big screens, but to have it on Netflix is is because of the pandemic. You usually don't get these kinda quality movies on Netflix off its release.The movie starts very slow and at some point I felt like its kinda boring me right now, but something keeps me watching. Well, then the story develops and the progress is amazing. Many subplots find a way to a main plot and that's the thing in this movie that makes it so exciting.It's the first movie of Tom Holland that I've seen where he's not playing Peter Parker. So I was hyped too see how he delivers. His acting was brilliant specially in the last 40 minutes of the movie. My God, didn't expect him to see him so authentic. He's the sunny boy with a golden smile we all know and then when the mood changes is or is serious in a movie like this his expressions and motions are clear and authentic. Fabulous work Tom ! He proved he can come out of the big bloster movie Spider-Man and play a different character like a top actor.Robert Pattinson... oh boy the cast is soooo awesome. AN actor who reminds me on Matthew McConaughey who played in comedians and romantic movie that I dislike and then here comes: True Detective, Dallas Buyers Club and many other fantastic roles where he played. Pattinson was criticized a lot by people for playing in Twilight, but this year was absolutely his year with Tenet & this movie right here and Batman in the bag. He's about to blow up !! Pattinson was convinced and I was shocked for how good he performed, when he played his role as the pastor with his speeches and imaginations he expressed. He was really creepy during the movie. I read some people even say he stole the whole focus and movie as a supporting actor due to his performance. I can admit someway you want to see him more and more.You miss a great movie if you pass on that one. There's not many movies in a quality like this. It's definitely one of my favorite thriller movies. It deals with faith, prayers, psychoses, delusions and evil habits of humans. I don't rate and know the director, but this movie is a gem. It deserves massive credits.",The Devil All the Time

365,SimonsRants,Not For Everyone,8,16 September 2020,"The Devil All the Time - 8/10 (Maybe 7.5, can't honestly decide)The Devil All the Time reminded me a lot of The Place Between the Pines but darker and more violent - and mixed a little with Lawless. It's a story that tells mirroring story arches of a father (Bill Skarsgard) and his son (Tom Holland); unlike The Place Between the Pines however, the emphasis is put on the son rather than the father which is to the film's detriment a little. Not a lot (see my rating) but I found myself enamored with Skarsgard's performance as well as his plot more than with Holland's acting and plot. Both are good, but I wish the father was more of the focus in the film. But that is only a minor complaint as I enjoyed both parts of the movie.For the most part the acting is great; Skarsgard especially steals the show but Harry Melling is also surprisingly superb. I say ""surprisingly"" only because I have not seen him since his turn as Dudley in the Harry Potter franchise and was not aware how talented of an actor he is. Jason Clarke and Sebastian Stan also put in great work and although I am not particularly a fan of Holland or Pattinson's work they were not distracting in their performances. Although, you could argue they were distracting as it was plain they were cast in this film to try to broaden the audience of a film that would likely have been merely a cult classic (and honestly, most likely still will be regardless.)This film is dark and twisted and certainly will not win any award for ""Feel Good Movie of the Year"" and is more of a character study. But in all honesty it is not much of a character study either as it remains fairly shallow in its study of the characters. So what is it then? It's a story of what happened between these interconnected characters at this point in time - the writers and director do not tell you what to make of it but instead challenge you to make of it what you will. A strategy that I am intrigued by personally, but rarely works among the masses. At least the general audience members in America.That is why I deem this movie to be more of a cult classic than a hit with the general public or even critics; from its dark subject matter to slow-burn pacing and lastly its ambiguity it will not draw in a large crowd. But those who are drawn in just might become obsessed with this movie.",The Devil All the Time

375,Nick_Milligan,Fine performances in a film that falls short of greatness,8,1 November 2020,"The Devil All the Time won't be the most uplifting film you'll watch on Netflix this year, but it may be one of the more interesting. Featuring a massive cast of Hollywood's darlings, this grim ensemble affair takes place in a microcosm of God-fearing Ohio towns from the mid '50s to the mid '60s, a world bearing the lacerations of World War II and drawing ever closer to the horrors of Vietnam.
Directed by Antonio Campos, the film features narration by Donald Ray Pollock, the author of the book upon which the movie is adapted. His Sam Elliottesque drawl gives the movie a literary, fable-like tone that contrasts with the grimness of the material. It has a Coen Brothers meets Cormac McCarthy atmosphere.
In a range of obvious ways, The Devil All the Time is about the stunning hypocrisies of the devout, and God's word is used as a justification for a range of atrocities throughout, that punctuate the running time like stabs to the gut. The Devil is everywhere, all the time, and one might wonder how the behaviour of these characters would differ if they were Satan worshippers.
While being finely acted, the movie falls short of greatness. The film is crowded with characters across different time periods and Campos' screenplay seems more concerned with the interlocking of the narrative than the inner lives or motivations of its subjects. There are memorable scenes - many, in fact - and then others that, in hindsight, feel entirely unnecessary. Wasted screen time.
The film could have, in fact, been much longer, to put more flesh on the bones of its characters (flesh likely contained in the more expansive novel). But the main drive of the story, that of the connection between father and son played, in different time periods, by Bill Skarsgård and Tom Holland respectively, fairs better than other threads. It's the spine of the movie, the depiction of the cyclical nature of parental trauma. That said, the film stubbornly avoids the ending that would have best served the material.
While Campos shot the film on 35mm, and the graininess is welcome, The Devil All the Time still has the brightly lit small-screen scope of, well, most Netflix movies. A little more darkness might have matched that within the screenplay.",The Devil All the Time

it turns out it's just a very dark story set out in the sticks and its most of its residents are scum of the earth. you have a couple of serial killers a religious nut who kills his wife believing he can resurrect her, a crooked cop, sleazy club owners, school bullies , perverted poachers a pedophile preacher the list goes on..

There was no message or moral to be found throughout the entire movie. It's dark and disturbing, which can be very compelling factors for a movie IF THERE'S A POINT (I.e. Requiem for a Dream). But there is NO point whatsoever. Every single character, with the exception of the protagonist and a few supporting characters, are terrible people, and they make irrational and terrible decisions. And nothing is to be learned from their actions; there is no underlying theme that the movie is attempting to get across. It left me very uncompelled. Not to mention, ""The Devil All The Time"" criminally underuses Robert Pattinson, while leaning too much on Tom Holland, who simply isn't a believable dramatic actor at this point in his career.

We witness in every character the incessant need of belief in something superior, either it is God or Death itself. We witness how cruel, corrupt, violent and mad, the human being can be.

387,gtessarini,"Choices, extremes and their encounters",8,23 September 2020,"Even with a rope, it might not be possible to tie the cores of the story of this Netflix adaptation as well as the script is capable of doing it.Based on a book of the same name by Donald Ray Pollock, directed by the semi-Brazilian director, Antonio Campos, and with big names in the cast, The Devill All The Time impresses us with the balance between the linearity and the cyclical flow of his sordid suspense.With the mix of religious fanaticism and hedonism at the center of the work, the story unfolds with a disturbing series of terrible choices and their consequences with superior characteristics.Involving wars waged between men and with God Himself, regardless of religion or lack of it, as seen in one of the characters in the film, the lustful pleasure or the feeling of satisfaction by the dogmatic rigidity of a higher belief form clearly opposite parallels, but with an inevitable encounter.In the script, a soldier returns home, tormented by the terrors of war. In a certain restaurant, he finds the love of his life in a waitress who is asked for the pleas of the needy. In the same place, an adventurous and perfectionist photographer is faced with another passionate and seductive waitress attracting her with his harmony.One will lose his wife to a cancer after brutal supplications to God, with the right to sacrifice and abuse, begging him to make it disappear, and the other will start a wave of voyeurism linked to brutal murders for many and many years.As a result of one of these meetings, we have the figure of the young boy abused by his father's flawed, fervent and short-lived religiosity.At the same time, we have the orphan woman who gives herself over to the worship of an exaggerated and God-fearing pastor. In yet another unpretentious encounter between religious, we have insanity and disbelief arising from an excess of belief leading to murder and another orphaned girl, as in her own mother's cycle.Against these two children, there is the growth of a pure relationship between foster siblings, soon affected by a further pastor who emerges ahead of their falsehood and seduction.In this production, at all times, we are introduced to chance's destiny and active choices about its actions and events. In any case, deciding to act or being coerced to such an act, there is not a single ""saint"" or innocent person who is not a victim of his own actions in any region where the two American cities set in the work meet.Not even the poor victim of a suicide that was not supposed to happen can keep that title for a long time. The actions that led her to this end were not only accepted, but the rope itself was literally suspended and tied around its neck by its own hands.With fleeting joys and extensive disturbances throughout the plot, with virtually no rest for such distress inflicted on its protagonists and supporting actors, the performances of his cast can really make you believe that so much suffering or apathy towards him is really being felt by everyone. - Maybe not so much for Robert Pattinson's acting that he doesn't seem to know very well the role he's been playing until the last moments.At the end of the work, another meeting between the cyclical extremes of the work. Two men embittered by the loss of their respective sisters. No innocent, but one more malicious than the other, is reunited in the first place where they were connected in their lives. This time, for the same motivation, but with intensely different purposes.With one coming to kill and the other trying to just live, doing everything in his power to do so, yet another set of personal choices and attitudes is connected in this set of stories in which, apparently, there is no connection, and certainly not there is no benefit.A growing energy that does not draw a straight line, the film ties the pieces of a puzzle together in a single line forming a very well-assembled circle, connecting each piece in a way that they meet in the most fierce and imperceptible way possible.Murdering Manichaeism and presenting us with a vision purely based on the pleasure and flaws of his fanaticism, whether worldly or religious, in none of them in the plot of The Devill All The Time, any of his characters can have a seal of ""good person"" ""Assigned to you in any of your days.",The Devil All the Time

390,bradersl7,Not everyone's cup of tea,8,25 September 2020,"This is a movie that demands your attention, it has around 5 different sub plots which all join together by the end of the film. With the narration by the author, Donald Ray Pollock, it comes across as a live action book reading which is an interesting concept and I really like it. I fully understand that the narration is not for everyone but I enjoyed it and it is one of the best Netflix films I've seen.The acting choices were solid and it's obvious that all of the actors gave it their all! Tom Holland was excellent as Arvin and it's clear to see that he is trying to be more of a serious actor. Sebastian Stan was a great addition as a corrupt police officer (Lee) trying to do whatever is possible to keep up his pristine appearances and will give it all up to get revenge for his baby sisters death. Lee's baby sister (Sandy, played by Riley Keough) does well to show the marriage trap that she is in with her psychotic husband (Carl, played by Jason Clarke) and you can tell that is breaking with the character arc from the start of the film to the end. Robert Pattinson puts in a solid performance and it's great to see him in a film so so much better than the Twilight Trilogy. He has made a real redemption in my eyes and is becoming a very credible and reliable actor.Effectively all of the acting choices are great, all the actors put a shift in and the direction is great and works well with the narration. There are points which could of been narrated but the actors facial expressions are always on point and you fully understand the situations that they are in.The movie, like the book, shows many different interpretations of what religion is. It doesn't matter what means in the eyes of people who follow it, no matter the religion, people do extreme and dangerous things to try and please their ""God"".

But their characters merely orbit around the standout star that is Spider Man's Tom Holland, who plays Arvin Russell with a surprising level of maturity and emotional subtlety that's deserving of a few acting nominations.The Devil All The Time, with its pressure cooker pacing, jumbled narrative and array of despicably complex characters, is not for an easy watch.

I don't remember the last time I watched a gothic movie that contained good acting, cinematography, screenplay, and just overall filmmaking. The acting was incredible despite a somewhat different band or group of actors. Tom Holland was great, so was Pattinson, Stan, Clarke, all the female leads were great. Skarsgård surprised me because he did such a great job. I didn't really notice the cinematography until the last 45 minutes, which was the best part of the movie by the way. The way they shot each seen, slowly zooming in on each characters face to see their reactions, fear, desire, that was incredible to see. The screenplay was great because of how the movie jumped from all these different timelines and characters, obviously in the end all these characters are intertwined with one another, which added to the epic finale in those last 45 minutes. The way they wrote the screenplay to build all of that up, build all these characters up and their different backstories throughout the movie, was also very well done. I think because if these elements it makes this movie well worth the watch. Very unique, very freaky, and somehow they threw in a somewhat happy ending, which some may not like.

Tom Holland has to convey so much with his portrayal and manages to not only convince an audience, he demands appreciation with his work here. His character is many things in the film: caring, troubled, stoic, intimidating and yet good-hearted. All of these aspects to the character are made or broken by the performance, and Holland nails every step of the way. Consider this a throughline in the film, as all of actors put in their best effort.The plot itself comes across as honest and grounded. It feels authentic in showcasing the best and worst of its characters and events. You'll feel uncomfortable and charmed while the switching back and forth between these two emotional states feels earned and natural.Unfortunately, the stellar performances and mature plot crumble under the weight of the cheer length of the flick. At two and half hours, the feature needed more to earn my investment. Several scenes and plot points felt predictable. The numerous plot lines and their interconnection were cleverly constructed yet unsurprising. Any challenge for the audience to read between the lines or the nuances in the actors' performances, is negated by overbearing narration that spells out anything and everything that could've been picked up by an invested viewer. It's pretty cool that the author of the novel the film is based on, is the narrator but it ads nothing to the story or characters.In the end The Devil all the Time is a film that can be appreciated for its honesty and performances, but will be forgotten because of its lack of memorable scenes and impact.",The Devil All the Time

I really like it as all the crimes here are based on the rottenness of the human heart and mind, and reflect mostly the existing reality. It doesn't matter whether you are a religious person, a person in office, or an ordinary person, you will never be free from mistakes and sins.I really like it when all the stories bring all the characters connected and connected to each other, there is no waste at all here. The story is explored perfectly by dividing the screentime of each character evenly. I also like that there isn't one character who stands out more, all the characters are very influential in the story here. The film uses repetitive scoring, with decent screenplay and cinematography. The tone that was delivered was diverse but still consistent with its main focus. Featuring a storytelling style with narrative intervals, this complex and long story has succeeded in making you not bored and being very interesting.Boyy, all the cast here put on an incredibly powerful performance. Even though it only appeared at the beginning, Bennet and Skarsgard were very successful in creating Arvin (Tom Holland) 's background for the whole story. the same as Bennet and Skarsgard, Wasikowska and Melling show pretty good acting. Rilley Keough and Jason Clarke succeeded in portraying evil and scary characters, and Sebastian Stan who also succeeded in evolving into a badcop with a distinctive stature. Scanlen succeeded in bringing the role of a vulnerable girl, Pattinson always amazed him where he brought the character of a religious person but committed a sin. Lastly, Tom Holland, boy, he managed to escape from his spiderman image, he evolved into a likeable main character who is easy to get the attention of the audience. I think Holland will continue to improve his acting when he plays more non-blockbuster films.I crowned this film as my second favorite Netflix film after The King. I hope Netflix releases more films like this.",The Devil All the Time
396,swishitsenthil,A very good watch,10,26 September 2020,"This movie has a really strong cast with some great direction and really interesting story. The movie is dark and violent and is really emotional at the same time. The performances by tom holland, robert pattinson, eliza scanlen are very strong. This movie is being under appreciated sadly since ppl are inflicting personal bias. Its a really good movie.One problem i did have w this movie is that the narration is kinda pointless and is to some extent annoying. It has the same vibe as some disney movie. The movie will be really serious and then the narrator comes in to tell u what the characters are thinking. He's basically j for expo because it seems like the writers got a little lazy.

While it's true the cast does a commendable job, they can't hide the facts: this is a hollow film. the narrative depends heavily on the shock value of murders, suicides and a few grizzly images; yet, the heavy handed story and ponderous, slow way it's told is a tedious thing indeed. The first hour feels like an overcooked introduction to a very lengthy narrative, that ties everything up at the end: it does not. It all falls apart into meaningless, lazily connected chapters.

413,louis_southwood,A very bleak movie with not much payoff to show for it.,5,16 September 2020,"The Devil all the time is a very bleak movie, filled with some of the worst characters I've seen all year. Characters who do some of the most unforgiveable things but at the same time wants you to care. This isn't something new, Movies like No Country For Old Men are able to portray a world filled with selfish characters only out for themselves with seemingly no chance of change or happy escape. Despite that the film is able to stay interesting thanks to the engaging story and well written characters, unfortunately the same cannot be said for The Devil All the Time, which I found to be a Jumbled mess of a movie with poorly developed characters with no one to root for and an overly long run time.One aspect to this movie that appealed to me was the cast, with the likes of Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson, Haley Bennett and bill skarsgård to name a few. Unfortunately, there talents here are wasted on some of the most unlikeable characters of the year. Characters being unlikable doesn't necessarily have to be a negative, it's been proven throughout the history of cinema that audiences find evil to be just as engaging (if not more so) than good. We relate more to characters with flaws and if the script can do a good job of establishing these characters then your audience will be on board. But here Evil is portrayed with such little nuance that it can feel overwhelming. As I said above, this movie is extremely bleak and that is due to just how nasty the characters are to one another with very little levity. Take Robert Pattinson's Preston Teagardin as a example, There are some small nuggets of character development sprinkled throughout to give the character some sense of personality, However for most of the film he is presented with such a lack of charisma and is awful to literally every characters he speaks to that it's really hard to see him as a real person and really it just comes off as comical in the end. At no point are we ever given any reason to understand this character and I am sure that's what the filmmakers were going for, I mean the movie is called The Devil all the time After all, but a little more development for some of these characters would have gone along way, just something else to latch onto to give reason to act the way they do so it feels less comical . Maybe not though, Im not exaggerating when I say every character in this movie is despicable, lots of violence, deceiving, murdering, and with no one to really root for this all ends up just becoming exhausting and kind of pointless.At times the devil all the time can feel structureless, with some of the storylines not feeling all that impactful on the overarching plot, Haley Bennett storyline for example felt as if it was from a different movie entirely. The third act does try to stitch everything together with all the different plot threads but it just feels so forced and weak. The final moments especially just felt rushed and lazy. Also a small nit-pick but the film features flashbacks to scenes that have already happened in the film, something that does nothing more than distract me and question why the filmmakers think I have forgotten something that happened 20 minutes ago, its more of an annoyance for me with movies in general and whilst not a major issue, it's certainly something that bothered me here and was done more than once.On a more positive note the movie is very well shot, it does a really good job of capturing the atmosphere of its surrounding, and despite my complaints with the characters the actors did do as good a job as they could. The Score was ok, and despite feeling very familiar at times it did get the job done and even improved some scenes. It is not necessarily a terrible movie, there are aspects to appreciate and its admirable when Netflix try something a little darker. But its not something I'll be revisiting anytime soon and will probably forget by the end of the week.",The Devil All the Time

I'm not talking about Jack-in-the-box jump scares, I mean legitimate plot twists that change everything about the direction you thought the movie was headed.There are also side stories happening the whole time, and they intertwine in such a way that some are just barely, and some are completely ties to each other.There are a lot of talented actors in this film, and every single one deserves recognition.

The movie does touch a lot of sensible topics so the performers really had room to flex their skills and it shoes. This is also why it might not be for everyone. But - I mean - there's so much shallow content out there, it's good to actually get something that really challenges you as a viewer.Really great cinematography as well. A lot of cool shots with great composition and a set of recurring visual motifs - hint: keep an eye for whenever someone looks directly up at the sky through the trees.I really enjoyed the structure of the story. Even though other movies use similar narrative structures - Magnolia, Cloud Atlas, Traffic - this one is particularly satisfying and cathartic. Also, while there's a narrator - the author of the source book himself, he has a great voice - there's almost no exposition. The ball's rolling from the first scenes.My only minor complaint is that some of the accents are off putting. Clearly, some actors have more of a talent for them than others.A great watch overall!",The Devil All the Time
426,JRodFilms,Some people are born just to be buried - The Devil All the Time (Film Review),7,2 October 2020,"Much like fate bringing together two strangers, The Devil All The Time attempts to do the same with its muti-layered story. The Netflix film starring Robert Pattison and Tom Holland begins with Willard, played by Bill Skarsgard, who returns home from war and starts a family. After marrying and having a son Arvin, his wife suddenly falls ill with cancer.Willard prays for his wife at his makeshift church in which he calls a prayer log. This is where he first teaches Arvin how to pray to the lord. In hopes of God answering his prayers to heal his sick wife, Willard sacrifices the family dog, breaking young Arvin's heart. Once his wife succumbs to her disease, Willard kills himself and Arvin is sent to live with his relatives, and is introduced to his step sister Lenora.Years pass and Arvin is now a young man, portrayed by actor Tom Holland. One morning at church,
the family is introduced to the new Reverend, Preston Teagardin, played by Robert Pattison, who gives his best attempt as an evangelical southern preacher. Tensions are raised immediately when the Reverend embarrasses Arvin's family at a service, and continues by taking advantage of Lenora.The story of Arvin and the Reverend is the main story while in the background we follow around a murdering duo who travel along the highway picking up unsuspecting hitchhikers and killing them. If it sounds out of place, thats because it is, and unfortunately acts as a separate film altogether until the final act. That's not saying the duo don't have their purpose in the film, including a memorable scene in the beginning in which a preacher lands in the duo's clutches and comes to face his own mortality.The Devil All The Time has many themes such as religion, god, redemption, and betrayal, but unfortunately never ties them together to make an impactful story. There are other films which tackle that subject better such as John Huston's 1979 film Wise Blood. In that film Brad Douriff plays a man eager to start his own Church and reveal Jesus is not the son of God.Much like the murdering duo's story that could be in a separate film altogether, The Devil All The Time seems like pieces of a story instead of one complete one. What stayed with me longer than the film was the wonderful soundtrack filled with classic country songs which had me pausing the end credits for nearly a half an hour researching the tunes.",The Devil All the Time

429,jeremyfrydman,Some People Were Born Just So They Could Be Buried,8,16 September 2020,"It felt like yesterday when I found out that my favourite book was being turned into a movie and this film became my most anticipated of 2020.But today, I finally was able to see the film and I can't help but feel somewhat happy but also somewhat letdown.I'll say that every performance is excellent. Bill Skarsgard and Tom Holland were most likely my two favourites. When I was reading the pages of Donald Ray Pollocks writing, it almost seems like he was writing about Skarsgard and Holland. They embody the characters of Willard and Arvin perfectly and I will continue to imagine them as the father and son. Holland shows some real acting chops here and I truly hope he gets some awards attention for his great performance here. I hope that he takes more roles like this in the future and doesn't just stick to big budget lifeless Spider-Man movies, I'm excited to see him in Cherry, if that still releases this year.The cinematography was great and the 35mm feel to it all worked seamlessly to set the old Southern tone of the story. I really respect the choice to shoot on film and when you watch the film the grain covering the screen almost comes across as dirt or dust and adds so much to the style of the film.The main issue I have with the film is the use of a narrorator. This films use of narrotation is the laziest choice I have seen in a film in recent memory. I honest to god would've given this film a much higher rating if they just removed the absolutely pointless narroration. You can tell what the actor is feeling, I don't need it explained to me that Arvin is feeling sad, I KNOW HE'S SAD! I'm also well aware that the novel had a narrorator as well, but there's a huge diffrence between writing a novel and writing a film. You can't see a character walk into a building in a book it's not a visual medium, in a film you can see an actor weep or show the emotion the narrorator is telling the audience they're feeling. There's a classic rule to storytelling which is to show, not to tell. This film attempts to do both and drags the excellent quality of the rest of the film down substantially.I'm also torn on the changes to many elements of Arvin's motivations here. In the book there was a real sense that Arvin not just had a sisterly love for Lenora but also a sexual one and I didn't really get that impression here. I know it's weird, but I felt the film cheated a bit not including that element. Also, the changed circumstances behind the films final act and the character of Roy are strange to see be changed, but I do not hate the differences here as they do progress the story a lot faster than the book.In conclusion, The Devil All The Time has some wonderful performances, ideas, cinematography and directing, however unfortunately the film doesn't entirely live up to the incredibly high standards of Donald Ray Pollack's masterpiece novel and the inclusion of narroration to dumb down the story is a very bad decision.Honestly, someone needs to make a cut of this film without the narroration and it would honestly be a substantially better film.",The Devil All the Time
430,Aditya_Dutta,Religion can really be the actual devil,8,17 September 2020,"The Devil All The Time is a slow burn, gritty and psychologically diabolical movie. While it does take its time to set the pace of the film, the payoff at the end is beautiful and worth it.The movie consisted of 3 different person's stories that tied up really well in the end and in a way you won't see coming.
For a majority of the time, you won't really understand what the movie is about.
But as time passes, you realize that this world is rife with deception of faith. It makes you question and judge the very foundation of religion.
The very heartless alteration of faith that is vastly abundant in this troubled Midwest belt of the 60's coupled with some terrifying acts.It definitely is one of the better movies released by Netflix this year.

The mutiple stories of devils are deeply inter connected.Tom Holland is incredible. As Older Arvin he comes to screen almost after 50 mins though. The Arvin at 9 also does his job quiet brilliantly.

So many movies on Netflix you watch and then a couple of days later you can't even remember them. This one will definitely stay with you for a long time. But a little caveat: If you are easily depressed or an empath, consider steering clear. It is a dark, evil world and it WILL affect you. I considered turning it off at a couple of points because it was hard to watch, but continued hoping there would be a ray of sunshine at the end. There isn't.

436,cornerofspace,"Gritty, but is it intelligent?",6,9 June 2021,"I think the film had some tense moments, some uncomfortable moments, and the acting was good, but the story just felt a bit too one-dimensional. It showed a bunch of terrible people doing terrible things and frankly, many of them did it for completely stupid reasons.The most obvious is the preacher in the beginning. Roy Laferty killed his wife on the delusion that God will resurrect her immediately. Even his friend (or brother?) mentioned how stupid it looks after he did the deed. Then there's Willard, the main character's dad, who killed his son's dog as a sacrifice in hoping his wife's cancer will be cured. I understand people do dumb things and will use religion as an excuse, but that's about the only message the film went as far as telling you. Unless the message was implying that gotcha! Religion is the reason for these violent acts! But we know you can be a devout religious person and don't use religion to justify moronic behaviour. This isn't really showing the bad side of religion, but more about how idiocy leads to terrible things.Let's talk about some of the other characters. The villains are rather straight forward. We got a pedophile priest, a corrupt police officer, and a serial killer. It is never explained why the serial killer kill people. Yes, he likes taking photos of soon-to-be dead people, but how did he get this fascination to begin with? And how does the girl just run with it for over a decade before getting tired of it? You can see toward the end she no longer wants to do it, but this was only done to create tension in the final moment between Tom Holland and the serial killer duo. Then there's the pedophile priest. He likes materialistic goods and dresses nicely. He gaslights how bad the food is so he can eat it for himself. And the crème de la crème, he manipulates young girls into having sex with him. Again the movie here doesn't try to offer an explanation for why he does this, and essentially shows, once again, how someone uses religion to act out bad deeds.Of course, the girls never try to decline his invitations. Not one was shown to retaliate, and Tom's character, Arvin, only suspected the priest after an officer told him her sister was pregnant. Arvin was about the only competent character in this show. His motivations were clear, his background justifies his acts of violence, and he shows intelligence by tailing the priest and taking the bullies down. Unfortunately the intelligence stops there. Being a serial killer, Carl, the story even explains how he is paranoid and showed how he removed the bullets from his wife's gun. Okay, Carl, if you were paranoid and a serial killer, you didn't see how Arvin was very uptight the whole time in the backseat of your car? The script only displayed intelligence when it is convenient. It is trying its best to show that bad people will be punished, so Arvin needed to be smart to kill the priest, he needed to be alert and calm to shoot the serial killer. It is this type of convenient story writing that turns me off. These aren't the only examples either. I haven't talked about the corrupt officer's arc, but there are dumb moments there, too. The people he killed just let him come into his house and take their gun, knowing full well that the bullets are untraceable.As a whole, I understand that the film depicted a bunch of average people going about their lives in the 60s of rural America. They lived in gullibility, made a lot of dumb decisions, and in turn resulted in a lot of violence. The show has no issue depicting uncomfortable things, such as paedophilic acts and violent acts. It tried to create a tense and gritty atmosphere in exploring the worst of humanity during this time.However, many of its characters actions lack thought and come off as idiotic. Characters were only thoughtful when it was convenient to do so, and overall lacked complexity. Killing someone was often the only solution the characters know what to do, and there was a lack of intelligence anywhere you looked. I don't think the film and its script wanted the message to be: stupid acts can lead to very violent outcomes. It nonetheless often felt this way based on many decisions and behaviours of its characters.Was it tense and gritty at least? Yes, but things will naturally be tense and gritty when characters are constantly facing the barrel of a gun. Effective tension can be created without such a direct manner and it was rarely seen. Overall, the acting was good, but the story failed to deliver an impactful punch.",The Devil All the Time

I'm not sure this film had a point. It felt like a Coen brothers film in places, and I think that's what kept me watching, expecting some sort of whimsical or philosophical denouement. But no. Nothing but misery and death for no particular reason at all.
Perhaps this represents something real for some unfortunate people, and they have my sympathy, but the point o storytelling is to find meaning in live, not to bleach it of all hope.

It's set in a rural post WWII town in Ohio and converges around Tom Holland's character Arvin.I like how most of the characters are more or less evil, and truly put him through the concept of fighting 'The Devil All the Time', of course a line in the movie. Arvin is one of the only innocent characters in the movie and we constantly see him being bent by the other characters and their actions. Though some of the things he does can be seen as bad, he is more or less justified in them.It's definitely worth a watch!",The Devil All the Time

I didn't mind so much, that it was so dark and depressing, but it was just horror after horror piled up on each other and going nowhere.

Also seeing these actors that I hold so dear to my heart in these roles makes me feel sick. I know that you need to separate the actor from their work but it was hard for me to do that here. Really great story nonetheless. I was wondering how the couple would weave back into the story again and I think that was done really well.

There is a difference between ""slow burning"" and ""not getting to the point"". I almost lost patience at times. The story makes little sense: each scene seems to have the sole purpose of getting you to the next scene.Who writes this stuff? Don't believe that because it quacks and walks like a duck, it must be a duck. Story telling is much more than that.But the cast was so good that it almost made up for it.Tome Holland appears around 45-46 minutes into the movie and you readily see that the guy has got it all...

I think Bill Skaarsgard was heavily under utilized butt it's very hard to argue that every actor did not do an excellent job. Directing was also excellent along with editing and location/scenery.The story line is where I think the least effort was given. By the end of the movie, it felt as-if there should have been a second part and I had to ask myself... ""what was the point of it all?"". I don't really have a complaint about the story line aside from believing it was driving somewhere only to end without ever reaching the destination.It seemed like an incredible waste of talent to deliver a movie that really has no point whatsoever except maybe that ""all people are evil?"".Worth the watch as the talent in this movie excels to the level of ""There will be Blood"" even if you're asking in the end.... ""is that it?"".",The Devil All the Time

It's comparable with Forrest Gump, in many ways, but is scarier and less fantastic, and is based around the similiarities between two generations in a family in the early 1900's. The movie paces itself, but its script and narrator's touch give it the right amount of emphases to the slices of life that the story shares with us. The last scenes are so action-packed that it brings it full circle as a reminder to the viewer of the old Western genre. This is all while holding onto the frantic pace it creates in the dark themes that permeate the storyline as well as the horrifying realism of the life-events we are presented with, within the questionable fates of the main characters. It's a story worth telling, and is hard to watch at times.",The Devil All the Time

Layer this with great acting and story telling, and I start questioning my score of 7. However, I have a dislike of killing off great characters performed by great actors early on in a movie and this movie carves through people I really wanted to get to know. I guess this was an inevitable outcome. Mainly to underline the title of the film and the devil being the protagonist, driving many of the characters' arcs.

Tom holland's, bill skarsgard's and robert pattenson's performances and i think they are the mot memorable thing in the whole movie.Cinematography was beautifully done.But i think that is just it?
I didnt like that narrative in every break between scenes, i feel like there are some scenes if left to the audience to figure it out it would be more interesting, also there was some backstories that i think was just meaningless? I mean ik that everything is supposed to be connected but that was bizarre and i didnt really see the point in the whole plot with the last act and twists being quite predictable.

The story features interesting characters and how they are all intricately linked together. The story is driven by the characters who are all morally corrupt in some way even at some point the protagonist. The performances are all brilliant, from Tom Holland's Arvin who had shades of Travis Bickle mixed with his natural likeability and Robert Pattison's creepy Preston with his softly spoken southern accented menace and don't forget all the other performances, every one is convincing.

It basks in horrifying images, graphic violence and just constantly senselessly messed up scenes that say nothing. The over dependence on a narrator to literally explain character's thoughts and the entire plot's development is hilariously pathetic. This is truly weak storytelling, exploiting horrific violence and the guise of some sort of religious symbolism to fool people into thinking there's some depth to it. Nothing unique is said in this movie, and it's a generally unpleasant watch. I like the actors, but I have no respect for the filmmaker.

The acting specifically was amazing, which makes sense with such an all-star cast. Even actors I've never seen before were impressive and those I already know (Sebastian Stan, Tom Holland, Bill Skarsgård, Robert Pattinson, Jason Clarke) did just an INCREDIBLE job portraying their characters.

Worth It !!,7,17 September 2020,"From Watching Tom Holland and Sebastian Stan together in avengers to watching them in this movie you can't help but notice how versatile their acting has become. Every character whether the role is big or small has tremendous significance and ever actor has played their respective parts Brilliantly.GOD is indeed a sensitive subject but a true believer of God is someone who knows where to draw the line, I am a true believer in god myself but just like me, we all know that certain people around us misuse the belief of god for fulling their personal agendas and some credulous people coexist for all of it to happen. The movie revolves around the same subject so what could be the Ramifications when God is Misunderstood and Misused? This subject with a touch of Karma is what makes the storytelling of this movie very intriguing.The movie starts slowly and I honestly felt that the movie could have been trimmed a little bit. 2 Hours 20 Minutes is probably a little too long for this movie.

The movie is a series of stories that run concurrent during the late 50's in to the 60's in Southeastern Ohio and West Virginia. (Most of the reviews I read refer to this area as ""the south"" which shows their credibility, but I digress...) The Director of Photography took a few risks with scenes that were shot ""off angle"" and often cut off top of heads or bottom of faces while the musical score was the same 30 second melody when something dramatic happened. Coming in at 2 hours and 15 minutes I heard it a lot! Finally, there was not real plot. No traditional good v. bad in this film which made it boring for me to watch.

497,mpiten-891-86828,Why isn't this a limited-run series?,3,23 September 2020,"SPOILERS!'The Devil All the Time' is an interesting film with fantastic acting all around. It is engrossing in its Southern-Gothic style and themes (even if it's partially set in Ohio). And it is one of the most disjointed, meandering films I've ever seen. Yes, the through-line is faith, the faithful, and how that is distorted and turned into evil by fallible human beings, but the variety of subplots -- trauma passed down from father to son, a serial-killing couple, a corrupt small-town sheriff, orphaned children, misled churchgoers, and immoral preachers -- yearn to be fleshed out. There's just too much happening in this film for even its two-hours-plus running time.You'll likely want more: more of Tom Holland, more of Bill Skarsgard, more distinction between the two settings, more backstory about the role of faith in the residents' lives, more explanation of the corruption in the town and its connection to its fixation on religion, more about the serial-killer couple, etc. There are so many threads and great stories in this film that it could sustain at least a season of a limited-run series, and probably much more. Look at the sprawling 'Castle Rock' and imagine what could've been done with this story, which I think could be much more affecting. Even the briefest subplots -- the corrupt sheriff and his relationship with organized crime in his town -- would make for a terrific, 'Fargo-' like criminal landscape that would enrich this tale.And the narration, while charming and well performed by writer Donald Ray Pollock, is intrusive in the space of even over two hours. I kept expecting to hear, ""The Duke boys sure were in a lotta hot water after killing that preacher!"" when the narration would unexpectedly kick in, and one shouldn't be reminded of that in a story as heavy and complex as this.MAN, I wish they'd do a series based on this story! I am now interested in tracking down Pollock's novels, but I'm still left with a bad taste in my mouth from the way this film's storytelling was bungled. Thank goodness all actors involved did a fantastic job -- because of them, elements of this story will stay with me. As they should.",The Devil All the Time

499,vs23,Just one nit to pick.,9,11 July 2021,"This is a great movie and my only criticism is that the narration was mostly unnecessary and did not always make sense. The acting is spectacular, the irony of the intertwined lives believable, the editing impeccable, the tone and ambience well established. It's a worthy example of Americana in its Southern Gothic modality, despite its Midwestern location. And it's a great critique of the religious-and so hypocritical-fundamentalism that has so hegemonized US society.In sum, I'm docking it only for the narration and only for its excess at that. A little of it would have gone a long way precisely because the movie is so well done that we didn't need a narrator to guide us through it.",The Devil All the Time
500,jakemelin1217,The Devil All the Time,7,16 September 2020,"With an all-star cast, the acting is all terrific, especially by Tom Holland, who gives a dominant performance as Arvin Russell. It's great to see Tom in these types of films other than Spider-Man. Pattinson is again terrific, on a streak with great roles in great films, and Skarsgard is great as Arvin's war scared father. The story is good, based off a book. The intertwining stories fold in well on each other, and the narration is good as well. The cinematography as well is very good, with nice shots of the West Virginian woods, and the golden sunlight setting. It makes you feel like you are inside the forest with the characters.
However, the film is slow paced and takes a while to kick in. It's about 15 minutes long in my opinion. Towards the end, the narration starts to get into obvious exposition, which I thought could've been done differently.
Nonetheless, the film is another Netflix production that you can add to your list for a dive.",The Devil All the Time
501,emmanuel-glenn,One of the most disturbing movies of the decade,9,20 September 2020,This is a compelling movie full of irredeemable people played by brilliant actors.

502,knighttanker,SOMETHING NEW BUT FAMILIAR,9,20 September 2020,"With such a star-packed cast I was wondering where this movie would go. I've felt a strong similarity to ""Bad Times at the El Royale"" except the comedy was replaced with more thriller.Again, with such a big cast it's obvious the runtime has to be more and some people could find it a bit too much. There were a couple of moments where I lost focus and interest but for a few seconds only. Overall the movie has a good story and ""nice natural cinematography"". This movie is very different from the stuff that Netflix usually puts out and I find that a good thing.The acting is amazing, as one would except with so much potential and talent. Tom Holland was the biggest surprise to me, he did really well. You'd think after being Spiderman for so long he could only be seen as the friendly neighborhood character. I've found his performance refreshing in a good way.PS: After hearing how Pattinson didn't use a dialect/accent coach during filming was surprising. My respect for him has been growing insanely rapidly in the past few months, but Lord Almighty he could've picked a different voice 😂",The Devil All the Time

encompasses that even in a house of worship, it is highly possible for a counter force to be at work, in this case, it being the temptations of evil and the corrupt devil. There's so much corruption and toxic wrongdoings that you end up rooting for solely one character, who is the metaphorical driving hope in the film despite the town's strenuous complexities.It offers great narration and also a great exploration of how each character's stories overlap with one another, fully bringing their small community and world to life gradually on film and motion picture.It is a great synergy of genres, namely drama and thriller, as it somehow always sneaking in an unnerving feeling of lack of trust in the citizens of the town.",The Devil All the Time

The acting of the cast was magnificent. I actually cried watching Bill skarsgard wonderful portrayal of the character he played. Nevertheless the rest of the actors especially Tom Holland did one hell of an act during the movie. Seeing a wonderful and realistic portrayal of characters really gets me hyped and excited even if the scene was so dramatic or tragic and what Tom Holland did had me jumping. The accents are a whole other thing. Robert Pattinson had this vicious and a little bit nervous way of talking which was really 💯. Sebastian stan's acting was so freakin realistic.

Like in most NF produced movies, there is no reason for this movie. No real tension.. Though casted with some ok actors, they all seem to be casted with no personality.. They are, for most of the characters, casted with a pretentious subtlety, that after watching 3 NF movies in a row with the same supermarket product, makes you promise yourself not see another NF produced movie again...

549,eugenelevine,Hard to watch - easy to appreciate,10,19 September 2020,"Netflix (as opposed to Amazon or Apple) is turning oiut high quality originals - both series and singles. The ratings for this movie are remarkably consistent, and I agree with all of the high ratings. The low ratings are predictable, because this is not a movie that will appeal to importtant groups of viewers. It was shot in Alabama (with the support of public funds), and I woukd make two comparisons:it portrays a particular place, community, era and religiuous communitty in honest detail (more on this below). And it tells its story in non-linear fashion.As to the first comparison, I think this portrayal of a specific time, place, community bears favorable comparison with Winter's Bone. However it has an additional--and I think remarkable -- quality. One ofthe criticisms of Philip Roth's early work was that it lacked affection for its characters and their community life. Winter's Bone also seemed to me to have a negative feeling about most ofthe people it showed us, and showed very little affection for almost any major charcters (except for Jennifer Lawrence's character).This movie presents people we might otherwise have no feeling for in a way that promotes understanding, compassion, or at least some degree of fellow-feeling, with the obvious exception of certain, specific characters. Even the worst of the characters can be understood on some level, and the overall feeling I got was of a time and place gone by, and missed by some. Elia Kazan's ""Wild River"" captured some of these feelings for me. So did Walter Hill's ""Hard Times"" and Robert Mulligan's ""To Killl a Mockingbird"" (and the posthumously publishd literary sequel).As to the story-telling technique, the easiest comparison for me is with ""Crash"" -- multiple stories and time-frames kaleidiscopically interwoven in ways that are only gradually revealed. One of the earlier reviewers here pointed out that the movie was messy but satisfying, and I agree.The acting was great. I must be one of the only people on IMDB who did not recognize most of the names (actors, directors, etc>) But there is no aspect of this movie I did not appreciate or recognize as a very high quality effort.I have enjoyed the parts played by Jason Clarke in other movies; Robert Pattinson, Tom Holland, and Bill Skargarrd were exceptional. Mia Wasikowsha, Eliza Scanlen, The cinematography and choice of locations and settings established the locatiuon with authority.The music is worth special praise, and the traditional music selection and playing by Pokey LaFarge were appropriate, moving, and beautiful.This movie is for adults; it left me unsettled and upset, in the way King Lear or certain classical tragedies do. I expect to watch it again.I agree that this movie is not for everybody. Certainly not for youngsters. Also not for people holding certain religious beliefs.There is some criticism of the length of the movie. It reminded me of a line in ""Amadeus:"" the emperor is asked what hre thinks of MOzrt's new muisical creatiion; he cannot think of a good answer, so he asks his court musician, Salieri, whatr he thought of it. ""Too many notes."" to which Mozart replied there werre exactly as many notes as were required. If you catch my meaning.The violence, which is a bit much, furthers the story, and without it the story woulkd lack the depth of engagement the movie expects of its audience..YMMV, of course.This is most certainly a dark and deep movie, well-made and well-played. I started writing this review with an 8 starrt rating, but as I wrote, I realized that I did not have any specific criticism to make, and that I was being timid because the story and presentation are so radical. I cannot find fault with the movie, though, again, irt is not for rveryone.",The Devil All the Time
550,reeseorta,This movie is like a Tarantino film meets The Witch,8,21 September 2020,"This movie itself is really solid, no complaints about any acting or the soundtrack or anything, it's intriguing and it's executed really well. I said in my title that it reminds me of a Tarantino film. How so? Well to start, this story focuses heavily on multiple different stories. There's 5 different plot lines that get followed throughout the story, and they kind of jump back and forth between the timelines a bit to start. Kind of confusing in the timelines, but wraps up nice and linear, similar to Tarantino films like Pulp Fiction. The old timely dialogue and setting helps perfectly capture a specific point in time but with a modern twist to it, much like Django or once upon a time in Hollywood. And good god, the use of violence in this movie is really good. The violence happens throughout, and has different levels of gore and shock to them, again, much like a Tarantino film. Sure the film shows a lot of things similar to how Tarantino builds the world in which the story is set in, but the actual tone itself is nothing like a Tarantino film. This is where I will compare it to the witch.This movie is uncomfortable to watch, it's all about how people are trying to live out these religious lives and how ultimately their choices lead them to tragedy. Ironically, the only person who is not dead by the end of the film is the one character who does not act religious whatsoever.
Same sort of thing with the witch. You are watching, feeling uneasy, then at the end all of the people who followed their faith and try to act like good people instead of just being good people, end up dead. It's about how bad comes out of good and vice versa.Overall I'd say the movie is really good. It wraps up nicely, I would say the first 45 minutes are the world building so you can understand how they all connect as the rest of the plot goes on and concludes itself. Masterfully put together, acting was good, shock value varies and is used appropriately, the characters often show both their good and bad side so there's a lot of moral gray, but simultaneously the outcome stays the same for most characters. Only issue I'd say is the movie near the end is a TAD bit too predictable, I often found myself being able to guess what was about to happen. Though I guess that does mean that the movie did a good job and keeping me interested the whole way through.",The Devil All the Time

556,thomasaschmidt,Everything is eternal return,8,21 November 2020,"German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche wrote around 1900 in his works: Everything is an eternal return (Alles ist ewige Wiederkehr.). This could be the leitmotiv of this wonderful and precious movie, which is full of excellent actors. The film tells an American family story that begins in a place of horror in World War II and runs into the 1970s. I can recommend the film strongly to everybody who is interested in family history, but also interested in the question, how fragile every building of happiness we try to build is, how fragile everything is that we can create in a lifetime, and that often the others who infiltrate into our lives, destroy to dust what we are building. This cycle of creation and destruction is the metaphor of this film, which underlines the leitmotif once again. Outstanding are Riley Keough and Robert Pattinson representing an excellent cast. The direction is heavily focused on the actors' work and the transport of the plot. The camera brilliantly captures the light of the Midwest. The film dramaturgy and the script are outstanding, telling us the lives of two generations compactly and vividly in two hours. Highly recommended.",The Devil All the Time

It's almost as if the writers and directors think they can carry the movie no matter how bad it is. What seemed like a promising beginning ended up going no where until the end. The main plot points in this movie boil down to just simple convenience. How is it that Tom Holland's character's car just breaks down at the right time to allow him to wait by a street to get picked up just to encounter Sally and Carl? Is the officer really going back to that place where he first found Holland's character as a child just because he has a suspicion? Anyways, what even is the message behind this story? That killing is fine so long as it's backed up by revenge? There was nothing driving the film forward. It was just a bunch of evil individuals living their lives.

People who are religious will not like this movie, if you have faith in mankind this movie will make you take a hit on that as well.The title says it all; The Devil All The Time. This Movie Follows a chain of events where people with faith are getting take advantage off by perverted individuals or people that have been driven crazy by religion. The story's main protagonist is Arvin, The only son from Willard (an ex-WW2 soldier) and Charlotte (an Waitress). When Arvin is 9 his mother is dying from an illnes, and Even though Arvin's father is obsessed with praying it doesn't save his mother. But Arvin's father (Willard) also teaches him to choose the right time to get back at somebody and take faith in your own hands. And that is what this movie is teaching us. There is no god protecting us and the people who believe so are being taken advantage off by the devil.

The way the film is shot, along with the performances, gives you the impression that if you stick out the slow pace you will be rewarded. Unfortunately, when the film ends it fails to provide a purpose for what you viewed. Normally, when a film evokes sadness that evolves into a borderline depression, I can appreciate the emotion the film provoked and praise it for its effectiveness. By the end it didn't feee effective. Like Out of the Furnace, I couldn't help but feel that what I viewed failed to offer any value. Exceptional performances and a professional ascetic couldn't make up for the frankly outlandish jumble of characters this film presented. Deeply depressing with no silver lining. Nonetheless I would recommend this film for its ability to truly get under your skin.

Very well cast, extremely well acted by every single person in the movie (and that's something I rarely say). I predicted the majority of the ending a little more than half way through the film, but that's not saying much considering how many movies I've watched in my life. One of my very few negative comments is that I had hoped to m discover who the narrator of the movie was, but now that I know it was based on a book I supposed I just have to accept that he's just a narrator. Also, I wish there was just little bit more character development for two or three people, but since it's already a relatively long movie it was an acceptable loss.Dark and very depressing for a good chunk of the duration, but for the most part I was very happy with how everything concluded and would highly recommend this to anyone who can appreciate something that takes this type of direction.

Robert Pattinson's performance is perfection. Tom Holland did a great job, his character Arvin, that poor kid couldn't catch a break.This movie is excellent. It's gripping, it keeps you guessing and glued to the TV, it's also very sad.

On faith that turns people into frenzied demons, on the wolf in the garment of the lamb and the cloak of the Savior, on the broken and defeated innocence, on the delusions of sanctity and purity and the illusion of falling into guilt and sin, on religion as a weapon and as an excuse. About escaping from the reality and nature of the human psyche. On the authority of the American who crystallized his personality between World War II and the Vietnam War and extends to today. About a scenario that spreads his story and then combines it with sophistication and narration with breathtaking scenes, a scenario that deserves an Oscar nomination for weaving its events and drafting its characters, a scenario for those interested in studying the scenario. For the proper use of the narrator. On the brilliant acting of young talents, led by Tom Holland. Sandy turns in front of the returning young man from Vietnam, Roy eyes, and Lenora backs off.

587,sarawatch,The Devil was here alright.,7,17 September 2020,"This movie is full of ickiness. However, in the midst of all the ickiness are captivating performances by a capable cast. Tom Holland, which we are most familiar with in the latest iteration of our friendly neighborhood Spiderman, does well in shedding his clean cut high school genius image here. We see him as a good person who finds himself in bad situations he didnt ask for. He is emotionally damaged from horrible things he had to endure, but the good in him still fights for the spotlight. Robert Pattinson on the other hand, is no longer that sparkling pseudo-vampire of the 2010s. Here, he is an opportunistic, manuplative, and condenscending preacher, who gets you to squirm in your seat from how sleazy he is. Although his charater has little to no redeeming qualities, you cant help but appreciate Pattinson's performance. Bill Skarsgard is another of many impressive performances. One cannot help but share his joy and his pain. Others include the always convincing Harry Melling, and Mia Wasikowska, who share what I believe the craziest and swiftest storyline of the whole movie.
This movie is violent and dark, and will most likely leave some unwanted images in your brain. However, its many characters and many storylines spread over a number of time periods, which could be confusing and altogether an unnecessary way to stretch the runtime. It could have been 20 minutes shorter.
The movie's blindly-religious overtones, and little Appalacian town in the middle of Nowhere, USA setting are bold and intriguing, and it is generally a pretty well-done movie.",The Devil All the Time

589,bijoubrown,Guy Thinks He Can Resurrect His Wife by Killing Her,10,17 September 2020,"It's an awesome movie to watch.
This movie was what I would imagine a greek tragedy to be, played out in an ancient forum fraught with blood and sex and perturbed beauty.
This movie was slow, but in a satisfying direction: tons of anguish and surgical methodology. In its approach it was borderline cult: judged in the foreseen but not metabolized in the current.
The plot was nonlinear, anchored by an omnipresent narrator. Normally in these movies the narrator is persistent; however, this is amongst the unique spectacles for which a viewer may not be annoyed by an all-knowing overseer.
The plot comes together. The characters are clear in their individual directives; so the ensemble-based narrative works well.
To speak of the thematic elements is convoluted; the perspective lies within the main cross to ladder derivative: a cross is present whenever violence occurs, indicative of a hyperbolic directive laced with malice and solemnity. Evil exists within innocence and innocence exists within evil. Every time you see a cross it's as if a higher sign of evil or human error to come.
Another motif was characters looking up into the ""heavens"", whether it be treetops or clouds. Maybe drifting into a collective hovering existence binds our knowledge of mortality. Everyone was tied together in this plot, which made the end so enduringly cathartic. I was excited and fearful for the protagonist, a feeling coveted in the viewer's perspective.
The plot may have been a bit predicable, but I don't think it's bad in that it hints to the viewer that the narrator was rooting for the hero who may have turned out to be a forlorn serial killer himself.",The Devil All the Time

There is no back stories of the characters which completely ruins the story. Few of the characters which were supposed to look one way look completely opposite in the movie. The acting seemed over the top. Even the much hyped Robert Pattinson couldn't save this mindless adaptation. I couldn't go even half way through. Just getting famous actors won't save a bad movie.

615,ictrw,PTA Wannabe,6,29 September 2020,"The Devil All The Time is an ambitious film that any cinephile can recognize as a ""pursuit of perfection"" in by the writer. What makes it fall very short of the mark is its lack of originality. What's essentially a 130 minute long metaphor, that aims to use a single character as a vessel for good vs. evil, is simply basic and drab when it draws to the conclusion. Its American Gothic style bows at the feet of giants who have mastered it before such as Paul Thomas Anderson and the Coen Brothers. It does come with some gems though, such as a stellar performance from Robert Pattinson and an even better one from Tom Holland. It's a film that keeps your attention, even though it's terribly predictable. It's entertaining, but not an awe inspiring tale that Netflix and all other parties really hoped for.

628,padgetdl,Southern Gothic Revival,8,23 November 2020,"I have long been a fan of the Southern Gothic genre that critiques what we accept as normal while also telling a good damn story and this film has done both. Loved Tom Holland as Arvin and the chicken liver scene was one of my favorites in recent history. The omniscient narration made it feel like the god - who seemed to only betray the characters of this movie - was actually there watching all along and making sure things went down the way they had to.8/10 because it seems out of place both in 2020 and in the setting of the 50s and 60s not to deal with racism or even have a Black character.

All the stories merge at one point and all the scenes are meaningful. Was skeptic about if spiderman's Tom holland can portray the character well. But, he blended very nicely. Other actors' acting was very smooth that blends with the story. The movie is not for everyone. It is for someone who sits relax and wants to listen to the story. The narration, direction, color gives you vibe of Forrest gump & The Shawshank Redemption. My only complain is that in the story all religious characters are bad and subconsciously it implied religion is bad. But, it's a story. From story telling point of view the movie was good.

633,lordgolemord,"Incredible acting, bad storyline.",7,17 September 2020,"The film is CERTAINLY NOT ""a sweaty mess from start to finish"" or a ""colossal misfire"" as the first critiques said. But for me it was between ""ehh"" and ""good"".
I think the biggest failure of the movie is that the storyline is ""unsuccessfully"" extended. I think if the movie was cut from still scenes to around 1 hour 40mins from 2 hours and 18 mins, it would give a much different watch.Because the film was meant to give a thrilling atmosphere, but instead a quieter ambiance emerged. Crisis scenes are weak and turns to stillness right away. When that is the case, the movie gets still before you get enough thrill and after a while, you get the feeling of ""I wonder if nothing will happen?"". Maybe, apart from shortening the film, this problem could be solved by giving stronger crises one after another in the middle of the film and maintaining the tension. They could push the limits a bit harder for longer and more disturbing scenes for the movie's theme and taste.It is definitely a movie in which the actors' influence is noticed. I think the movie would be a little more boring if the actors were different. I especially liked Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson and Harry Melling (although his name was not on the poster), because they successfully pulled off characters we had not seen on them before.But it's also true that the rest of the cast don't have roles in which to perform hard. I don't know if this is a bad thing, but it is certain that the rest of the cast can succeed at much more complicated roles.Apart from these, I liked the soundtracks and the story. The general theme of the movie was interesting. It does make you watch. But it's a movie far below its potential. I think that's why the critics were buried it too much on the first reviews. And it's not as disturbing as it was told in the media. It strangely seems to me that they're running a commercial with this on the movie 😬 Or maybe I am turning into a psychopath...",The Devil All the Time

But as we know the story is not all, this story also needs to be filmed well, with which Antonio Campos handled with which I also never heard, but I hardly forget now.

But why most of the characters do anything (except for Tom Holland's character) never quite add up. The movie spends a lot of time telling us things (via narration) without showing or earning anything. Many of the characters are bad people. Why? Because bad people exist. Do good people exist in this world? Sure. They get to suffer at the hands of the bad people. And some people see someone do something terrible and just move on. One character watches another do something terrible and then just covers it up. Why? I don't know either. Everyone tried on this movie. It looks really good and the noir atmosphere is there.

663,mattlovesjackie,Stunning Commentary on American Religion,7,16 October 2021,"Christians take notice (I am one). The portrayal of distorted Christian faith seems to be a major motif. It's either predatory (the guy from Twilight - who hauntingly uses Scripture to get out ahead of the impending news about the young woman's pregnancy), twisted by trauma (the father), twisted by views of the miraculous (the spider preacher), hypocritical and impotent to curb evil (the sheriff - though he was committed to a morality veneer more than explicitly mentioning Christian faith), naive and vulnerable (the young lady preyed upon by the preacher), or settling the conscience before murder (i.e., the woman asking the hitchhiker if he's been baptized). One reviewer pointed out the adoptive mother being the only positive portrayal of Christian faith - hospitable but battered by the preacher's condescending chicken liver (her attributing her cooking ability to God was a bright spot in the film, but then the preacher trashes it). The only character who gains any ground against evil is the agnostic Tom Holland. A friend remarked that evil is everywhere in the film, but so is religion cooperating with the evil, except in the case of the one who fights evil with violence. And yet it was violence that distorted the faith of his father and ruined his life, so the story is not praising violence. I haven't researched the author of the novel, but I hardly blame any American who sees Christianity this way - even if it is informed by what Frederick Douglass called the Christianity of this land rather than the Christianity of Christ.",The Devil All the Time

Tom's acting was stellar, along with Eliza Scanlen, Bill Skarsgård and Robert Pattinson shining too. The plot was intriguing but seemed to have an annoying stop-start-stop pace that may make repeat viewings feel a bit drawn out, but at the end of the day, this isn't an action film, it's a drama and with a 2hr 17min runtime, it could be far worse.

669,millerian-55,Solid movie,7,16 September 2020,"This movie has been on my watchlist for a couple of weeks, after watching Simon Killer from the same director, I was very interested in seeing him explore such a long and expansive story like this one (especially when all his other movies are very short on plot and running time). And after watching it this morning I can safely say that Antonio Campos has done a really solid job with this movie. With it probably being my favorite of his whole filmography.First let's start out with the acting, the acting in this movie is pretty great. With Tom Holland being the most surprisingly great of all of them. I know he's a good actor, but it's easy to forget that with all these Marvel movies he's doing. Not only does his character have the most depth, but Holland manages to really bring the character out through simple tics and mannerisms that really make the character stand out from the rest. In addition, we have the usually great Robert Pattinson, who again brings his all into the movie. It's still amazing that only 8 years ago, he was doing Twilight movies, amazing how far he's come. Those two actors in particular were phenomenal and they really make the movie worth watching.In terms of cinematography, this movie again shows that Campos really has an eye for the camera. With many shots in this movie being really beautiful, and with these shots it brings a sort of pleasant atmosphere to the movie (despite the dark subject matter).If I had any problems with the movie, I will say that Tom Holland's character seems to be the only one in the movie that I really got a sense of who he was and what his motivations are. Also he was the only character I really connected to in the movie, and he unfortunately doesn't come into the movie until about 50mins to an hour into it. Even with that, the movie tended to drag a lot in the middle to a point where it felt like it could have easily been cut, which is also a problem I had with both Simon Killer and Martha Marcy May Marlene. Although he more than enough makes up for it with his endings in all three I've seen (which includes this one)But overall the movie is definitely worth a watch, it's incredibly well-acted and well-shot, and despite it's being around 140 mins, it almost never manages to feel its length. So please check it out if you canEdit: In addition, if you were a fan of Place Beyond the Pines, it has that same sort of style and long-form storytelling as that one.",The Devil All the Time

676,vintageandvariations,Nothing New to See Here.,1,24 September 2020,"One of this film's enormous mistakes begins immediately with an overlong voiceover narration from an anonymous narrator, an irritating feature that continues throughout the film. When utilized skillfully, a voiceover can enhance a film (i.e. ""The Shawshank Redemption""). Here, it serves no purpose, sometimes even describing in excruciating detail the events that are literally occurring onscreen.The cinematography is excellent, and the film is visually compelling, with near perfect lighting and framing - which makes the unnecessary voiceover even more frustrating; leaning on those strong visuals and forgoing the novelistic monologues would have made the experience much more enjoyable.While a lot of the performances are great, the film features an overwhelming number of well-known actors including, but not limited to: Robert Pattinson, Tom Holland, Mia Wasikowska, Bill Skasgard, and Sebastian Stan. For a film focusing on small, rural communities, it perhaps would have been more interesting and original to cast lesser known or debut actors, especially for the young male lead played by Tom Holland.As a whole, this film didn't really know what it was saying. It spent over two hours ambling on, trying to find its voice. None of the characters really exhibited any motivations or arcs. There were so many tropes and themes that didn't offer anything new and were simply done better in other instances:An unhinged preacher who claims to have the power of divine healing? ""There Will Be Blood"" did it better.Small town folks conflicted by their religious culture? Literally any Flannery O'Connor story did it better.A reverend suffering from insatiable lust? ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" did it better.Someone murdering their wife with an unconventional weapon? Sweeney Todd did it better.So if you have almost 2 1/2 hours to kill, I guess give this film a watch. If not, you're not really missing out on anything.",The Devil All the Time

this movie is dark. Very dark, yet very entertaining. Donald Ray Pollock's narration is brilliant and the acting is superb. The way the story is told is also very amazing. It is told in a linear fashion, but has points where it stops to go back and tell why what is happening is happening, that is the best way I can describe it. It's genius. The music of this film is on another level. Both the orginal soundtrack and the old gospel and country songs used are awesome. All of the characters and their stories are freaking amazing. The whole premise is just great. Robert Pattinson as Rev. Preston Teagardin is some of the best casting I have ever seen. Jason Clarke and Riley Keough as Carl and Sandy Hederson is a pair I would not expect, but Carl and Sandy were probably my favorite characters and they were great! This film is dark, slow burn, Southern gothic film that needs to be seen by EVERYONE. Has echoes of Tarrantino and Coen Brothers, but better. Everything is just right in this film.

686,boojitsu,"Great acting, but for what?",7,17 September 2020,"Fantastic acting, overall pretty well written, but in the dark and gritty story, the film just leaves the audience with the question of ""what was it all for?"" and I wouldn't say the film ever even attempts to answer that, which may bother some. It feels like the movie would've been better suited for a mini series with multiple episodes centered around each main character / character set. It would've allowed more depth and explored the ideas of death, life, religion, the cycle of violence, and what the real point of it was.Positives: acting, time period felt natural rather than fabricated (costume / set design / cinematography)Negatives: one-note characters, same song plays throughout most of the movie, lots of voice over narration to tell you about the story instead of showing it to you or allowing the audience to discern / interpret the characters themselves.",The Devil All the Time

Contrary to the connotation of the title ""The Devil all the time"" which excites the thrill of the unknown, the movie is slow going and dull in some instances. This movie has numerous highlights like the acting of Robert Pattison, also the performance by Tom Holland is great, the way he enacts the character of a boy whose life has just been filled with challenges and setbacks was commendable. Moreover, this movie has a very refreshing screenplay. But all these highlights are overshadowed by the pace of this movie. It is very slow and this slow-pace drags the whole movie down. But thankfully after the hour mark, the movie starts gathering pace and becomes very intriguing as all the good things start to grip together.
This movie is a solid 7/10, with a great cast and strong screenplay, but the unrushed direction kind of brings down the flow and leaves the movie being above average.",The Devil All the Time

I loved the movie, the acting was amazing. But its not a happy movie and the title gives it away.

I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this movie. The ending is worth it. I'm not sure which critic it was that said it wasn't. The character development is great, especially for the protagonist. The cinematography is excellent. The writing, and the acting is phenomenal. If you're into popcorn films like Hobbs and Shaw, you probably won't like it. It's dark, but not overly-dark and dramatic like some pretentious art films. There really isn't a thing to complain about this movie.

The accents from Bill Skarsgard, Robert Pattinson and Tom Holland was pulled off very well which I've never seen these actors do in a role; it really has done them justice rather than playing characters that haven't got much depth to them.

It is also nice to see Tom Holland take on a more serious role rather than everyone still seeing him as the kid that plays Spider-Man. I'm glad he's branching out.
I enjoyed this film, there was ALOT going on but I think if it was longer it would of dragged and turned into a 'how longs left' kinda film. Overall an okay film with an amazing cast.

703,briankunkel,This movie is good,10,23 March 2021,Its a good movie when you don't got people in your ear telling you its not. I watched this a couple days ago after i got the book i've seen this movie twice and wanted to read the book and right now. The book and movie are kind of the same some example would be when Willard beat up the hunters and when the preacher killed his wife. i would say one thing that wasn't the same was Jack the dog in the movie he was the family dog but in the book he was a random dog that Arvin wanted to keep also another difference was the prayer log. In the movie it only contained the skinned dog but in the book Willard found different dead animals on the road and hung them up even taking the blood and dumping it on the prayer log it was dark blood everywhere. Another example of it being the same was with Arvin finding his dad and the cop asking if the pie on his face was blood but that's mostly it i keep reading reviews of people saying the movie was boring and long but they're probably the same people that can watch the titanic over and over and say it isn't boring the movie is supposed to show you the good and then then the bad of people just watch the movie through and don't complain but this was my review hope you guys like it,The Devil All the Time

This movie won't try to tell some grand message, and it's not supposed to. It documents a series of events, and presents a cast of characters who are extremely well acted and convincing.Those who try to look for meaning into this film will either get disappointed as the message is pretty grim, or simply get offended.

I agree with one review that said this would have been better served as a mini-series. I think the film held up well on its own but it did leave a lot of juicy characters with a lot of juicy character development left on the table. I want to know more about all of them except the bullies.This film drew me back 3 times so far and I'm getting the urge again. I won't give a synopsis of the story because that's been done but I will say it you want to see hard life where sometimes there's no winners this might be for you.

So watch it. If you get confused, stick with it. You'll eventually figure out who everyone is and how it all comes together. Yes, it's violent. Yes, there's a lot of disturbing images. Yes, it's raw.

717,xxforkliftermattxx,Put me down as deeply disturbed,9,6 October 2020,"The Devil All the Time is a slow burn, thriller and melodrama with outstanding acting, exceptional editing, and precise cinematography. I love the focus on the theme of evil disguised as good. The film focuses on people who are thinking they are doing good under the guise of religion, God, and divine right instead of the harsh reality that they are terrible people committing terrible atrocities. Unfortunately, this is true to life. Obviously, this isn't saying all religious people are evil. It's more so that people are using religion as an excuse to commit crimes. The performances are all really good, and provide a look into the minds of sick, vile humans. The film is deeply disturbing because of how true to life it is and how it focuses on real life themes. It's extremely well crafted, and I love how it's presented, using voice over narration to dictate the flow of the film. The plot is a little convoluted, and the story could've been more thought out. Get ready for a slow descent into disturbing madness. This is one for the ages.",The Devil All the Time
718,JudgeSteve,Study in Trauma,7,12 October 2020,"I am a state court trial judge. Every day I get to see, first hand, the worst things people can do to each other. And, every one of those people have a rationalization, or what they believe to be a rationalization. In the case of this film, the acting presents one spot on display delusional rationalization after another. Every character is deeply, deeply disturbed, although in most cases we don't really have enough development to know why. The central and most developed character is driven by his Appalachian, evangelical upbringing and a belief that he must right every wrong done to those important to him by any means necessary. And the means are always violent. From beginning to end this movie is violent. As I watched, I began to think much of the violence was gratuitous, for shock value. However, I began to see that it was conveyance of intergenerational trauma experienced by so many. As in life, the traumatic experiences suffered by the characters in this film are most often at the hands of those we expect to protect us. Clergy, parents, police.There is nothing about this film that will make you feel good for having watched it except for knowing that, if you are disturbed, you are capable of empathy. This movie is based on a fictional novel but it is a very real study in the worst things people do to each other.",The Devil All the Time
719,mazkota,Great film,9,28 September 2020,"The plot and effects were superb. Although the film began slowly, cracks soon emerged and the plot made unexpected twists and turns which were unanticipated. Although I had my doubts about Bill Skaarsgard's infuriating acting as the It, his acting was redeemed through a believable and palpable display of brutality and his maniacal belief in Christianity. Such can be said about his whole family, who either buried their heads deep in the sand or stood to abet the murder of multiple victims in praise of the lord or in protection of their families. God bless Skaarsgard's mother for all the torment she was put through. A bad case of PTSD must of befell Skaarsgard to have become such a brute. Hated both priests and wished the second one dead earlier. A satisfying end to the film as everything returned to how it was before. Brilliant and a must watch!",The Devil All the Time

I love the book so I was waiting to be disappointed by the casting or an altered plot as I often am, but this film really hits all the spots, it left me wishing they had made a two part film or done a mini series because I wanted to see even more of these characters.The film is a dark American Gothic, unrelenting in its treatment of the characters caught up in this world. You have to look hard for the rays of light in this, in a line up that contains Robert Pattinson's superbly creepy preacher and the consistently good Sebastian Stan's duplicitous Sheriff.Tom Holland is the star of an all round great cast, he's sublime. He keeps his emotions mostly internal and you can actually see the inner conflicts in his eyes and his body language.

728,wwinnstonn,Intense But Corny / Very Cult Hollywood,8,2 October 2020,"Just finished watching this movie with some friends. Overall, it's a nice one. Cannot begin to think of how many moments had me holding my breath and gasping after an intense scene. It was gripping and well acted all around - even when Robert Pattinson is trying his best to hit this accent and instead fell short. You hate him so much from the very beginning it doesn't even matter.The Devil All The Time is an emotional tidal wave of a movie, and everybody we watched it with agreed it was powerfully shot and basically insane. That alone makes the movie tolerable.All that being said, it's a shame watching a movie and not being able to fully enjoy it because the filmmakers personal opinions / bias encroach on the film so much that it gets corny. Some of the most intense scenes are gut wrenching, but at the same time feel like they trying way too hard to manipulate the viewer into believing something other than just the movie - forcing opinions on the viewers and making it really obvious and pushy. Hate when directors do that, it's so obnoxious.The Devil All The Time is also heavily existential but also extremely predictable. There were those painfully overplayed themes in modern hollywood cinema where all humanity is displayed in our most banal and most ignorant representation, Christians are all anachronistic simpletons or predatory cult members, and the only pure or morally justifiable character worthy of redemption is the most traumatized victim imaginable. Who hasn't see this type of ""dark"" film like 1000 times already, right?If I were an A-list Hollywood celeb who felt most people in the world are inherently despicable and guilty for existing, religious thought is the downfall of humanity, and everyone with guns deserves to die unless we bury them with our crosses and get on the bus, then this would be one of the best films I've seen all year.8/10 regardless, so it was worth the watch.",The Devil All the Time

I couldn't finish and I went to bed broken hearted. If you are sensitive to dogs being killed in movies it might ruin it for you.It was really frustrating to watch people do insane and evil things in the name of religion, feeling they are a good person. This is an important point to make. When I was a child I rejected the church because I saw people assume that because they love Jesus they're immune to being a bad person.

This film really doesn't hold back in those respects and I really enjoyed just sinking into this film and not thinking too much about it, I just allowed the film to happen, although, at times it's structure is at first confusing, it isn't a hard film to follow at all and I was really engrossed by the story which I personally thoroughly enjoyed",The Devil All the Time

The Devil All the Time by Donald Ray Pollock is a haunting, twisted story with many complex characters which is what makes the book so interesting because you don't know what they'll do next. Sadly, in the movie, directed by Antonio Campos, the plot is jumbled and the characters' subtext is thrown out almost all together. While I suppose this is to make the movie more mysterious and slow burn, it doesn't work for me. On the other hand the acting was phenomenal! Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson, and Bill Skarsgård took the cake for me. They're performances were hands down the best part of this movie. I could barely take my eyes off the screen during their scenes.

But there r so many characters & none of them feels fleshed out. I don't know how Netflix convinced some of these actors for this movie, seeing as neither do they have screen time nor do they have any material to work with, must be the money I guess.*Only Rob Pattison understands that it's just a pointless pulp movie discussed as something artsy, meaningful and just let's loose as a sweaty, creepy, smarmy preacher.

Also Robert Pattinson was amazing in his role and proves to everyone how amazing actor is. Also the directing, the cinematography and the music were excellent and made a dark atmosphere.

I actually thought for a moment that this was written by Lansdale, but discovered it was written by Donald Ray Pollock, an author that I will be adding to my reading list. It's hard to watch the darker moments of the movie, but the actors did a very good job of bringing the characters that they portrayed, to life.

I also love how they tied all of the characters' stories throughout the course of the film. It is very much a slowburn but once you get invested in the story, the runtime doesn't matter at all. The film in general is a bit disturbing so if you don't vibe with that kind of stuff, maybe this isn't for you but to all of those who can handle it, do please go and watch this film!

Very predictable, you can see what is going to happen a couple minutes ahead. There wasn't really anything incredibly entertaining in the story, it wasn't really attaching, even when the multiple ""storylines"" collided. Sometimes movies that have a slow paced story, like this one, are still very entertaining, by virtue of great camera work, creating a peculiar atmosphere to the movie, or by creating very vivid and entertaining characters, but not really this one. The only redeeming feature this movie has is it's truly great acting, which could be enough for some to enjoy the movie.

My skin was crawling for the entirety of the film and I literally had to go and watch a couple episodes of Bob Ross to get rid of my heeby-geebies.Again, the actors were great and the storyline was original-but that won't do a lot to help a movie when you can barely stand to look at the screen.",The Devil All the Time

831,Ethan1945,A terrific cast that deserves a better script.,5,16 September 2020,"First things first, The Devil All the Time undoubtedly has the cast of the year. Tom Holland proves himself as a legitimate actor worthy of awards recognition and Robert Pattison makes the most of his limited screentime to create a truly chilling antagonist. The supporting players also shine with Riley Keough, Sebastian Stan, and Eliza Scanlen also delivering great performances.However, outside of the performances there is very little to say about Devil All the Time that is positive. Antonio Campos's script bites off more than it can chew, with themes of religious fanaticism, generational trauma, and the nature of violence popping up on multiple occasions. But the film has so many topics it wants to explore that none of them end up being fleshed out in any satisfying way, leaving the audience with a bunch of half-baked ideas and a sense of emptiness,Perhaps this would have worked better as a miniseries with a slow burn or as a shorter film with less characters and subplots. But in its final form The Devil All the Time is a watchable but forgettable experience that won't leave anyone hungry for more.",The Devil All the Time

Enough to make you put your phone away and pay attention as to not miss anything.",The Devil All the Time
834,n_pow,Disappointing for me,5,29 September 2020,"I realized pretty early on in the movie that it was just going to be a series of ""overly zealous religious believer does bad thing"" and after that I was honestly really just wondering how much longer the film could drag on for. Like damn, we get it. People who commit fiercely to any belief system, whether it be religion or ideology, can do terrible things. Why didn't the film focus more on some of the terrible environmental factors these characters were living through that may have driven them to be such religious fanatics? It did this for Skarsgard's character, but not much anyone else.And I say this all as an agnostic atheist. Getting the same message played out over pretty much every character in the film got old fast.The acting in this is the film's saving grace, if it has one. Pretty much all of the actors kill their roles; Skarsgard and Holland both did well in their intense, brooding characters, Pattinson was slimy as all hell and Harry Melling blew me away with his acting.Too bad the story couldn't hold up. This film was a letdown ultimately.",The Devil All the Time

837,aberonja,Heart-racing in just about every scene.,9,23 September 2020,"For starters, I walked in with no knowledge of the story at all. I knew this was a film adaptation of a book, but other than that - nothing. I was looking forward to the film due to the cast line up, and they all really stepped up in their roles. Tom Holland did an amazing job as the lead and I think this is an incredible shift for him from his previous work. While this story is not for everyone, those who do watch it are in for a great story. The cutbacks from past, present, and future all flow very well with the story and I think the way it was pieced together tied things together in a way that didn't leave you confusing and satisfied in the end. The music was beautifully eery and it really drew me in even more to the story. I was absorbed almost instantly to the story and truly think that if you can stomach the film, you should give it a shot. Overall one of the better films to come from Netflix in a long time.",The Devil All the Time
838,scottcraig-46387,Masterpiece.,10,18 September 2020,"From the moment this starts until it ends I was hooked, the acting is absolutely phenomenal, the multiple story lines all connecting was genius and it pays off. This is a slow burn movie but the final act (last 45 mins) is where the film really shines. Tom Holland is incredible and gives the performance of a lifetime, Bill Skarsgård is only in the movie for the first 35/40 mins but he is also incredible, The scene stealing Robert Pattinson is on usual form, every time he was on the screen I was star struck he was that good. Jason Clarke was ruthless as one of the serial killers praying on young men and Sebastian Stan as the corrupt sheriff was amazing, there is one scene in particular that involves Sebastian Stan and 2 gangsters in a house and that blew me away. Overall this is a slow burn but very very violent film about the cycle of violence in life, please watch this movie you will not be disappointed.",The Devil All the Time
839,shomikmandal-43762,"An intense dark tale, Tom Holland nails it.",9,16 September 2020,"The movie is slow in the beginning then gets violent in the last hour. The storytelling is fantastic.

You can tell this movie is based on a good book as it gently intertwines the relationships of the characters.

858,nerdmentor,Predictable & Disgusting,1,18 September 2020,"When you know what will happen before it actually does the filmmakers have failed miserably. The dog's fate and the preacher with the young woman are examples. Moreover, having the dog visually hanging on a cross was horribly disgusting and not necessary as the film makers went for cheap shock value instead of allowing the viewer to use their imagination. Frankly, I question if that portion of the story needed to be transferred from book to film in the first place. Graphic gory scenes are the laziest way to convey plot points. Think Psycho versus Friday the 13th. The acting was good enough, but wasted on a bad adaption.",The Devil All the Time

Peculiar movies like this, can quickly become too artsy, and lose the majority of the audience. I for one really enjoyed the pacing of the story, and the development of the characters. By the end of the tale I was really invested Arvin Russel, excellently displayed by Tom Holland. The ominous characters left a bad taste in my mouth, and I applaud the whole cast for their delivery.The plot jumps back and forth in the storyline, but it's still possible to follow the plot as a whole, and the jumps are used in a tasteful way to build the background of the characters. No unnecessary narration and overall just a very smooth delivery of the story. Loved it.",The Devil All the Time

This film is an extremely dark representation of all of the social ills that those West Virginia jokes dealt with. The characters and vignettes are so bizarre, it is difficult to determine whether the acting is good or not. The camera work may be good, but the film is so depressing it does not stand out...there is no beauty. Poverty and filth only add to the horrible existence the film portrays. This film does not take the viewer anywhere positive. It is hard for me to understand how The Devil all the Time is so popular. It was so depressing, bordering on offensive, and it took me several attempts to sit through it.",The Devil All the Time
871,nenarokomovasasha,Beautiful movie and empty plot,7,27 September 2020,"So, initially it was the celebrity caste that attracted me. But is he justified? I think no. It seems to me that such a caste is appropriate in larger films with a strong plot. Or in films where the action develops more smoothly. Here the plot is very fragmentary and seems to be glued together from short films. An attempt to show the relationship of all the characters led to the fact that there was not enough time to prove themselves. The only one who made me feel emotional was Pattinson's character, a local preacher. It turned out to be so skillfully vile that it evokes genuine hatred, that is lively emotions.

There was bit and pieces of information and you were craving for more, however, It didn't leave you there thinking who is the antagonist or the protagonist. But you'd definitely stay to see how it ends!!
The casts plays well since Holand, Skarsgard didn't grow up in the states but they speak the accent well!! They act naturally and very well!!!

882,elmireqkidd,Not worth watching...Requires a lot of patience!,1,13 October 2020,"If you're truly a born again believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, I'd say this movie is not worth your time. If you're someone who takes Christianity lightly or have had many bad experiences of wolves in sheep's clothing, you may be able to tolerate this movie. Be warned however, that its implications are unnerving although definitely not unheard of in life period. However, nothing justifies crime in my mind especially regarding religious practices etc. Any sound-minded person knows killing/murder, mutilation, sexual exploitation, adultery, suicide, and all these things cannot truly be done in the name of Jesus Christ because Jesus is holy. However, to me, the movie makes it as though it can be. Thus, mocking the One and Only True and Living God and The Faith. To me, the movie also highlights how gullible/fragile the human mind can be and the importance of having balance. Otherwise, you can become convinced to do something or believe in something that could get you or someone you love hurt OR it can make you crazy and vile. It also highlights the fact that you can't make God do anything no matter how much you beg and plead. Furthermore, it highlights the fact that you shouldn't pick up strangers or hitch hike. Apparently, this movie is based off a book. What I would say of the author is normally when we as authors write things, there's a hint of revelation regarding something we've personally experienced. It also normally expresses a bit about our own character so...to that end, hopefully, the main character found the real truth about life and God wherever he ended up. And as far as the film producer...let's see you take a book about Islam, Buddhism, Witchcraft and the black arts or something to that nature and make light of those religions. People have been mocking Christ for centuries - it doesn't make Him any less real.",The Devil All the Time

I would describe this movie as awesome: Great storyline, Best screenplay, outstanding performance, especially by actors Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson and Bill Skarsgard and also the child actor who played young Arvin Russell.

Great movie!!,The Devil All the Time
914,Beccakins13,Amazing Cast!,9,9 October 2020,Impeccable acting. I admittedly had reservations about the difficulties of turning this book into a film. The cast takes this movie to another level.

I loved the way this ""story"" builds with mostly character developments. Very unique film pacing, which leaves you satisfied at the end. Feels like a whole season of a series instead of a movie, in a good way.

923,litl_sayf,Act. Direction. Story - Great Package!,8,9 November 2020,"Tom Holland, perfect for the role. Kept it thrilling and to the mark. Not forgetting the others though. Loved how the director completed some early scenes later in the movie which we had first seen from a totally different perspective. How everything changed into a completely different story, putting up a lot of questions to reality and how people perceive things. Messy ways for people to die, in such different sorts. All put together so well in perfect sync!",The Devil All the Time
924,ashraf-mchoudhury,A Masterpiece,8,20 September 2020,"Very beautifully made, with unexpected twists, subplots and character lineup...The main takeway is the narration, which will initially make you feel like it's going to be a fairy tale ride...But you won't have to wait long to find the sinster side of the movie, and realize that the narration was always meant as kind of a pun, and is totally in contrast with the story line. Character development is wonderful, and all the characters are shown in the grey, no blacks or whites here. A unique film, which has both an old school charm, nostalgia, as well as violence and gruesome scenes. A masterpiece.",The Devil All the Time
925,jakehutchens,As a believer I still found this movie very interesting.,8,11 April 2021,Great acting and everyone that follows the Bible knows their are evil that use the word of god to manipulate the weak.

I feel like this could have truly been a great TV series. But i'll be honest in saying this movie falls flat. Drags on and on. It feels like it is dark just for the sake of being dark. So many depressing moments. I feel as if the story teller didn't know what story he wanted to tell. It's too much contained in 2 and a half hours. A jumbled up mess. 3 out of 10 for the movie as a whole but I would give the acting a 10. If you want to bore yourself to death or fall asleep, throw it on.",The Devil All the Time

This film needs better reviews. I get it, it's not for everyone. But it completely exceeded my expectations because I thought I was gonna see just an another crowd pleaser starring people's favorite Hollywood pretty boys - Pattinson, Holland, Skrasgard etc..
I was so wrong.I love that someone mentioned ""Pulp Fiction"" - which is also a movie that doesn't really have something you could call a ""plot"" but is still (to a lot of people) one of the greatest movies ever made - and in a way ""The Devil"" kinda works the same. There is a plot but it just isn't the main focus of the film, the characters are. They just come and go and lead the way, and the movie just flows and flows and you follow. Pacing is the best. It's enjoyable, wonderfully shot, actors are great...Just don't expect a crime/thriller. It's a ""story"", a lot of different stories connected into one.
A must watch.",The Devil All the Time

The script, acting, cinematography.In the first ten minutes I wondered how they were going to weave it together, but the story flows effortlessly, bringing together their individual stories to diverge into one.Being over 2 hours might make you hesitant but if you have time, i would highly recommend. Some movies of this length may feel like they are dragging on but there isn't a single dull moment and they made it well paced.On a final note the acting was superb from highly recognised and talented actors/actresses.

This is the kind of dark movie that gets more horrible the more it goes on. It had no redeeming qualities other than the acting itself. It was made even worse by the time period that it was set in and the way they produced it to add insult to injury.

I couldn't even get through the whole movie because it felt like there was no suspense or plot to it at all, and it was ridiculously long.

Some random events happen and multiple timezones are shown to the audience. Something that Tarantino did with pulp Fiction where they show the past and the future and where it leads to in the end. The whole movie is also Narrated like a lot of Tarantino movies. There is a constant tension in the movie what feels like a great build up but unfortunately your patience won't be rewarded.

Not only did this film kick Holland up a notch in my book, but the supporting actors added the right amount of crazy to an already crazy storyline.It was very well written. Having not read the novel, I can say that this movie got me wanting to read it... And usually it's the other way around. Very well adapted. The screenwriter did an amazing job.The pace of the film as a whole kept you in your toes without giving you too much whiplash. The speed of the story was just right. It's a longer film, but you would never notice it until it's over and you look at the clock.
