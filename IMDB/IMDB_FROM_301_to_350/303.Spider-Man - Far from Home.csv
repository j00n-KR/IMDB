0,Leofwine_draca,A step backwards,5,12 April 2020,"And so my long Marvel-watching journey comes to an end; I've finally caught up with the endless franchise, after what seems like eons playing catch-up with the rest of the world's population. Sadly, this SPIDER-MAN sequel is a real step down from the highs of AVENGERS: ENDGAME, and a feeling like they've gone backwards given how they learnt what worked so well previously. Personally, I've found both of Holland's outings as the web-slinging hero to be middling at best.This one starts off okay, with a first half mixing the usual lame high school gags and characterisation with some decent and destructive set-pieces; Jake Gyllenhaal is a nice choice of supporting actor too. However, a crucial twist halfway through renders the second half extremely mundane, building to a climax which is silly and predictable as it is hollow and contrived. Fans tend to lap this stuff up due to its well-meaning nature, but I expect a lot more from this kind of budget.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1,SnoopyStyle,EuroTrip: The adventures of Night Monkey,7,9 July 2019,"It's eight months after the Blip, the moment when the people who got dusted in the Snap return after over five years. It's a period of readjustment as those people come to terms with the world five years later. Tony Stark is gone and Peter Parker (Tom Holland) has to fill some very large shoes. He and his friend Ned Leeds are set to go on an European school trip. Peter is struggling to make his move with MJ (Zendaya). In Venice, they are attacked by a water monster and they are saved by fish bowl head Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) who claims to be Quentin Beck from another Earth.It would have been great to have Gyllenhaal be Holland's replacement mentor. I don't mind the expected villain turn although he probably has a few too many henchmen. As for Zendaya's MJ, her deadpan delivery holds some interest but could be limiting in future sequels. The main question I have is whether this franchise needed an European Vacation already. Most of time, a franchise should be stale before trying to refresh itself with exotic locations. I wouldn't mind more high school and more Aunt May to let his world breathe. The reason for a younger Peter Parker actor is for him to live more fully in the high school experience. At this pace, he's getting a job at the newspaper in the next movie and that would be a shame. He should be having more high school soap opera before then.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
2,claudio_carvalho,Teenage Spider-Man in Europe,6,23 September 2019,"""Spider-Man: Far from Home"" is a typical film for youngsters or fans of Marvel, CGI and explosions. The storyline is silly, the screenplay is not as funny as the writer intended to be and the hero is annoying. Anyway entertains if the viewer has lower expectation and does not have a better option. The cliffhanger in the credits is one of the best scenes. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Homem-Aranha: Longe de Casa"" (""Spider-Man: Far from Home"")",Spider-Man - Far from Home
3,nogodnomasters,"Welcome back, Peter",9,7 August 2019,"The film opens as a link to the last one with the incident being called the ""Blip."" People came back at the same age as when they left while everyone else aged five years. Peter's (Tom Holland) class does a getaway trip to Europe. Here he must fight the elements from space/time and save the planet while remaining a geek and attempting to work up the courage to tell MJ (Zendaya) he likes her. And that is just the first half. And as usual, all the other Avengers are unavailable.I liked that they kept Spiderman as his original ""regular kid."" Emma Stone will always be my favorite Spiderman girl, but Zendaya exhibited promise. This is the first Marvel film without a Stan Lee cameo.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
4,kosmasp,Phase 3 concluded,8,3 August 2019,"Before I even start, it is imperative that you have seen the previous movies. Especially Endgame of course, but also the others. Now this can be enjoyed as a standalone and readers of comics in general will have a great time anyway. But with all the previous entries in mind, I will not spoil this one, just going to assume you are up to date.Why do I say this? Well because this plays and this is the last ""warning"", directly after Endgame. So there have repurcussions, with losses and gains, but with a fight won. And apparently this has done something to our universe. It has opened doors. Spiderman has to be the one to step up, since others are either gone, incapable or really gone.It is tough to step out of the shadow of Iron Man and while you can blame him and his technology for certain things ... hm Peter Parker gets an inheritance of Stark technology ... so some might feel things are predictable, I personally was surprised by quite a few things, especially considering the little knowledge I had before the movie started ... It's a fun little movie and if you can't have fun with this it is a shame. The movie really achieves to entertain if you let it",Spider-Man - Far from Home
5,classicsoncall,"""You get that Peter-tingle back on-line.""",7,11 December 2019,"More so than with the Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield takes on the Spider-Man character, it appears that the Tom Holland version is geared more toward a teen and young adult audience. Nothing wrong with that, because alter-ego Peter Parker is a teenager himself. But it just doesn't feel like a super-hero movie for me with all the high school kids running around and Spider-Man trying to get out of a world threatening assignment from Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). I was surprised to see Jake Gyllenhaal cast here as the film's principal villain, but liked the idea that he came on as a buddy-buddy to Peter before the reveal that showed him to be the mastermind behind the Elementals. The numbered Earth concept opens up a whole array of possibilities for future stories, so a franchise like this can go on forever. As a completist I'll be on board for future movies, though I'd like to see more in the way of character development and effective story telling. A little bit darker tone would also be of help.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
6,jboothmillard,Spider-Man: Far from Home,6,17 July 2019,"Avengers: Endgame may have concluded the ongoing Avengers story that gradually developed since Iron Man, the first movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but that doesn't mean it will not continue with further films, this was the next instalment. Basically, in Mexico, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) are investigating an unnatural storm, and encounter the Earth Elemental, extradimensional creatures that use natural forces. A super-powered man, Quentin Beck (Jake Gyllenhaal), arrives to fight the creature. In New York City, the Midtown School of Science and Technology restarts its academic year to accommodate the students who were among those who disappeared in ""the Blip"" eight months ago. The school organises a two-week summer field trip to Europe. Peter Parker (Tom Holland), who is still distraught over the death of Tony Stark, is planning to confess his growing feelings for classmate Michelle ""MJ"" Jones (Zendaya), and he wants to take a break from heroics. Dressed as Spider-Man, Peter is forewarned by Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), at a charity fundraiser organised by his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), that he will be contacted by Fury. Peter chooses to ignore this, he leaves the event after being overwhelmed with questions about Tony Stark. Peter and his friends travel to Venice, where the Water Elemental strikes and wreaks havoc on the city, until Beck arrives and destroys the creature. Fury meets with Parker, he wants his help, and gives him Stark's glasses. The glasses are equipped with the artificial intelligence E.D.I.T.H. (which stands for Even Dead I'm The Hero) (voiced by Dawn Michelle King), which has access to all databases of Stark Industries and commands a large orbital weapons supply. Beck, who adopts the nickname ""Mysterio"", says he is from a different reality, one of many in the Multiverse, and he claims the Elementals killed his family. Peter rejects Fury's call to help Mysterio, opting to rejoin his class, but Fury covertly redirects the school trip to Prague, where the Fire Elemental is projected to strike. The creature appears at a carnival, Beck is eventually able to defeat it with the help of Spider-Man. Fury and Hill invite Parker and Beck to Berlin to discuss the formation of a new superhero team. Peter believes Beck is more worthy of being Stark's successor, and bequeaths him the E.D.I.T.H. glasses. But it is revealed that Beck is a former holographic-illusions specialist at Stark Industries, he was fired for his unstable nature. He leads a team of other disgruntled ex-Stark employees, using advanced projector drones they are simulating the Elemental attacks so Mysterio can masquerade as a hero. Intending to tell MJ his feelings for her, she assumes Peter is going to tell her that he is Spider-Man, which she already realised. MJ shows Peter a piece of debris she retrieved during the carnival battle, it is a projector that presents a simulation of the Air Elemental, they realise that Beck is a fraud. Peter travels to Berlin and meets with Fury, only to realise that it is an illusion created by Beck, this leads to a battle with multiple illusions before Fury apparently subdues Beck. Fury forces Peter to reveal anyone he told about Beck's deception, but this is revealed as another illusion. Peter is hit and badly injured by a train, falling unconscious he eventually waking in a jail cell in the Netherlands. Peter breaks out and contacts Hogan, who flies Peter to London, while a machine left by Stark synthesizes a new customized Spider-Man costume. In London, Beck uses E.D.I.T.H. to orchestrate his biggest illusion yet, a fusion of all four Elementals, and he plans to kill MJ and any others who know his secret. Peter breaks through the illusion, regains control of E.D.I.T.H., and defeats Mysterio. Beck ends up killed by a misfired drone gunshot. Parker returns to New York City and begins a relationship with MJ. Spider-Man and MJ are seen together in Times Square, then on a big screen is an announcement by reporter J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) of TheDailyBugle, he blames Spider-Man for the Elementals' attacks. He then plays pre-recorded footage of Beck, who incriminates Peter for his death and then reveals his secret identity. It is also revealed Skrulls Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) and Soren (Sharon Blynn) have been masquerading as Fury and Hill the whole time, so that Fury can relax on a spaceship. Also starring Jacob Batalon as Ned Leeds, Tony Revolori as Flash Thompson, Angourie Rice as Betty Brant, Remy Hii as Brad Davis, J.B. Smoove as Mr. Dell, Martin Starr as Mr. Harrington, Jorge Lendeborg Jr. as Jason Ionello, Numan Acar as Dimitri, and Claire Rushbrook as Janice. British-born Holland reasserts himself as a spirited and wise-cracking hero, Jackson is both commanding and amusing as the Avengers boss, Gyllenhaal does well as the anti-hero, and Zendaya remains amusingly snidey as Spidey's love interest. The story is essentially Spider-Man battling evil whilst globetrotting, it is nice to see European sites along the way, the script is filled with wittiness and humour, and the special effects are jaw-dropping and add a lot to proceedings, it is a little by-the-book, but a satisfying superhero fantasy action adventure. Good!",Spider-Man - Far from Home
7,BA_Harrison,"Not terrible, but far from great.",6,12 July 2019,"As with Homecoming, I had a reasonable time with Far From Home, but found my overall enjoyment hampered by a few niggles.My biggest problem with the film is that there's very little feeling of genuine peril for our hero thanks to his impossibly fast reflexes and apparent indestructibility, the web-slinger surviving being hit full-on by a speeding train, getting set on fire, and being shot at by countless high-tech drones. Without any real sense of danger, there's very little excitement to be had, the action scenes washing over the viewer in a wave of fancy CGI extravaganza. Yes, the visuals are amazing (especially the trippy holographs Mysterio uses to fool Spiderman), but I never once felt moved by what I was seeing.I also found certain plot points difficult to accept: Tony Stark leaving control of EDITH to 16-year-old Peter Parker seemed unlikely, given the potentially deadly nature of the system, and, although staying relatively true to the comics, Mysterio's high-tech illusions take quite a bit of swallowing.Meanwhile, Marisa Tomei is (again) out of place as a very easy-on-the-eye Aunt May, with her character's relationship with Happy (Jon Favreau) most unlikely (sorry Jon, but she's out of your league).On the plus side, the humour is mostly effective (the Night Monkey gag made me laugh every time), Holland makes for a decent lead, and Zendaya is likeable as the his love interest M.J.6.5/10, but not good enough for me to round it up to 7.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
8,paul_haakonsen,Surprisingly good...,7,29 July 2019,"Granted, I haven't seen ""Avengers: Endgame"", so I am not sure what lies before ""Spider-Man: Far from Home"". But still, I was given the chance to watch this 2019 Marvel movie, so I did, even though I am not overly keen on the superhero genre.I must say, that like all other Marvel movies, then the 2019 ""Spider-Man: Far from Home"" was entertaining, and it was also a spectacular movie to watch on the screen.The storyline in the movie was entertaining and enjoyable, and it definitely had a great pacing to it. And also the twists and turns along the way were quite nice, as it made for a more non-linear movie actually.""Spider-Man: Far from Home"" is a special effects movie, through and through. And there is nothing bad to be said for the special effects and CGI, because they were phenomenal and bedazzling. I was genuinely impressed with the CGI and special effects in this movie.One thing I will never grasp is why they keep changing the storylines from previous movies. In this 2019 movie, Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland) is again to become romantically entangled with MJ (played by Zendaya). We have already seen this, and why suddenly change on the MJ character? Not going to start a racial debate here, but it just seems odds. But hey, that is Hollywood for you, I suppose, being all about pleasing the crowd and the minorities.The villain in this movie was actually among the best of any villain I have seen in the Marvel movies thus far. And they had opted for a very talented actor for the part. Not going to spoil who the villain is by revealing his name.The parts of Nick Fury (played by Samuel L. Jackson) and Happy Hogan (played by Jon Favreau) actually brought a nice element of comedy to the movie, without it tipping the scale and becoming too much.Now, I do watch superhero movies when given the chance, but it is not my preference of genres. But I will say that the 2019 ""Spider-Man: Far from Home"" was genuinely entertaining and enjoyable.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
9,BandSAboutMovies,Fun popcorn movie!,7,4 July 2019,"For every Marvel movie that comes out, beyond the big box office and throngs of fans that love every moment, there are those that like to ride their high and mighty horse, telling you that comics are for kids and that these movies are infantile. And that's fine - look, we all have our own opinions - but when you're fighting your way through life and just need a break that takes you away from your own cares - which is what movies are really for - these popcorn films do a great job of making you forget bills, work, dealing with fixing up your home and even your aches and pains.Basically: Yes, we get it. You're above comic book movies. Keep it to yourself, because these movies are modern myth and have never been better than right now.The twenty-third film in the Marvel Universe - soon, you'll need a whole shelf to hold all the blu rays - this film starts in Mexico, where Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) battle an elemental creature alongside Quentin Beck (a great Jake Gyllenhaal) who will come to be known as Mysterio.Way back in the Sam Raimi days, Mysterio was to be the fourth film's villain. He was to be played by Bruce Campbell and there had been cameos in each of the three previous films to set him up. Sadly, that never came to pass.Meanwhile, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is still learning how to adjust to life after ""The Blink,"" the five year period where Thanos wiped out half of all life, as well as the events of the last few movies like Avengers: Endgame. He's reeling from the loss of Tony Stark, his father figure, and also dealing with a crush on his friend MJ (Zandaya of HBO's Euphoria).Nick Fury has plans for Spider-Man, but Peter Parker has better ones this summer. He wants to attend a class trip to Paris and confess his feelings to MJ. Standing in his way are a series of elemental villains who are trying to destroy this Earth in the same way that they wiped out Mysterio's alternate Earth-833.There are at least three major plot twists that I have no interest in spoiler, other than to say that this was the best possible way to introduce Mysterio as the major villain in the life of Peter Parker. The mid-credits reveal of J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson drew loud cheers and applause in the theater I saw the film in, which made me smile. That's all the spoilers you're getting out of me, other than it's nice to actually be surprised by a film these days.Continuing the tradition of members of Spider-Man's Sinister Six showing up in minor roles - Mac Gargan (The Scorpion) and The Shocker were both in Spider-Man: Homecomng - one of Nick Fury's men is named Dmitri Smerdyakov, the real name of The Chameleon, who is the first supervillain to ever battle Spider-Man, all the way back in his first issue in 1963. Plus, Peter Billingsley (Ralphie himself!) reprises his role as William Ginter Riva from Iron Man. While he worked for Obadiah Stane back then, now he's part of Quentin Beck's entourage.Whether or not you appreciate this film depends on what camp you fall in as it relates to the opening of this piece. As for me, I'm pleased to report that the scenes where Mysterio manipulates reality are the best live action superheroics I've seen, a perfect spin on the visuals of the comic book world made wonderfully 3D. It's still not as great as Spider-Man: Into the Multiverse, but that's a movie that may never be topped.Hurry up and see it. The ending that sets up the next sequel made me start counting down the days to the next sequel!",Spider-Man - Far from Home
10,studioAT,A strong Spiderman film,6,20 August 2019,"I dip in and out of this whole MCU thing, but there's no denying its quality when it produces a film as good as this.Even without having watched the other films you can pick up the plot here (though of course it helps) as this works as just a fun Spiderman film, with good performances from Tom Holland, the ever lovely Zendaya, combining with lots of fun action sequences.These new Spiderman films are on a par with the Raimi trilogy.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

12,CinemaSerf,Sets your spidey-senses a-tingling!,8,26 November 2019,"The Spiderman franchise seems to be the one that is bucking the trend with the films actually getting better each time. The dynamic between Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal in this is great and now that we don't have to pretend we don't know Spidey's identity, we can develop the character much more fully so the relationship with MJ is also taking better shape too. It's fast-moving, entertaining and the plot is fun. For a change, the CGI is complementary to the production rather than the sole reason for it. Good stuff, this!!",Spider-Man - Far from Home
13,george.schmidt,"Peter Tingle! Holland's awkward charm is becoming iconic in spite of the echoing of SPIDER-MAN 3 (um, not a good thing)",8,4 July 2019,"SPIDER-MAN: FAR FROM HOME (2019) *** Tom Holland, Samuel L.

While the direction by Jon Watts and the screenplay by Erik Sommers is lively the tedious chockblock of CGI is underwhelming and over-the-top at the same time (echoing SPIDER-MAN 3; um, not a good thing).

14,view_and_review,Rebuilding,8,8 July 2019,"Emotionally I was going into this movie with a lot of ambivalence and reservations. We're entering a whole new era. Iron Man is gone, Captain America is gone, and the Avengers as we know them are no more. So, what does Marvel do moving forward? I know that Spider-Man is his own superhero but every MCU movie had ties to the Avengers.I expected a flop. Gladly, I got a good movie.Spider-Man vacations in Europe and he's needed there. The enemies are creatures called Elementals and they take the form of various elements (e.g. water, fire, air, etc.). That's one of the reasons I thought this movie would be weak because Spider-Man already had to fight a similar looking thing in Spider-Man 3 with the Sandman. I was thinking, ""Who cares to see him fight water or fire? That's a horrible premise."" Thankfully, the movie was more intelligent than that.Quentin Beck aka Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) ends up not being a superhero but a super-villain. I liked the twist. Even though it required a big production team and some next level tech I liked the idea of the Elementals being fictitious as opposed to real monsters. Furthermore, I wasn't too keen on a Mysterio as a superhero. He was too all-of-a-sudden and too generic.I also liked the Peter Parker-Mary Jane love story. It was more believable. They didn't overly romanticize it. It had a realistic awkward teenage feel to it and more of an innocence as well. I mean it helps that they both look like teenagers as well as opposed to the very adult Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. Their upside-down kiss in the rain was akin to The Notebook or some other romantic film. In this movie it was more muted, kind of playful, and definitely awkward (as you would expect Peter Parker to be).In short, I was pleasantly surprised. The MCU is not dead and a movie like this is a good step towards maintaining its quality production while refilling the void left by the loss of the Avengers.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
15,FlashCallahan,Nick Fury Just hijacked our summer vacation....,8,3 July 2019,"With Endgame still fresh in our memories (and our hearts), this film has huge shoes to fill, plus the fact that the whole Spider-Man franchise has gone through four different incarnations in the last 12 years, this film has a lot to prove.Well it proves itself in droves, as Far From Home cleanses the palate of what was a heavy meal with the events of Endgame.We know it has to have connotative elements to the rest of Phase 3, but the way it deals with it is light and breezy, and without sounding too macabre, downright funny in it's opening sequence with Betty Brant reading the school news.And this sets the mood for the rest of the film, and it's a relief that although Iron Man and Stark Industries are pivotal to the narrative, it doesn't dwell on death or the finger-snap, it lingers on hope and the fact that we do not stop, we go on, no matter what has tested us.Spider-man has always been the sunshine hero of the Marvel world, full of fun, colour, and vibrancy, and this is why Webb failed, and Marvel succeed, because this follows the winning formula of Homecoming.Holland nails it yet again as Parker, and here, we focus a lot more on Parker, him dealing with the loss of a mentor/Father figure, and his coming of age, not just with his gift, but with the predictability of him being a normal sixteen year old boy.When we join the class on holiday, this is where the film comes into it's own, the set pieces remind one of the heady days of the nineties, where there were probably only two or three tentpole films released in the summer, and these set pieces are just big, silly fun, and then we are introduced to Gyllenhall, who blows the film out of the water with Mysterio.It's a genius move to have someone who was in the running to play Spider-man at one time as a pivotal character, and Gyllenhall is really having fun as the troubled Mysterio, really living up to his name at times in the film.And then Far From Home goes from really good, to astounding, as the narrative turns on it's head. Yes, it may be a little predictable as to what certain characters motivations are, but their rationale is a wonderful inclusion that takes us right back to 2008.Add Jackson in an extended cameo, and a sub-plot involving Happy Hogan and Aunt May, Far From Home doesn't let the viewer suffer with MCU fatigue, as it just goes along for the ride, and has a lot of fun while it does it.You feel that a lot of weight has been lifted when you see this, it's what Spider-Man should be, a bright, fun-filled adventure, that never lets up, and keeps the viewer on it's toes.There is one scene that is a little dark toward the final act, it almost feels like the Scarecrow level from Arkham Asylum, but it's inventive, and again, quite important to the film.So all in all, it's a welcome sequel that is light in tone and heavy on set pieces.And the post credits sequence is by far the most mind blowing one from the MCU.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
16,phd_travel,Weak story nice scenery,3,18 September 2019,So many effects and grand battles in Venice Prague and London. But such a weak story what they are fighting about is so boring.

17,Aaron1375,My Peter tingle tells me to rate this movie highly!,9,19 August 2019,"After looking forward to Endgame for a year and wondering how it was going to play out, I have to say, while I enjoyed it I was mildly disappointed with it too. Certain aspects of it I did not care for, the way certain characters portrayed and such. So, then I saw the film that immediately followed and have to say I enjoyed this one a bit more than Endgame despite how huge that movie was. Of course, this may be due to the fact I am a huge Spider-man fan and he and Hulk are my favorite two comic book super heroes. That may be another reason I was a bit disappointed by Endgame, because Hulk really did not do all that much and seeing a character whose trademark line in the comics is Hulk is the strongest there is! constantly get beat and be a non factor really irked me. Enough about that one though, this one was a really good movie and had a very well done Mysterio.The story has Spider-man/Peter Parker still coming to terms with the death of his mentor and the fact that life has moved on for so many people while it seems like he stood still. Thankfully, nearly all of the people Peter know looks to have been taken out by the snap, which is a bit hard to believe, but I'll role with it. He tires of being Spider-man and just wants to enjoy his class trip to Europe; however, his mom, Happy and Nick Fury all think he needs to continue being Spider-man as a strange threat appears and Spider-man must team up with the strange Mysterio to try and thwart it.Mysterio was done very well in this film, during one scene where he confronted Spider-man I kept thinking this is exactly how Mysterio fights. I did think that this film would feature Scorpion due to the last Spider-man film, but it was cool to see Mysterio who is one of my fave Spidey villains on the big screen. Tom Holland continues to do a good job as both Spider-man and Peter Parker, a trait the earlier two lacked as Tobey was good as Peter, but lacked Spidey's delivery and Garfield could deliver the constant barrage of insults to his enemies, but did not fit the role of Peter at all.All in all a very good Spider-man movie and the way this one ended makes me wonder who might the villain be in the next one. I am hoping it is Kraven the hunter as I can see him in the next film after what they established at the end of this one or maybe the Scorpion will make his entrance into the Marvel cinematic universe? Who knows, not particularly excited about the universe moving forward, but I am always happy to see the wall crawler on the big screen.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
18,trashgang,took a while before I liked it,6,28 September 2019,"I never had any trouble with a spiderman movie but this one was i don't know a bit too childish at some points. I mean, the start it took a while before I really got into this movie. Somehow I even found it boring and the monsters attacking Venice or Prague I just don't care.But it's the effects that made me watch it further, and guess what. After 40 minutes i started to enjoy it. Again , due storyline and effects. The CGI is stunning. Naturally in a spiderman you need some jokes here and there and it does work with the glasses from Stark given to spiderman but some jokes are for me a bit too childish again.So much as I loved Homecoming (2017) on everypart so much i had my doubts about this one. Maybe it's the DC and Marvel world combining these days and created this in-between spiderman.Worth seeing for effects but not the best one for me.

19,Mr-Fusion,Another joyride,7,21 August 2019,"""Spider-Man: Far from Home"", that pleasing bit of Summer escapism that promised pretty much everything the first movie did. And it delivers; Holland still shines in the lead role, the villain is handled pretty damn effectively and the web-slinging is a lot of fun. There's a particular post-credit appearance that's a genuine delight (loved seeing this character again) and the humor provides just the MCU palate cleanser needed after the world-domination that was ""Endgame"". I enjoyed myself quite a bit.One aspect that surprised me is that, just as in the first movie, Tony Stark is once again leaned-on fairly heavily here; and it wasn't a sore spot for me this time. I think it was handled rather well.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
20,siderite,Quite adequate,7,13 September 2019,"I was quite dissatisfied with the story. The plot was convoluted, with a lot of personal issues that either went nowhere or went really off-book (can't say much about it without spoiling it, but you'll see). The ending was a bit predictable, then was somewhat invalidated by the end credits scenes. Technically it was great, the acting was top notch - maybe except for the annoying sidekicks that brought nothing to the film, but it felt off. Too technical, perhaps, I just didn't feel it. The jokes fell flat, the action was pointless because there was no back story and the big reveal came after the credits. Seriously, you just have to watch the end credits scenes to understand much of the film.Bottom line: merely average.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
21,DKosty123,A Fun Trip out of the Neighborhood Into The Future- Tingle,8,10 July 2019,"This one has a pace that never stops, plenty of action, and enough emotion to carry the story. Tom Holland does well as Parker/Spidey and he has plenty of support in this one. Rather than go over all of the cast, and warning Spidey's head nearly explodes at one point in this saga, lets show a sign of my age first.With all the locations, stunts, and fast movements, those items remind me of some of the Bond films. Now that you know how old I am, isn't it fun when Spidey's cell phone reminds him not to text while swinging. Of course Peter Parker has a girlfriend, and she gets to know him pretty well in this one, especially when he strips in front of her. He also strips for a female customs agent but that is to be expected with all this reaveling between borders.The big spoiler is really who can Parker trust, and who can't he trust. The plot twists here might surprise you. Meanwhile, wow Spidey's Aunt Em (Marisa Tomei) can still model jeans which shes definitely packed into. This one has another great soundtrack. The Marvel music choices always seem very good and this film is no exception.There's a new Avenger world on tap, and some heros we really need. Then there is monkey man, and some other diversions thrown in. This one is definitely a great summer respite from dull movies. Marvel scores again. It is good enough that the Peter Tingle scores.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
22,lasttimeisaw,FAR FROM HOME unyieldingly adheres to its high-school puppy love lightheartedness,6,8 October 2019,"The timing seems apposite to weigh in Martin Scorsese's recent headline-grabbing remark that ""Marvel's superhero movies do not hold up to the standard of 'true cinema'"", as this reviewer has just watched the second installment of Tom Holland's standalone Spidey outing.It is axiomatic that the products from Marvel studio and its ilks represent very different esthetics from what Scorsese's ""true cinema"" entails, and the former is, beyond doubt, esthetically inferior. Merchandized and streamlined to pander to their key audience who is weaned on consumerism and the millennial nerd culture, bombarding and even brainwashing them with its numerous iterations of its cookie-cutters saving-the-world plot, Marvel's movies (with occasional outliers like GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY franchise) are not keen on alterations in their bland world-building, it is especially frustrating since they own the cutting-edge technology and fiscal means to maximally individualize their output, and most of the time, they simply rest on their laurels of a massive money spinner and fabricate publicity-seeking ballyhoos.In the case of FARM FROM HOME, after the ill-adventure of THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN twofer, and a renewed interest whetted by initiating Spider-man....reading my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",Spider-Man - Far from Home
23,thesar-2,Now You Spider Me 3,8,13 July 2019,"I swear Peter Parker has more costume changes than Cher has in all her Farewell shows.And that's not a complaint. The very first Iron ""Spider"" Man suit he was wearing was the absolute worst and almost turned me off immediately to this movie. Mercifully, they ditched that idea fairly quickly.Everyone has their favorite Bond, Superman, Batman. (Daniel Craig, Christopher Reeve and Michael Keaton, respectfully. Jus sayin'.) And my favorite Webslinger is Tobey Maguire, by a landslide. Now, Tom Holland's fine and better than Andrew Garfield - but only in acting, not looks. Garfield definitely looked more like Spidey to me. But, I digress.Holland's okay. No offense to that fine actor, but I don't think anyone, including myself, goes to see a Spider-Man movie because he leads it. Now, that said, having Jacob ""Ned"" Batalon and Tony ""Flash"" Revolori back, plus the additional Remy ""Brad"" Hii, are huge draws for me.I digress, again. ""Far From Home"" is one huge swing above Holland's first Iron Man Jr. movie, ""Homecoming."" While the first chapter was fine, it was nowhere near as good as the original Maguire trilogy, though oodles better than the Amazing Spider-Man duo.Now, that said, I'd rank this 8th big screen Solo Spider-Man movie about half-way down the list with Spider-Man 2, 1 and Into the Spider-Verse edging this out. It's good, but super long. C'mon guys...I know you relish in avoiding the editing process, but a solid half-hour could've been cut from this and made it rank probably higher.Peter Parker & Co (kids from school plus two dimwitted chaperones) are headed to Europe! And as ALL SUPERHERO MOVIE TROPES GO: Parker just wants to be normal and give his ""great responsibilities"" a rest. Also, as always, it's for a love interest. And, as always, danger gets in the way and heroism is needed.A new hero emerges, but anyone who's ever seen a Spidey comic or cartoon before knows where this is going and, despite that, it's pretty well done and I like the arc Parker has to change to advance the story.The action is pretty darn good, the jokes work about 75% of the time and the chemistry between all the actors on screen: very well done. The score's just okay, never, ever memorable and the enormous tie-ins to Tony Stark (plus Endgame) was annoying to me. No, I'm not a fan of the Iron Man Jr./Spider-Man alternative universe. I'm a fan of Parker discovering all his powers, weaknesses, abilities, suits and webs on his own. My biggest gripe with ""Homecoming"" was that it was just Iron Man 4 with special guest star: Spider-Man. This one, mercifully, has some less Stark in it, but it does find Parker at bat...alone. Somewhat, but still. The Bat, Baseball Gear, Ball, Training, Funding...all still: Tony.Overall, I liked it a ton, despite its flaws and things that should've been cut. I didn't, however, like the two post credit scenes. The first: YOU NEED TO SEE, the second - like 14 minutes later!!! egad - you really don't. Sure, it's part of the movie, and does provide information, but it can be skipped until you can see this again at home and can, thankfully, fast-forward those 14 wasted minutes.This European Vacation is recommended and WAY better than the Griswold one.***Final thoughts: Back to those post credits. I understand the direction these Avenger-(mostly Tony Stark)-heavy Spider-Man movies are going, but I hated the first post credit scene with the exception of one AWESOME returning character/actor. I know how Iron Man 1 set the tone for the remaining 20+ MCU films, but I sure as heck miss the olden days of Superheroes and their alter-egos.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
24,cherold,Slight but entertaining,7,17 September 2019,"This cute movie has Spider-Man on a school trip where his goal to woo a girl is hampered by the need to save the world.This is a light, funny movie. It comes directly after the events of Avengers Endgame, and seems to be designed as a frothy dessert for overstuffed Avengers fans.It's all perfectly enjoyable. Tom Holland is charming and vulnerable Spider-Man, Jake Gyllenhaal manages to be persuasive even as his role alters, and Zendaya is the impossibly cool girl I would have had a crush on in high school too.At the same time, it's not very memorable. The action scenes are fine, but nothing really blew me away, and the movie is more notable as a high school comedy than as a superhero flick.The movie has two interesting post credit bits, one setting up a promising sequel that I'm not sure will ever happen, since there was some sort of recent negotiation crash between license holder and production company, and a cute, funny one that also manages to make sense of certain elements of the story.Should you watch it? Yes. Will you remember it a month later? Probably not.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

26,Robert_duder,Good solid summer time tentpole flick,8,17 July 2019,"I liked Spiderman: Far From Home. I enjoyed it a lot. I am still surprised at the type of fan fare it is getting though with many people giving it a ten and saying it's the best live action spiderman they've ever seen. I wouldn't go that far to giving it credit. What it does well is follow up Endgame very well and tells a whole new story. It also manages to bring the underlying story of Spiderman to the big screen and that is a kid with superhero powers trying to balance that with being a teenager and falling in love and school and friends etc. This manages to capture that very well considering it's all about monsters and aliens and destruction. The CGI battles are plenty and the CGI is quite well done but there is a lot of it. It was nice to have some of the younger people playing supporting cast members like Zendaya (who actually makes a very good, layered MJ) , Jacob Batalon and Angourie Rice. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a decent villain as the bizarre Mysterio. He sort of overplays it, a little campy at times but it works for the most part. I didn't think his chemistry with Tom Holland was all that great but it was still good to see a new villain on the big screen. Speaking of chemistry, I think Tom Holland and Zendaya are actually great together and I wasn't sure how she would fare as Mary Jane but the two of them are quite good together. This is a great summer flick, exactly what you would expect, shows the Marvel Universe has more to offer and it's a lot of fun. 8/10",Spider-Man - Far from Home
27,Pjtaylor-96-138044,With great power...,8,4 July 2019,"'Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019)' is a solid superhero story that's always enjoyable, at its best when continuing the 'high-school' aesthetic of its predecessor. It sometimes tends to get a little lost in spectacle and a few of its elements don't quite make sense. Of course, the spectacle is always impressively rendered and suitably entertaining, though occasionally a little intangible, and the portions of the plot that don't quite add up are easy to look past since the thing is generally so fun. By raising the stakes and trying to make things feel 'big', the flick sets itself apart from its predecessor. Thankfully, it doesn't really miss out on what made 'Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)' so amazing, though. Character is still at the forefront, which puts this above a considerable amount of other entries in its genre. Pretty much everyone on screen feels like a real person. Their interactions are always entertaining (and often funny) and the main players have mostly satisfying, if sometimes slightly rushed, arcs. It does seem to get slightly confused as to what the central character conflict is, but this doesn't heavily dampen the effect of the overall narrative. The flick also continues the trend of having fantastic villains in (non-Garfield) Spidey stories - even if its baddie doesn't reach the heights of Keaton's 'Vulture' or Molina's 'Doc Ock'. Much has been made of the piece's post-credits sequences. Though they effortlessly set-up a sequel by having consequences that can't be ignored, at least one of them really should have been before the credits because it's the proper ending. Overall, the film is fun, well-constructed, occasionally subversive and tangibly consequential. It's a solid slice of superhero entertainment that has a few flaws but remains a good time throughout. 8/10.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
28,ThomasDrufke,Where is the Heart?,7,22 July 2019,"I think much like other Marvel projects of late (not named Avengers), I've found it hard to muster up any sort of unique opinion on the films. They are typically the definition of average, mediocre, luke-warm, and 'okay'. Spider-Man: Far From Home is a film that sadly had to follow the monumental achievement of Avengers: Endgame, it was almost doomed to not live up to expectations from the very beginning.But then, Jake Gyllenhaal signs on to play Mysterio and the marketing was fantastic for the film as well, giving most people hope that the script must be nothing short of spectacular for someone like Gyllenhaal (notoriously picky) to sign on. And while the film has some great moments, and game changing decisions for the MCU, I'm not sure it was a good 'Spider-Man' film. I will probably always be somewhat partial to the Tobey Maguire films since I grew up with them, and even the Andrew Garfield ones due to the magnetic chemistry he had with Emma Stone. But I also can't deny that Tom Holland is likely the best combination of Peter Parker and Spider-Man we've ever had. With that said, I can't help but think his best entries have been in the Avengers films, and not necessarily his standalone adventures.Since Sony has allowed Marvel to use Spider-Man in the MCU, it has made Parker's story feel less focused and centric, and more universe focused. I never mind a little connective tissue, but I also don't want Spider-Man's films to feel like sequels or prologues to Avengers stories. Alas, here we are with Far From Home.I say all that because I think this outing is an entertaining, at times hilarious, and ultimately well-shot action adventure film. But I think the heart is missing. I'm not emotionally attached to Peter, Aunt May, or his love interest (in this case, Michelle/MJ) as much as I definitely should be. It's not a good sign when a 10 second shot at the end of Avengers: Endgame when Peter and Ned reunite gave me more emotion than 2 full Spider-Man films.Visually the film feels somewhat fresh considering it takes place entirely outside the United States, and certainly Mysterio creates an interestingly unique visual representation of what a film can be. And to its credit, the film does a nice job of re-establishing the relationship between MJ/Peter. Even though her personality is nowhere near what MJ has always been, I can't deny they have much better chemistry in this film compared to Homecoming. Overall, this film will fall into the same category that 75% of the other MCU films do, solid but ultimately forgettable.7.2/10",Spider-Man - Far from Home
29,Edvis-1997,Don't skip end credits,8,24 February 2021,"Movie was really good. From the beginning I loved that this film starts with Whitney Houston song. We will miss Iron man and other part was cute but looked not necessary(I'm fan of Iron man and other super heroes but it looked really cheap and lack of context). Can't talk a lot about visuals. It looked good,sound effects were nicely made, but what else you can expect from Marvel? Acting was on point, it was convincing, I didn't see anyone who did bad job in this film. Plot was okay. From the beginning that green guy or mysteryo looked very suspicious so I didn't see plot twist here. I can say that I wanted a little bit more action istead of chatting. Also, I can't understand why Hollywood loves to put actors who are almost decade older than their personages. Ending was good, can't really complain about it. I didn't see plot twist coming at end credits, it surprised me in a good way. I really enjoyed this movie, however, I liked newest Thor and End game movies more. I would say this film could take spot in top20 movies of 2019. Worth to watch,especially, if you're fan of Marvel or Comics.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

31,Cineanalyst,Multiverse Allusions and Illusions,8,3 July 2019,"It took 23 movies, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe finally has a thoroughly self-reflexive entry with ""Spider-Man: Far From Home,"" and it's clever enough to make this one of the best of the entire series. In more ways than one, ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019) irrevocably altered the universe. The introduction of time travel--which allowed the movie to revisit and annotate prior MCU entries--already pointed the way for the movie-within-a-movie concept employed here. And, indeed, much of this one is spent ruminating over the fallout of ""Endgame."" The antagonist, Mysterio, is at the center of this construction; he uses an image projection system to create illusions--essentially, he directs a movie-within-a-movie, for what is cinema, especially one as laden with CGI and fantastic superhuman characters, if not an illusion. Like other MCU movies, Mysterio's projections involve destroying whole cities as spectators look on with awe. This isn't the usual silly alien invasion fluff. It's a movie versus a movie within. And no hero in the MCU is better equipped for this allusive turn than the ""really old""-movie-referencing web-slinger Spiderman. Heretofore merely concerned with being a local hero of reflecting similar films that came before him--""your friendly neighborhood Spiderman,"" who, say, would run through backyards like in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" (1986)--he's now fully invested in meta cinematic universe building.Of course, there's still the obligatory romantic pining and the high-school jokes are a plenty, and the sequel follows the traditional route of being a globe-trotting follow-up (including the countries in large text across the screen alongside the names of famous cities, lest someone mistake Venice, Italy for Venice Beach, I guess). But, I love the self-reflexive meta-narrative. This is a cinematic multiverse (and a rather apt response to the stakes for complexly-layered narrative being raised by ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" (2018), I might add). One of the illusions Mysterio puts Spiderman through is especially wonderful in its surrealism, and the climax essentially comprises Spidey entering Mysterio's movie to deconstruct the illusion, which alludes to what the entire meta-narrative construction is subtly doing in the first place.Even the after-credits scenes, which are often merely irrelevant bits of humor in these superhero flicks, furthers this construction and deconstruction. The shapeshifting (another form of illusion) aliens from ""Captain Marvel"" (2019) make a return, and Fury gets up to leave a virtual-reality beach he's vacationing in, complete with an illusion on a screen. He's figuratively doing the same thing patrons of ""Far From Home"" are about to do: exit the theatre. Moreover, these illusions specifically allude--similar to ""Endgame"" in its traveling back in time to past movies--to prior pictures in the MCU, such as the ""BARF"" virtual reality show put on by Tony in ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016), the joke recalling Tony's revelatory press conference from ""Iron Man"" (2008) and Fury's virtual-reality room recalling Loki's (another shapeshifting master of illusion, by the way) prison cell from ""Thor: The Dark World"" (2013).Perhaps, the only thing I'm not sure if I'm keen on here is Peter Parker continuing to execute his powers on behalf of the techno-corporate overlords and private clandestine military outfits of Stark Industries and S.H.I.E.L.D.--most conspicuously by idolizing the late Tony Stark. None of which is to dwell on the wisdom or lack thereof of handing over a vast arsenal of weaponry to a teenager. As in ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (2016), those looking to compete with these masters of plutocracy are labelled terrorists--as with Vulture, as with Mysterio and the other disaffected workers held under the grandiose thumb of Iron Man, even from the grave. One wonders what the multitude of visual effects artists and other laborers churning out these productions for the likes of Bob Iger or Kenichiro Yoshida make of this narrative.The DC universe has a similar situation with the billionaire Batman, and like him, the protector of moneyed interests and practitioner of militarized invasions of the citizenry's rights, (after all, Parker deletes a peer's cell-phone picture and accidentally orders a drone strike on him, to boot), Spiderman either dies or lives long enough (even if still in high school) to see himself become the villain--at least according to the Daily Bugle. Because he's the hero the universe deserves, but not the one it needs right now.... He's a dark knight.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
32,ericstevenson,I thought Mysterio was an Asgard,10,8 July 2019,"This movie features Spider-Man going on vacation with his class to Italy. As you might have guessed, trouble follows him there. He's recruited to stop giant monsters called the Elementals from destroying the Earth. He gets help from Mysterio. I love the opening, where it shows the deceased Avengers. I thought it was in memoriam to Stan Lee at first!Captain America is mentioned, so it can be assumed he died of old age. We get this great bit at the beginning where they talk about having to adjust to half the population being five years older. While they don't go into much detail, it's still great to acknowledge. Now, fans of the comics would know what the twist is and it happens halfway through the film. As someone who is a fan, it's still set up really well. As if that wasn't enough, they throw in another huge twist at the end.And then they throw in another twist at the very end! Honestly, I really don't want to say what happens, but just let me say that it's probably the biggest example of an MCU film that must be seen to be believed. Peter Parker's friend is a lot of fun, although I do think Mary Jane could have been better. I just love how bright and colorful this movie is! Everything really does make sense in the end!

35,851222,"Much better then first, but Spider Man must free itself from shadow of Avengers if it want's truly shine",8,13 May 2020,"Greetings from Lithuania.I didn't really like first film set Marvel universe of Spider Man. It was just an OK at its very best. And i wasn't looking forward to this one to be honest, kinda forced myself into watching it during quarantine - but i was very pleasantly surprised of how much i enjoyed this movie. I have not seen any trailers for it nor did not anything about it, and i won't spoil anything, but i highly enjoyed the villain of this movie - very good concept, probably one of the most original in this franchise. Also action sequences were good, as well as good humor and some involving characters.Overall, while ""Spider-Man: Far from Home"" isn't the best Spider Man movie i have ever seen, it was much more better then i expected it to be. The downside of this character in this series i see is that it needs to free itself from Avengers shadow - almost every 5 min this movie we do get very big references to this Juggernaut series with Nick F. and Stark and all other stars. I think Spider Man should be a star of its movie, like in previous movies, without remembering to audiences every 5 min the universe he is in.

37,ironhorse_iv,"Spiderman, Spiderman, does whatever a spider can! Spin a web any size! Catch thieves just like flies! Look out, here comes the Spiderman! Truly this is one film worth looking",8,26 October 2019,"Honestly to tell you the truth. I was really getting superhero fatigue before going into this film directed by Jon Watts. I thought I was done with seeing Marvel Cinematic Universe movies after seeing 2019 'Avengers: Endgame'. After all, 22 superheroes flicks from Marvel Studios with three featuring Peter Parker Aka Spiderman (Tom Holland) with two other movie series featuring the web-slinger played by other actors produced by Sony can be too much. Nevertheless 'Spiderman: Far from Home' got some of my Spidey senses tingling when it was announced that one of my favorite comic book individuals, Quentin Beck Aka Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) was going to be in the motion picture fighting along with the Web-Head against Elementals throughout Europe. Without spoiling the film too much, for the most part, I was not disappointed even if the baby face to heel is highly predictable and obvious to anybody who readt the comics. While the clichés battle scenes in the beginning with the CGI heavy elementals felt a bit recycled, after subsequently after watching similar action sequences from 2007 'Spider-Man 3'. The later fights got very interesting and clever with the villain feeding on the Webslinger's fears of trying to live up to his mentor. The continuous illusions were visually stunning and super creepy and chilling at the same time. On the edge of my seat throughout the whole time. Well Shot. I also dig that Parker in this movie has more character depth, besides the fact that Pete is an outsider in high school with common coming to age issues like trying to get with a girl and being popular in school. Yet, the point that the villain has more of a grudge against Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) than the title character, makes Spiderman seem secondary. Even without Robert Downey Jr. it's still the Iron Man show. Nevertheless, it was still a great way to reconnect some of the loose ends establish from 2016 'Captain America: Civil War' like the BARF concept. However, the whole manipulative plan seem a bit unrealistic. There is no way, it can perfectly be control to a tee like that. Outsider forces will clearly interfere. Although silly, the Stark-like millionaire playboy mannerism from Gyllenhaal & lost boy seeking father figure look from Holland made those conflicts seem semi genuine and intense. Both also did a hell of a job with their physic and mental performances. As for the supporting cast, I found the classmates of Peter to be less annoying than the last movie. Characters like Michelle Jones (Zendaya) really got better as her depressing persona died down a bit. She was mostly lovely in this film and more like the spitfire that MJ was in the comics. I just wish the filmmakers had the balls to make the character's hair red. If not, establish Mary Jane Watson as quickly as possible. As for Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon), he is delightful with his limited role. He was indeed funny. As for the rest of the current roster of Midtown School of Science and Technology's Academic Decathlon team, they were fine even if the concept of visiting common tour sites in Europe doesn't make sense with what they're supposedly learning in school. It's also very strange that the group was rarely affected by 'the Blip AKA the Snap'. None of them has aged five years or seem to have any trauma. To tell the truth, the whole world seem pretty fine after half the world population return from the dust. You would think things would be more chaotic than a brief mention of homelessness problems likes urban and biological decay, resources shortages and economic and political collapse during that time period. The world should look more apocalyptic. Nevertheless, I really didn't like how the film made the snap seem like a joke. The tongue in cheek 'In Memorial' slideshow in the beginning kinda ruin the serious impact of the last movie. As for the other humor involving the teen situation comedy road trip & Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury popping up at times was alright for what it is. Even the odd love affair between Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) & Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) were decent enough to watch even if 'hot may' jokes were so yesteryear. Nevertheless, Marvel Studio's utter refusal to reuse the same Uncle Ben's narrative is getting pretty jarring. As for the final post credits sequences containing a multitude of mind blowing Easter eggs and cameo moments. The whole feeding the sequel narrative of 2019 'Captain Marvel' was confusing but interesting. Yet I found J. Jonah Jameson's appearance to be best. Glad to see J.K Simmons return to the role. It felt special. Sadly, the film does not contain an appearance by writer Stan Lee as he died in 2018. It sucks that he didn't get to have 'Spiderman: Far From Home' as his final cameo. Spiderman has always been his favorite superhero, he help created at Marvel Comics. Regardless, the film did had an amazing soundtrack by composer Michael Giacchino. It was easy to the ears. Overall: I have to say for Spidey's second solo swing through the MCU. It was entertaining for the most part. Even with its flaws; I can still highly recommended checking it out. It's one web of illusions worth getting stuck to.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
38,The-Sarkologist,Entertaining,7,10 July 2019,"Well, this is the first post-Endgame movie, and as with the way Marvel sets the films up, this is a somewhat more light hearted one. Well, that certainly was the case, though I can't say that I found it anywhere near as funny as some of the other Marvel films that I have seen. Mind you, it is Spiderman, so I never really considered it to be funny in the same way that Antman was, but on the other hand, it sort of does have this rather, low key, feel about it - you know the whole 'Friendly Neighbourhood Spiderman'.The thing is that in this film, as you can tell from the title (and from the trailers) that he is in Europe. That sort of puts Spiderman somewhat out of his comfort zone, except that the reason he is in Europe is because he is going on a school excursion, so I guess that teenage spirit still exists here. In fact we are reminded a number of times that Spiderman is basically a 16 year old kid, and having the whole suggestion of taking over Iron Man's role doesn't sit well with him (and apparently he was never actually a full blown member).Now, we have the opponent, Mysterio, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, who certainly has some moments. Look, I'll be honest as point out that I never really got into the comics all that much, so I'm not all that familiar with him, but the scenes were he is playing the master of illusions were certainly done really, really well. Look, I actually quite admire Gyllenhaal's ability, it is just that, well, he was rather uncharacteristically stale at the beginning of the film, and this was also rather uncharacteristic of Marvel, which tends to put quite a lot of effort into producing the best film possible. Disney certainly isn't a company that cuts corners when it comes to producing movies.Anyhow, the first part of the film, as I mentioned, did feel somewhat awkward, but it certainly got somewhat better as it progressed, especially when it came to light that Mysterio certainly wasn't the character we thought he was (though I suspect that a lot of hard core fans already knew that). The illusions were certainly done quite well, as was Spiderman. Of course, we also have the cut scenes at the end, and there was certainly quite an interesting reveal there as well, which is certainly setting the scene for the next few films in the series.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Only plus is mysterio but like always villains get wasted because they are not loki or thanos.Kevin feige maybe the legs and brains of the mcu but he is bad at creating consistent long lasting villains.If Marvel can't protect their own Spider Man. Then X-Men and Fantastic 4 is doomed. No pun intended because MCU is about to make X-Men and F4 into rotten trash.,Spider-Man - Far from Home

43,cruise01,"Amazing, fun, and top notch with the action.",10,4 July 2019,"Spider-Man: Far From Home (5 out of 5 stars).Spider-Man: Far From Home is a great stylized fun superhero film. And the second sequel that surpasses the original and lives up to the rest of the MCU movies. It is a lot of fun, action packed; Tom Holland and the cast were great. The story does take in for a surprising turn with a mysterious character like Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) appearing out of nowhere to fight against these giant beasts called Elementals. Which he needs the help from Spider-Man (Tom Holland).The plot literally begins right after the events of Avengers: Endgame. The world is recovering from the snap. Peter and his classmates are going on a European trip. Peter is trying to express his feelings for MJ (Zendaya). While, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is trying to enlist Peter to join him and Mysterio to battle against Elementals that are appearing around the world.It was a great plot. Referencing back to Endgame from the snap and the aftermath of people trying to resume their lives. The plot does play around with the idea of multi universes and dimensions. Without giving spoilers about the villains like the elementals. Mysterio is an interesting character. Peter wants a normal life to be a regular teenager. Nick wants Peter to claim the responsibility of being an Avenger. That Tony Stark would want Peter to take his position.The direction, the music score, and the script are fast moving. It is also a lot of fun. Peter's class mates also deliver with them embarking on a trip. Some of them questioning Peter's absence when he disappears during big fights. There is plenty of humor to make you laugh and cheer for the character. I think this is by far one of the better Spider-Man films that has a great time and delivering a lot of action without letting it distract you from a story.There are a lot of fun action sequences. Jon Watts direction did a great job with the cinematography work in capturing the action. Seeing a blown up shot with Mysterio battling against the elementals. And Spider-man flying between buildings and doing some aerial fights. There is a twist that spins the film in an interesting direction which we have not seen in any of the Spider-man movies thus far. It is trippy, crazy, and insane but well made. You will know when Spider-man comes across this scene.Overall, Spider-Man: Far From Home is a great superhero film. It is one of the best movies in the MCU series. I loved it more than the first film. Tom Holland and the cast ensemble did great. Zendaya had more of a bigger role which she does great. Jon Favreau and Marisa Tomei were fun and great. Jake Gyllenhaal did a great job as his character which was quite interesting. The film is action packed, funny, and one of the fun superhero movies you will enjoy. There are also a mid credit scene and at the very end a post credit scene that is definitely worth checking out. Which may be setting up for an interesting direction in the MCU.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

45,eddie_baggins,A swinging good time across Europe,7,3 July 2019,"Much like its very entertaining and endlessly fun predecessor, Spider-Man: Far From Home may not be the type of film that will leave any form of lasting impression on viewers, but thanks to a loveable cast, energetic pace and a collection of visually strong set pieces, Marvel's newest event film is yet another win for the world conquering studio.A film much lighter than this year's box office behemoth Endgame, Home sees the return of director Jon Watts and his main cast members for another bout of comedy infused/teen romance filled action adventure antics, that wisely moves Tom Holland's webslinger from the tried and true surrounds of New York City to a European filled vacation, that is anything but your run of the mill school based trip.It's a fresh spin on the Spider-Man cinematic universe and one that removes Home from anything that has come before in the many Spidey lead movies that have found their way into existence over the last 20 years and it also allows Watts, Marvel and the character of Peter Parker time to reflect on the events of Endgame but also begin to move on from them, in what's an important next step for the Marvel film series.While this is a big move for a Spider-Man film, Home doesn't mess with the formula too much as it fly's along at a rapid speed of which most of what occurs will be expected but thankfully its charming cast and wit goes along way to keeping things feeling fresh and fun, while the inclusion of fan favourite Mysterio is sure to delight diehard and casual fans alike and also helps the film achieve a great sense of added intrigue.Played by Jake Gyllenhaal (who is a great get by the Marvel hierarchy), Mysterio aka Quentin Beck, is brilliantly bought to life by the endlessly talented A-lister who is quite evidently having a blast getting a chance to be a part of this large scale undertaking and his on screen chemistry with Holland is an additonal bonus as the two bounce off each other whenever they share the screen.It's all relatively fluffy stuff, there's not a whole lot of meat on the bones of this newest addition to the Marvel cannon but there's enough growth in the character of Parker and Spider-Man to get exicted by where the next steps (swings) will take us, while the high hit ratio of jokes and some seriously juicy end credit sequences ensure this will be a huge winner for audiences.Final Say -With a great turn from new additon Jake Gyllenhaal, top notch work from it's returning cast and an overarching sense of playfulness and fun, Spider-Man: Far From Home is another highly enjoyable gift from the studio that keeps on giving.3 1/2 Led Zeppelin songs out of 5",Spider-Man - Far from Home
46,filipemanuelneto,A nice addition to the long list of Spiderman movies.,9,2 February 2020,"I haven't seen ""Avengers: Endgame"" yet, but after some reading I realized that this movie works almost like a sequel, reporting events after that movie. The script is quite simple: after being part of the Avengers team, Peter Parker tries to return to a minimally normal life and take a trip through Europe with his high school classmates. But the emergence of new threats to the world will frustrate Spider-Man's vacation plans and, at the same time, put to the test the confidence that the late Tony Stark placed in him.The film continues to be starring Tom Holland in the role of Spider-Man. He has progressed a lot from one film to the next and here he is much more solid and tailored for the character. Jake Gyllenhaal gave the villain life in an impeccable way and Samuel L. Jackson makes a flawless performance too. Zendaya was discreet but competent, leading the younger cast. The only negative criticism I make of her is that she did not get a particularly good chemistry with Holland.The film maintains the adolescent and light spirit that we feel in ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" but the quality of the plot and the story told seemed to me better. I felt that this film has an easier time captivating and holding our attention. The comedy, on the other hand, was also much better accomplished and does not transform Spider-Man into a silly boy inside a suit, as happened in ""Homecoming"". The action scenes follow one another and will please fans easily, and the state-of-the-art visual, special and CGI effects are sure to impress the audience.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

48,leonblackwood,Fed up with watching an immature Spider-Man. 4/10,4,15 February 2020,"Review:
Will they ever get this franchise right? I really wasn't a fan of this film because the whole ""teenager on a school trip"" concept was ridiculous, and the script was awful. They tried there utmost to make it funny, but it just didn't work, and Tom Holland's constant whining about how much he wanted to be with his school friends, and trying to get the girl, became tedious after a while. I can't believe that Spider-man went through the whole of Infinity War and Endgame, saving the world with the Avengers, and ended up dodging Nick Fury's calls because he wanted to be with his friends. On top of that, the humongous creatures that were attacking Europe weren't enough for the school to cancel the trip, which was totally unrealistic. The major twist in the film was also written badly, which was a shame because I actually liked Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) before he turned dark. On the plus side, I did like seeing the aftermath of Tony Stark death, and how the so-called ""blip"" affected the world, but with all that in mind, Spider-man still was acting like an immature teenager, even though he was heavily involved in the battle against Thanos. The whole drone concept was also completely ridiculous, and the fact that no one realised that it was all an illusion, blew my mind. Although I found the film disappointing, Tom Holland is a good Spider-man, in terms of his movements and action scenes, but I think it's about time that he took his role as a super-hero seriously. I don't know how close the character is to the comics, so I can't totally blame the director for his vision but I'm really getting fed up with his boyish behaviour, especially after Tony Stark took him under his wing. The action scenes made the film watchable, even though they were extremely far-fetched, and the ending left the franchise open for many possibilities, but I still expected more after Endgame. Disappointing!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Jon Watts, who also brought you Cop Car, starring Kevin Bacon, and Spider-Man: Homecoming, which was also disappointing. He's returning to direct another Spider-Man movie, which is due out in July 2021, after Tom Holland saved the film from cancellation by forcing renegotiations with Sony and Disney. It's the 28th film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and with other movies being released from the MCU franchise beforehand, the plot of the next Spider-Man is unknown. I hope they show a different side to this character because the gullible Spider-Man concept has been done to death.Budget: $160million

49,TheMovieDiorama,Spider-Man: Far From Home swings from New York to Europe through floundering webs of exposition.,6,4 July 2019,"Superhero fatigue is really kicking into full gear now, and not even my ""Peter-Tingle"" can avoid such a fate. I enjoyed 'Homecoming'. It had its flaws and pacing issues, but delivered a smart take on the origin story that we've seen countless times before. Unfortunately for this sequel, it has far too many plot points to resolve acting as a sequel to 'Homecoming', 'Endgame', and closure to an entire phase of the MCU, to which it's overstuffed. A case of the old ""too many spiders on the spider web."" (Y'know, that famous phrase...). So, after the infamous ""blip"" that occurred, everything is back to normal which sees Peter adjust to life post-Avengers as he attempts to deal with global responsibilities and growing feelings for his classmate MJ.Alas, life is never that simple for the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man, as he must help combat the Elementals with the assistance of the mysterious Mysterio. The fibrous silk that is the narrative structure comprises of teen romance, high school comedy and superhero shenanigans. Three sub-genres mixed together to create a frivolous spider web that holds little to no weight. Now, hear me out! Viewing these genres as separate strands of entertainment, and the film is just that. Entertaining. The blossoming romance between Peter and MJ is delicate and loveable. The high school comedy is punchy and well-written, albeit somewhat forced and failed to personally make me crack up. And the superhero efforts made for some blockbusting extravaganzas, in particular the entire third act (which suffice to say, saved the entire film). Silky Venetian goodness.However, the heavy-handed execution of combining these tonal changes was mediocre to say the least. Immediately, the introductory scene allows Mysterio, an Elemental and various returning characters to enter the scene. Literally, ten seconds. But that's not my biggest problem. That primary issue goes to plot conveniences. In order to shift the genres, McKenna writes several unlikely conveniences (such as an Elemental randomly appearing in Venice where Peter was at the time) that sprays a huge jet of disbelief across the script. Oh but wait, apparently that was all planned! It's incredibly lazy. And, like I said, only embedded to shift the genre tones. What's worse is the excessive amount of exposition that exists, in what is one of the worst scenes from the entire MCU. A certain Mysterio reeling off a certain amount of unnecessary exposition to people in a certain bar. It was terrible. Atrocious even! So noticeable that I shook my head in anger.Why was I angry? Because the rest of the film was pretty decent! Holland was fantastic once again as the eponymous hero and was able to showcase a range of emotional complexities. Zendaya was magnificent with her deadpan delivery. But the standout, which comes as no surprise, is Gyllenhaal. Never mind his outstanding natural beauty, it's his acting! He was a perfect choice for Mysterio. Despite a few directional choices regarding his character which I did not necessarily appreciate, he was charismatic and memorable enough to be an excellent supporting character. The illusory scenes were inventive, involving and a perfect demonstration of Mysterio's mischief. The visual effects, excluding a few human CGI moments, heightened the bombastic excitement of the third act. And heck, even the mid and post-credit scenes were of notable value.It's just a shame that the narrative cohesion that makes this web sticky holds little viscosity. If it wasn't for the performances and third act, this spider would've drowned in the Venetian canals.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

However the movie is like remaking the Lord of the rings with Bilbo being a human. Peter Parker and Aunt May and Mary Jane aren't who they are supposed to be and I don't care if this is an alternate universe.Even Mysterio is different including his back story. It doesn't work for me.Even the script is poorly written. The story didn't make sense. The characters were plastic. Traveling through Europe was filler.They threw out the spider sense because it would make their script not work. Also because it would prevent the holograms from functioning. Which by the way, holograms do not work like Professor X sneaking in to your mind making you think you are being punched.Overall this movie represents how corporations have taken over the creative process of making movies that need more artists. There was no common sense or logic in the movie. It failed on all levels.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
52,SAMTHEBESTEST,BY FAR BEST SPIDEY FILM IN NEW MCEU FRANCHISE !,7,5 July 2019,"SPIDER MAN FAR FROM HOME REVIEW :
It's been more than 12 years to the end of Best Spiderman Trilogy made by Sam Raimii and we are yet to see a better spidey film. Let it remain Best and i am happy with it. Spiderman Into the Spider verse made it look better than forgettable The Amazing Spider-Man series hence standing as Best Spidey Film of this decade. Here comes Spiderman Far From Home as the Biggest Competitor to the Spider Verse for the Best Spidey Film recently. Spider Man Homecoming introduced Tom Holland as beloved Peter Parker in MCU and the Sequel has surpassed the introduction film by far.This Spiderman film was different because it was coming just after the Global Phenomena called Avenger End Game, so the pressure was there. That burden was heavy to carry especially after knowing the possibility that Spidey could be the alternative replacement of Iron Man, and Director Jon Watts porteraged the burden on his shoulder successfully. World needs Next Iron Man but ypu know No one can be Next Iron, so just be a Spider Man. The formula has worked. Far From Home tells the story of Spiderman who is chosen by Tony Stark to carry forward his Superhero legacy but a teenage guy doesn't seems to be prepared for this. As we meet Mr. Beck, how some mistakes of Spidey cost him to put his friends in danger and make him realise his responsibilities takes the plot forward. More details and the spoilers will kill your watching experience, so stop, i can't be doing this. A good writing meets the breathtaking action sequences, brilliant cinematography and excellent visual effects to make this one a Perfect Entertainment package. As far as acting is concerned, Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal are damn impressive.Most importantly Far From Home doesn't leave goofs in the narrative and that intelligence should be admired. Ultimately, that makes it even better film than End Game logically. Those much needed conflicts are there, comedy is there, slight bit of romance, emotions and what not. If you want surprises then you will get that too, watch out for intermission scene and then End Credit scene which promises a bright guture for the franchise. Film doesn't leave any chapter incomplete or in halfway. This is why Spiderman Far From Home is a Complete film. Overall, Spiderman Far From Home delivers every freaking thing promised, actually more than expected to end up as Best Spidey Film in MCU franchise. Do Watch it and there can't be any disappointment for sure.RATING- 7/10*",Spider-Man - Far from Home
53,matthewssilverhammer,A Saturday Morning Cartoon On the Big Screen,8,11 July 2019,"Far From Home feels like a throwback, though not really to anything in superhero film history. Superhero movies have almost always carried a heavy weight of nostalgia, fandom import, and franchise insurance on to their silver screen escapades. And even though the latest web-slinging adventure directly follows one of the most ambitious cinematic projects in history (Avengers: Endgame), it somehow finds a way to shed all that in favor of pure, escapist, one-off fun. With lighthearted soul, a travelogue setting, an endlessly relatable hero and a compassionate but cartoonish villain, Far From Home is a Marvel movie made for the Saturday-morning-cartoon crowd.
After the world-altering events of ""the snap"", Peter Parker is trying to get back to some semblance of normalcy, when a high school Eurotrip gets interrupted by multiverse superhero Mysterio and some big elemental bad guys. All the everyday superhero facets are here (funny quips, questions of self-worth, great action sequences), but with the added element of an angsty teenage comedy. How does he tell MJ he likes her? Can he and his bff stay friends while having girlfriends? What kind of fun can they get into in Europe? This seems low stakes, and I suppose it is in comparison to much of the MCU, but that's what makes the story work: we know these characters on a personal level, and we like them for it.
Honestly, after the Infinity Saga ended, with all its drama, death and destruction, Far From Home's down-to-earth, low-stakes, neighborhood feel is exactly the comedown we needed. With no overarching plotlines, no big universal threat, and few crossover implications, this manages to be a perfect summer escape.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

He belongs in a super hero movie the way Ben Affleck does.In other words, he doesn't.The second half of the film is tedious and repetitive.The best Spiderman movies are still Sam Rami's.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
56,southdavid,Far And Away,8,8 July 2019,"Phase three comes to its official end with ""Spiderman. Far From Home"", as I write this, the future of the MCU remains rumour and speculation but Phase three goes out with a bang, as (certainly the second half of) Far From Home, is a strong as anything we've seen before.Still struggling to come to terms with the losses of ""Endgame"" Peter Parker (Tom Holland) wrestles with the need to step up, and defend the world, and his desire for a simple teenage life. The school science trip to Europe seems to offer Parker the chance for some Spiderman free fun, but a monster seemingly built of pure water attacks Venice whilst the class are there. Spiderman is joined in the battle by Quentin Beck (Jake Gyllenhaal) a traveller from an alternate reality, who along with Nick Fury (Sam Jackson) battle the world ending threat.As I mentioned above, I liked the second half of ""Far From Home"" a little more than the first. Not that the Eurotrip aspect of the film isn't good. It's an amusing if a little slight opening, though with occasionally dollop of pathos as Parker is unable to escape the reminder of just what was lost in ""Endgame"". These early battles too are with the water elemental are fine too. However, the film really pops into life in the second half, when secrets are revealed and the fight scenes are taken up a notch. It's hard to discuss without spoilers, but the battle that start in the abandoned building is phenomenal, equal visually, if not better than the stuff in ""Doctor Strange"". It's also tremendous how these revelations tie back into the wider MCU and reshape little bits we've seen before.None of it works without the characters though, and the actors performing them do a great job here. Tom Holland remains my favourite of the three incarnations of Peter Parker that we've seen on the silver screen. Zendaya has more to do in this one than the first, and they wisely expand Martin Starr's role given his comedic chops. Jacob Batalon's Ned and Tony Revolori's Flash Thompson are both back too, again mostly filling out the comic relief aspects of the film.Can't talk about the mid credits scene without spoilers, but just Wow... what does that mean for Spiderman going forward?!? Cannot wait to find out !",Spider-Man - Far from Home
57,Vartiainen,Looking forward to the future,7,10 August 2019,"Spider-Man: Far from Home, the first Marvel movie after the gigantic events of Endgame, but also something of an epilogue, an end to Phase Three. In it Peter Parker (Tom Holland) has to deal with all that he has lost in Endgame, while also navigating the treacherous waters of a high school field trip to Europe. Oh, and there are scary monsters to overcome and villains to outsmart. But that you already knew.The villain of this film is interesting. In many ways he's very similar to Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) from Iron Man 3. A genius put down by the world, who now returns to prove his superiority over each and all. Only, this time I found this archetype to have more bite to it. The actor, for one, is better, which of course helps, but the role is also given more depth and it cleverly calls back to previous events in the MCU.Mysterio is also a cool character. All the illusion scenes were fantastic. My only complaint is that they were so few in numbers.Speaking of complaints, if I was to name my biggest gripe with this film it's the fact that Peter Parker hasn't really changed or evolved as a character. Think about it. This kid has now been named an Avenger, by Tony Stark himself no less. He's been to space. He fought against Thanos. He has experienced quite a lot between these two films. Yet he's practically the same awkward, insecure nerd we saw at the beginning of the first film. And that's disappointing.Still, I can't say I didn't have fun while watching the film. The visuals were awesome, the villain was cool, Nick Fury was still a badass (with an asterisk), and it was an all-around good fun. Not the best Marvel film by any stretch, but it still worked.Remember to stick around for those end-credit scenes. We get some doozies this time around.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

The movie fails to me to be it's own thing, it constantly keeps reminding the audience that it is in the marvel universe, to the point it started to get very annoying. I mean other marvel films have done that, but this one takes it farther, left me uninterested.
Black Panther and Dr. Strange both are in that universe, but at the same time managed to stand on there own has films. The effects are enjoyable , and Tom Holland does bring his awkward charm to this, but Zendaya looks really bored being here, and her sort of romance with Holland comes together feeling very forced, and very unconvincing, I was more convinced by Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone in The Amazing Spider Man(2012).

The film is a mega-budget CGI extravaganza and the plot (such as it is) is a distant second to the imagery. In what is becoming a tiresome trend in these films, the story hinges on a 'do anything' technology, so there is little logic or consistency - essentially anything the plot requires can happen, which eventually just becomes tedious. In keeping with the PG rating, the scenes of mass destruction are essentially bloodless and usually peppered with cute 'quips' from Spiderman or his various school chums. The cast is fine for the material with which they are provided and the imagery, although repetitive and not very original, is technically well done.

61,generationofswine,An Honest Review,7,7 July 2019,"I'll be honest upfront and say that I am still not a fan of MJ. She is supposed to be a redhead, she is supposed to be a sexpot, and she is supposed to both know she's hot and have no issues telling other people that. She's supposed to be well out of Parker's league. This is a bit too far from the source material for me.And the same goes with Flash. He's really supposed to be that guy that burns out the moment he graduates from high school. All muscle and no brain. And this Flash has a future. He's not going to deliver your pizza when you go visit your parents.But, beyond that, it's still a fun movie, but one that didn't have as many laughs as the first outing. Although Holland still delivers, this has a more somber and serious tone and, really, Jake Gyllenhaal is not at all as good of a villain as Michael Keaton was. He's kind of irritating to watch and, really he always has been.The plot twist, if took my wife by surprise, but honestly it was something that absolutely everyone familiar with the source material could see coming from the trailers. It didn't come as a surprise for those of us that read the comic books.Still, it was fun and sentimental and paid a respect to the Avengers that I suspect certain movies in the franchise will not.

62,dfranzen70,No one cared who he was until he put on the mask,7,18 July 2019,"Peter Parker is...far from home. As in, he's in Europe on a school science trip over the summer. Also as in, he's no longer in metaphorical Kansas and has to do some quick growing up after the death of his mentor and father figure, Tony Stark. But it seems that destruction follows Peter no matter where he goes, and this time it's attacks by ""elemental entities"" (in the forms of fire, earth, wind, and water monsters). But never fear, because Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) is here! Mysterio is a mysterious (heh) dude from an alternate Earth whose entire family was wiped out by these elementals, so he has an axe to grind. Nick Fury reels Spider-man in to help Mysterio, but poor Spidey would rather stay on his class trip and put the moves on MJ (Zendaya). Torn between a sense of duty and the wish to be a normal-ish teen, Peter tries to have it both ways, and that hardly ever works out well. This latest entry into the Marvel movie world is agreeably entertaining and a fun follow-up to this year's Endgame, even if it takes a little while to really get going. But once it does, look out! As Spider-man, Tom Holland is even better than he was in Homecoming, which is saying something. Holland's Spidey, unlike previous iterations of the superhero, doesn't come off as mopey or whiny but rather sincere and legitimate. We all know how honest and righteous Spider-man is, but Holland provides some needed color and dimension to that characterization. Samuel L. Jackson is fine as crusty, cranky Nick Fury, but for me Gyllenhaal felt a bit out of place as the charismatic Mysterio. On a younger note, both Zendaya (MJ) and Jacob Batalon (Ned) are terrific as Peter's friends, and Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) and Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) make for a nice, if temporary, couple.

This is the second Spider_Man movie with Tom playing our hero-the first was in 2017-and it takes place right after Avengers:Endgame.

It seems Samuel has need of Spider_Man's services to work with a new hero from another dimension, Jake/Mysterio. In the other dimension, Jake was fighting 4 elemental creatures comprised of fire, water, earth & wind. The creatures came to our world so Jake pursued them here and has dispensed with two of them already but could use Tom's help on the last two. Tom doesn't think he is the right super hero for the job-he thinks the creatures are out of his league-and all he wants to do is have his vacation and spend time with Zendaya/MJ. Yep, like that's going to happen. Tom and Jake team up but if you are a comics fan-like I am-you know there is more to Jake/Mysterio than meets the eye. There are lots of good battle scenes and lots of humor to make it a great popcorn movie. There are 2 scenes at the end. One right after the end credits start and one at the very end so don't leave too early.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci_fi action and violence and a little language and has a running time of 2 hours & 9 minutes.

Sony Pictures, the official propaganda arm of a Japanese Ruling Class still sore about losing a World War Two which THEY started, tramples America's Grapes of Wrath with this SPIDER-MAN: FAR FROM HOME preview of our crucial upcoming 2020 POTUS re-election formality. ""Quentin"" is a very thinly disguised version of our incumbent Hero, Leader Trump, as Q promotes plans to Make America Safe Again.

To sum up, the nefarious folks at Sony use all kinds of manipulative trickery in an attempt to get young voters enthused on behalf of Peter Parker (and, by extension, Mayor Pete) with its despicable FAR FROM HOME brain-washing ploy.

65,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Spider-Man: Far From Home,10,20 July 2019,"10/10 - not just a great superhero movie, but also an excellent and highly comedic teen movie that appeals to all demographics",Spider-Man - Far from Home
66,drqshadow-reviews,"Smooth and Snappy, Just Like Homecoming, but Lesser for the Comparison",7,11 July 2019,"As Marvel's first follow-up to the massive culmination that was Endgame, this is lighter by necessity. Spidey's a character that really benefits from a smaller stage anyway, so the timing is appropriate, but he's quickly pulled out of his comfort zone and never totally settles in. I think the foreign location has a lot to do with that. New York City is an essential part of the web-slinger's identity, whether he's doing friendly neighborhood stuff or zipping through Manhattan with a slice of pizza, and separating him from all that for a quick European vacation makes the character feel rather vanilla. His classmates are along for the ride, of course, which maintains his connection to high school drama and the wise-cracking teen culture, and that helps, but it's an issue.Tom Holland is still a nice fit for the role, achieving a difficult combination of confidence, spontaneity and awkward social cues. Jake Gyllenhaal is convincing and charismatic as the perception-altering Mysterio, lending depth and direction to a character that's often rather flat in the books. Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury is around a lot too, personally dealing with several situations that would have probably been beneath him in earlier circumstances, and there's one great casting surprise late in the film that left my entire theater gasping for air. The effects also look phenomenal, with a particular credit due for making one of the comic's most ridiculous-looking foils, somehow, seem pretty cool.Most of the pieces are still there, and it's loyal to many things I enjoyed about Homecoming, it's just... lesser in most every way? A decidedly middle-of-the-pack effort, which is somewhat disappointing since the first installment felt so fresh and spot-on.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Filmed in 8K and Mastered in 4K looked gorgeous for the ""Nerd"" in me .",8,4 July 2019,"Far From Home actually looked like it was going to be pretty decent from what I saw in the preview. I especially loved how they didnt deviate from the comic with Mysterios look. I also felt like it was going to be predictable. BOY LET ME TELL YOU! The writers must have known the audience well enough to know that we thought we knew how it was going to play out, so they did a very good job convincing us that our theory was wrong. It was nothing like I expected! Mysterio was badass as hell and even Holland did a very convincing job at playing the conflicted teenager. I wish I could tell you more, but that would be spoiling it. I have to say that THIS movie is by far the best out if the Phase 3 of the MCU.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
68,alindsay-al,A Great Spider-Man Film,8,4 July 2019,"After Avengers Endgame, I had a lot of anticipation for this film as the newest Spider-Man film and I really enjoyed this film, even though it was a little bit weaker then Spider-Man Homecoming. The premise sees Peter Parker going on a school trip with his class when he is dragged into a world saving adventure by Nick Fury. Tom Holland for me is the best Spider-Man put onto screen, he feels like the most natural fit for the role ever seen. He does an even better job with the emotional scenes in this film and he is so charming and charismatic to fill this role. The supporting cast also does a great job, i'm gonna start with possibly one of my favourite performances in the Marvel Cinematic Universe Jake Gyllenhall as Quentin Beck/Mysterio. I grew up watching this character on the animated series and to see Gyllenhall give his all for the role and deliver a truly complex character, I also loved his and Holland's chemistry in the film. Samule L Jackson continues his role as Nick Fury and he is great in the film, his character has evolved very nicely over the films and he fit this film very well and adds a fun extra dynamic. Zendaya is back as MJ in this film and we spend more time with her character in this film and I really liked her performance and her and Holland have really good chemistry in the film. The story is a bit of a mixed bag, I love everything to do with the dynamic between Spider-Man, Fury & Mysterio and it delves into deep emotional moments that really works. However, I felt that this film spends a bit toomuch time trying to give every character something to do in the film and I didn't care about some of it. Also I felt like the final act of the film wasn't as interesting as some of the sequences that happen earlier in the film. The script has better dramatic dialogue in this film then previous films and really helps Spider-Man's character, the humour mostly hits as well, some of the lesser characters don't have funn dialogue but overall I thought this film was pretty funny. The style of the film has some really good sequences and really fun action scenes that will keep you entertained throughout the film. But I felt like the pacing of the film wasn't particularly great, the film feels longer then it actually is, focusing on so many story arcs did hurt the film a bit and made it a bit less focus. Overall this was a great sequel and continues the momentum of the Spider-Man character, also there are two post credits scenes and they are brilliant and definitley worth staying for.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

It is certainly not as threatening and serious than most in the series and indeed pretty much by definition lacks the gravitas we have seen lately. However, the set pieces are fun, the romance between the kids well handled and Holland is really very impressive as the definitive Spiderman. Not sure I was wholly convinced by Gyllenhaal, who looks a bit lost doing this stuff but this is a minor quibble in a fun movie.Make sure you stay for both post credit sequences.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

72,sauravjoshi85,A predictable but entertaining movie,8,9 August 2021,"Spider-Man: Far from Home is a superhero action, adventure, Sci-Fi movie directed by Jon Watts and stars Tom Holland, Samuel L. Jackson, Jake Gyllenhaal, Zendaya, Cobie Smulders, Jon Favreau, Jacob Batalon and Marisa Tomei.The story is about Spider-man who faces four destructive elemental monsters while on a holiday.The good part of the movie is it's action, acting, breath taking visual effects and the humour. The bad part of the movie is it's flat storyline and predictable screenplay. MCU is now serving the same platter and almost the similar locations with similar execution although with different seasoning those who are following MCU regularly might actually feel this. They have been upgrading their standards when it comes to VFX but plot is almost similar with little twists here and there.As mentioned the plot of the movie is about destructive elements who wants to destroy the city and eventually the earth and spider man who is having a tough time in facing this gets support from another superhero mysterio. The movie runs on a simple and straight pace with some predictable but good twists.Acting is good and Tom Holland had done a tremendous job, Jake Gyllenhaal in the character of mysterio was impressive but little more weight should've been given to his character as in my opinion his character looked little raw. Jon Favreau was funny and entertains whenever he is on-screen. Zendaya, Jacob Batalon and Marisa Tomei were also good and makes their presence felt.Screenplay and climax of the movie is predictable but decent. Just like other MCU movies this movie is also entertains and can be watched with the family. A good movie to watch.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
73,snoozejonc,"People need to believe. And nowadays, they'll believe anything",8,21 September 2021,"Peter Parker goes on a school trip to Europe and faces up to life after Tony Stark.This is a strong MCU entry with great humour, memorable moments, and enjoyable performances.The plot is a good mixture of character focus and outlandish, humorous sci-fi action. The writers focus well on Peter's struggle to fill the void left by Tony and his awkward romance with MJ. At the same time (naturally) there is a supervillain for Spider-Man to contend with and drive the story forward in an entertaining way.I enjoyed the humour, which mostly comes from the banter between characters. Peter, MJ, Ned, and various other contingents of the travel group have great dialogue and all the actors deliver. There are some very funny situations that are quite memorable, particularly the compromising photo, the accidental EDITH drone strike, and the Dutch football fans.Jake Gyllenhaal gives an excellent performance, and I won't mention anything that will spoil the plot. He is involved in one pivotal but poorly written scene of exposition, and it's a credit to his performance that he carries off the dialogue well.Other supporting characters like Aunt May, Happy Hogan, and Nick Fury contribute well. John Favereau in particular is great value for his screen time.As to be expected the action scenes and effects are off the charts spectacular. For me it strays marginally over the top in its effort to wow, as some of these sequences last a little bit too long. However, this did not impact my enjoyment of the overall movie the same way as some other Marvel movies.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
74,r96sk,Had a suitably fun time,7,25 January 2021,"A good end to Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.In short, I like 'Spider-Man: Far from Home'. I do think it's someway off its predecessor, but I still had a suitably fun time watching this. Tom Holland remains top notch in the main role, with Jake Gyllenhaal, Samuel L. Jackson and Zendaya supporting strongly.The story is a solid one, I like the concept of it; especially with Gyllenhaal's character. Some of the special effects do look a little questionable, but only in relation to how great the effects usually are in the MCU. Compared to an 'average' film, they still look good.By sheer process of the elimination, it probably is one of my least favourite films from this universe. That's not a negative though, as I very much like it and keenly await the currently unnamed sequel.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
75,kirbylee70-599-526179,SUPERHERO ON TOUR,9,21 October 2019,"In 2002 when the first SPIDER-MAN movies came out I enjoyed it. I wasn't a huge fan because so much was altered from the comics and as a comic fan it just felt different. But those differences didn't prevent me from liking the movie. With the rise of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and their bringing Spider-Man into it I was hopeful and that hope proved well deserved. They got the character right this time. Now the second solo film of the web spinner is out on disc and it's a treat.Taking place after the events of AVENGERS: ENDGAME, in SPIDER-MAN: FAR FROM HOME *spoiler alert* we find Peter Parker aka Spider-man (Tom Holland) trying to find his place in the world. With his mentor Iron Man aka Tony Stark now dead, he does his best. But most of what he's dealing with is his life as a teenager. He's surprised that his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) might be seeing Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau). And he still has affection for Mary ""MJ"" Watson (Zendaya). What better time to go on vacation.A class trip to Europe is scheduled and Peter chooses to go, leaving behind his Spider-man suit. Too bad his aunt packs it for him anyway. Looking for the right moment to let MJ know how he feels about her he finds he has competition with another teen in the group. In addition to that, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) shows up and tells him he has a mission for him which cuts into his trip time.While in Venice an attack takes place in the form of a huge water creature who is fought off by a mystery man. Called Mysterio on the news, he takes on the creature and wins while Peter protects potential victims from harm. Called in by Fury, Peter learns that the man is Quentin Beck (Jake Gyllenhaal), a hero from another version of earth, part of the multiverse. He's followed these creatures here to defeat them like he did there. He lets them know the next creature, called elementals (the first one taken on in the film's opening), will strike in Prague. Peter chooses not to go, instead saying with his group.That doesn't stop Fury though who reroutes the group to Prague and upgrades all of their visit. Before leaving on the trip Happy gave him a last gift from Tony, a pair of sunglasses. When he puts them on he learns that these glasses tap him into the Stark computer network called EDITH. It's a burden for Peter he's not sure he deserves.Another attack, another elemental and Mysterio and Peter join forces with Peter in a different uniform. They save the day and sit down after the battle to talk. Peter discusses his life, the fact that he's been entrusted with this power at age 16 and doesn't know if he deserves it. Considering what message Tony left him, he entrust the glasses and Edith to Beck, knowing that he's older, more experienced and a larger hero than he will ever be. I'd love to tell you more but it would spoil it. Suffice to say that things take a turn for the worse, as they always do, and Peter must don the garb of Spider-man to save the day.The movie works on so many levels. The story of the teenager trying to find his way through life, learning about that first love, first kiss and more is handled incredibly well by Holland who shows he has more acting skills than one would think. It would be easy to spend an entire film in costume with no glimpse of the man behind it. They writers and director of this film chose not to go that route and allow us to learn about Peter and his friends.At the same time we get to watch as Peter takes on the mask of Spider-man and learns what it means to be a hero as well. It's more than just donning a costume and shooting webs. He learns about the responsibility that comes with the role of hero, not just to his friends but to everyone that he encounters. Spider-man becomes a symbol of something greater than just a costumed vigilante. He becomes someone worthy of being called an Avenger as he was in previous films. And Peter learns about himself in this role as the film progresses.The effects as always are amazing here bringing to life the elementals in their huge glory. Mysterio is a bit altered from his comic book counterpart but not to the extent that he isn't recognizable. They've done a great job in his appearance and Gyllenhaal does a wonderful job in the role. Does anything need to be said about Jackson as Fury? I thought not.Look for a mid-credits piece as well as an end credits piece. And be happy because word came out this week that Disney/Marvel and Sony have reached a deal where Spider-man will continue in the MCU. Until then this movie is one worth watching and putting among the collection of MCU films on your shelf, all to be enjoyed more than once.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
76,MissSimonetta,Boring and overblown housecleaning in the wake of Endgame,4,6 November 2019,"The final battle between Spiderman and Mysterio, where Spidey falls into the middle of a cloud of light-show, weapons-toting drones and doesn't even get a scratch worth crying over, is pretty much a microcosm of this entire movie. After ENDGAME, it feels more like housecleaning and treading water than a Spiderman adventure. There are no stakes to speak of-- Spidey seems indestructible at this point and I never felt any of his comic relief buddies were seriously in danger. Even his relationship with MJ seems fireproof, with Peter barely having to break a sweat to handle that.I'm generally pretty forgiving when it comes to plot holes, so long as there aren't too many and the rest of the story is good. FAR FROM HOME seems to exist on lapses in logic and continuity. Like Tony thinking giving a teenage boy access to massively destructive drones is a swell idea. Or this sudden assertion that Spiderman is the new Iron Man (an assumption the film claims to reject, but actually embraces for whatever reason). Or how the heck Mysterio's big evil plan even works-- apparently this is all projections, but we see things get blown up and people can get killed so.... I don't know, maybe there's a quick explanation in the movie that I missed, but I doubt it.Also, the sudden ""Tony Stark is a plagarist"" angle is just such bad retcon work. It really leaves a sour taste in my mouth. It doesn't help that the scene where all this is laid out is some of the worst, on the nose, clumsiest, badly acted exposition dumping I have ever seen in a major motion picture.Some things I liked so I don't close on a horrible note: MJ and Peter were cute (too bad HOMECOMING never developed their relationship enough, so the sudden crush feels abrupt) and the chaperones were funny.Yeah.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
77,lukem-52760,"VERY GOOD BUT IT'S NO ""SAM RAIMI"" SPIDERMAN 2",6,1 March 2020,"I enjoyed this teen-level peter parker/ Spiderman movie. I will always like the BRILLIANT Sam Raimi Directed Spiderman 2 best, that film is easily the best Spiderman movie ever.
I also still like Tobey Maguire best in the role.
Tom Holland is very good here as the timid Peter Parker who is coming to terms with the huge pressure he has as the new ""Iron-Man"" in a away, peter has inherited Tony Stark's cybernetic hardware, gadgets & devices & it's all abit too much for him. Here Peter just wants to enjoy being a young teen & go on a European school trip with his friends & teachers but everything goes wrong & peter has to deal with being a teen in love with a girl & hanging out with his buds & also being the super hero he needs to be to save everyone.
It's a great performance by Holland & he does come accross a nice guy & a kid way out of his league with his responsibilities.
Peter Parker makes a new Super hero friend in the mysterious new ""Mysterio"" played by the excellent Jake Gyllenhaal, his performance is very good as expected from one of the biggest rising movie stars of our time!!! Mysterio aka: Quentin Beck, is a really nice guy & quickly becomes good friends with peter parker but he has a sinister side. I was actually gutted when Mysterio shows his truth self because Jake gives such an understanding & nice guy performance to his character that you like him right away.
All the big budget fx look great as usual for all the Marvel films & there's plenty of big Action scenes & some very funny bits too.

To further convince Peter of his need to step up to the plate, a multiverse being named Quentin Beck, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, shows his mettle by being the point person when attacks come. Of course anyone who's familiar w/the character will know things may not be so cut & dried so Peter has to figure his way through to the truth.

85,davidmvining,Unfocused storytelling,5,17 February 2020,"I was underwhelmed by Spidey's second solo adventure in the Marvel universe. I've struggled a bit to figure out why I wasn't that engaged with the film, but I think I've come up with it. There are tonal issues right out of the gate that make what probably should have been a sadder film into a jokier one, and I think the contrast hinders the film.The world is reeling from two major events: the death of Iron Man and the blip (as they call it where half the population disappeared and re-appeared five years later). The opening treatment of Iron Man's death feels wrong. It's somewhere between genuinely sentimental and a joke, providing the audience the background while doing so as a cheaply produced high school TV production. The clash of tones is rather shocking. Anyway, Peter Parker was one of those that blipped, but he never seems concerned with it, he's more concerned with the loss of Iron Man, his father figure. He's mostly concerned with, though, dating MJ, an intentionally unpleasant but pretty girl in his class.And that fight of concerns in Peter's mind is what drags the movie down for me. The thrust of his arc is about becoming his own man and stepping out of Iron Man's shadow to become the Spider-Man he could become, but he spends a very large chunk of his time trying to win MJ's unpleasant heart. There's no real focus to Peter's journey. It jumps from one concern to the other, never really connecting the two. The MJ part is hampered by the fact that MJ is intentionally unpleasant, and the other part, the part dealing with Mysterio and EDITH ends up feeling a bit underserved.When Tony Stark died, he apparently had known that Peter Parker was going to come back from the blip and wrote in his will that Parker would get control of EDITH, a powerful defense architecture controlled through a pair of very Tony Stark sunglasses. The first thing Peter does with it is accidentally set a hit on the kid in his class that is spending time with MJ instead of him. Meanwhile, a series of large elemental creatures are destroying parts of the world and a new hero, Mysterio, is helping SHIELD fight them off. When Peter goes to Europe with his class, he finds himself center stage and helping to fight alongside Mysterio and Nick Fury.The action scenes are big and inventive, finding new ways to use Spider-Man's powers in support to a stronger adversary. Feeling overwhelmed, though, Peter hands over complete access to EDITH to Myseterio, an action that feels really underdeveloped. So much time has been spent focusing on MJ and so little focusing on Peter's inability to face large forces without Iron Man at his side, that the hand over feels like the creation of a screenwriter instead of a natural decision for the character.It's that handoff that allows Mysterio to reveal himself to the audience and no one else. He's created the monsters through a combination of holograms and drones to inflict real damage, tricking SHIELD and using old Tony Stark employees, all with motives for revenge against...a guy who's already dead. And who saved the world. Sure. I'll buy it. Mysterio plans on using the drones that EDITH controls to make even larger threats that only he can fight off, cementing his status as a great superhero, I think. He's essentially Syndrome from The Incredibles with less motive and a less clear endgame.I get it. It's fun to make fun of high school drama, emotions, and hormones, but it's done at the expense of Peter's actual journey. He doesn't know what to do in the face of Stark's death, and in the movie he's supposed to come out of that shadow and become his own superhero. The journey is muddled with distractions, though, and I think it really drags the film down. It has a superficial appeal in terms of special effects, humor, and performance, but it still feels like a disjointed experience that never really comes together to tell a complete story.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
86,TheOneThatYouWanted,Far from something,7,14 September 2020,The villain makes the movie. Which is pretty much the same case with the first film.

89,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Spider-Man: Far From Home,8,6 July 2019,"""We have a job to do and you're coming with us"". You as a viewer have a job to do and that's to see Spider-Man: Far From Home.Anyway, have you ever viewed a Marvel Studio movie where the humor almost single-handedly trumps the armed conflict? You know, kid and adult personas constantly making goofy quips with tongue firmly planted in cheek? ""Far From Home"" is that movie and at 129 free-flowing minutes, it's my latest review.""Far From Home"", with its international flavor and its introduction of Jake Gyllenhaal to the Marvel universe, feels like one of the best good time, hangout flicks in the Spider-Man franchise canon. Yes it's live-action fodder but ""Far From Home"" also has the look of being sort of cartoonish. Trust me, I'm okay with that.In terms of casting, well Brit Tom Holland is perfect as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He's likable as a non-cocky protagonist and actually looks like what I envisioned Spidey to look like. Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire are decent actors but Sony completely gets it right with Holland.Taking place in Europe (starting with Venice) and paying tribute to one Tony Stark (spoiler), Spider-Man: Far From Home involves Holland's Peter Parker wanting to go on a class trip only to be hurled back into saving the world by antihero Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson).Look for solid, Zack Snyder-style film-making from director Jon Watts (I dug Jon's use of three-dimensional space within a large canvas). Also, look for love story elements (Parker and MJ), recurring Marvel characters (Maria Hill, Harold ""Happy"" Hogan, Fury), and lots of nasty, firing drones. Finally, know that ""Far From Home"" takes a page out of the Ant-Man films in that it's almost comedic and not wholly action-packed. Endgame begot, this duck soup sequel just wants to have a good time. My rating: 3 and a half stars.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

91,Kingslaay,Decent but not as strong as the first,7,15 October 2019,"Spider-Man 2 is not a bad addition and its great to see Peter Parker back at it again. I'm not one to complain when there are more Marvel films. Far from home has a decent plot and some good laughs along the way. It seemed somewhat simple and linear and perhaps not too different from other superhero movies. Only difference is it had the strength of Marvel. I feel this is not as good as the first which was fresh, funny and packed a real punch. 7/10",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Aside from the diversity in you face & slight hints here & there of political correctness, the film wasn't bad, but it wasn't any better. The villain was bland & the film dragged a bit. There was too much comedy in a lot of areas & serious moments were ruined by these little niggles.Th film doesn't feel like a spider man film & spider man himself isn't his standalone character as others from Avengers seem to be interlaced & distracting from the main hero himself. The film feels too much like an excuse to extend the Avengers universe & misses the pint of what the title character is. Spider man has been ruined since the demise of Spider-Man 4 & this & Homecoming AREN'T any exceptions.This film feels more, Iron-Man crossed with both Avengers & oh yeah, what's left with Spider man. The film doesn't feel like what the classic were back in the 00's, a much better time for films like this which are nowhere near as good & too political & overloaded & overrated.The film overall wasn't as bad as thought, but honestly it ISN'T much better better... 4/10",Spider-Man - Far from Home

After, Iron Man dies at the end of the last movie Peter is struggling to cope after all of thing Tony taught him in the previous movies. He is left under Happy Hogan (Tony's friends) custody. Our friendly neighbourhood wall crawler is on a trip all around Europe to stop this weird elemental creature and he is partnered up with Mysterio an agent of Nick Fury. However, Mysterio has his own hidden agenda.The story for the movie was very good, while it is not as good Endgame in terms of best movie from the MCU but was far more enjoyable than Captain Marvel. Heck, even Nick Fury agreed with me in the movie about Captain Marvel. I am not sure on how it could be improved possibly just did force the romance between Betty and Ned but that is all. I really liked how the setting kept on change in the movie as well.The humour could have improved but I really liked the 'night monkey joke' they added. The acting once again was brilliant Tom Holland continues to impress me as Spider-Man and as well as the rest of the cast. The best bit was when Spider-Man was fighting Mysterio and they changed setting constantly during the fight with his illusions and the brilliant use of CGI. I would seriously want to know how to do that.Overall while it may not be my favourite MCU movie this but it is far better than Captain Marvel and even better than Homecoming.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

This was the kind of movie, like several of Marvel's recent entries, that if I never see again, I won't care. There are some good things:
The Good - Peter & MJ. Nice chemistry and they seemed like awkward teens. The rest of the cast was decent as well.
Mysterios suit. Other than the unnecessary lightning, this was really close to the comic.
EDITH - hysterical. Really funny.
The Bad - the story was clunky. Why did they have to go to Europe? This could have happened in America. It's not like they did anything special on the continent.
Spideys suits. What's wrong with the original? These are all ugly.
Stark. First, can killing him was a damn bad idea. Now, even dead here dominated the movie. The title is Spider-Man, not tony Stark and Spiderman. Also, have any of these screenwriters read any Spidey comics? He's self taught. No mentor. Next movie, stop with the world saving and get Spidey back down to earth.
I'm not putting in any spoilers, so I will say I'm still shaking my head at the end. Especially the end credits scene.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
96,elliotjeory,Fish Bowl Head,7,8 July 2019,Overall a good Spider-Man film. Although it appeals to a younger audience it is still an enjoyable film despite the unusual plot and Jake Gylenhall aka Mysterio looking like a Fish bowl head. His costume is so lame it's funny. Compared to other Spider-Man villains this one was mild and the action was good but average. It contains a post credit scene that contains one big cliffhanger that makes you want to see the third. I feel like this should of been incorporated into the film itself instead of being conveniently added at the end. I actually found this post credits scene more interesting than half the scenes in the film. Also Happy and Peter's ain't? No no no,Spider-Man - Far from Home
97,fntstcplnt,Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019),5,8 February 2020,"Directed by Jon Watts. Starring Tom Holland, Jake Gyllenhaal, Samuel L. Jackson, Jacob Batalon, Zendaya, Jon Favreau, Cobie Smulders, Martin Starr, J. B. Smoove, Marisa Tomei, Angouri Rice, Tony Revolori, Remy Hii. (PG-13)Spider-Man in the post-""Avengers: Endgame"" Marvel world, dealing with the fallout of those events, including the so-called ""snap"" and the five years that passed afterward. Here, Peter Parker (Holland) joins classmates on a European trip while tangling with nondescript elemental monsters and joining forces with S.H.I.E.L.D. survivors (including Jackson's Nick Fury) and Mysterio (Gyllenhaal), a master of tech-based illusions that hails from an alternate universe (readers of the comics will see the head-shaking plot twists coming well in advance). Part CGI-driven superhero slugfest, part teen romance with exorbitant comic relief; like ""Homecoming"" before it, awkwardly struggles to exist in the pre-fabricated MCU composite while trying to ""do its own thing."" Holland is in decent form, but he's saddled with an underwhelming villain and love interest (Zendaya) and makes one idiotic decision after another, so rooting interest remains fairly minimal throughout. On the few occasions when the comedy actually lands, credit is often due Starr and Smoove as the last teachers one would want to chaperone their kids on an extended vacation. J. K. Simmons has a mid-credits cameo as J. Jonah Jameson (a version that weirdly seems inspired by Alex Jones/Sean Hannity types).55/100",Spider-Man - Far from Home
98,nancyldraper,Entertaining,7,3 July 2019,"I enjoyed it. Tom Holland continues to bring a freshness and boyhood charm to this incarnation of Spider-man (that belies his age) and his transformation from Brit to New Yorker is flawless. Love the innocence and humour of the high school drama as it is juxtaposed against the save-the-world, perilous, big CGI action. Good writing. Great cast. Great character bits (Fury and Hill, May and Happy). I'm not a big fan of Jake Gyllenhall. I always feel his performances are wooden and his delivery of dialogue unnatural, which may have aided his character, in this case. Don't forget to stay for the mid credit and end credit scenes (phase 4 of Mavel pictures is promising). I give this film a 7.5 (entertaining) out of 10. {Super Hero Action Adventure}",Spider-Man - Far from Home

100,Abdulxoxo,Good follow-up,7,16 January 2021,"First off, this movie follows on from the original film and it remains heavily a high school comedy. I got a mixed feeling about how large chunks of this film are spent on the side characters that are solely for comedic purposes. Their relationship isn't necessarily crucial to the plot. The high school aspect of the film is too strong for my liking. But I enjoyed Peter trying to execute his plan to tell MJ his feelings. In addition, this film try to address some of the issues that we all had after 'Endgame', in terms of, did all of Peter's class disappear at the snap? & how exactly did they return? In terms of the supe stuff, I think this film is a massive improvement from what we saw in Homecoming. The action sequences are incredible, they are far more cooler, trippier, and entertaining than in the first movie. The visual effects are stunning. The main villain is also very good as he has an interesting motive. However, there's still a slight sense of underwhelming. I just didn't feel that this character is as good as Vulture from 'Homecoming'. The mid-credit scene is excellent. It's a serious scene which makes me really pumped me up for where they might go with the third Spider-Man film. Then there's the post-credit scene, which is kinda confusing. I think it's trying to be funny, but all it did was make me question stuff from the past.
All in all, Far from Home, is a fast-paced follow-up, which manages to balance the comedy with the action. The cast performances, the writing and the direction all worked really well, especially in conjunction with some first-rate visual effects and cinematography.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
101,arungeorge13,Marvel and Tom Holland continue their impressive run! [+70%],7,6 July 2019,"With Spider-Man: Far From Home, we've gotten to the last film of the third phase of the MCU, which takes place eight months post the events of Endgame. The world is still coming to terms with the reversal of timelines (here referred to as 'blips') while Peter Parker is prepping himself for a trip of Europe with his schoolmates. Holland once again proves he is the ideal choice for Parker/Spidey, trying to strike a balance between being a teenager with all sorts of teenager issues and being a dutiful Spider-Man that Tony would want him to be.Gyllenhaal, however, turns out to be an interesting choice for Quentin Beck/Mysterio. He is given an air of intrigue, right from the opening shot of the film, putting up a restrained act in the first few acts before going all-out in the latter ones. What's better, the writers (Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers) give him a proper backstory as well; one that ties well into certain events from previous MCU films while trying to hold its own space. While Nick Fury and Maria Hill remain busy being themselves (*post-credits-wink*), it is Happy Hogan who takes away the lion's share of the honors when it comes to comic relief. He pitches in at a crucial juncture in the film, almost showing up as an unlikely adviser for Peter - a gaping hole that Tony left behind! That he's hitting on Parker's aunt May (Marisa Tomei who still looks dashing as ever!) with Parker getting the hint, always makes his scenes a riot!Zendaya plays a dorky but extremely sensible (and likeable) MJ who has a not-bad number of pivotal scenes in the film. In fact, it's her scenes with Holland that lend the film its much-needed rom-com feels. The action set-pieces might seem a little too video-game-like for some, but they're sure to please younger audiences to a great extent. The supporting acts (Ned and his girlfriend, Flash, Brad, and more) keep the proceedings engaging at all times with their funny and sarcastic quips. Cinematographer Matthew J Lloyd has captured Europe stunningly (the tulip gardens in the Netherlands were such a breath of fresh air amid all the action!) while Michael Giacchino's music meshes with the film's feel-good-action vibes perfectly.Jon Watts' idea of Spiderman being able to tackle threats beyond his friendly neighborhood, with the aid of some stellar tech left behind by Tony Stark and moral support from Happy Hogan, Aunt May, and a few others, works mostly thanks to the charm of Tom Holland, a well-performed act by Gyllenhaal as Mysterio, and those thrilling CGI scenes where the lines between illusion and reality begin to blur. Watts also puts the Spidey-sense (referred to as 'Peter Tingle' in the film) to the best use in the climax set-piece, that results in a hoot-worthy moment. The writing ensures plenty of crowd-pleaser scenes while not going overboard with the action.The entire crew of the film seems to have had immense fun making it and that infectious energy has visibly spilt over to the silver screen. Spider-Man: Far From Home also boasts a couple of brilliant post-credit scenes that are alone worth the price of your ticket (you simply won't see the first one coming!). Stay till the very end to find out what's in store next for Spidey/Parker.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

103,Troy_Campbell,Charming and exciting Spidey outing,8,7 July 2019,"Following the biggest cinematic event in recent memory is no easy feat, but the second solo Spidey outing within the MCU, coming a little over two months after Avengers: Endgame, is required to do just that. Knowing it can't match Endgame on either narrative heft or spectacle size, the film makes two wise moves: leans heavily into the boy-likes-girl story at its heart and lowers the stakes down a few notches from the life-altering Thanos-snap (here played mostly for minor gags). It's a great decision that allows director Jon S. Baird (returning after successfully delivering Spidey's MCU Homecoming) to keep the tone light-hearted, his intentions clear as soon as Whitney Houston's ""I Will Always Love You"" blares out during the Marvel Studios opening logo. That's not to say the threat of the Elementals - gigantic rage-monsters formed from wind, water, earth, etc etc - isn't taken seriously, but much like Peter Parker himself, the movie is more interested in our hero returning to normal teenage life. Tom Holland continues his impressive form as the awkward super-powered adolescent, finding plenty of humour (and humanity) in his attempts to ditch the costume, much to the chagrin of Nick Fury, as he deals with love, life and loss. His blossoming romance with MJ (a brilliant Zendaya) is genuinely riveting and could easily be its own film, whilst his relationships with best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon), guardian Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) and similarly-grieving pal Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) entertainingly serve their purpose despite less screen time. Not everything is a home run though. The action, although decent enough, lacks any truly memorable moments; Jake Gyllenhaal's aptly-named Mysterio fails to engage on any meaningful level; and the European setting feels strangely ill-suited to our protagonist. But these are relatively minor quibbles in an otherwise funny and rousing blockbuster that, thanks to two massively important post-credits scenes, sets up the future of the MCU in an intriguing manner. In an astoundingly high-quality franchise this can't quite push into the top tier, but Spider-Man: Far From Home is nevertheless a charming and exciting web-slinging adventure.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
104,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Another entertaining film in the MCU.,9,19 July 2019,"Spider-Man's return to MARVEL was something that was inevitable in the end: Sony couldn't keep the iconic mascot for themselves so they decided to share the film rights of the character with Disney and MARVEL. Thus, Spider-Man: Homecoming was born and its sequel, this year's Far From Home: where Peter Parker is on holiday in Europe and he'll come to terms with his own sense of responsibility and belonging in the world.Far From Home is another solid entry in a very thorough film franchise: and it helps that Spider-Man's an equal favourite superhero of mine, equal to Superman and Batman. This film extends the web-slinger's legacy and shows he can still be re-imagined in many ways to fit today's very demanding cinematic landscape. Also, even though there are plenty of post-Endgame twists addressed in this movie, it has some rather nice ones of its own making: one in particular which was NEVER teased or implied in the trailers (or rather, make that TWO secret twists).Spider-Man's here to stay, and it seems like the best is yet to come.

I can see how folks less concerned with my complaints could enjoy this movie. I just lament when thinking back to where Marvel Studios started. We're watching (and enjoying) the Toby Maguire Spiderman 2. Toby was a little old for the part but had the role down cold. A little bit of silly romance, a well-developed villain, good supporting roles (Incl J.K.), nice pacing. The world isn't facing destruction, you didn't have to see 4 other movies to understand it, Jon Favreau doesn't do an obligatory cameo nor Nick Fury, there's none of the stifling Disney idealogical and social twist, the plot makes sense and doesn't just fit the scene, and the CGI is as absolutely good as it has to be. So while maybe Far works nicely with the new generation, it's by-the-numbers agenda, plot and production have already grown very old for me.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
108,Prashast_Singh,Spidey is back in form with this new and one of the best action films of the year.,10,4 July 2019,"This film is even better than Homecoming. It takes action choreography and storytelling to the next level and delivers every bit of the Spidey fun fans needed. Tom Holland as Spider-Man does a great job as usual, but Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio truly impresses big time. I can call it one of the best action films of the year so far.The film was so fast paced that when an hour passed away and the cinemas placed a random intermission, my first reaction was, ""What? Why so early?"" It was when I looked at the time I realized that an hour had gone already, and the film was so gripping that I didn't even feel the need to leave my seat. The second half went on to intensify with a couple of very serious moments, but also present were the heroic elevations that made the viewer not just cheer for Spidey but also feel that yes! he should fight and save the day!And of course, what's a great Spider-Man film without action? This film's biggest highlight are its white-knuckle action sequences. The stunt directors really went creative with the fights and other action scenes, and I couldn't help but feel exhilarated. Visual effects were done very well, and the cinematography, especially during the final fight, was outstanding.But what has really left me surprised is the mid-credits scene that has also made me restless to know what would happen next.Spider-Man: Far From Home is a top-notch action flick that has got something for everyone. If you are Spidey fan, you need to see this one immediately in IMAX 3D. There's no way you can afford to miss this summer blockbuster.

Also if you're a fan of the comics, you're totally expecting the twist, which I'm guessing takes a lot away from it; I am glad however they had great trailers that kept that a surprise.

The field trip coincides with the emergence of Mysterio, an inter-dimensional superhero who's tracking down elemental monsters who seem intent on causing havoc and mayhem. Add to this Peter Parkers grief at missing Iron Man and his panic at trying to maintain secrecy from his piers about his costumed adventures, you have a few ingredients to make a fun filled film.Tom Holland seems perfect for the role of Peter Parker, unfortunately I can't say the same for the cast of school mates he has, I'm just not sold on them all yet. There's plenty of action with a dose o fun and comedy sprinkled in for good measure. Gylenhall joins the cast as Mysterio who does a good job, I was dubious when I saw him cast but he does a top notch job. There isn't a massive amount for me to critique on the film; likewise there isn't a massive depth to the film I feel compelled to analyse. This is just a fun film, kind of how you'd probably expect to see in a Spiderman film. Personally I don't think this is as good as the first Tom Holland Spiderman solo film, I also think that some of the other Spiderman films are on par with this (Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield versions), but it's still fun escapism and adds to an ever expanding Marvel universe.

But it is Soooooo Uneven.I laughed (or chuckled) about 10/15 times but I also rolled my eyes hard about 5/10 times.The action is fast and great, but also some entire setpieces look like a videogame in the middle of a real movie.

120,rockman182,Spider-man: Far from Home (2019),8,6 July 2019,"Just thinking about Avengers: Endgame sends a chill down my spine. It was more or less a perfect way to wrap up a decades work of films by the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This next Spider-man had to be a perfect follow up to one of, if not the biggest blockbuster of all time. Spider-man isn't my favorite comic book or MCU hero, however I love what Tom Holland has done with the role. He brings the charisma and youthful exuberance needed for a young Peter Parker. I had quite a blast with this and its definitely better than Homecoming.The film takes place almost immediately after the events of Endgame. Peter Parker finds himself wanting to relax and go on a European trip with his class, where he can unwind and more importantly spend time getting close to MJ. Little does he know Nick Fury is making Parker part of a mission to take down ancient elemental monsters who are attacking the planet. Parker teams up with Quentin Beck (dubbed Mysterio) to try to take down these monsters while preserving his identity from his classmates.I think the special effects in this film look great. The elemental monsters and action associated with it look amazing. The film amps up the comedy and the relationship between Parker and MJ is so great. The characters are fleshed out well and there is a weird but charming connection between the two. The film creates a wonderful dreamlike sequence with Spider-man that is excellent and a real highlight of this Universe. I really liked the way the script handles itself.Far From Home excels Homecoming and feels like its more important. The character development of Parker here is what the MCU needs after the departure of Iron Man. To see Parker struggle to take over from his idol; its done so well. Overall, its not the best solo hero film the MCU has to offer but it is still a very impressive statement that this universe is the biggest thing around in cinema and will continue to tick on as it still seems fresh as ever.8/10",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Makes a lot of sense.That's the distinct deft charm of Director Jon Watt's ""Spider-Man: Far from Home"". Jon also directed the previous ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"". He has a genuine feel for teen angst and bravado. Tom Holland returns as the screen's most authentic Spider-Man. As Peter, Tom uniquely balances innocence, doubt and courage on the tipping point of boy and manhood. Tom is the dork when Peter clumsily tells MJ, ""You look pretty."" His eyes well in tears, getting that he might have disappointed his 'surrogate' Father Tony Stark (Robert).The story and screenplay by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers succeeds the events in ""Avengers: Endgame"", where Tony's Iron Man died defeating powerful galactic villain Thanos. Thanos had wiped out half of all life in the universe with his 'Infinity Gaunlet'. Those affected disintegrated from existence. When Tony defeated Thanos, those banished returned back ""to life"". However, 5 years had passed. So those returning were the same age as when they left. Those who had remained on Earth were now 5 years older. That event is called ""The Blip"".Peter experienced ""The Blip"". Apparently, so did his Aunt May, strong beautiful Marisa Tomei, and MJ. Returning back to Planet Earth, Peter reunites with best bud nerdy Ned, played by spritely funny Jacob Batalon. Both prepare for their school European trip with MJ. Peter plans to tell MJ: He likes her. Peter faces romantic competition from handsome ""ripped"" Brad, too cool for school Remy Hii, who was 13 years-old before ""The Blip"".Challenging his resilience, Peter discovers that Aunt May might be in love with Tony Stark's driver best friend Happy Hogan, comically irreverent Jon Favreau. WTF? S.H.I.EL.D.'s Nick Fury, no nonsense charismatic Samuel L. Jackson, wants Peter for his ops mission in Europe as an Avenger. In doing so, Peter meets Jake's Mysterio.Nick bestows upon Peter a gift from his mentor Tony: EDITH - Stark's multi-billion dollar weapons, communication, database system encased in eye glasses. In hysterical experiment, Peter averts a nuclear targeted strike, when he doesn't use his powers for good, albeit hormonal. Jon and his Writers have a wicked sense of humor and eloquent coherence.With EDITH, Tony leaves Peter a note from Shakespeare's ""Henry IV"": ""Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown."" ""It's not from 'Star Wars'."" Possessing great power is the responsibility, perhaps even a curse. That resonates with Peter. That resonates with us, as well. Is Peter enough to be the next ""Iron Man"", to be the next Hero? Perhaps, Peter fears becoming greater than he knows himself to be. That's so very human.Writers Chris and Erik invent the narrative where all is not what it seems. Thematically, it reflects Mysterio's 'power of illusion'. Jake is brilliant in his presence. As Mysterio, he's the heroic paradox. He displays compassion and a disarming singularity. Jake's innate chemistry with Tom is one of the movie's distinct strengths.Jon Watts creates breathtaking visuals as Mysterio and Spider-Man fight to stop the Water Monster in the canals of Venice. He awes as Spider-Man entangles holographic drones with his web. That being said, I was most captivated by Peter and MJ. Theirs is a profound sweetness. As MJ, Zendaya confesses that she's purposefully unkind, fearing anyone getting too close. Yet, from her heart MJ touchingly tells Peter, ""I've been watching you..."" We get it. Maybe, liking the girl is as important as saving the world. Just saying.""Spider-Man: Far from Home"" is occasional predictable misdirects, dazzling action, and needlessly convoluted. Still, what makes us cheer is the big heart and profound kindness. Maybe for the Hero, falling in love is just as important as saving the world. That's something we can relate to. ""Spider-Man: Far from Home"" is definitely worth seeing.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
122,Benjamin-M-Weilert,"More of the same great Spider-man action, but in Europe.",8,5 August 2019,"After the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019), there were still plenty of questions that remained. While still part of Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Spider-man: Far from Home (2019) attempts to grapple with the outcome of such a pivotal film in the superhero franchise. As was the case with its predecessor, Spider-man: Homecoming (2017), Far from Home shows the audience the impacts of the other films in the MCU in a way that's personable and relatable. After all, it's easier to connect with a ""friendly neighborhood Spider-man"" than with a multi-billion dollar playboy.I did appreciate the emotional depth of this movie, especially considering how Tom Holland handles the role of Peter Parker. From grieving over the losses of Endgame while also trying to move forward with his life, Peter has plenty of growth opportunities throughout this film. That being said, Far from Home seems to hit almost all the same beats that Homecoming did, only in Europe instead of Washington D.C. Though I did feel the villain of this film was something that could only be possible via today's technological advancements, his origin story felt derivative of both Homecoming and Iron Man 3 (2013).Still, the visual effects (for obvious reasons) were incredible in this movie. The little Easter eggs that hint at the future phase of the MCU give me hope that there are still stories to tell in this superhero franchise. Even if Far from Home seemed repetitive, I am still glad there are new villains to explore in the Spider-man universe (considering how many have been covered in previous instantiations of the franchise). And with Spider-man as a somewhat newer member of the Avengers, I look forward to his involvement in the future, large-scale battles to come.More of the same great Spider-man action, but in Europe, I give Spider-man: Far from Home 4.0 stars out of 5.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
123,RforFilm,"As an Epilogue for Endgame, Spider-Man: Far from Home makes for a fun vacation with Spider-Man",9,5 July 2019,"Avengers: Endgame was not only one of the most anticipated movies of all time, but it also closed the door to a story that had developed over eleven years starting with Iron Man. It was a movie that I really enjoyed and had figured that would have made a fine last movie for Marvel. Now that Disney runs Marvel, of course they wouldn't want to end things here. There's too much money to not continue and there are a lot of other stories Marvel could do. One of these heroes that can evolve, especially with his age, is the web slinger, Spider-Man.Without spoiling what happened (though the trailers gave that away), it showed a couple of heroes leaving after Endgame, which now has to rely on the heroes they still have. Spider-Man still remains popular and can easily carry the future that Disney and the Marvel Cinematic Universe is going to throw. The key is making sure that this Spider-Man grows as he evolves from a teenager into a young man. The previous Spider-Man movies have had trouble making this transition, this this is a rare chance to get things right. Let's see where Peter Parker has gone in Spider-Man: Far from Home after Endgame.In the time that's passed after the events of Thanos and the snap (which is called the ""blip""), Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland) and his friends like Ned (played by Jacob Batalon) and M.J. (played by Zendaya) are dealing with the fact that everyone else has aged by five years while their still the same. At the same time, with Iron Man gone, Peter is now under pressure by the press that he's expected to be one new leaders of heroes. He declines calls from Nick Fury (played by Samuel L. Jackson) and just wants to enjoy a class trip to Europe for the summer.While in Venice, the group is attacked by a giant water monster called an eternal that's fended off by a mysterious caped person that the press dubs ""Mysterio"". Peter is later taken by Nick Fury to meet the ""Mysterio"", Quentin Beck (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), who says to be anther hero from an alternate Earth. Peter tries again to decline help, but his group ends up in Prague where another eternal, this time a fire monster, attacks. It seems like that these things are popping up all over Europe and Peter will have no choice but to help.As far as an epilogue to Endgame, Spider-Man: Far from Home not only serves the story well, but it also proves to be another fun Spider-Man story. The MCU has done great at portraying Peter Parker as a more inexperienced hero and thus, leading way for this growth. Tom Holland is still likable as Peter, who now has more pressure then he did in Homecoming. You not only cheer when he's kicking butt, but you also feel sorry for the fact that he can barley get a break. You want to see him enjoy his summer and interact with M.J., but understand that ""with great powers come great responsibility"".Speaking of which, I've really grown to enjoying Zendaya as a different M.J. as she may be more cynical, but does make the chemistry between her and Tom Holland really cute. Plus is not like she's a damsel in distress: she does help in ways I can't spoil. Samuel L. Jackson does good as Nick Fury, but my favorite is Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio. For a character where illusions are his power, the movie not only makes it convincing on how people would fall for it, but even makes him threatening when needed.Do they all manage well in this story? For the most part. As a comedy, it's a mixed bag. As a high school story, I liked it. As a travel story, it's mixed. Spider-Man: Far from Home is trying to do a lot with it's premise and does have a little trouble. I'd say the first half felt a little rushed in explaining the ""blip"" and how it affects the world. Things pick up when the villain is revealed and Spider-Man has to step up. Did I like it as much as Homecoming? I'd say about as much, which does put this up higher on my ranking, but not the masterpiece that was Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse.I'll give this nine Mysterios out of ten. Overall, this makes for another fun superhero story. This is probably something I'm saying too much, but it shows how having these heroes in a shared universe can take advantage of their situation. Take a cinematic vacation and witness what a spider can do.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
124,Hollywood_Yoda,An OK Follow Up to Endgame,8,14 October 2019,"Spider-Man: Far From Home was an okay MCU film, but I think the third phase would have ended better with Endgame as the cliffhanger. The story here was fairly well written. The action scenes were above par. And I especially liked seeing Jon Favreau reprise his role as Happy. However, its just not the same without RDJ as Tony Stark.In all honesty, I think the first Spidey film, ""Homecoming"" was much better. It was well paced, compared to the slow pace in Far From Home. I was also hoping to see more characters from the MCU in this film. I hope that if a third Spider-Man film in the continuity of the MCU is released, its better paced and contains more of the MCU.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
125,eminkl,"A decidedly middle-of-the-pack effort, which is somewhat disappointing",7,17 April 2020,"As Marvel's first follow-up to the massive culmination that was Endgame, this is lighter by necessity. Spidey's a character that really benefits from a smaller stage anyway, so the timing is appropriate, but he's quickly pulled out of his comfort zone and never totally settles in. I think the foreign location has a lot to do with that. New York City is an essential part of the web-slinger's identity, whether he's doing friendly neighborhood stuff or zipping through Manhattan with a slice of pizza, and separating him from all that for a quick European vacation makes the character feel rather vanilla. His classmates are along for the ride, of course, which maintains his connection to high school drama and the wise-cracking teen culture, and that helps, but it's an issue. Tom Holland is still a nice fit for the role, achieving a difficult combination of confidence, spontaneity and awkward social cues. Jake Gyllenhaal is convincing and charismatic as the perception-altering Mysterio, lending depth and direction to a character that's often rather flat in the books. Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury is around a lot too, personally dealing with several situations that would have probably been beneath him in earlier circumstances, and there's one great casting surprise late in the film that left my entire theater gasping for air. The effects also look phenomenal, with a particular credit due for making one of the comic's most ridiculous-looking foils, somehow, seem pretty cool. Most of the pieces are still there, and it's loyal to many things I enjoyed about Homecoming, it's just... lesser in most every way? A decidedly middle-of-the-pack effort, which is somewhat disappointing since the first installment felt so fresh and spot-on.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
126,Anurag-Shetty,"Spidey knocks it out of the park, yet again!",10,5 July 2019,"Spider-Man: Far From Home continues with the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man(Tom Holland), after the events of Captain America: Civil War(2016), Spider-Man: Homecoming(2017), Avengers: Infinity War(2018) & Avengers: Endgame(2019). Spider-Man must take responsibility & battle new dangers, in a world that will never be the same.Spider-Man: Far From Home is a mind-blowing film. Director Jon Watts has retained all the key elements that we loved about Spider-Man: Homecoming(2017), while still introducing new elements, to keep things fresh. The action set pieces are fantastic. The visual effects are brilliant. The 3D is eye-popping. The various foreign locales are gorgeous & have been captured beautifully, by cinematographer Matthew J. Lloyd. All the various suits that Spidey wears, look amazing. The climax is jaw-dropping & is the highlight of the movie. The performances are unforgettable. Tom Holland is spectacular as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Holland is definitely my all-time favorite big screen Spider-Man. Samuel L. Jackson is awesome as Nick Fury. Jake Gyllenhaal is awe-inspiring as Quentin Beck/Mysterio. Gyllenhaal's performance has various layers & you will just gape at the limitlessness of his acting talent. Zendaya is outstanding as MJ. Tom Holland & Zendaya share this adorable chemistry together. Jacob Batalon is brilliant as Ned Leeds. Tony Revolori is great as Flash Thompson. Angourie Rice is excellent as Betty Brant. Jon Favreau, Cobie Smulders & Marisa Tomei are superb as Happy Hogan, Maria Hill & May Parker, respectively. Martin Starr & J.B. Smoove are hysterical as Mr. Harrington & Mr. Dell, respectively. Stick around till the end of the credits, for two crucial credits scenes. Spider-Man: Far From Home is a must watch for MCU fans, Spidey fans & pretty much everyone else.

127,bankofmarquis,"A nice ""palate cleanser"" after Endgame",8,14 July 2019,"After the richness - both in emotion and spectacle - of the previous entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (that would be the epic that is AVENGERS: ENDGAME), SPIDERMAN: FAR FROM HOME is a palate cleanser.And that is a smart move by the honchos at Marvel. It brings us back into this Universe acknowledging - and playing homage to - the previous film - but also points us to the future as we fondly remember, but don't dwell on, the past. This Spidey-film takes the titular web-slinger on a roadtrip to Europe where he teams up with Mysterio to fight the Elementals as Peter Parker grapples with the legacy of Tony Stark and a blossoming relationship with MJ.And...it's a darn fine film. Director Jon Watts and writers Chis McKenna and Erik Sommers craft a light, fun action flick that leans heavily on the personality and charm of Peter Parker/Spiderman and this succeeds tremendously thanks to the continued strong performance of Tom Holland. He has grown into this role and has now fully embraced it a makes it his own. This is the 5th film that Holland has played Spiderman and he is fully in control of the character and is a joyous character to watch.Ably joining in is Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio - another hero who just might be another strong mentor-like presence for Parker. A fine actor of interesting dimensions, Gyllenhaal understands the type of film that he is in and adapts his performance (and presence) accordingly. Jacob Batalon returns as Peter's friend Ned, and he is everything we've come to expect from Ned. The same can be said for Jon Favreau's Happy Hogan and Marisa Tomei's Aunt May - both are welcome, warming, presences that help everyone feel good.The biggest surprise for me is Zendaya's performance as MJ - I really enjoyed it - and that's a surprise. It is one of those nuanced-type performances (in a Superhero film - of all things) that will make me re-assess my thinking about her as a performer. I thought she was that good.Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders reprise their roles as Nick Fury and Maria Hill and they are solid while Martin Starr and J.B. Smoove provide broad comic relief as the two teachers who are chaperones of these high school kids (remember they are high school aged in this film - they'll have to graduate into college for the next one, their age is beginning to show). I've read/heard some negative comments on how ""out of place"" the 2 teachers were in style to the rest of this film (and the MCU in general) and I couldn't disagree more. I thought they brought just the right size of comedy to what is a light film.And, make no mistake, this is a light film (which is why I call it a ""palate cleanser"" after Endgame) and that's just fine. The stakes are an excuse to spend time with this characters - and to dazzle with some interesting special effects that I thought were very well done.If you're into Spiderman - or the Marvel Cinematic Universe - you'll like this film.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 stars (out of 10) - and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Spider-Man - Far from Home
128,fernandoschiavi,"Full of humor, exploring the teen universe. With a kind of cartoonish and stereotyped air, the teen passions, the adventures and discoveries of teenagers. It's all there.",8,29 March 2020,"""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" officially closes Marvel's ""Infinity Saga"" and follows the events that took place in ""Avengers: Endgame"". Again directed by Jon Watts and written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, it stars Tom Holland, alongside Samuel L. Jackson, Zendaya, Cobie Smulders, Jon Favreau, JB Smoove, Jacob Batalon, Angourie Rice, Martin Starr, Marisa Tomei and Jake Gyllenhaal. In the film, Parker is recruited by Nick Fury and Mysterio to face threats from another dimension while he is on a school trip to Europe.Now, without Tony Stark playing the role of tutor, it is up to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) to have that influence in the life of Peter, who still tries to reconcile having a normal teenage life with all responsibilities arising from being a superhero. And to make matters worse, Tony Stark trusted him to be a part of and lead ""The Avengers"", and that is a weight Peter still has a lot of doubts about if he could be who Stark believed he would be. After all, Peter is just a 16-year-old boy from Queens, he says. When Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) appears to defeat beings based on the four elements, Peter thinks that Mysterio may be the real substitute for Stark. And that is where the audience and the hero realize that nothing was what it looked like and he needs to gain confidence, and truly demonstrate his worth to prove to Stark that he could count on him.Tony Stark shows that he is still very present from all over the world for his sacrifice in the name of a greater good and, especially for Peter. The relationship of affection and respect that Peter always felt for his tutor is undeniable. Now, his relationship further strengthened with Happy, Tony's longtime friend, manages to convey the lack that Tony makes in their lives. The attempt to overcome this loss in their lives and the passing of a baton to Peter and the doubts he has to take an important place at the heart of the Avengers, is one of the important themes covered in the script. There is also the presence of billionaire E.D.I.T.H. (sensationally, the acronym for Even Dead I'm The Hero or ""Even Dead I Am the Hero"" - voice of Dawn Michelle King) that allows Peter to command the whole world with orders and glasses. ""Homecoming"" was an excellent film, featuring the new interpreter of the arachnid hero, but this is where Tom Holland shows his true potential in the hero's shoes. The actor manages to convey the sadness at the loss of his mentor Tony Stark in very well developed dramatic moments, and yet the joy of going on with life and trying to win over the girl of his dreams, MJ (Zendaya). It is a whirlwind of feelings that Holland is able to convey categorically.These characteristics of the narrative and adolescent dilemmas are told through new outlines. One of the differentials here is the photography of Matthew J. Lloyd, who has the chance to explore scenarios very different from what we were used to. We left common scenarios and witnessed creative and bold action scenes across Europe, with special emphasis on the scene with the Water Elemental in Venice, the Fire Elemental in Prague and the entire final sequence in London. In each of the locations, the director explores specific characteristics of the cities and provides different action scenes.The villain Mysterio, is revealed to be a fraud, being an expert in holographic illusions and a former employee of Stark Industries, who was fired for being considered unstable, with him planning a plan with his team of colleagues also former employees of Stark. Despite generic motivations, based solely on immense revenge, the villain even works by the charisma of Jake Gyllenhaal. But the feeling remains that the last act could and should have been better explored. As for the rest of the cast, the film continues the relationships started in ""De Volta ao Lar"", especially the friendship with Ned (Jacob Batallon), who here finds an unlikely romantic couple, and the love interest in MJ (Zendaya) .Following the same characteristics of the character's first film, the script continues balancing several genres in a single film with praise, which makes the experience very interesting. The film is full of humor, exploring the teen / school universe. With a kind of cartoonish and stereotyped air of practically all the characters, the teen passions, the dispute for the girl's attention, the adventures and discoveries of teenagers in new places. It's all there. The romantic comedy with a lot of humor is the main motto of the story, obviously full of interesting action scenes. It is in this ability to mix everything organically, that the greatest quality of director Jon Watts is in his work with the young cast and with the stripped-down atmosphere of a teen comedy.""Spider-Man: Away from Home"" may be a gateway to a new and unknown era of the MCU, but first of all it is more concerned with being its own thing, much like ""Homecoming"" showed a balance between pleasing the chronology of the expanded universe and create a new identity for this current phase of the Spider in theaters. With great powers comes great responsibilities, and the greatest responsibility of Peter - and this film - is in what is closest to him: family and friends. And let the long awaited Marvel phase 4 come!",Spider-Man - Far from Home

131,agmoldham,Are we due another reboot?,6,30 July 2019,I'm not quite sure how many movies we are into the Spiderman reboot. The inclusion of Spiderman into some of the other Avengers movies also makes this more complicated. It does feel around the time the last Spiderman series with Toby Maguire was rebooted. It feels like there's still a good 2 or 3 films left in the current Spiderman though.Far from Home continues from the previous Avengers movie with Spiderman trying to come to terms with his extra responsibilities. The movie is split between the action and the love interest. I have to confess that I much preferred the romantic chemistry of the previous Spiderman to that of Tom Holland. Maybe that will improve over the coming movies.Overall Far from Home is pretty watchable and unlike some super heroes there is genuine tension that Spiderman can be defeated.

133,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,One of these things are not quite like the others,4,22 September 2019,"I thought this was another Disney Marvel film because of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). The Columbia Pictures Torch Lady in the opening scene just didn't register with me right away but I knew something was really off in this film. The film is extra cheesy. Looks like Sony ordered extra cheese on it. It just didn't feel like a Disney Marvel movie. It wasn't until the end credits that I realized this was a Sony Picture. Ironically, I think it's more ""Disney TV-G"" for Disney Channel than Disney Marvel movies.I really didn't like it. It was disappointing. This picture should have been split up into five parts and made into a mini Netflix TV season because it has more of a made for television Je Ne Sais Quoi than silver screen material. I am surprised it is rated PG-13, but I think it might be for some very few sexual innuendos in the dialog otherwise it's a TV-G. I can't see adults liking this film. Last year's animated ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018)"" is a far better movie than this live action film with CGI draped spiderman suits.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
134,MihaiSorinToma,An OK movie,7,19 July 2019,"As it tries to present an evolution of Spider-Man, introduce a new hero into the picture and at the same time tell a seemingly ordinary teenage love story, the overall outcome of the movie seems a bit off judging by the quality with which we were accustomed from the Marvel universe. If you see it as an ordinary movie, you'll find it quite ok, like I did, but if see it as a Marvel movie, I think you're in for a little surprise. The biggest problem that I find with it is that it tries to do multiple things which seem to lead into multiple directions but as they tried to present them all as a whole, they missed a bit (or more) on the important stuff. Another aspect which wasn't so good is that it focuses a bit too much on the romance/teenage stuff, which seems even cliché at times, leaving the hero part of Spider-Man in the background, his contribution in the first part of the movie (I might go as far to say that the entire first half) being insignificant or even bad, just to have something to fix or improve upon later.Fortunately, it raises the bar as time goes by, even if done with small steps, and brings something more intense and obviously more interesting. It starts to show the part of Spider-Man which I want to see in such a movie, the one which fights against the bad guys, the one that makes you smile but still stays serious enough to make the action credible and enjoyable. The plot twist which it features is also a good aspect worth mentioning, totally unexpected for a stranger to Marvel comics as myself, while the explanation of it is even more impressive and satisfying.Overall it proves to be a movie which doesn't go above the OK mark due to the above mentioned downsides but is still able to provide a good time. I wouldn't quite recommend it but I wouldn't tell anybody to stay away either.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
135,bob-the-movie-man,Where Marvel goes after the Game Ends.,8,18 July 2019,"Where does Marvel go after the enormous success of ""Avengers: Endgame""? At the time of writing it's just $7M short of it's ""Avatar"" target of being the biggest grossing film of all time. The answer is a joyous comedy romp with your friendly neighbourhood Spider-man.Peter Parker (Tom Holland), still reeling from his 'blippage' and the loss of Stark, needs a break. His stress is not improved by his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei, in well-fitting jeans) getting 'closer' with Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau). Fortunately, he's about to go on a European school trip; his chance to get closer to MJ (Zendaya), the source of much pressure in his lycra. Unfortunately school heartthrob Brad (Remy Hii) is also on the trip and zeroes in on MJ too.But while in Venice a new global terror strikes in the form of a water monster : one of the ""elementals"". Fortunately Quentin Beck - a.k.a. Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal), a warrior from a parallel Spiderverse - is on hand to assist. But the water-sodden monster is just one of the elementals. Will Peter Parker, teamed with Mysterio, win through and - more importantly - will Spidey get the girl?As is common with many of the Spider-man films, comedy comes to the fore and this one is no exception. Starting with an excellent ""post-blip"" tribute video and some hysterical ""end-blip"" footage, the laughs come free and easy.It's not National Lampoon's European Vacation, but at times it feels like that. There are more laughs to be had as the school trip hits Europe, and ""free-and-easy batchelor"" Ned ( Jacob Batalon) forms an unlikely romance with fellow student Betty (Angourie Rice).Even Gyllenhaal infects his role with a 'wink-at-the-camera' nonchalence that is giggle-worthy. ""This is Quentin...."" introduces Peter; ""No.... "" interrupts Gyllenhaal with a 'Smolder Bravestone' eyebrow to camera... ""that's Mysterio!""This irreverence extends to the main villain of the piece (who only emerges late in the second reel), revelling in the role with high camp concern for the creases in his cloak!This is an excellent ensemble cast, brought over nicely from ""Spider-Man - Homecoming"" by the same director and writing team (Jon Watts and Erik Sommers respectively). Each character in the school party is well formed: Flash Thompson (Tony Revolori) for example is desperately video-blogging in an attempt to have ""likes"" fill a personal void (a greeting on arrival at a US airport is both hilarious and heart-breaking).Tom Holland is great again in the role. He is surely the definitive Peter Parker. I wonder if he had a terrible cold or hayfever or something during filming, since he seemed to have watering eyes in a lot of his scenes.... even the ones that weren't sad!Zendaya - hot property now after ""The Greatest Showman"" - does a marvellous job as MJ. As the incredibly sexy siren in ""Showman"", here she plays the exact opposite: a shy and geeky schoolgirl who you would think about taking for a milk-shake but nothing more.And once again, surely shining as a future star in her own right, is Angourie Rice as Betty. She was just sooooo great in ""The Nice Guys"", and here - for me - stole all the scenes she was in.As always for a Marvel flick there is a finale that gives the numerous digital artists a roof over their heads for another year. But it's all well done.... I had fears on seeing the ""Night Monkey"" outfit in the trailer that we might be heading for another ""Spider-Man 3"", surely the CGI / multi-villain nadir of the series. But no, it's all good. Earlier in the film there is quite a mind-warping sequence that is reminiscent of the ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" of ""Dumbo""! (Again, those digital artists all needed a new conservatory or two).Are there any ""end credit scenes"" at the end of the film? Yes, actually two crackers. The first features a very welcome cameo return to a well-loved role and provides for a great cliff-hanger ending! And the second - which will probably bamboozle occasional Marvel watchers - made little sense at all yet was good fun!This is a great summer popcorn movie, enormously entertaining, helped along by a superb soundtrack by Michael Giacchino (if you want to feel some superhero energy for your morning tube ride, listen to his Far from Home Suite Home (LOL) on Youtube). Yes, the movie is a piece of superhero fluff, closer to the ""Ant Man"" end of the dramatic spectrum, but after the ""heavy"" drama of ""Endgame"", it's just what the doctor ordered. Thoroughly recommended.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the interweb or Facebook. Thanks.)",Spider-Man - Far from Home
136,silvermistvio,Spider-Man films are always the best even if there's something I don't like.,9,12 September 2019,"Spider-Man: Far From Home is very different from what I've seen before because they have made the main character different from the other Spider-Man films. Spider-Man films are very cool and I always watch as soon as it's out. So, I saw it's out last night, I watched it immediately even I was kind of busy at the moment.What I don't like is that nowadays, they always make Spider-Man stupid. I mean they had to make something to continue the story longer. But of all the ways in the world, why did they make Spider-Man stupid? This is Spider-Man based film and as the one who loves to watch the main character clever, I kind of want to watch Spider-Man is so clever. I don't want to watch he's kind of very easy to deceive and so stupid.Except for that fact, Spider-Man: Far From Home is a great film. Everything's perfect. The special effects are very cool and it's full of excitements. In some scenes, I was really eager to know how it's going to end. And some scenes are very exciting. I was afraid that Spider-Man would lose even I know that he would win in the end. Moreover, the end credit scenes are so interesting. It seems like there's going to be sequel and I'm looking forward to see it. It'd be so exciting and I can't wait to see it. And hence, Spider-Man films are great and I totally love it.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
137,pietclausen,A slight improvement,5,14 September 2019,"The Avenger movies have deteriorated over the last few years, but Spider-Man seems to improve.

The humor, however, is slick, so the movie qualifies for an overall rating of 5",Spider-Man - Far from Home
138,kjproulx,A Fantastic Spider-Man Film,9,3 July 2019,"From Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man trilogy to Andrew Garfield's two Amazing Spider-Man films, Spider-Man: Homecoming to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, the big screen has been blessed with the presence of the web-slinger for many years. Coming off the heels of Avengers: Endgame, it was clear that this would be the first Spider-Man film to truly feel different. It does further the characters we first met in Spider-Man: Homecoming, but this movie really does show the growth of Peter Parker. While Spider-Man: Far From Home may not be the best overall Spider-Man movie ever made, here's why I do believe it to be a fantastic one, nonetheless.Picking up shortly after the events of Avengers: Endgame, the world is grieving the loss of Tony Stark. Peter, on his way to a summer vacation in Europe, is tracked down by Nick Fury and recruited to take down monsters that will destroy the Earth. Making friends with Quentin Beck (Mysterio), they work together to stop this looming threat. Without giving much away, there is so much more to the plot than this, but I'll have to remain mute on that in order to preserve your experience.Tom Holland continues to prove why he was born to play this character. His devotion to having fun with the character and also delivering an emotionally charged performance when it's required, I don't think I'll ever be tired of his rendition of the character. On top of that, Jake Gylennhall steps in as Mysterio and their chemistry is quite infectious. With the addition of Michelle/MJ (played by Zendaya) and Peter falling for each other throughout the course of the movie, Spider-Man: Far From Home feels like a teenage romance flick, meshed perfectly within the story of a Spider-Man film.Normally I don't make it a point to talk about the post-credits scenes for these movies during a review, but these scenes may just be the most important ones to stick around for yet. There are two of them and they really do require your attention. Seeming to open up the world more than it already has been throughout the years, in terms of connectivity, there are some jaw-dropping moments throughout these two scenes. I can't wait to see what both of these mean for future instalments.I can go on about how great so many aspects of this film truly are, but I'll keep it simple and say that Spider-Man: Far From Home benefits from a terrific score and theme for Mysterio that had me smiling, some truly great action sequences, and many surprises along the way that will have many fans feeling giddy. I had an absolute blast watching this movie. It does feel slow throughout the first act but in terms of being a sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming and the enormous events of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, this movie is near-perfect at accomplishing that. Highly recommended to those who have been following Marvel films since the very beginning.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
139,AhmedSpielberg99,"To whoever made the decision to make each half of the film feels like a single film, WE ARE NOT FOOLS!",7,20 September 2019,"I mean, even if we are, I doubt that there's a single person who would believe there's a superhero film that's an hour long! The teen-centric stuff that worked perfectly in Spider-Man: Homecoming didn't work here at all because everything was rushed and all over the place in the first half including the uninspiring fight scenes that made it quite clear that the first hour of the film isn't the entire film (as if this wasn't already clear!)The film overall is dramatically bland. And that's also due to the same, and probably only, aforementioned major issue. That said, the film improves so much after the first hour. The second half is way better in almost every aspect. The CGI quality and the performances (especially from Tom Holland and Zendaya) are the only two things that are exceptionally great throughout the entire film.To be honest, and despite all I've said, I can't say that I was bored at any moment. It's tasteless and underwhelming from both the action and dramatic standpoints; it's a fast-paced superhero flick that offers a lot of twists and surprises (regardless how poorly executed they are.) Spider-Man: Far from Home is a fun ride, but it's far from being one of Spidey's best films.(7/10)",Spider-Man - Far from Home
140,katyayan-12892,Amazing,8,6 February 2021,"Review By Kamal KI have to say I didn't read the comics, however out of all the superhero films this one felt the most balanced. It has everything you could ask for in a superhero film such as real life struggles. They really make you feel the struggle Peter has trying to keep saving the world and enjoy his youth. Also they really nail the villian in both of these new Spiderman films. Mysterio is sooooo amazing It made me wish he could have been the new replacement for ironman but like most movies there is the twist. Even with the twist he is such a layered character. I also loved how it goes so well with endgame. It's like pairing a great wine with a great meal. It does great at giving what fans needed a breath and chance to mourn our fan favorites that didn't make it. The use of imagery in alot of scenes of a character lost really helps make spiderman and the audience aware of the shoes he is trying to fill and the shadow of it. But it also makes you realize he is only 16 to have all this responsibility is insane. The love scenes are awesome they suit a young first love awkwardness. Instead of Frenching they peck and look petrified which is perfect. Also I applaud Zendaya as MJ she is the right fit. She brings something new not over the top but just right for a independent and intelligent love interest who looks like she can hold her own. This is how the mcu gets things right not only is there a layered plot and great comic faithful characters but they also leaving hints to connect other films and do twists that make sense and we should have spotted but missed it so you want to go back and say oh wow they filled me happily. I just hope they keep this highschool grounded aspect for future Spiderman films it gives him more of a deep and relatable aspect. I mean noone wants to see the same spiderman story over and over again and please don't bring back green goblin again for a film. I mean the vulture wasn't as big of a villian as some are and look at how well done he was. Sometimes new and simple are best. I am just hopeful they can live up to the bar set for themselves with this new great entry. But if this is the future being set up for the MCU then I am excited to see what's to come. To summarize it's a must see movie. If you miss it in theaters you will regret it. It's great on the big screen. great plot, great characters, great twists, great dialogue........so amazing I can't stop thinking about it.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
141,Carycomic,"Not as good as AVENGERS: ENDGAME. But, still a whole lot better than S-M: HOMECOMING.",7,4 July 2019,"It starts off with a memorial tribute to the five Avengers who gave their lives, six months earlier, in order to restore the three billion Earthlings spontaneously disintegrated in what has become internationally nicknamed ""The Blip."" We then learn that the science club of fictional Midtown High School is going on a summer-long trip to Europe. Which includes the cities of Venice and Prague. The next two points of attack for what are supposedly four elemental monsters from a parallel universe. At least, according to Quentin Beck. An alleged superhero from that same universe who just happens to be dressed like a cross between Iron Man and Thor!Of course, anybody who grew up reading the Spidey comics (especially the issues where Mysterio was the main antagonist) knows that's a bunch of b.s. But, I have to admit: Jake Gyllenhall does a great job making the silver screen debut of Mysterio suitably theatrical. Even the self-serving justifications are appropriately melodramatic!More importantly, Tom Holland and Zendaya do a nicely plausible job simulating the angst of first-time teen romance. Well, first time for MJ, anyway! Technically, it's the second time for Peter.But, I still don't like the excessive swearing. Again; only the absence of f-bombs kept this from being R-rated. Hence, my deduction of three stars from what could have been a perfect ten. Particularly, in light of the two twist epilogues that occur at unpredictable intervals during the end credits!My only other complaint with regard to this movie? The busload of over-indulged preppies who wouldn't stop using their cellphones to illegally record video footage of the movie.

Spider-Man 2 still holds the best of the character in my opinion. The main concern is the lack of depth for the villain, a constant problem with Marvel films. I don't understand why. The hero tends to be either having some self doubt or a love interest. I don't get why they side line the villain with no real explanation. This could've been great and allowed Spider-Man another great showcase. Spider-Man 2 has a strong villain and unlike this film had Raimi at the helm to steer the ship.

My Rating 8:10I feel a bit unqualified to review Marvel Action comic movies as I haven't seen many but today just felt like an escape movie and I really enjoyed this Spider Man franchise film.I liked the tongue in cheek humour , I enjoyed the performances , especially Jake Gillenhaal as Mysterio and Tom Holland as Spider-Man.
I guess my favourite 3 Super heroes are Spider-Man ,Batman and Spider-Man and remember Tobey Maguire back in 2002 when he bought Spider-Man into the 21st Century for the first time.There's a huge amount of craft and talent , especially the CGI artists that contribute to these films but if they're flat and just macho crash bang boom action I don't find them entertaining.This Spider-Man film has a little romance , a lot of action and a sense of humour .
I enjoyed the College trip to Europe plot with great cities like Prague, Venice ,London , each with their own threatening Monster , real or imagined.I liked Mysterio's comment near the conclusion that ""People today need something to believe in but they can't find anything ""The actors must have fun making these movies they remind me of the Saturday Afternoon matinee escapist Cowboy and Indian movies I saw as a kid but on a mega budget scale .They certainly earn huge box office dollars , much more unfortunately than most of the movies I really love but money is not the be all and end all and there's room for all genres in the World of Cinema so good luck to Marvel Studios for providing good escapist entertainment.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Just really seemed aimed at kids this film. Definitely wouldn't recommend. I felt like falling asleep at the first part of this movie, Just noticed this is the first MCU movie without a Stan Lee cameo. i feel like I'm watching power rangers stupid movie. The sound and music is bizarre to me. it was boring. I thought the dialogue was forced and unnatural. It didn't feel like a Marvel superhero film, more like a parody of one. What is Mysterio's costume? I thought it was really cringey. May and Happy as a couple makes no sense to me... and the scene where they have a whole convo about his beard? The humor was so childish it was unwatchable. he is a Spider man & he don't want to be Spider man wow?!! I really feel that the villains were awful in this, the whole plot of never knowing what's really going on is lazy writing, and having a frustrating lost at the end is beyond stupid and annoying. It especially wastes the impact of seeing our man Jonah Jamesom. it was extremely boring movie with a very predictable plot ( just like the last movie) But my biggest problems is they are using nick fury like a clown which doesn't fit his character at all and the entire reason the 1st act of the movie boils down to spider man breaking his character and the 3rd act a MASSIVE convenience. Also am i the only one who is annoyed by MJ? 75% of the time she is a black hole on screen by sucking the enjoyment out of every scene and her jokes fall short every time. Honestly I didn't like it I'm sorry. Tbh what I needed in this film a rise of Peter and for me they didn't do the best.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

150,anselmdaniel,Familiar,6,16 August 2021,"This review contains spoilers.Spider-Man: Far From Home is a superhero action movie that premiered in 2019. The movie is directed by Jon Watts, written by Chris McKenna, and Erik Sommers. The movie stars Tom Holland and Samuel L. Jackson. Spider-Man goes on a trip with his classmates to Europe. He encounters a threat.Spider-Man: Far From Home is a typical Marvel movie. The movie follows the same beats as other previous Marvel movies. This movie does not do much new in terms of Marvel movies but it does do it impressively enough. The plot has a twist that is predictable during viewing. Mysterio, played by Jake Gyllenhall, is the villain in this movie despite him appearing to help the heroes. His presence is only caused by the previous Marvel movies where he is able to capitalize on the danger posed by supernatural events happening to the Earth.The highlight here is Tom Holland as Peter Parker. Tom Holland does an awesome job here like he did in Spider-Man: Homecoming. Tom Holland has the natural charm and great performance as Peter Parker. The movie's main appeal is to watch Tom Holland and his interactions with the other characters. Everything else in the movie does not have as much of an impact as watching Peter Parker's journey.The main connection with the rest of the Marvel movies is at the end when Peter Parker is revealed as Spider-Man. The rest of the movie is not as impressive and is typical Marvel movie affairs.I would still recommend ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"".Grade: C.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
151,msbreviews,Rating: B+,8,8 July 2019,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)First of all, this is a spoiler-free review of Far From Home, but NOT of Avengers: Endgame! So, if you still didn't watch the latter or heard what happens in it (by some inexplicable reason), this is a SPOILER WARNING for the events of that era-ending film. Moving on to the web-slinger, this sequel is everything it should be and a bit more. It beautifully encapsulates how everyone's feeling about the central death of Endgame, especially Peter Parker. I wished Jon Watts would put a lot of focus into Spider-Man's grief and I hoped that a big part of the plot would be him just having to deal with the fact that his mentor/father figure is gone. He can't continue to just be the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. He needs to grow up and become what everyone expects of him: to be the best of them all.Watts does all of it. There are so many emotionally powerful dialogues featuring Nick Fury or Happy (Jon Favreau) or even just moments with Tom Holland just standing alone and having to breathe through the pain of losing someone you love. The pressure that everyone is putting on his shoulders is immense, maybe too much for a simple teenager, but he's everything but simple. I love every single bit of story dedicated to Peter and Tony Stark's (Robert Downey Jr.) relationship. Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers wrote a wonderful screenplay, and Jon Watts executed it seamlessly. However, the reason why all of this works is due to Tom Holland's performance.He said in an interview he would play Spider-Man until he can and until producers let him. I hope he stays around for years without end. He's not only my favorite on-screen Spider-Man but my favorite on-screen Peter Parker as well. I love how he spends most of the movie holding on to his feelings, and in the last act, he just lashes out because he can't take it anymore. He left my eyes close to tearing up in probably the best dialogue of the film with Happy. As a superhero, he perfectly embodies what Spidey is all about, and Holland has the plus of doing most of his action stunts. As a teenager, he's incredibly funny, innocent, and he still doesn't know how to deal with falling in love or having a crush, which leads me to the second of the three main storylines of this movie: his relationship with MJ.Zendaya did get some criticism from fans who, well, don't like the fact that MJ is not the same one as in Sam Raimi's original trilogy (physically and psychologically). Same for Holland and the fact that this Spider-Man has a lot more ""gadgets"" than Tobey Maguire's. For those people, I only have one advice: understand that this is a distinct universe with different takes on characters we know and with other stories to tell which are, in fact, the closest we had to the comics so far. The sooner you accept this, the easier will be for you to enjoy these films. Having that in mind, MJ didn't have much to do in Homecoming. Actually, she was even played as a post-credits twist so that the sequel could focus more on her ... and it did.Their relationship gradually evolves throughout the movie smoothly and realistically. They're teenagers! Having their first crush, trying to come up with a good time and place to tell the other they like them, being nervous when they're together and being anxious when they're separated ... Watts handled this subplot very well. It didn't feel forced (rom-coms should take some tips), Zendaya and Holland's chemistry is palpable, and I love this new MJ. Most of the superhero's lovers are the cliche damsel in distress, always needing saving and making dumb decisions. Zendaya's MJ not only can handle herself, but she has an unique personality that makes her stand out.Finally, the third and last storyline relies on Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal). I can't really get in-depth about this character because he has a massive impact on the narrative, but I can guarantee that Gyllenhaal makes this character work. I like how they approached Mysterio, but if it wasn't for the outstanding actor that Gyllenhaal is, Far From Home would have suffered a bit. The relationship between him and Spider-Man is well-developed, but the character of Mysterio lacked better treatment. There's an exposition dump midway through the runtime that's just horrible. Really, really bad. However, the film moves on and gets better until it reaches the last 45 minutes, which are unbelievable.I will always prefer a slow start and a fantastic finish than the other way around. Far From Home struggles with the first two acts' pacing, but the last one compensates that with some of the best action a Spider-Man movie ever had! There are so many sequences where our superheroes are just going at it, flying and swinging across buildings, bridges, and rivers like we've seen before, only better. The CGI looked like it could be excessive in the trailers, but instead, it's some of the best Marvel has shown us. Nevertheless, the jaw-dropping scenes are some that involve illusions, very much like Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) had in his origin flick. Spider-Man has two memorable sequences (the VFX here are mind-blowing), one of which incorporates a certain superpower not seen in the MCU so far (officially, at least). The kid in me was smiling with pure joy, let's write that.It's on par with Homecoming. One is better than the other in various areas, but they're extremely different, so comparing them might be unfair. The first had the goal of introducing a ""new"" character to the MCU, so the focus relied solely on Peter Parker having to deal with his powers and being the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. This sequel is set so far away from the origin story and so much happened between these two that if people chose to watch them back-to-back, they wouldn't understand much of what's going on. Nevertheless, Far From Home still has its own issues.Like I wrote above, the first two acts struggle with its pacing. While it's refreshing to watch Spider-Man in other cities besides New York, the transitions between them are ridiculously fast, especially one that takes Peter Parker to another country in such an illogical way. The film tries to play off these less rational moments with comedy bits quite often and sometimes it just doesn't work, affecting both the tone and pacing. I liked Ned in Homecoming, and I also enjoyed his presence here, but this time he almost felt like just a comic relief guy instead of that essential ""sidekick"" to Spider-Man. Michael Giacchino's score is good, but for some reason, I couldn't really connect with it, which I think it's the first time I don't exactly love Giacchino's themes. Finally, the comedy skits could be better, they don't land that many times and the one supposedly funny scene I remember is the absolute worst.All in all, I still had a blast! I think I prefer Far From Home to Homecoming since the latter deals with a much more complex and emotionally compelling story than the origin flick. The action is some of the MCU's best and definitely as great as Spider-Man's action ever was, featuring some mind-bending, astonishing sequences. The cast is brilliant, especially Tom Holland who cements his spot as the best on-screen web-slinger ever. Zendaya and Jon Favreau are also amazing, but I have to praise Jake Gyllenhaal's performance because he's just awesome every single time. It's the movie the MCU needed after the tragic events of Endgame. It works because we feel what Peter Parker's feeling and we can deal with our grief with the help of Spider-Man's journey in this film. Aside from some minor problems with pacing, comedy, and exposition, the last act plus the two post-credits scenes, which have a tremendous impact on the movie and on what's to come on Phase Four, are more than enough for you to go see this film at the theater.

Betsy's character was useless. The only characters that brought some charisma were Happy and Nick Fury.
Even our main antagonist Mysterio aka Quenten Beck was massively underdeveloped. His character seems like a hurried writing rather than a cautious and concerned approach.Technically, it was just fine, considering the previous films and the spectacular CGI we are so fond of ; it's just ordinary. But two sequences (Illusion) were my favourites from it! I would have love to see more of those.In the end the story wasn't that bad if the film Had taken itself On a serious note, the first half was a disgrace as a Spider-Man film! I couldn't believe how much a mess they created in that! It should have focused more on his responsibilities, struggles rather than on his love life and teenage drama.
The story actually had no proper mindset, sometimes it wanted to be a High school comedy, other times a Superhero feature. The ongoing transition wasn't smooth either.If you're a Spider-Man hardcore fan, then I would strongly recommend you to skip this one. But for the casual movie goers and children it could be a Fun and Light hearted ride.For myself, it's a film that I would not like to remember in the long term.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
155,mahmus,A fantastic and superior sequel,7,5 July 2019,"""Spider-Man: Far from Home"" is better than ""Homecoming"" in almost everyway. From the chemestry betweeb the cast (particuraly Holland and Zendaya) to the action and the effects. As a follow-up to the devasting ending of ""Endgame"", the movie does a great job at exploring a universe dealing with Endgame's aftermath. The best thing about this movie (other than the amazingly fan-pleasing mid-credit scene) is Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio, although I won't spoil much about his character for those unfamiliar whit the comics. This is a great movie and another win for the MCU.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
156,0w0,Spider-Man: Dodges 10million bullets,6,7 October 2019,"Movie's title should have been: Spider-Man: Dodges 10million bulletsI know when we're talking about the MCU then it's a little strange bringing up the concept of 'realism' but we have to assume that the basic laws of physics still apply in the MCU and that it's physically impossible for a 16 year old boy to dodge 10million bullets... so yeah, this movie loses points because of the lack of realism.Apart from that, the fact that they (S.H.I.E.L.D.) only called in 2 super heroes to fight a world-ending enemy, is just stupid. The ""All other Avengers are unavailable"" excuse is just not a valid one in this case... they would NEVER get just 2 Avengers to protect the world, so yeah, apart from the utter lack of realism, the movie is OK.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
157,Min111,Spiderman has another enemy,8,26 August 2020,"It's a sequel. Spiderman is back for another amazing adventure. There's so much action to be found in the movie. Spiderman or Peter Parker goes on a school trip to Europe. It's a holiday for our amazing and friendly superhero. It's a summer field trip for only a few weeks. They travel to places such as Berlin, London, Prague and Venice throughout the trip. Spiderman has another enemy. A new enemy. Mysterio. His actual name is Quentin Beck. Pretty alright name. He's one of Spiderman's enemies. He's a popular enemy by the way. He's also an enemy of Daredevil. I like the way Mysterio looks - I like his costume or suit. He's famous for wearing a round helmet. He can see in the helmet, but no one can see him out of the helmet. He's a master of deceptions. A master of illusions. Mysterio is also a member of the Sinister Six. Spiderman has to fight him; Spiderman has to defeat him. He's the only superhero that can. What I liked the most about the sequel is that you get to see a brand new villain in Mysterio otherwise it would've been boring. It was nice to see Mysterio or Quentin Beck in action. He even fooled me in the sequel. You have to see it to understand what I mean by that. He has extraordinary powers. He's capable of things other Spiderman enemies aren't capable. A lot of fans wanted to see Mysterio, and he has finally arrived. You get to see him in ""Far From Home"". Also, let's not forget there are other characters such as Mary Jane and Nick Fury. Spiderman was played by Tom Holland. He was a right choice to play the amazing/popular hero. He's good-looking. Nick Fury was played by Samuel L. Jackson. He was an interesting choice to play the character. We have already seen the Shocker and Vulture in the series, and now you can add Mysterio alongside these other enemies I've just mentioned. Hope we get to see another new enemy in the next sequel. There are so many Spiderman enemies to choose from. Who would you like to see? It's a good movie. A fun sequel. It's exciting to watch the movie again.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

It's a fun addition to the Marvel Universe where Spider-Man battles the deadly illusionist Mysterio. Some cool scenes where Mysterio puts Spider-Man in a deadly game of spider and fly with his illusions. There is a lot of humor in this movie, a reminder this is a kids film. Not the best script in the world, takes huge hurdles in logic, but I liked this movie and hope for another Tom Holland Spider-Man jaunt.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

160,MrDHWong,A fitting epilogue to the Infinity Saga,8,4 July 2019,"Spider-Man: Far From Home is the sequel to 2017's Spider-Man: Homecoming and the twenty-third film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Once again starring Tom Holland in the lead role, it is a solid final entry in the MCU's Phase 3 and a fitting epilogue to the Infinity Saga.Shortly after the events of Avengers: Endgame, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) and his high school friends leave for a two week trip to Europe. Upon arriving in Venice, Peter and his friends encounter huge elemental monsters bent on destroying everything. Donning his Spider-Man costume, Peter attempts to stop these new threats by himself when suddenly a strange man in a supersuit named Quentin Beck (Jake Gyllenhaal) shows up to take matters into his own hands.As enjoyable and faced paced as ever, Spider-Man: Far From Home is perhaps the most unconventional Spider-Man film to date, unafraid to take risks where necessary. This film follows suit with its predecessor, giving the villains believable backstories and grounding them more in reality, which in turn makes their motives more fun to watch. Even though Endgame left big shoes to fill, Far From Home pulls off several moments of heroism that makes the audience cheer for Peter Parker every step of the way, much in the vein of the other Avengers. Tom Holland is still superb as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, proving he is the best live action actor for this dual role, but Jake Gyllenhaal steals the show as Quentin Beck/Mysterio. Even Zendaya, whom I wasn't a big fan of in Homecoming, had some great scenes as MJ. Be sure to stay back after the credits for two important bonus scenes that appear to set the stage for Phase 4.I rate it 8/10",Spider-Man - Far from Home
161,Alexander_Blanchett,Welcome to the next MCU Phase,8,7 July 2019,"Very solid sequel, not as great as the first encounter with the official Marvel Universe Spider-Man but still a very good entry to the MCU and great start of the next phase.
Tom Holland once again proves that he is the perfect choice for the spider-costume as he captures the honest charme and kid-like attitude the character has based on its origins. He did not disappoint and really delivered a fine performance. Samuel L. Jackson was fine a addition to the cast, doing another turn as Nick Fury. It never gets old to see him doing the film and its even explained why he wasnt not really the same he usually is. Jake Gyllenhaal was also good. It was a creative casting decision to have him play the villain as he once was in serious talks to play Spidey himself. Zedanya is fine and so is most of the supporting cast. Nice to see Jon Favereau and Marisa Tomei having a bit more to do in this film. Some nice twsists, (some truly mind blowing ones in the post credit scenes). Great effects and very good action scenes. Loved that the setting was all over Europe which was an original turn.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
162,cardsrock,Spidey's delightful new adventure,8,3 July 2019,It's hard not to enjoy this quirky teen romance disguised as a Marvel movie. This Spider-Man sequel is hilarious and charming. It swings along through a great story and takes time to enjoy itself along the way. There are some terrifically trippy sequences that showcase the coolness of Mysterio. Gyllenhaal brings his typical great performance and is one of the better Marvel villains. Far From Home is loads of fun and a great segue into the next era of the MCU.Make sure you stay for the mid-credits scene as it is probably the best one in MCU history.,Spider-Man - Far from Home
163,CANpatbuck3664,"Far From Home is Another Fun, Thrilling and Poignant Story in the Spider-Man Saga",9,9 July 2019,"Spider-man: Homecoming was a huge success and the sequel had a lot to live up to. I didn't buy into the trailer as much as many people did, a character going on vacation can feel like a cheap plot twist but I was willing to give it a chance. The first thing Far From Home is able to replicate is that its able to achieve the comedic balance that Homecoming did. This one is even more comedic and there was never a shortage of laughs in my theatre. Do the jokes feel a little more obvious sometimes? Yes they do (a lot of it coming from Martin Starr and J.B. Smoove) but I think they also work most of the time. Even if it doesn't have high-minded satirical bite, the bottom line is I laughed quite a bit and the movie achieved that goal for me.Tom Holland is my favourite actor to play Spider-Man. He feels like a teenager and he sells the emotional turmoil that Peter feels at this stage in his life the best. He's funny, dramatic and heroic all in one and his performance is noteworthy in a cinematic universe that boasts a ton of talent. Zendaya does a fine job as MJ, MJ's off-kilter personality sold a little better in the first one but that's a result of the material feeling a little more forced. She has good chemistry with Holland and they work well together. Jon Favreau comes back as Happy Hogan, he's always good in this role and it was a pleasant surprise to see him back. Jake Gyllenhaal had big shoes to fill as Mysterio but he shows why he's such a versatile presence and he also nails all the big moments. Jacob Batalon is still funny as Ned, his scenes with Angourie Rice walk the line of being too broad but they get the job done. Samuel L. Jackson, Cobie Smulders and Marisa Tomei round out the solid cast and they all perform capably.Far From Home is trying to get to the strong emotional centre that Homecoming had but they choose to go about it a different way. Homecoming was not only about Peter trying to get the girl but the added subplot with the father/son dynamic between Tony and Peter. After the events of Avengers: Endgame, they had to go a different direction. Tony still looms large but the movie is as much about Peter's budding relationship with MJ. It works but I still preferred where Homecoming went instead. That could be just my perspective, I'm watching this as an adult and I don't think the kids will be as picky. But I felt like some of the same beats of the story were being rehashed with MJ and Peter.As much as I enjoyed this movie, going into the halfway point, I thought it was more solid than spectacular. Luckily, in terms of the action scenes, they saved the best for the end. There's a scene where Spiderman battles the villain in a vivid hallucination and I loved it. I hate when movies use a dream sequence as a chance to fake out the audience but Far From Home used it really well. There's some crazy visual stuff and it not only delivers the goods but it serves the plot. I also thought the end set piece was well designed and fit the bill for the movie. It showed off Spiderman's talents and brought enough to the table to make things exciting.Far From Home is as good as I heard going in, even if it didn't fully shift into overdrive until the climax got moving. It really is typical when it comes to Marvel's output, I could go on and on about their success but the bottom line is that they produce fun movies that people want to go out and see. Far From Home is more of that kind of blockbuster film making, I think this will please both comic fans and normal moviegoers alike. There's some funny moments, a few surprises and even some well done character development for Peter Parker, MJ and even Happy Hogan. Spiderverse is still my favourite, and if I had to split hairs, I would still grade Homecoming slightly higher than its sequel (we're talking about a 1A), 1 B) scenario). But that's in no way a slight against the character, its reflective of the high bar that this franchise has set for itself. If you haven't seen Far From Home already, don't hesitate to check it out. I'd give it an enthusiastic 9/10. Also, stick around after the credits for a return appearance from a fan favourite character.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
164,cliftonofun,"Keep it simple, Spidey.",7,7 July 2019,"This Spider-Man was - well - a lot like the last Spider-Man. The teen movie vibe works, the humor is on point, and you cannot help but be charmed. It has all the things that were missing from the multiple web slinging franchises that existed before it. That said, all the same down sides remain too. The connections to the broader MCU feel a bit unnecessary, the scenes with adults are way less effective, and the action sequences get a little overly complex and muddy at points. In other words, it is not perfect...but it is also hard not to enjoy. In some ways, I wish they would simplify these movies a bit. They don't need the extra subplots, and they don't need to set-up the next Marvel story. Just give us Spider-Man. That's enough.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

168,ronakkotian,Not quite as good as Homecoming but still very enjoyable.,7,26 July 2019,"WARNING: *SPOILERS*Spider-Man: Far From Home was a good way to end off Phase Three of the MCU. However, I feel Homecoming was a better film even though this film does a few things better than Homecoming.A huge positive I saw was how well the action scenes were helmed in this movie. Here I felt Jon Watts was more confident directing those scenes compared to Homecoming. I also thought the jokes in this movie were really funny and were better than the jokes in Homecoming.Tom Holland once again is perfect as Spider-Man. He has that innocence and charm which makes the audience root for his character. Holland also conveyed great emotion whilst feeling the pressure from the events of Endgame. Zendaya was also great as MJ. I found her character more interesting than Liz from Homecoming. Jacob Batalon was really funny and Samuel L. Jackson did a great job as Nick Fury. Finally Jake Gyllenhaal was amazing as Mysterio. There's a scene involving him and Spider-Man which was so enjoyable and surprising. He clearly had a lot of fun with his role.The problems I have is mainly to do with Jake Gyllenhaal's character. Whilst he did a good job portraying him, I thought the writing of his character wasn't so good. There is a scene where he explains why he's doing what he's doing but it came across very exposition heavy as it felt the writer couldn't explain it in a better way. That's why I felt the Vulture was a better villain since his setup was better and had more of a connection to Peter.What made Homecoming so special to me was how real and different it felt compared to the rest of the Marvel movies but Far From Home didn't have that unique feeling for me.In spite of this, Spider-Man: Far From Home is still an entertaining and satisfying end to Phase Three. After the emotional events of Endgame, it's relieving to go back and have fun with our favourite web-slinger. Also don't miss out on the mid-credits scene. There are a couple of surprises in it.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
169,Azanspy,Far from expected.,8,4 July 2019,"I knew this was going to be a good MCU movie as they always offer. But Far From Home is not just a funny and friendly Marvel movie. Homecomming was a simple good movie with a short story and a lot of great moments. But Far From Home's story is long and complicated with many twists and turns. Jon Watts retained the humour take as he did with Homecomming and it worked better than the predecessor. The strong villain, excellent visual effects, good performance and post-endgame world adds the cherry. Is this the best Spider-man movie? This maybe the best live action spidey movie but taking overall, Spiderverse gives good competition. This is one of the best movies in MCU and sets the course for it's future as its main protagonists are gone.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

171,saadanathan,Fun and enjoyable movie 7/10,7,13 June 2020,"Spiderman is a character everyone loves so it's obvious that once a movie of his comes out, everybody is hyped. I love spiderman movies and this one for sure, they are fun, amusing, funny and filled with action. This film in particular is a combination between action and teenage romance which is really enjoyable. A few scenes are a little off and other scenes are better. The action sequences are terrific and amazing. Tom Holland proves once again that he is the best actor to ever portray spiderman. Samuel L. Jackson is awesome, has a lot of good lines. Jake Gyllenhaal is a great actor and gives the audience a good villain. The rest of the cast delivers it's aspects. What disappointed me the most though was the end credits scene: when spiderman and MJ see the news that cover the attack on London and the footage of Mysterio reaveling Spiderman's identity. I felt really cheated cause now we have to wait another two years for the next movie. The film could have ended with a hint for another sequel or movie but instead we got that ending scene. So now we the fans have to wait just to know what happens to the famous web slinger. It's a cheap move by marvel to make fans wait but marvel has used this trick so many times in their movies that now it became a real problem. If marvel doesn't stop doing those end credit scenes that give the fans nothing but waiting. The MCU is going to lose its element of surprise. Even the second end credits scene doesn't give much. Mysterio's character kind of disappointed me. All fans know he is an enemy of spiderman so when I see him on screen I know he's up to something and he's not a good guy. That's why when it's revealed he is an antagonist so it didn't surprised me cause I was expecting it. Overall it is an enjoyable movie but I feel like it has problems we see in all marvel movies and things that could have been done better. I hope marvel at least learns from its mistakes.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Far fetch i love Mysterio as a bad guy but even then.I was more of a Andrew Garfield fan I feel he was the better spider man, still Holland is a million times better then Toby Mcguire who was even weaker then him.This movie was a so so and i don't believe it deserve such a high rating.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
173,andrewroy-04316,"Far From Home balances the action, emotion, and humor and adds visual inventiveness to create an over-the-top but very fun ride",7,5 November 2019,"Far From Home is a movie that can certainly be silly if you dig deep into it, but has enough creativity to be mentally satisfying and has an irresistible propulsive energy. Holland is great again in the lead, and while his scripted lines left plenty to be desired, I loved to see Gyllenhaal as Mysterio. It's bizarre that a scientist close to Stark could then claim to be from another dimension and nobody bats an eye (though the post credits scene explains at least why Fury didn't realize), and his lines given to his helpers feel far too egomaniacal.
The jokes aren't forced and are funny, and the coming of age and romance subplots didn't take too much space but did enough to generate investment. I love the choice to go all in on the visual creativity; the first illusions scene is an absolute joy to watch. The action scenes and timing of events are a bit unrealistic as always, but the premise of using drones to create these illusions was great. It's not hard to find flaws or plot holes, but few of them jump out when you're watching because between rooting for Peter with MJ, rooting for him as Spider-Man in the action scenes, and enjoying the small character interactions, you get caught up in all the fun that it has to offer.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

It labours the stereotypes and landmarks on the school trip and the memorial to Tony Stark a bit too much, but it does make sense in the bigger picture.

His acting is poor, his Spidey has no depth (The cartoon Spidey in Into the Spiderverse was a better version than this guy). The movie itself was what I expected, a lot of Marvel action and silly humor. I actually wanted to see the movie for Jake Gyllenhaal and he did not disappoint (so that's why I gave it a five).

I know I liked or even loved other Marvel movies that changed the roots of the comics sources completely (Black Widow, Thor Ragnarok). But I think that movies, even with the changes, respected their main characters enough to keep them on their own. Spiderman is an awesome and rich character. And that richness is being missed in Holland's tenure. I think he's a good actor, but the script and the portrayal of his character is not. Once again, the proof of the need to back him movie after movie: the upcoming third installment...

So, this movie can legitimately be seen as a post-mortem legacy from Iron-Man to Spider-Man. In this regard, the elaboration scene of a new costume, in the plane, next to Happy Hogan is very successful.A successful entertainment. I liked it, really!",Spider-Man - Far from Home
181,PyroSikTh,Holland Proves Once Again Why He's the Best Spider-Man,8,3 July 2019,"Far From Home picks up straight away with the aftermath of Infinity War/Endgame. This is the very first truly post-snap film, so there's actually a lot for it to deal with before it can get on with its own story. I Will Always Love You plays over the studio logos and we're greeted by ""in memoriam"" written in Comic Sans. First thing that rang through my head was ""Marvel? What you doing Marvel? Marvel, come on now..."" Then we get badly photoshopped images of Iron Man and Captain America, a watermarked image of Black Widow, a grainy photo of Vision. Yes, it's a cheap high school production for their little news segment. This acts as a great way to catch up with events so far in the grand narrative, we get shots of the snap from the perspective of average people, as well as everyone snapping back into existence suddenly. We get shown how some kids from the school have grown up five years while others are exactly where they were pre-snap, and how it's caused curricula mayhem. Rather than using some clunky exposition, or revealing the effects of the snaps gradually and naturally, I felt using the school's cheap news broadcast to bring the audience up to speed was probably the best and most entertaining way to go about it.From then on Far From Home largely takes its own course through the movie. This is a movie about Peter coming to terms with a world without his mentor, where he's looked upon to step up and take on the mantle. While this is a theme of many superhero movies, Far From Home takes it further by making it about how much of a superhero Peter is expected to be, and his resistance to that by just wanting to be a normal kid and go on a school vacation, Spider-Man-free. This is in stark contrast to Homecoming where Peter went above and beyond to prove he had what it took to be an Avenger. It shows how Peter has matured. He's still a hormonal teenager, but he's grown up enough to recognise his own limitations and his own immaturity. He's not an adult with years of experience, and he knows firsthand what kind of dedication and experience it takes to be a ""real"" superhero.But it isn't completely detached from the MCU. In fact it's more connected than Homecoming was. Tony Stark's death is felt in almost every other scene. Doctor Strange, Thor, and Captain Marvel all get namedrops, and of course Nick Fury and Maria Hill are ever-present. Then without spoiling too much, Mysterio's entire background is intimately tied to events from both Civil War and Iron Man, making it a surprisingly good epilogue to this era of the MCU, and a great bookend. Oh, Spider-Man also wields a sign and a chain not too dissimilar to Captain America with Mjolnir in Endgame. I got a little kick out of that I admit. They knew how iconic that shot would be and they recreated it in Far From Home before Endgame was even released. There's also a pretty huge callback to the Maguire/Raimi Spider-Man films too, but shh, spoilers.The visual effects are fantastic from top to bottom. If you're anyone who knows anything about Mysterio, you'll know there's more than initially meets the eye. He's a master of illusions, and in this case he uses holographic tech to confuse his opponents. This leads to a sequence that feels super familiar to Doctor Strange having his mind expanded, where the laws of physics no longer apply, and we're thrust from one surrealistic arty shot to another with no regard to scale or spacetime positioning. That scene was by far the best scene in Doctor Strange, and honestly the similar scene in Far From Home is up there as one of the best scenes here too. Although that said Far From Home definitely has more competition. Spider-Man exclusively using his spidey-sense was also a fantastic sequence, and all of the elementals look great. Not to mention Mysterio's suit may be my favourite superhero costume ever put into film. Ever. That suit is a piece of art and I want one.Acting was great all round too. Tom Holland really is the best Spider-Man/Peter Parker we've had, managing a careful balance between the completely awkward and nerdy Peter, and the wisecracking heroic persona of Spider-Man. More crucially he manages to nail the emotional scenes too. His anger is raw, his tears are real, and his happiness is infectious and charming. Jake Gyllenhaal is also unsurprisingly great as Quentin Beck. His acting feels maybe a little off at the beginning, but it completely makes sense retroactively as the movie progresses, and almost makes it more impressive. There's a huge exposition dump in the middle of the movie, which is as close to a criticism as I can get at the moment, but it was saved by Gyllenhaal's monologuing. Dude is just so good at this kind of character. Zendaya gets a whole more to play around with here as well, showing more vulnerable sides to MJ that we didn't get to see in Homecoming. She's a brash edgelord for sure, but there's humanity and actual feelings there, and Zendaya does not struggle in offering those other sides to us.As I said, the big exposition dump in the middle of the movie is about as close to a lull as this movie gets. It's literally just Gyllenhaal talking and explaining every minutiae, complete with flashbacks to previous films to make sure the audience is connecting it all up properly. Rather than letting us sit with the ""twist"" and trying to piece it all together ourselves, it's spoonfed to us, and it's a long one too. It goes on and on. There's a few jokes and lighthearted lines thrown in there to keep it entertaining, but even so. The other criticism I did have was about the mischaracterisation of Nick Fury in particular. While he's by no means infallible, he usually has a keener eye than this, and a few of his lines just don't quite sit right with his character. If I had to use a single word to describe him here, it would Dumb. But - and this is a big but - it's all explained perfectly in the second post-credits scene, so make sure you stick through it all otherwise you'll come out with the same criticisms. In fact I'd argue that these are the most crucial and important post-credits scenes so far. Do not leave when the credits start to roll.I have genuinely tried to not like the three MCU movies released this year, but they're just too good. Marvel are horrifically consistent with their movies. Even the fairly generic feeling of Captain Marvel didn't undercut how downright entertaining that movie was. Even the shaky, badly explained time-travel logic at the end of Endgame didn't undercut how much of a landmark film it is and how iconic it will become to the landscape of movies. And here, even the exposition dumps do not affect the movie's flow or pacing enough for it to feel like a legitimate criticism. This is Spider-Man on his A-game.Far From Home was Spider-Man feeling fully at home within the MCU. It may not stand as well as its own movie, at least not when compared to Homecoming, but this is just how the MCU works, this is the great thing about shared universes, we can have single movies that connect to entirely different and unrelated movies, and I personally welcome it. I get a huge kick out of every reference and recurring character through these movies. If you watch MCU movies, you either need to make sure you watch them all, or you need to accept there are just going to be some parts you don't fully understand. For me, Far From Home was stronger because of these connections, not weaker. I vastly preferred it over Homecoming. It's fun, funny, explosive, but also cutesy in that typical high school dramedy type of way. I give Far From Home a solid 8/10.P.S. The mid-credits scene has the best character cameo of any movie this year, hands down. It's worth the price of admission by itself.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
182,Darth_Osmosis,"MCU's Peter Pan, just a boy, just a boy.. never be a man!",6,6 July 2019,"The movie was OK, not great, not good, not awful just OK! And that is a problem! It has some nice action is funny enough and is decently paced(although the first half drags a tiny bit)! Where it fails is it's main characters, both the hero and villain.Peter Parker is exactly the same super insecure kid he was in ""Homecoming"" which suited him at the time, he was just discovering his powers and was new to being a hero. This time however it's a whole different story, sure he is not THAT much older, BUT he fought in a Superhero Civil War, went to space and faced the Mad Titan himself, became an Avenger and worked together with the greatest heroes! He also had Tony Stark for a mentor! And despite all that experience and change he is still the same kid he was... not to mention he is so well off compared to the other big screen incarnations of the character(especially Tobey Maguire's)! He has a cool young supportive aunt, he goes to this fancy school where the biggest bully is the extremely nerdy version of Flash Thompson, he has friends who back him up, Nick Fury and SHIELD who back him up, and even Tony backs him after his own death! This is the fifth movie he is in, and he has not grown a bit.. he seems to be always apologizing for everyone almost for just being alive.. while also being likable but in that adorable way, which suits Peter I guess, but it's almost impossible to see him taking on any serious villains who really want to end him like the Green Goblin or Venom! Overall I am just really disappointed by his lack of growth through five five films.Mysterio is wasted as a character! Instead making him have an original backstory(or the one he has in the comics),he is another guy who has beef with Stark, much like The Vulture from ""Homecoming""! Jake Gyllenhaal does a good job portraying him though, so that helps a little! Also when he ultimately gets what he desires he does the dumbest thing ever, he could literally become the next Iron Man, but he just wants the fame while the Avengers are away(if any of the other major heroes would be present, he would be toast in a sec). So he wastes the opportunity to play a good guy and infiltrate SHIELD/Avengers or go full on mad dictator for some ridiculous stab at fame.. he does strike at Spidey later in a significant way.. but it's neither here nor there. In the end it seems there never really were any big stakes, which is quite disappointing, especially since Mysterio had so much potential!The supporting cast is mostly fine. The humor can be a little hit or miss at times, but it's to be expected, overall they make it so there is always something happening and the movie feels alive! What is more noticeable this time around(at least to me) is how most characters are quite a bit taller than Peter, including MJ portrayed by Zendaya(who is likeable and charming!). This makes Peter/Spidey seem even less intimidating. This is of course a minor gripe that most won't even care or notice. This movie seems kind of unnecessary and exist as a sort of filler in the MCU, which is something you should NEVER be able to say about a Spider-Man film!",Spider-Man - Far from Home
183,Draysan-Jennings,Same ol stuff.,5,24 September 2019,Couldn't keep my attention and Myseterio sucked as the villain. Was cool for background noise at most. Haven't watched a good superhero movie in a long time.,Spider-Man - Far from Home
184,dfle3,Manages to not be a terrible film from the second half. 65%,6,26 July 2019,"I've got a confession to make: this is the first film in this series that I have seen. Okay, I watched some of Toby Maguire's turns as the titular character...maybe I've even seen all three by him...but maybe it was only the first two (but hey, who can remember? Actually, I see that I have reviewed ""Spider-Man 3"" on this site and I gave it 5 out of 10 stars, meaning that I liked it less than this film) and I didn't bother watching any of Andrew Garfield's turns when the franchise was rebooted just a few short years later! The only thing that made me consider watching this latest instalment in the umpteenth reboot of this character is that I saw and didn't mind the most recent of the Avengers' films, ""Avengers: Endgame"", which it directly follows on from and narratively intersects with.The opening to ""Far from home"" made me think that I had missed nothing by avoiding this latest reboot and it also made me wonder if I would regret having having taken the plunge into it now. It has to be said: there is no context or scenario in which it is all right to play Whitney Houston's song ""I will always love you"". I didn't even know that it was a cover of a Dolly Parton song but having since heard Dolly's original some short years ago, it is infinitely preferable to listen to. Whitney's vocal histrionics grate greatly with me. From there it got no better with what looked like the film presuming to put words into the audience's mouths about how they should feel about the Avengers. Maybe it's because I'm an Australian (or, maybe now, a no longer very young Australian) that I found all this saccharine content just extremely hard to stomach. If the film had gone on in this style, it would have done tremendously well to reach a score of 40% from me.Now, ""Avengers: Endgame"" had what Far From Home refers to as ""The blip"", the sudden destruction of and (spoiler this paragraph - if you haven't seen that and it's predecessor ""Avengers: Infinity war"") later 'resurrection' of 50% of the population of the world. As I find these Marvel films forgettable, I can't even remember if Spider-Man was one of the original casualties of this mass cull of humanity in the last two Avengers' films. This ""blip"" gives rise to an age difference between those who used to be the same age before the mass cull and after the culled were 'resurrected' due to the intervention of The Avengers.Also weighing down the story for me was the remarkable situation that a sequel to this reboot (I had thought it was the 4th in the series but it turns out that it is only the 2nd) would still be dwelling on themes of Peter Parker's awkward teenage attempts at romance. All this stuff just bored me and is obviously pitched at an audience who are experiencing such things now. You would expect this stuff to be the domain of the first rebooted film, not subsequent sequels. Maybe you could attribute this to ""The blip""? I dunno.The major drama of the film concerns some Avengers' level agents of destruction, known as ""The Elementals"". Again, if the whole film dwelled on this conflict, it would have been less than mediocre. One of my notes on this film commented on how unmotivated their penchant for world-destruction was. Maybe there is actual historical myth which lay behind their use in this film? By contrast with Thanos, from the last two Avengers' films, The Elementals were utterly boring as enemies, with nothing to say at all about why they want to go about destroying the world or, at least, somebody explaining why they do so.Again, if the film had concerned itself mostly with this kind of fare, it would have been absolutely rubbish, except for those for whom spectacle is enough. Fortunately, the second half of the film improves things. It gets a bit ""meta"", as far as making parallels, one could argue, with the nature of the Marvel Universe's own audience. Whilst this is self-conscious, it was interesting but maybe others might find that it lacks depth of insight (not me, as I'm not that picky...at least on this front!).Even though this was by no means a particularly good movie, I suppose that I have to give grudging kudos to the studio for their finale. Before that finale, I can't say that I had any plans to continue with this rebooted series. After the finale, my interest in how the events depicted would unfold was piqued. It's not my intention to imply that I think that the sequel to Far From Home will be good - it would be nice if it was - but merely to say that it would hold some narrative interest for me. Maybe best to wait for next reboot?Random observations:Plot hole: how the last recipient of EDITH could control it!* Nice save re Peter's love interest's earlier comment to him* Sandra Dee was cute in this film...she played Olivia Newton-John, I believe* Fans of Led Zeppelin will enjoy some of the songs on the soundtrack* Australia and the Australian state of Victoria were one of many nations' bodies providing funding for the film. Connection to Australia in the film is?* Tony's note to Peter said?* Crazy stupid: Spidey on a public date at end* Spidey has infinite webbing?!* Finale pushes this to 65% score from 50% (similar to Toy Story 4 for me)",Spider-Man - Far from Home
185,sweidman-28016,A Perfect Marvel Film!,10,7 July 2019,"Spider-Man: Far From Home Review:Spider-Man: Far From Home is once again directed by Jon Watts and stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker. After the events of Endgame, Peter goes on a school trip to Europe where he wants to relax and take a break from big superhero jobs all the while trying to tell MJ, played by Zendaya, that he likes her. During the trip, however, monsters known as Elementals ravage different cities so Peter has team up with Quentin Beck/Mysterio, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, and try to protect everyone from the Elementals. If you know me you most likely know that I'm a humongous Spider-Man fan. It was actually Spider-Man: Homecoming that made me really get into the MCU and that's all thanks to Tom Holland for being the best Spider-Man ever. I wish there could be more than three Spider-Man stand-alone films with him but unfortunately that's all we get. Hopefully he is in a lot more MCU films as the franchise continues. What I loved about this film is that it's a teen romance film disguised as a superhero film. Zendaya was even better in this than she was in Homecoming. There was more development getting to know her through Peter's crush on her which helped quite a bit with her character. Tom and Zendaya just have a great relationship so it made it feel real and we want him to tell her how he feels, but every chance he gets something happens to foil his plans. The film quicks in right from the beginning. It feels as there's always something happening so there's never a boring or slow scene. I've scene it three times now, I was lucky enough to get to see a midnight premiere for it, and I'm still excited every time! The action scenes are truly stunning. I will argue to say it has the second most badass scene in all of the MCU behind Cap getting the hammer. For Jake Gyllenhaal's first time in a superhero film, he does fantastic! I love Jake Gyllenhaal and for him to play Mysterio was a blast. The exposition on him made sense to me, he wasn't just a character you could ever forget, and he's also just amazing. The bond with him and Tom was really good. Mysterio is there to take place of Tony and be a figure for Peter to look up to. Peter is so stressed and lost trying to fill the position of Tony and Mysterio helps him find his way. There is a twist about halfway through the film that I won't say, but we all saw it coming but I did not predict it in any way. It worked for me and I think it worked for most looking at the reviews I've seen. The visual effects were really good in this, especially towards the end. There was only one part where it looked a little weird but it's not a big problem. I think Michael Giacchino's score for the film improved even more from Homecoming. I really like his version of the Spider-Man theme and I personally think it's one of the most memorable in the MCU. Mysterio' theme and the ""love"" theme (I guess is what you'd call it), were memorable also. I just think it's a good score and I've been listening to it for the past couple days. Also I enjoyed the song choices added as well. The score and songs helped set the mood well. The comedy is really good in this. I think Jacob Batalon as Ned is just really funny and there's a side plot with him and Angourie Rice as Betty Brant that added much humor to the story. Jon Favreau as Happy and Marisa Tomei also have a humorous side plot. Peter being an awkward person is funny to me. I just love how these films are teenage comedies that are also superhero films. The mid credit scene is absolutely amazing but also causes me a lot of stress. There's a surprising cameo that had everyone at the midnight premiere basically screaming. Honestly it was the best experience in a theater that I've ever had. I won't spoil it for anyone but it literally gets me every time. Also the end credit scene changes everything really. If you see it a second time you'll catch some stuff that will make some things make sense. I could go on and on about Far From Home. Expect to see a spoiler review soon. I don't like to spoil Marvel films without a warning because they're a big deal to everyone. I would highly recommend this film. It's in my top four MCU films. I haven't heard anyone say it was disappointing. It is on par with Homecoming for me. There is nothing I would change about it.

186,sweidman-28016,WE NEED THE NEXT FILM NOW!!!,10,17 July 2019,"Spider-Man: Far From Home SPOILER Review:If you haven't seen Spider-Man: Far From Home and are looking for a spoiler free review, I wrote one a couple weeks ago when it first was released. You've been warned.
_________________________________________________Since it's been two weeks since the film has come out, I think it is now appropriate to write my spoiler review. As many people know I absolutely love Spider-Man and I really loved this film (as it was my second film of the year to get a perfect A+ score from ). As of this past weekend I've seen the film four times which is my record for film most seen in theaters. I really liked the setup and pacing for this. Unlike Homecoming something was always happening. Don't get me wrong I liked the breathers in Homecoming but I liked how they tried something new with this. We get the introduction of Mysterio right away which sets him up as the hero. Many people knew he's a villain in the comics so the hero part was all an act. What I found fun was figuring out how he was the villain. The scene in the bar after he's given the EDITH glasses, I just loved how slowly the illusions faded away causing some confusion and then he has that fantastic smile. Jake Gyllenhaal is just great and he will be remembered for this role. The two contrasting personalities were just so fun. His true personality just reminded me of his insane character in Nightcrawler. Some people weren't super into how the exposition came in through those flashbacks. There wasn't really another way for them to put it in there until then. For those who didn't know he was a villain they needed to wait to put it all out there. There were some hints earlier like when Peter shot his web and an invisible object fell to the ground which eventually revealed the illusion. I enjoyed the drone illusions. It provided the second most badass scene with the ""Peter Tingle"" on the bridge towards the end. I'm glad they explored Spidey Senses more since that is a big part to the character. The characters were more well developed. Zendaya as MJ was fantastic. I liked her in Homecoming but we couldn't really feel for her too much. It's the romance between her and Peter that helped more. It honestly was my favorite aspect of the film. Every chance Peter gets to tell her it's just all ruined so we just want it to happen. When he finally does tell her after the drones are all gone that was really cute and put smiles on everyone's face. In the trailer the scene where she guesses that Peter is Spider-Man is shown. I think they should have left that out and just left it for the film. Everyone who saw the trailer knew it was coming and I don't think it should've been added. I think the other big things I would like to talk about are the after credit scenes. The mid credit scene gets me literally everytime and it makes me anxious. When J.K. Simmons showed up as J. Jonah Jameson that was amazing. During the midnight showing we all just cheered. J.K. Simmons as that character is so iconic. He is perfect for the part and you can't just replace him. When Quentin frames Peter for the drone attack that got me. But when he reveals that Spider-Man is Peter Parker, I just have no words. There are too many emotions. We're going from everyone liking Spider-Man to the classic everyone not liking him. I don't know what is going to happen now. I need the next Spider-Man film now and for them to never stop making those films. Tom Holland is the perfect Spider-Man and I don't want him to ever stop. The other after credit scene is a pretty big reveal to me. It's revealed that Fury and Hill weren't even there and they were just the two Skrulls, Talos and Soren, from Captain Marvel the whole time and Fury is just on a ship somewhere. Rewatching it I could see a few hints and it makes a little sense. I'm not sure what emotion we're supposed to feel with that my it feels funny and shocking to me. Far From Home was a fun roller coaster that left me feeling many emotions. I still absolutely love it and would highly recommend it. I can't wait for what the MCU brings next!",Spider-Man - Far from Home
187,funtasticfour,Continued Marvel and Spider-man excellence!,9,7 July 2019,"Is Tom Holland the best Spider-man? I'm still not sure, but I like that he stayed in high school longer than Tobey Maguire's Spidey. The stories are more fun in a high school environment, even if that means some crazy European trip that I never even imagined could actually happen in my teens. Jake was great as Mysterio, and the side characters are also very good. A lot of laughs, and great action as expected. What about that ending though? Where the heck does this franchise go next? I'm excited to find out, and hope it doesn't suffer the third movie curse (sorry-not sorry that Andy Garfield didn't even get there).",Spider-Man - Far from Home
188,JakeBrinkman,Not another teen... superhero... mind-bender?,10,4 July 2019,"This movie shows how the superhero genre can break into yet another genre and adapt it with its own twists. This time they make a teen road trip movie that has every bit of the classic teen sitcom feel while still providing edge-of-your-seat action.As expected based on his previous performances, Holland acted exceptionally well as both Peter and Spider-Man. In this film, he adds yet another layer by perfectly capturing all of the wonder, heartbreak, and awkwardness of young love. Gyllenhaal also gives an amazing performance as a relatable, intelligent, and ambitious side character.The villain was by far my favorite part of the film. Truly enjoyable personality and motives putting the villain on par, in my opinion, with the much-beloved Loki. The villain's powers and foresight left me with honest fear for Spider-Man, which is something I've rarely felt for the usually invincible protagonists of superhero films.This movie also, for the first time, presented spidey sense and Peter's intelligence exceptionally well. Previous MCU films have shown these, but not nearly as well as they were depicted in Far from Home.In summary, this movie was another excellent installment in the MCU. While it certainly wasn't as moving as Endgame, it doesn't necessarily need 22 movies of background to still pack a lot of enjoyment!",Spider-Man - Far from Home
189,Offworld_Colony,What's not to like?,8,10 February 2020,"Charming and fully Spider-Man through and through. The only complaint is that with all the mystery surrounding the Mysterio twists and that title, the mind races to second guess what sort of pretzel-like twists the plot will go through. However, it's rather straight-forward, modern, and a little Iron Man Three-ish in tone, which, once it settled, I liked very much, in-fact the villainous twists were rather in continuity with the earthy villainy of Homecoming.
It's exquisitely modern-feeling and naturally inclusive, and yet manages to have a classic 'movie Spider-Man' feel, compounded by the gonzo, squeal-out-loud, world-breaking cameo at the end. The roadmovie/field trip feel is really well implemented (A natural London was a joy to see), the comedy is on point throughout (It was extremely funny at points, see: Martin Starr), and the mixture of themes are all handled and managed satisfactorily throughout (although they all get murky at the end).
Not quite sure what to make of the actual post-credits sequence but I'm sure a Reddit pass will subdue that.
Overall it's a perfect distillation of the Marvel machine: It has the comedy of Rangarok, the punk irreverence of Iron Man, the visual wit of Doctor Strange, the slackness of Ant-Man and the Wasp, and the groove of Guardians. It was hugely enjoyable after the (excellent) dirge of Endgame.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
190,acedj,Almost flawless,9,13 July 2019,"I have always loved Spider-man. Ever since I was a kid watching The Electric Company. I suffered along through many poorly made TV movies until Sony came out with Toby McGuire and the first two great offerings. These were, at the time, the best there was to offer of the web slinger. Then came The Amazing Spider man, and these were even better. Marvel has regained their property, and my friends, they are not messing around. This movie fired on every cylinder and was everything you would expect. Funny, touching, humbling and packed with action. This movie, in my opinion was slightly less good than Homecoming, but I feel that had a lot to do with the mood of the times in which it is set. Coming after the tragedy of loss that Thanos brought to the MCU, it has to have a more somber tone. Run, don't walk to see this great movie.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

These are Hollywood fantasies pushed by a political agenda.It bothers me because it is so fake and forced. It's not done because anyone actually cares about diversity.This was just badly made.

And frankly I am not spending any more money on Hollywood until they begin to go back to ORIGINAL films made from merit and not superficial political agendas.Of course we got the stereotypical cute white boy lead, the fat asian flamboyant side kick, the POC lead girl.These diverse groups only appear in real life in small pockets of woke universities, but Hollywood promote it as if this is a reflection of America.

'Far from Home' is immense fun as the story follows the events after 'Endgame'.
It's not meant to better the Avengers movie but help continue the Marvel universe after Tony Stark snapped his fingers.They say a hero is only as good as his nemesis.
Here the villain doesn't obviously present himself.
Jake Gyllenhaal is absolutely splendid as Mysterio. Creating a memorable character due to a performance that he obviously relishes playing.
Holland once again puts in a great turn as both Peter Parker and his alter ego.
I think now Tom Holland is the definitive version of the character, even surpassing the brilliant Tobey Maguire.'Far From Home' is a hugely enjoyable film blending a teenage road trip movie with that of the Superhero genre.
The laughs are sprinkled throughout with also a lot of heart. All the characters in this movie get great development allowing the audience to care.
MJ and Peter's relationship blossoms and this film is just as entertaining during the quieter moments as it is when the tremendous action set pieces are lighting up the screen.'Far From Home' is also a sublime looking film.
I rented the movie via streaming and even when compressed the image quality still pops.
I can only imagine just how good this film is going to look on 4K Blu-ray.
Sound quality is also mightily impressive.
Surround sound effects are constant and bass is deep.
LFE rumbles particularly during scenes involving the Elementals.Like I said this is a better movie than 'Homecoming!'

198,LloydBayer,Far From Home is goofy fun with lot more screen time for Peter Parker and why Spider-Man could be the next big thing in the MCU.,8,4 July 2019,"Remember what superhero films were like many years ago? Eleven years ago, there was no such thing as the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It wasn't until 2008 when Robert Downey Jr (in the mother of all comebacks) set the ball rolling in Iron Man. And even then, we had no clue that that film would pilot an entire franchise to its grand finale a few months ago. Avengers: End Game, though epic in proportion and conclusion, did leave some lingering questions about the fate of many of the Avengers and the franchise itself. But now that the battle smoke has settled and along with it, the hype and anticipation too, Marvel fans can sit back and enjoy a superhero film that doesn't take itself too seriously. You could also call Spider-Man: Far From Home a Marvel Lite film, because that's all it is and tries to be.Like Superhero films many years ago, Far From Home isn't about an elaborate plan to save the world. You won't have to keep track of a superhero ensemble trying to outwit an evil mastermind or why said mastermind wants to wipe out humanity in the first place. At its purest level, Far From Home is about a boy who likes a girl, but doesn't know how to profess his feelings for her. That's a highly relatable predicament for anyone who has been a high school teenager, which is the case with Peter when he learns that his crush MJ (Zendaya) is on the summer field trip to Europe. Also onboard is Peter's best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon), who like the other kids in his class, is still 16-years-old. Why they are not 21 (after Bruce Banner snapped everyone back to the 'present day' storyline in End Game) is cleverly explained within the first ten minutes of the film. In fact, a lot happens in the first ten minutes of this film, including a spoof farewell to the slain Avengers in End Game (looking at you, Academy Awards). As expected, one of them is Tony Stark, who lives on as Peter's mentor in memory. But Stark didn't die without leaving something behind for Peter - a pair of sunglasses with UV protection, and, tactical support. This little device will prove more than handy during the whirlwind tour through Venice, Prague, Berlin and London where Peter encounters a new friend and mentor - Mysterio.Jake Gyllenhaal as Quentin Beck, aka Mysterio, is a new and terrific addition to the MCU's ever increasing list of superhero characters. There is unaffected charisma and noble determination that Gyllenhaal gives in Mysterio, but it's his brotherly fondness for Peter that makes us believe the latter is in the good hands after the demise of Tony Stark. Where Far From Home excels is not in the expensive CGI built action scenes, which in my opinion has become tiresomely explosive and repetitive, but in the character dynamics that are equally goofy and down-to-earth candid. Sure, every superhero must battle worthy supervillains, and all that, but Peter's greatest nemesis is his own every-day life. The peer-group pressure arising from several awkward situations Peter and his friends find themselves in significantly dials up the humour quotation in this film, while keeping the story rooted to the reality of kids being naïve, curious, expressive, and yet fragile at the same time. Holland has a nuanced awareness of this which gives his Peter Parker a steep learning curve in even the very mundane aspects of being a teenager. Such is his delivery in this film that holistically, you could say Tom Holland is the best actor to dawn the Spidey suit, even surpassing his own role in 2017's Spider-Man: Homecoming.At its core, Far From Home is a teen romantic comedy resonant of the dreadful years of adolescence but also the rewards that come with it. But as a superhero film, we get a lot of screen time to focus on the character development of just one superhero, and just like the good old day. Yet Arguably, the film's release is in close proximity to End Game. This also means the film is either the final chapter to the Infinity Saga, or the beginning of a new era which could see Spider-Man as a significant character in the continuously evolving MCU. Either way, what happens during the film is well worth the price of admittance, but stay seated for the two head-smacking end credits scenes and you might just walk out with notion that you got more than you paid for.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
199,david-meldrum,"Tom Holland Is Good, But This Treads Water And Annoys Anyone Who's Not American",6,12 July 2019,"Tom Holland is a very good Spider-Man; but we already knew that. I can see him inhabiting this role for years. Much of this has a deft, light touch that is Marvel's trademark but the lightness with which it skips over recent MCU events seems an odd tonal shift. There's some good stuff here touching on what we might call Imposter Syndrome, but there's too much of the super-hero movie trope of city-wide destruction for no real reason. When you play around also with the idea of what's real and suggest multi-verses without ever really exploring the idea properly, it's hard to really trust the narrative. And this American movie trope that Europe is a Scary Place where Bad Things Happen to Americans (see also Hostel, etc)? The rest of the world has had enough of that; how about you use the camera to look at yourselves?",Spider-Man - Far from Home
200,Magow-Intermean,Spider-Man: Far From Home Review,7,6 July 2019,"In the wake of Thanos' defeat, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) leaves Spidey at home for a class trip to Europe, where he can ask out MJ (Zendaya). But he's soon approached by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to save the day with new hero Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal).
Avengers: Endgame irrevocably changed the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The apocalyptic time-travel epic not only wrapped up a decade of narrative threads and character arcs, but set up a whole new world in which half of the population has blinked back into existence, five tumultuous years after being blinked out of it. How will the MCU address such universe-altering consequences?
The answer, as Spider-Man: Far From Home proves, is with the same considerable wit, boundless energy and tonal levity that made 2017's Spider-Man: Homecoming such a joy. In its opening minutes, Far From Home establishes its post-Endgame world with a hilariously flippant extended gag sequence that doubles as a handy catch-up reel for those who skipped the second- biggest box office hit of all time. (Spoilers follow, if you too are in that camp.)
The good news is that Thanos is dead and dusted. The bad news is that Tony Stark is dead too. And while the world is clamouring for Spider-Man to take up Iron Man's mantle as lead Avenger, poor Peter Parker (Holland) really needs a break. Just as Iron Man 3 saw Stark haunted by his trip through the Chitauri wormhole in Avengers Assemble, Endgame's endgame casts a shadow over Parker, now grieving his mentor's untimely death and hoping to relinquish his super-suit for a little while - less a Spider-Man 2 Spider-Man-No-More than a Spider-Man-not-right-now.
An upcoming school trip across Europe is just the opportunity Parker needs to both put his heroism on hold and declare his feelings for the brilliant, beautiful, and slightly terrifying MJ (Zendaya) - hatching a romantic plan for the holiday involving the Eiffel Tower and her favourite flower, the black dahlia (""Like the murder""). Ned (Jacob Batalon), meanwhile, reckons he and his best bud will be ""American bachelors in Europe"", bully Flash Thompson (Tony Revolori) has become a swaggering vlogger who broadcasts to his #flashmob, and teacher Mr Harrington (a consistently hilarious Martin Starr) is still one lost student away from a total breakdown.
"" Faces Endgame's monolithic legacy head-on, before leaving it behind to embark on its own globetrotting adventure.
Just as Homecoming was a whip-smart John Hughes-inspired teen comedy that also happened to be a Spider-Man movie, Far From Home would fly by without any interrupting superheroics. The impeccable Spidey-sense of humour from the previous film isn't quite as well-honed here (a recurring gag about J.B. Smoove's teacher believing in witchcraft never lands, while Ned and Peter's golden double-act gets less screen time), but returning director Jon Watts clearly relishes the coming-of-age touchstones afforded by his teen hero, this time combining the Hughes influence with a Eurotrip-inspired vision of Europe (a brief jaunt to the Netherlands is improbably populated with windmills, tulips galore, and kindly sports hooligans).
But superheroics do, inevitably, interrupt when Nick Fury (Jackson) hijacks the school trip, recruiting Spidey to battle destructive elemental creatures alongside Jake Gyllenhaal's newly arrived hero Quentin Beck, aka Mysterio - purporting to hail from the same alternate dimension as the monsters. Watts nailed the localised Queens setting of Homecoming, but clearly delights in the possibilities of taking the friendly Spider-Man out of his neighbourhood - Parker now contending with crumbling architecture, crowds of sightseers, and enemies unaffected by his webs. The director gets maximum mileage out of Spider-Man's status as the most acrobatic Avenger, punctuating the action set-pieces with dizzying flips and thwips, most effectively in a slick showdown on London's Tower Bridge.
After Homecoming saw Parker working under the tutelage of Tony Stark, the Iron Man-shaped void brings three new potential father-figures into his life. Mysterio, in a typically non-traditional MCU twist on the source material, is now his co-worker and confidante, offering companionship and empathy for Parker's latest loss. And then there's Fury, Jackson back on mischievously imperious form, both lamenting that Earth's most available hero is a literal schoolkid and relishing the chance to brandish his considerable authority over him. And after spending much of Homecoming fielding Parker's needy voicemails, Jon Favreau's Happy Hogan now bonds with the youngster through their shared grief and fear of Fury - all while striking up a secret relationship with Aunt May (Tomei). It's testament to Watts that these character threads dovetail neatly without jostling for screentime, bringing even more emotional depth to the MCU's Spidey-verse.
If the buddy relationship between Parker and Beck initially feels bland, Gyllenhaal later shakes up his vanilla heroism, the film switching up a gear just as it appears to be going through the motions. There's no equivalent rug-pull to the Vulture reveal in Homecoming - anyone who took Spidey Comics 101 will see a major development coming - but Watts stages his upping-of-the-stakes moment with a jolt of energy that spurs a wickedly fun second half, boasting surprising ties to the minutiae of the MCU that reach right back to the franchise beginnings. Not only that, but Far From Home unexpectedly delivers the series' most thrillingly mind-bending imagery since Doctor Strange had his third eye opened by The Ancient One.
Despite everything else going on, Far From Home charmingly never loses sight of Peter's quest to ask out MJ. The couple's would-be-romance is sweet and endearing, but not sickly in the slightest - and Zendaya shines, dropping razor-wire zingers with deadpan delight. Tom Holland remains a note-perfect Spider-Man - still funnier and more believably teenage than Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield's incarnations. While Far From Home finds him desperate to take the weight of the world off his shoulders, Holland never loses the ebullient spark that makes him one of the MCU's most endearing figures.
Far From Home is a looser film than Homecoming, with pacing that occasionally slackens, and a compulsion to give every minor character time to shine. But it's a light-footed summer blockbuster that faces Endgame's monolithic legacy head-on, before leaving it behind to embark on its own globetrotting adventure. The MCU doesn't need a new Iron Man yet - Far From Home proves it's more than safe in the web-slinging hands of Spider-Man.
It's not quite the home-run of Homecoming, but Far From Home isn't far from matching it, with heaps of humour, energetic action, and the answers Endgame left you craving.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
201,ericrnolan,"A review of ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" (2019)",8,12 July 2019,"""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" (2019) is a fun enough Marvel movie; based on my own enjoyment, I'd rate it an 8 out of 10. It's got the same qualities as almost all the other films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - fun, humor and great special effects housed within a remarkably well constructed shared universe. This mostly standalone adventure is definitely one of the MCU's campier outings, but I think that most viewers will find it a welcome break after the last two high-stakes, apocalyptic ""Avengers"" films. (You may have heard of them.)It's also a great film to appeal to comic fans who are younger adults. The humor usually works, and the characters are nicely relatable. Peter's peers and teachers are all engaging enough on their own, and make a good group of supporting characters. I know most fans have commented how much they like Ned, and I do too - but I think the MCU's biggest improvement in this part of the mythos is the character of M.J. She is vastly different from her comic book progenitor, but in good ways. She's dry, sardonic and slightly dark, and she's extremely well played by Zendaya. I don't imagine that many fans will agree with me here, but I personally find this character to be a lot more likable and compelling than the MCU's Peter Parker.And that brings me to my largest concern about the new ""Spider-Man"" films. Their version of Peter is sometimes frustrating. I don't think it's the fault of Tom Holland, who brings a nice amount of energy and personality to the role. I think it's the fault of the screenwriters, who have made the character so doltish, boyish and eager-to-please that it's occasionally annoying. He sometimes seems more like a middle school student than an advanced high school student. (Isn't he supposed to be a senior here?) The writers seem to want to counter-balance the character's high intelligence with a humanizing flaw, and they seem to want to contrast young Peter with the older, more seasoned Avengers lineup. All of that makes perfect sense, but I do think they go a little overboard.I'm willing to go on record here and say that I prefer Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man."" His trilogy between 2002 and 2007 had more heart, more devotion to heroic archetypes, and greater attention character depth and detail. (I still think that 2004's outstanding ""Spider-Man 2"" is one of the best comic book movies ever made.) There are advantages, too, to depicting an iconic superhero that doesn't inhabit a shared universe - you spend more time exploring the character than exploring their context in relation to others.Still, I'd recommend ""Spider-man: Far From Home."" Like I said, it was a fun movie.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
202,Mike_Devine,Far from a masterpiece but packs a punch,6,26 November 2019,"In the post-'Endgame' Marvel era, it's easy to view everything through a different lens. Is there really anything beyond the events of the biggest film of 2019? In 'Spider-man: Far From Home,' we get a glimpse into what we're going to be seeing in future MCU efforts.'Home' dusts itself off from the events of the last 'Avengers' go-round fairly easily as it doesn't so much focus on the past as it does look to the future. We're once again taken on a wild ride through the adolescent battleground that is high school, as Peter Parker/Spider-man (reprised once again by Tom Holland) joins his misfit peers on a European class trip. What could possibly go wrong?While 'Home' does a solid job of injecting lightheartedness into what could otherwise be a pretty dark outing, it's not all fun and games. Holland's Parker deals with his one-sided relationship with MJ (again played by Zendaya) while trying to uphold his ""must defend humanity"" mandate in the wake of a mysterious new superpower named Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal). The film is entertaining at face value but sort of stumbles and fails to make an impact as a ""must see"" entry in Marvel's library. Even with an extended final sequence, the increased action doesn't do much to help the film's cause.'Spider-man: Far From Home' is far from a masterpiece, but it helps kick things off with a bang in this new chapter.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

204,thomasjay-2201,Far from home but close to Marvel's best,8,3 September 2019,"Personally up their at the tip of the MCU the second solo spider man film in this continuity delivered on everything I'd hoped for. In terms of scale it felt so vast and action packed making for a brisk watch despite its fairly long run time. There's a case for it being perhaps the most impactful solo film in the marvel universe and certainly felt as such, sending the character through various turmoils to come out changed at the end. Gyllenhaal was a personal highlight and the villain felt well motivated if a little contrived/shoehorned into this world, throw in a mind blowing Mysterio illusion scene and various callbacks to prior films in the MCU and you're left with this really enjoyable product! For all it's positives it can't escape flaws and does have certain issues, Ned as a character is neglected for the sake of MJ and in a way the humour dips as a payment for this but aside from a few other minor niggles there's little else wrong. Packing a reveal that could be hugely impactful for the fate of future marvel films I'd argue it's not only a must see but one of the best in the whole 20+ films currently released.

208,Puroo,Enjoyable,9,18 June 2021,"After Endgame, I thought the Marvel Cinematic Universe has ended. I didn't know the meaning of culmination back then. I used to think it means the final movie. So when I heard about Spider-Man: Far From Home releasing, I thought it's just gonna be to show from the perspective of one superhero as to how life has changed since the reverse snap. Since Endgame was 3 hours long they couldn't exactly show much about it from the point of view of the civilians, this movie could do it much better. After all, it's about Peter going to Europe (a place other than America) for a trip.The only reason why I watched this movie is because it's Spider-Man. If it were any other superhero I'd have skipped it. Turns out it's a lot better than what everyone was saying it to be. There are a lot of things I liked about this movie, mainly Spider-Man himself. I really like Tom Holland's Spider-Man because of how much developed his suit is. Even if he just leaves his body idle the suit will allow him to continue fighting on his own. All those web mods are very interesting. I have talked about it in depth in my Spider-Man: Homecoming review so I don't feel like writing it again.The movie really panders on the emotions for those who were fans of Iron Man. He has multiple references everywhere, since he was the mentor of Peter. Peter gets Tony's glasses as a gift from him which allow him to see many digital stuff. It actually draws many parallels between Tony and Peter, as to how they were both geniuses who have an AI-operated suit that helps them fight intensely powerful bad guys. Peter always looked up to Tony as his mentor, and in this movie it has been shown very appropriately.Another thing this movie has shown very well is the life after the reverse snap. Many of our questions get answered over here. What happened to the people who came back is answered, how people are reacting, and most importantly what is to come for the Avengers. Iron Man, Black Widow, Captain America, Thor, Black Panther, Captain Marvel - all of them are gone now. Only Spider-Man can be in contact of the Avengers in case a threat is to come on earth. And this brings me to why Mysterio is a good villain in this movie.Ever since the snap people have been traumatised. There could be any amount of danger coming in from any place and of any intensity. Seeing some monsters in Europe was enough to scare the people, and Mysterio used this opportunity to portray himself as the hero. Even Spider-Man became his fan seeing his work. Although he did learn about the truth later, Mysterio continued to be brave. The focus over here was to target Peter's friends and not the world. The stakes here were completely different.Normally whenever there are any threats for a superhero, it's always on a big level: Someone is attacking the city, a family is in danger or the villain wants to take over the world. Here, however, the stakes are that Peter's friends are in danger. Since we have seen them for so long, we had grown fond of them. A threat to them will mean a lot more to us than the threat to a European city. And that's exactly what happens in this movie. This is the kind of a fresh air this movie is able to provide after the events of Avengers: Endgame.In my opinion this should have been the last MCU movie. The end of the franchise is that everyone now knows who Spider-Man is and all the other Avengers have left earth. So now Peter has become the next Tony. It would have been a huge turnaround since Iron Man, as that movie was the one which showed for the first time that a hero doesn't need to hide their identity. This is a fun movie that can be enjoyed even if one hasn't watched Endgame, since everyone knows about the snap at this point.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
209,shawneofthedead,"There might be a few growing pains here and there, but Marvel has hit another home run!",8,2 July 2019,"THE LOW-DOWN: There's a lot riding on the slim, young shoulders of everyone's friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man. Far From Home is the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) since the recent double-whammy of Avengers movies changed the status quo forever. Where does the most successful superhero franchise in the world go after this? Can non-legacy superheroes - like Spider-Man, Black Panther, Captain Marvel etc - carry on where Iron Man left off? Is the MCU running out of steam? It's a big burden for a relatively smaller film in the franchise to carry. But Far From Home does so very well by zeroing in on what has successfully fuelled the MCU thus far: prizing character development above all to tell a story that's as emotional as it is entertaining.
THE STORY: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is trying to find his bearings in an unsettled world. He, along with half his school-mates, has suddenly reappeared on Earth - unaged and not at all dead - five years after the Snap. His mentor, Tony Stark, haunts him in the form of video tributes and street art. There's something strange going on between Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) and Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), Tony's Head of Security. Amidst the uncertainty, all Peter wants is to get back to normal: to enjoy his school trip to Europe, and to let MJ (Zendaya) know how he really feels about her. But world-saving duties wait for no young man. Suddenly, Peter is roped in by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to do battle alongside Quentin Beck a.k.a. Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal), taking down rogue Elementals that have already ravaged one world and are hellbent on destroying another.THE GOOD: At its best, Far From Home impressively blends the awkward comedy of a coming-of-age romantic drama with country-hopping superhero action thrills. It's a delight to watch Peter use his superhuman skills as Spider-Man to navigate his way through hormonal messes of his own making - often in the same scene. This is as intriguing a narrative direction as the MCU has ever taken: using a lighter, more humorous lens to examine the aftermath of Endgame's darker, considerably more mature themes. At the same time, Far From Home finds a rather ingenious way to quietly become one of the MCU's most political films. (More on this later.) It's worth noting, too, that, in a franchise filled with sublime casting coups, Holland continues to prove himself to be one of its very best. He dances nimbly through Peter's high-school misadventures, while still tapping into the heartbroken, traumatised core of his character.THE NOT-SO-GOOD: With the action focused so squarely on Peter, his friends - especially his love interest - invariably suffer. Jacob Batalon is as goofily charming as ever as Ned, Peter's best friend, but he might as well have the words 'comic relief' tattooed across his forehead. Zendaya's sparky, sarcastic MJ - while still an interesting twist on a classic character - comes dangerously close to being a damsel in distress. And, while Jon Watts' direction is more zippy and confident than it was on Homecoming, he doesn't always land or weave narrative beats together very effectively. As a result, the film occasionally sags when it should soar.ONE OF LIFE'S GREAT MYSTERIOS: What is Gyllenhaal - indie movie darling and theatre thespian - doing in an MCU movie? It might seem like one of life's great mysteries... but all will soon come clear once you realise just what drew him to the part of Quentin Beck. Fans of the comics will know that there's far more to the character than what we saw in the trailers, but nothing will prepare them for how brilliantly he's been reinvented for the MCU. Essentially, this is a gift of a role for the prodigiously gifted Gyllenhaal - allowing him to play every shade of hero (including a few notes of uncanny similarity to Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark), while also indulging his more whimsical, theatrical side. In retrospect, it's easy to see how Gyllenhaal must have been drawn to the grim relevance of Quentin's storyline to the world in which we live today. Just as Black Panther examined race and Captain Marvel explored toxic masculinity, Far From Home asks audiences to think about the concepts of truth and reality - at a time when both are very much under threat.FAN FARE: Marvel has trained us all well - never leave the theatre before the credits stop rolling, for fear of missing a funny moment or a narrative nugget that hints at future films and storylines. This reaches a new level of necessity with Far From Home. Each mindblowing scene - one midway through and one at the very end of the credits - is vital to knowing (or, at least, guessing) where the MCU is going next. Also, watch out for one of Tony Stark's beloved A.I. acronyms: it will apply, in a subversively clever way, to more than one character in the film, drawing laughs in one instance, and eliciting a deep sense of foreboding in another.RECOMMENDED? Absolutely. There might be a few growing pains here and there, but Marvel has hit another home run - grappling effectively and emotionally with its immediate past, while raising the storytelling stakes for the future.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
210,DeBBss,A Good Sequel to Homecoming,7,7 April 2021,"Wow, this movie completely caught me off guard. While I was watching, I was like, why is the first act so terrible, but then the twist happened. I am so glad that the Elementals weren't the actual villains. Mysterio is the actual villain, who uses holograms and drones to make it seem like he's the hero by defeating the Elementals. I love and hate this idea. I love it because it offers a villain that's smart and unique, I hate it because it ruined the Mysterio character. I couldn't wait to get more exposition about Mysterio; where does his power come from? What is that green smoke? Why is there a fish bowl on his head? Mysterio is one of the coolest characters I've seen in the MCEU, his powers and suit were so interesting, and to find out that it was all a fraud was disappointing.Otherwise, I liked the story, even though it relied on a ton of plot convenience. It was entertaining even when there was no action going on. And when there was action, it was very, very good; it has some of the more unique action scenes in the MCEU. I think the weakest part about Spider-Man: Far from Home are the characters. There were two things that ruined them. First, most of the characters had no dimension. They had a specific character trait, and that was the only shred of personality. Second, the comedy. I think there was too much comedy that it ruined the personalities. Everybody in this film is comedic, and since everybody is comedic, nobody is different.I think Spider-Man: Far from Home is a good watch. But I see too many 10/10s. Spider-Man: Far from Home has plenty of issues: the simplistic characters, the weak first act, and the comedy overkill.

214,x_manicure_x,Decent for its target audience,5,14 August 2021,"""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" is your average Marvel Studios summer movie, a lighter note to wash off the bitterness of ""Avengers: Endgame"". It definitely tries harder than ""Homecoming"" but kind of fails at being as genuine and fun.Everything is forcefully brought on a parodic level, and Peter Parker's love interest and teenage problems stick to tired archetypes we've seen hundreds of times in much smaller productions. Most jokes don't land, and everything that happened on that school trip is just too forced even for a teenage movie (oh my god that bus scene).The first half of the film felt like a trivial Disney Channel drama from the early 2000s, but things start to get into the right mood after the kind of obvious plot twist. Gyllenhaal's Mysterio is not the same character as the comics but was unexpectedly spot-on. I hated him as he fought the ""Elementals"" and acted as the corny superhero from another dimension, but after his true intentions are unveiled it all made sense. He was a fun and charismatic villain, as arrogant and over the top as needed. The scenes he tricks Spidey with visual effects and shapeshifting were also pretty cool.

director: Jon Watts
starring: Tom Holland,Zendaya,John Favreu,Samuel L jackson,Cobie smoulders,Jake Gyllenhaal,Marisa Tomae,Jacob Batalon,Tony Revolori,Angori Rice etcoverall rating 93/100wow this film was fantastic one of the strongest entries in the MCU and it really shows marvel is mastering and improving its craft after every film.First of all the film referenced and went deep into the aftermath and effects of avengers endgame. I loved the little things that they added linking to endgame things like it all being called the blip and people not ageing. And also the toll it had on peter parker and happy really showed during the film and this was the perfect film and character for the film after endgame.Next the film was hilarious. This was perhaps one of the most funny films in the MCU. Whether it was all the college kids antics with each other. By the way the standout for me was Tony Revorelli his constant posting of the horrible events happening on social media bought relatability to the film but also a lot of humour as how he reacted was exactly the same as a normal persons would be. And also MJ ( zendaya) was hilarious just her surprisingly dark one liners and quirky personality really made me laugh.Next the film had excellent plot twists and set up future films really well. I thought the plot twist of Mysterio faking being a hero was executed brilliantly and they went into excellent detail in explaining these. I also admittedly found both the end credit scenes shocking when mysterio told everyone who spider man was and framed him for his dirty work it was a big twist which should set up a future spider man film really well.Next the film had excellent narrative character development. Firstly with peter parker,secondly with peter and MJ and thirdly with peter and mysterio. The first point is that the film really felt like a transition of character and personality for spider man as he accepted more responsibility and got in touch with his sensitive side with relationships and friendships so this showed a great character growth. Next the character development between peter and MJ was great to see the film was not just an action film but a romcom as well which was a nice change of tone for marvel. Seeing peter try and win over MJ was very sweet and you were really rooting for peter and MJ really grew as a character as well as she showed off her cleverness by finding out that peter is spider man and when they finally kissed at the end it just made me feel so good whilst watching. And finally it was so nice at first to see the character development between peter and mysterio. Before he turned bad Mysterios. character was surprisingly likeable and to see him be like a father figure to peter was really nice to see as it gave peter someone to talk to about ""superhero stuff"" when he most needed it.Next i loved how they gave new characters more of a spotlight. I am specifically highlighting Marisa Tomae, Tony Revolori and Angori rice. Who all bought a different flavour and tone to the school trip and certainly made it more relatable to the audience. I just liked how they did not just keep it to a few characters and actually added depth and character development to a wider cast.However i do just have two little nit picks. Firstly i found Peters friend Ned ( Jacob Batalon) to be frustrating at times. I just felt he tried to hard to be something he wasn't in the film and his whole relationship with Angori Rice was just incredibly cringey to me. And finally i personally think they made the character of spider man to technology based. I get that he was trying to be more like iron man due to the close bond they shared when he was alive but for me adding so much technology to his character really took away some of the charm and impressiveness of spider man as a whole.However ending on my final two positives. Firstly the film had amazing action sequences. Marvel always find ways to become more visually creative with every film and many action sequences within this felt fresh and not recycled. All the scenes involving the elementals and Mysterio were especially fun. Highlighting also that the fake reality mysterio created also made for some stunning action sequences that were incredible to watch on par with spiderverse. And secondly the film had a fantastic cast for the lead roles. Firstly Jake Gyllenhaal was fantastic within the film. He just has a natural charm within his acting that makes you connect with his character straight away. But my main praise is to Tom Holland and Zendaya. Zendaya bought a unique twist to the character of MJ which was very welcomed and also done to match Peters personality. And finally Tom Holland has to be the best spider man there is he has such charm and charisma on screen and connects with the other actors and characters that he is just a joy to watch and he had a relatable charm to his character that really made you root for his pursuit of MJ.Overall Spider man far from home is definitely one of the stronger films within the MCU and really proves that marvel is changing and evolving in a good way.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

218,gavinp9,"Good, without being spectacular/'Into The Spider-Verse'",7,4 July 2019,"'Spider-Man: Farm From Home' is the second ""new""/MCU and Tom Holland's fifth time playing Spider-Man/Peter Parker. It's a good follow-up to 'Endgame', in that it doesn't ignore what happened, but chooses to focus on this group of teenagers getting on with their lives. The romance between Peter and MJ (Zendaya) is funny, because they're supposed to be awkward teens, but are actually both 22 - as are Ned (Batalon) and Flash (Revolori), both back as the wisecracking friends. Also worth a mention are the comedic support offered by the teachers - Mr Harrington (Starr) and Mr Dell (Smoove) - with plenty of great little momentsIt's also good to see Nick Fury (Jackson), Maria Hill (Smulders), Aunt May (Tomei) and Happy Hogan (Favreau) back, linking this nicely with other MCU films, but also hitting home how important Tony Stark was to Spider-Man. Bascially, after 'Endgame', Peter just wants to go on his European science trip/holiday (what type of school does he go to!?) and not worry about ""superhero-ing"" for a while. Obviously, things don't go to plan, as he teams up with Mysterio (Gyllenhaal), who has Dr Strange-like powers, to beat ""elementals"" - giant fire/water/earth creatures.Obviously, if you know anything of Mysterio from the comics, all's not what it seems. The illusions and CGI-within-CGI is expertly done and some of the best scenes in the film. Love Peter's black & red suit at the end. Every character gets enough screen time, but there's definitely some slow moments where not too much happens. Pretty satisfactory ending, with a great final battle and it's definitely worth staying for both credit scenes.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Am really grading this movie compared to the first five horrible ones in the series, so I'm being generous. I found it a bit tedious at first and wasn't liking it until I recalled what Mysterio was about. The only things I didn't like was how the Snap/Blip affected the story, which honestly, should have been ignored or, TBH, the Avengers should only have said it happened a very short time to prevent any issues.The Eurotrip was lame. It was very obvious the production got ministry of tourism dollars to showcase tourist attractions and events in each city. Everything pretty much took place in the center of the cities near sites tourists flock too. In one shot of London, you can even make out the restaurant that scene near the end of Mission Impossible 5 took place.Spider-man was dumbed down a lot. There were just a lot of scenes where Peter Parker did the dumbest thing imaginable in spite of knowing better. The villain was just not as intimidating or compelling as the Vulture was. Much of the villain and his tactics seemed like a retread, possibly because this script was rushed.The acting was the strong point of the film. Excellent performances from everyone involved, which was a weak point of the previous franchises. I really would love to see The Green Goblin or Hobgoblin in the next film, which probably will happen since it likely will be Holland's last film, but I could see him easily doing five at this rate.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

He also embodies Spidey's mix of self-doubt, strength and humour.Mysterio's introduction (Jake Gyllenhaal) brings some mystical elements to the normally down-to-earth Spider-universe. It's done well, doesn't feel out of place, and leads to some wonderful fight scenes between Spidey and Mysterio.In the Marvel tradition, it's essential to stick around for the two post-credit scenes.

Second Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Spider-Man - Far From Home. I assume by now that everyone has seen Avengers End Game, but if this is not the case I shall make sure there are no spoilers. Tom Holland, who is my favourite Spider-man to date, returns as the 'sticky' superhero (His word, not mine). Following the events of the previous summer, Peter Parker is travelling to Europe on a school trip where he wants to be normal and plans to woo the girl he fancies, but hey this is the Marvel Universe and events and Nick Fury most definitely conspire to thwart those plans. Enter Jake Gyllenhaal, who I believe nearly played the red and blue web wielding super hero himself when Toby Maguire injured his back whilst filming Seabiscuit. He finally gets his little piece of Marvel magic playing a new superhero, Mysterio. Being a Marvel film I sat through the credits and was amazed to see the units involved making this movie came from London, New York, Canada, Czech Republic and even Australia, taking the Marvel Movieverse truly global. Sad not to see the Stan Lee cameo but heartened to see a dedication to the great man in the credits.

227,dommercaldi,"Fun Little Marvel Film With Some Cute Moments, But Largely Forgettable",7,12 April 2020,"Pros:
1. The CGI looks great. It's possible that it won't age well, but for now, it looks great.
2. The film leads off from Avengers: Endgame (2019) superbly. Peter Parker/ Spider-Man (Tom Holland) deals constantly with living up to his mentor Tony Stark/ Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) expectations and his legacy.
3. Jake Gyllenhaal (Quentin Beck/ Mysterio) and Tom Holland give great performances.
4. The characters of Mr. Harrington (Martin Starr) and Mr. Dell (J. B. Smoove) serve as really good comedic relief and they are really good comedic duo.
5. The action sequences, for the most part, are entertaining to watch.
6. The entire scene involving Quentin Beck/ Mysterio tricking Peter Parker/ Spider-Man into giving up his friends is visually stunning, mesmerising, and is just terrific cinema rarely found in a Marvel movie.
7. There are a couple really nice, and appropriately handled, call-backs to previous Marvel films. For example, the blasting out of 'Back in Black' by AC/ DC which calls back to Iron Man (2008), and J. K. Simmons reprising his role as J. Jonah Jameson which calls back to the Sam Raimi Spider-Man trilogy.Cons:
1. The camera shots are too close. The movie markets itself as being ""far from home"" and is set in beautiful cities such as Venice and Prague, yet the camera never pulls back to provide the viewer with some beautiful shots.
2. The whole sequence where Peter Parker/ Spider-Man accidentally sets drones on Brad Davis (Remy Hii) to stop him from sending a compromising image to MJ (Zendaya), is utterly pointless, moronic, and boring.
3. The romance between MJ and Peter Parker/ Spider-Man is forced and the movie acts like it's an ongoing romance, even though it wasn't set up at all in the first film.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

230,movieman6-413-929510,Europe,7,2 July 2019,"Spider-Man: Far from Home is the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming from 2017 and the sequel to the events in the latest Avengers movie Avengers Endgame from a few months ago. This film is again directed by Jon Watts, who also directed Spider-Man: Homecoming.In the film, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) goes on holiday to Europe with his classmates. Here Peter tries to leave his superhero role as Spider-Man behind him and tries to get a chance with MJ (Zendaya).
Unfortunately, Peter is still disturbed during his vacation by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), who tells him about mysterious attacks in various European countries. Nick Furt investigates and collaborates with Quentin Beck (Jake Gyllenhaal), who himself also fights against the dangers of the elements as a hero under the name Mysterio. Spider-Man must now work with Mysterio to defeat these elements and protect European countries.This film takes place again as a real Spider-Man film where it starts with the teenage life of Peter Parker and all the teenage problems that teenagers now also have to deal with. In addition to his normal teenage problems, Peter also deals with the problems of his superhero identity as a Spider-Man. Because Peter is trying to take a vacation from his superhero work, this film starts as a romantic comedy. Apart from some action in the beginning, the real action starts in the middle of the film when Spider-Man meets Mysterio.
This structure of the film gives smaller characters a little more chance to come out better in the film. A little work can also be done on the relationship between Peter and MJ. For example, they have been able to properly divide the roles of Peter Parker and Spider-Man in this film.The film is again filled with many comic moments, but especially in the beginning they choose to make too little use of the comedy. Many of the extra characters, such as the teachers who went with the students, create smaller comic moments that unfortunately do not always appeal to the audience.The effects in the film also look good. The elemental creatures that Spider-Man and Mysterio are fighting against appear beautiful and credible. They also make good use of the different European locations where the story takes place.The acting work is also done well. Tom Holland portrays the characters of Peter Parker and Spider-Man well in this film. He also knows how to play well with the emotions of these characters and especially after the events in Avengers Endgame. Together with Zendaya, he also has good chemistry. Together they set up a relationship in a realistic manner, as can be the case with teenagers. Jake Gyllenhaal also performs well as Mysterio and Quentin Beck. It's special and nice to finally see Mysterio again in a Spider-Man movie. It is also nice to see Jake Gyllenhaal in a Spider-Man movie, because for the 2004 Spider-Man 2 movie, Jake Gyllenhaal could have replaced the Spider-Man actor of those movies after Tobey had an accident on a film set of the film Seabiscuit.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
231,Apollo15AnnoPianoCatDogSnailAnt,": Vibrant enough and breezy, and these Illusory worlds",2,22 April 2020,"1. This movie deals with Illusions. I would place here that it is ingeniously made. The part of Spiderman in Illusions are really fantastical looking. It's like a movie within a movie. Those moments of Spiderman in those illusions could be done even more. Like they could have him in some fairytale world and he would be tripped out. What we get is cool though. There is a lot of Spidey swinging battling stuff that is overload of objects in the air but instead of that I would replace it with even more illusions for Spiderman to be in, because those sequences appear hypnotic and is really the main meal of the movie. The badguy is cleverly revealed which is really interesting.2. This is by now the next in line in this interconnected Marvel cinema uni and by now they are referencing like numerous other Superheroes and events from like the movies like the previous Avengers and also Team Cap/Team Iron Man prior to that. It is ingenious that they weave the core of this entire plot from something from the event Team Cap/Team Iron Man. The one thing though is having characters from other Marvel movies in here too much like Fury and Stark's friend Happy. I personally read the comics and stuff like this did occur with cameos and crossovers so I don't know how I am *sensing* about this for a movie and the only contrasts is basically every other superhero movie aside from MCU how it's just like the title characters and no other cameos. It's relatively a new thing doing this for the movies from what has been going on in the comics. Oh now I know, if they're going to do those I would choose someone better than Fury or Happy. I mean for Pete sakes (haha) they keep wheeling out these characters. They could get numerous other characters. ENOUGH of the same people. The Nick Fury character is actually the James Bond of the comics and battles villains like Hatemonger who causes peace touting Hippies to go batshyt from his ring-looking space station and Fury has to annihilate him. In these movies he is zzzzzzzz. Reasons are since these are money funded movies and not the panels: contracts, paychecks, names in the industry and have a say to be in this.3. The tech use here. There's loads of Iron Man technology being utilized and it's like what do they want to do either make a true street level Spiderman but they keep wheeling out advanced planes, drones, from Iron Man's techwizardry. People use cellphones so much it's a given all those smartphones for the simplest of things. Though he does actually ask someone's cellphone to use FINALLY. They are morphing the character and making it their own thing for the movie fine.I pop open a Dr. Pepper can while they're also at a bar prior to something of a pivotal scene ah so good which is like whoa synchronization.

the final in phase three dc film picks up after the endgame events and it's more of a comedy a fact that we expected in most of the recent dc films.
at least we get to have a few of laughs here and there.
no matter this movie was hilarious.....full of twists and constant action.....great CGI effects a cute love story...a classic pop corn gem which is worth more to watch it in a theater than in your home.
An imax choice is even a better choice to watch this.
I grew up with the first 1990s spiderman trilogy and I will always love those films more the first spiderman actor was the real spiderman for me and I was in love with the actress who played his love interest.
if those two actors were in this movie I would have rated higher but anyways the love story of this spiderman is also kind of...enjoyable.
if u want to have a good time with your kids take them to see this movie...they will love it.....as for us adults we will not be....thrilled like the kids but we will enjoy the film in most part.

This film took the comic book stories we know, and used them against us, with such deceitful mastery, that it is almost impossible to not applaud the gambit.Though Spider-Man was without his repartee in this installment, I do feel however that Watts may have just delivered perhaps the most accurate Spider-Man to date, and we got the Spider Sense, aka ""Peter-Tingle"", which was brought into this film in a way that felt necessary, instead of just in a manner that was meant to let us know that to be one of Spider-Man's abilities.Far From Home isn't perfect, but it's not far from perfect. What this movie did right, it did so right that it was outright magnificent, and what it got wrong, it just got wrong.Spider-Man: Far From Home is undoubtedly one of the MCU's most inspired entries, and one of its leading sequels.

It feels like the villain necessarily has to throw him many softballs in order for him to survive. Unfortunately this does take some of the tension away from the film, but a curveball at the end helps keep us wondering how Spidey will deal with the heightened stakes ahead.Perhaps there is a lack of dramatic tension, but luckily the film keeps things light anyway with a cheeky score, vivid colors and an endearing teenage relatability with the simple can't-be-messed question of ""will Peter Parker get to kiss the girl?""Sam Raimi's Spiderman movies will always have a special place in my heart, but Spider-Man: Far From Home does catch up in terms of being a coming of age story albeit in a much lighter and unconcerned fashion.

249,namob-43673,2nd best superhero movie of the last couple of years,8,28 October 2019,"I believe this to be the best Spider-man movie ever made, it is also a very good movie. This is funny, exciting, have a couple of nice little love stories, and its a nice callback to the comics the movie is based on.I am also very happy that we got 2 good superhero movies this year, and consequently 2 good ones the last two years or so. Ragnarök was one of the worst movies of all time, Black Panther was boring, Infinity War was just a high-speed better acted transformers movie, and Endgame sucked big time. Thankfully we got the Brielliant Captain Marvel and this Spider-Man movie, both showing us that Marvel can still make good movies as long as Russo brothers do not make them.Spider-man far from home is not as fantastic as Cap Marvel was, but it is still a very good superhero movie and I highly recommend.I give this 8/10. Far from Home lack a bit in logic here and there, I had a hard time buying into all the villains motivations, and the first mid-credit scene felt too convoluted. I also think this movie do not have a very good music score, which matters in these types of movies.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
250,GomezAddams666,Here comes the Spider-Man!,10,7 July 2019,"It is no secret that my All-Time Favorite comic book character is Spider-Man. No matter how much I love other characters, the Friendly-Neighborhood wall crawler will always be my favorite, and I mean the one TRUE Spider-Man, Peter Parker.This movie has tons of surprises and reviewing it without spoiling is hard but I will say it is by far one of the best MCU entries thus far and of the best Spidey movies I have ever seen. While we have seen Peter Parker in at least nine movies, Tom Holland keeps proving he is the best of them all, this film feels like ripped off from the Marvel Comic pages, it is true to the source and it is nothing short of amazing.It has a talented cast, a great story, lots and lots of humor and amazing connections to the larger MCU that will pull emotional strings you did not know you had.The filmmakers have truly given us an ""Amazing"" Spider-Man film and I cannot be fair if I don't rate this a 10/10.After Marvel's Avengers: Endgame this movie had a lot to prove and it did. It even had me singing ""look out, there comes the Spider-Man!""",Spider-Man - Far from Home
251,skip-98756,"Painfully Bad, Not the Spiderman we all know and love.",1,16 September 2019,"This was the worst rendition of spiderman in the entire series, at least for me..It was painfully bad to sit through and I actually had to break it up into 2 nites of watching ,as it was just to hard to sit thru 2hrs of it all at once..To me, toby mcquire IS spiderman, that guy just nailed it and noone has done it as well since..Garfields spidey was also Very good but not as good as the original... Unfortunately, Hollands portrayal falls very flat..It lacks the character and is missing depth and dimension..Holland comes across as a whiny schoolkid who just happens to have superpowers ..Maryjane in these films played by the black chick is utterly and completely lacking in Any chemistry with Tom as spidey... zitlch, nada, nothing there at all..Previous films ,even those with Garfield had maryjanes who were Connecting with spidey and had an emotional bond.. its so lacking with the current ""politically correct"" casting that its nonexistant anymore..
Compare this fiasco with previous movies ..look at the relationships with maryjane, aunt may, uncle ben, Harry, ect and look at what its become now..Bickering schoolkids with no depth at all..As for the villian, Mysterio was just weak and the reliance on tech for illusion theme was a letdown for me...The effects dragged on and on and I hate to say I was bored senseless with todays special effects cgi, but in this instance, I truly was and did not find it enjoyable at all...Look at the incredible spiderman 2 movie with Doc Oct and tell me how this new spiderman is even worthy to bear the name? utterly silly outfits with insect arms coming out of it , Come on! the suit in the earlier movies was perfection and didnt need to be messed with...it was like seeing a cartoon come to real life.... Todays crazy techy suits look just ....ridiculous...If a movie Ever needed to be Rebooted, yet again, its this one...Erase it from memory and find an actor worthy and capable of the role..Get back to its roots and start again...Anything would be better than continuing this abomination in its current form...",Spider-Man - Far from Home
252,LukeCustomer2,Sony hired some people to give 10 start reviews.,4,29 March 2020,"It isn't that it is a bad film but it isn't great. First, by taking spiderman out of new york it really diminishes the character. Half of spiderman's appeal is being a friendly neighborhood spiderman. Secondly, the bad guys here are all wrong. Spiderman is ill equipped to fight the ""elementals"" -- what is he going to do, web water to death? Nevermind the fact he can't fight too hard because his friends will see him in Europe which, happens at the end -- ugh. So the idea he was recruited for this mission was glaring. Mysterio was imho, bad. He had no real motivation other than a thin one the writers gave him and then, also, his plan made no sense. Apparently the plan is to fool the world into thinking he was a super hero. Well, what happens when a real super bad guy comes and or any old disaster at all? Nick Fury was utterly wasted here. Yes we find out later he might not be what he seems but the character was off the entire movie so that is uncomfortable. This movie was a first draft of a movie. Perhaps hastily put into production or left vague due to endgame. IMHO this was the first crack in the armor of Marvel. I think they are starting to buy their PR and thinking they can produce subpar work as long as it gets out there.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
253,CabbageCustard,"Much better than its predecessor, Spider-Man Homecoming",8,4 October 2019,"Finally! After the dreary Captain Marvel and the disappointing, turgid Avengers: Endgame, the people who make Marvel movies have got their mojo back and made a movie that is fun, exciting and enjoyable. The first movie in this rebooted Spider-Man franchise was OK but less than spectacular, but this movie gets everything back on track.This is the first Marvel movie since the annihilation of half the life in the universe by Thanos and its restoration five years later. The movie references that event in a very interesting way by noting that those who ceased to exist were restored in the same form they left, at the same age, while those who were not consigned to oblivion have aged 5 years. As one character notes, 'My little brother is now older than me!' That phenomenon strikes me as a very promising premise for another movie. The movie also honours the heroes who were lost in Avengers: Endgame. Unfortunately, it does so by using the excruciating Whitney Houston version of 'I Will Always Love You' as a backing track. Anyway, once we get past that, the movie swings into high gear and we get into the action and it hardly stops. This movie makes up for a lot of the flaws of Spider-Man Homecoming: the CGI is better, the story is genuinely exciting, the villain is more interesting, Tom Holland is more confident in the lead role and is very likeable, and even the dreary Zendaya loosens up and is more enjoyable. This movie still departs markedly from the canon of the comic books and Tom Holland is even more obviously NOT 16 years old, but I can live with that. One of the strengths of this movie is that it doesn't take itself too seriously, but it doesn't make a joke of its lead character or of what is happening. It gets the balance pretty well right. It also seems to be aimed at a younger audience than other Marvel movies and that adds to its sparkle.I'm not going to give away any plot points, but I will say that this movie does not lag like the few previous Marvel movies and the just over 2 hours running time passes quickly. You also won't be surprised to know that this movie sets itself up for a sequel and does so with a twist that will make you gasp. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens next.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
254,Eli_Elvis,By far the best Spider-Man Film,10,12 September 2019,"OF ALL TIME.Now why do I say this? I have despised all the Spider-Man films, maybe Rami's second one and I hate all the Disney Marvel films except for Infinity War.Disney and Sony managed to mangle some of the best characters created in human history. I said some. Disney has been doing it for a century and continue to do it with Star Wars.I'm not a fan of high school Peter Parker, but at least they did it right.This film had terrible Marketing. The next Iron-Man? I'm glad this was not the case. Spider-Man is Spider-Man, in the first good becoming a hero film since Donner's Superman 1.Some of us remember the awe of seeing a man fly for the first time, I know I do, and as I've aged I've enjoyed more adult themes (I despise campiness), because the sense of awe is never represented in these films. It's just a bunch of corporate losers behind a desk making bad decisions.I'm disappointed I didn't see this in the theaters. Disney's recent series of woke BS has turned me off. I don't even want to subject my kids to their nonsense.I'm glad Disney lost Spider-Man, at least they won't be able to taint this character. They've already destroyed Star Wars, The Hulk, and many more in the near future... Spider-Man at least is safe.I loved into the Spider-verse, Venom was terribly written and directed(typical Sony cheapness), but I really loved Far from Home.Job well done Sony! Keep the evil Mouse Away from this Spider!",Spider-Man - Far from Home
255,pensacolacomputer,Excellent movie,8,19 July 2019,"Spider-Man 2 in 2004 is still my favorite Marvel movie of all time. Spider-Man far from home is a close second. This movie had everything...action, adventure, comedy, mystery, suspense, and more....I was VERY surprised, as I was not expecting much from it but left the theater very satisfied....Very well done...Go see it!",Spider-Man - Far from Home
256,Lewis_Heather787,Very Surprising!,7,18 July 2019,"In all honesty I am not a Spiderman fan at all, can't tell you what it is about the character or the films I've just never really been into them. However I must say that after watching this new film, it surprised me a lot and actually made me interested in the character.........Finally I understand why people love this character!Tom Holland is great again, I think he has been great in all the other films Spiderman has appeared in the MCU but I'd go as far to say that this is almost the best. (He is very good in Infinity War). Peter Parker actually really evolves as character in this film trying to balance school with being a superhero. I was a bit shocked myself at how much I was intrigued by his story, fantastic writing along with Holland's performances.I have to say though the main reason I watched this film was to see Jake Gyllenhaal in a superhero film, to be honest I never thought I'd see the day but here we are. I'm not really surprised by the fact that he was fantastic in the role of ""Mysterio"". Although I had no problems with Gyllenhaal's performances I do have some issues with his character.......I'll touch on them in a bit.Other shoutouts should go to Zendaya, Samuel L Jackson, Jacob Batalon, Marisa Tomei, Jon Favreau and Angourie Rice.Last positive I have has to be some of the action scenes and in particular some of the special effects. Those illusion scenes with Spiderman and Mysterio are absolutely fantastic, Jon Watts what a brilliant idea. Those scenes genuinely left me speechless because they had everything......inventive, mysterious, tension, suspense and most of all emotion that hits hard. Just brilliant.Now I only have one negative that is sort of bugging me. As I mentioned earlier I do have a problem with Mysterio, when we find out who he really is.....its just a bit of a let down for me personally. Its him joined by a group of ex Tony Stark employees that are just projecting everything. The more disappointing thing was that I was buying Mysterio as the good guy which I suppose is the point. I must say I also buy him as the villain just as much. It just seemed really silly if I'm being honest. Nothing to do with the performances which were great but this part is just bugging me.Overall though I am very surprised to say that enjoyed watching a Spiderman film. Its 70% out of 100 or 7 out of 10 its surprisingly good and I'd say the best Spiderman film I've seen. Yes even better than ""Homecoming"" and this is coming from someone who didn't care about Spiderman before watching this film.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
257,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Is this review an illusion? Maybe...,7,2 July 2019,"I definitely enjoyed it, but I think less than Spider-man : Homecoming. Kind of similar to Guardians 2, it was very funny but sometimes that got too much in the way of hitting an emotional beat or realism. Like we're in an intense battle scene, but sure lets cut to a lady who is still steaming a cape. Or this was running gag of the class trip constantly being ""upgraded"". Like after the first attack, wouldnt they realistically send the kids home? Especially after the events of Infinity War/Endgame? And even when the decision does finally be made to go home, theres still an added ""But we'll tour around London first"". I get that they needed the plot to progress and they couldnt have Peter get on a plane and go back home so early in the movie...but I feel like they could have done something a bit more realistic to keep them there. Like their flights got cancelled or delayed and there effectively stuck. At least for a few days or whatever. It just felt like the danger they were in wasnt being treated seriously. The elevator almost crashing in Homecoming felt more serious and this movie its a way bigger threat. There was another scene in particular that was kind of dumb and honestly could have been cut out as it didnt really add anything. Like this new character takes a photo of Peter in an embarrassing situation and is going to use it against him. But it takes so long for this character to do anything about it. Its not like its the 90s and he needs to get his film developed. Why he didnt show the picture BEFORE getting on the bus, or send a text. Like its the modern age. If he wants this person to know about this picture....then show it. And I get that the filmmakers didnt want Peter's relationships to be effected...but again...why even put the scene there in the first place if the outcome wasnt going to change in any way? There was also another tiny moment towards the end where they tried to justify why Flash is the way he is...but I felt it didnt really add much either.That being said, there was still a lot to like. As I mentioned before, it was very funny and made me laugh a lot. Also, I love that as much as its a superhero story, it is also very much a teen/highschool movie. Some of my favourite moments were just of awkward Peter trying to figure out how he's gonna the tell a girl that he like her. Stuff like that. There are also some really cool and trippy visual scenes that made me think of Doctor Strange. I would just love to see the two of them go head to head. I thought Mysterio was a really cool villain and he definitely has shaken some things up. I didnt like that he wasnt as much as a Spidey foe, per se. I dont really want to give too much away. But overall cool villain. One of the better ones. Truly always thinking one step ahead. There are 2 after credits scenes, so stick around for both as there is some big implications for future movies.Overall, its fun. You're gonna like it. If I had to rank it somewhere....oooh boy....maybe somewhere between the 12-15 region. I know that may sound bad...but honestly the MCU rarely missteps and I enjoy them all. This was still a really solid fun flick.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

261,AdrenalinDragon,Post-Endgame Spidey swings on a good note,7,3 July 2019,"After Avengers: Endgame ended things pretty conclusively, there was uncertainty to how the Marvel Cinematic Universe would continue from Spider-Man: Far from Home onwards. Starting right after the events of Endgame, Far From Home explains exactly what happens when things went back to normal and focusing on Peter Parker getting back into his high school life again. Similar to Homecoming, Far From Home focuses a great deal on character development and scenes with Peter Parker and his friends more than the actual Superhero action stuff. I liked how the movie deals with the absence of a specific character and everyone trying to move on and get on with their lives. In a way, it acts more like an Epilogue to Endgame in that regard, but make no mistake this is a Spider-Man movie with some good humour and emotion that connects everything nicely.Far From Home is essentially a road trip movie mixed with Superhero stuff. Peter Parker and his friends go on a school trip to various locations with some personal shenanigans and issues happening as subplots. Peter bumps into a new Superhero named Mysterio, which Jake Gyllenhaal performs a rather hammy and charismatic role in it. He's definitely one of the best things going for Far From Home. I do have some issues with how his ""Powers"" exactly work and nobody else seems to find any flaws with him or his technology, but he does give us some interesting fights and visuals for a Marvel movie. There were definitely parts that looked cool from him and without spoiling it his motivations are a bit of a twist and spin on the usual Marvel Superheroes stuff we've seen so far.As for the other characters, Peter's best friend Ned is being his usual jokey self now tied to a new Romance subplot making things awkward for Peter, who is trying to win over MJ throughout the school trip. You really feel for Peter and him trying to connect with his other friends awkwardly while also having to juggle with his Spider-Man self. Peter continues to make sure he is never revealed to be Spider-Man, although it takes quite alot of suspension of disbelief that he takes off his mask in European towns and cities with not a single person noticing his real identity. Nick Fury and Happy Hogan get a good amount of screentime here too, and they both have nice little interactions with Peter Parker and his friends.Some problems I have with Far from Home is that it does feel a bit on the long side. Alot of the road trips changing locations that so happen to conveniently work out for Peter and his buddies feel a little far-fetched in places, and some of the logic and possible plot holes that are present are hard to ignore and you start thinking ""Why didn't that character just do that?"" or ""How did they not notice that at all?"" which can be a little distracting and making you question if it made any sense. Some of the jokes don't land too well and there's definitely a sense of retreading old ground a bit here and there. The visuals are mostly great, but there's a few that look a bit iffy. The music is fine, most of the acting is solid, and yeah it's good Post-Endgame start for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Overall, Spider-Man: Far from Home was decent, but nothing amazing for Marvel.6.5/10",Spider-Man - Far from Home
262,peeedeee-94281,Most of these 9 and 10 Reviews Were Written By Mysterio,3,3 July 2019,"After the enjoyable Captain Marvel and epic Avengers: End Game, I was expecting Marvel to keep the bar set high with the post-Infinity Stone adventure. Boy was I wrong!
Okay, first off, there is absolutely no chemistry between Peter Parker and his apparent love interest MJ. I don't feel any reason to root for either party to get together, it just seems like a dull plot point.
Second, I wasn't familiar with Mysterio, so I was expecting something bigger. I did know he pretends to be a good guy, and then turns. But wow, a disgruntled Stark employee? lol that was pretty bad. Not engaging or interesting in the least.
Then there was the humor, or attempts at it. Every line had to be a joke. Over and over, it got really tiresome.
The trickery and illusions also got tiresome. One thing that bothered me is that if they figure out Quentin is using special effects and holograms to distract and hurt Spider-man, why didn't they create special polarized spectacles or goggles for Spider-man?
Lastly, when you stay to the very end credits, the last scene is like a slap in the face. But it also points to a huuuuge fault in the film. So if they were testing Spider-man by having him fight Mysterio solo, and the real Nick Fury was lounging on vacation somewhere, what if Spider-man ended up getting hurt or killed? And why was Fury willing to let innocent people to get killed? At least we know why no other Avenger shows up in this film to help out Spider-man, but the reason for it seems really really lame.
Overall, a really disappointing entry into the Marvel universe. Some have said this is taking us into the new direction. Frankly, it seems like it's put it into FULL STOP.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

264,cgearheart,Solid Superhero Flick,7,17 July 2019,"For the most part, I can say I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, even though I knew pretty well what was going to happen. I knew it was going to be a lot of CGI and action, and what I was treated to in that category was very high quality and exciting. Jake Gyllenhal made for a formidable and utterly dastardly villain for the charming Holland. My complaint in this movie was Zendaya. No, it's not because of her race. I couldn't care less about that because I honestly think it's neat that they're trying to do something new with the characters (Ned is also a great example). My complaint with Zendaya's MJ is that she isn't MJ. They wrote her simply just to be an angsty, brooding, ""I'm so weird and quirky about my weirdness but also sarcastic but also cute and independent"" type girl that it just came across as really pretentious and honestly stupid. MJ is the popular and preppy girl who's pretty normal but also sassy and independent. I agree that Kirsten Dunst was no better because she was literally always screaming and freaking out like a 12 year old, but is there no grey area with this character? Hate me all you want but that annoyed me.B",Spider-Man - Far from Home
265,sirwillisiv,A fast-paced and charming romp...,9,9 July 2019,"Upped is the action, comedy and drama and tailoring it effectively is Tom Holland as the titular webslinger who is battling not only a crafty new foe, but his own turmoil and insecurities, which the villain exploits to his advantage. It was nice to see Jake Gyllenhaal break out of his heavy drama mold to play an outright eccentric comic book character like Mysterio; a very well done portrayal and he really made the action sequences pop with his complex illusions. I absolutely enjoyed this film's sense of humor. Peter's classmates, while just one-note characters, steal the show with their witty and crude remarks and it had me in stitches at times.Even the teen romance, which I normally find corny and forced, was cute. Both Peter and MJ are charming and likable characters and I wanted to see them get together, in fact I found MJ to be more interesting than Peter's previous love interest in Homecoming...what was her name? Exactly my point. I also wasn't expecting the return of a very minor character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe: William Riva, played by Peter Billingsley (who as a child actor played Ralphie Parker in A Christmas Story). Riva was the scientist that Obadiah Stane shouted at in a short scene in Iron Man, and Billingsley reprises his role 11 years later as new enemy of Spider-Man. Not a pivotal role, but it was an unexpected callback. Hopefully it gives Billingsley a career resurgence.Easily one of my new favorite films in the MCU lineup and favorite live-action Spidey film overall, Far From Home expands on the coming-of-age approach to the superhero genre that made Homecoming a fresh and fun flick and sets an interesting standard for the future of MCU. Make sure to stay after for the credits scenes. You'll see a familiar face!",Spider-Man - Far from Home
266,coasterdude44,"Fresh, Modern, Crisp, Sharp Smart Writing and Acting. A dazzling modern Superhero movie with loads of memorable moments",8,27 November 2019,"This movie was sick, it gave me everything I wanted from a Spider-Man sequel and from further reflection, I like it more than Spider-Man 2 from 2004 as a sequel, but only by a tiny bit. The movie itself is incredibly sharp and fast moving, never dragging or leaving you bored though it doesn't move too fast, just right so you can process the story enough. Tom Holland once again smashes it as Peter Parker and Jake Gyllenhaal plays a very entertaining and funny villan. This movie is also shot so incredibly well that you really can't complain about the movie visuallyBeing the first ever Spider-Man movie to take place outside New York, the movie does a great job at using these locations to their maximum potential, with Venice being used as a great location for the film for many of it's action squences.The CGI effects in this film were insane and Marvel have mastered the technology in their films. There was one certain scene where it just blows your mind just how elaborate the effects have become, it's just the pinnacle of cool in this movie.Overall, Far From Home was a blast and my favourite Spider-Man film of the decade, it does look like it's one of those movies that will have great rewatch value and I'll be watching this one many times more.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

272,fredschaefer-406-623204,A great vacation for the fans after AVENGERS: ENDGAME,9,7 July 2019,"In SPIDERMAN: FAR FROM HOME, Peter Parker and his science class take a trip to Europe, and for us diehard fans of the MCU, this film is like our own movie vacation after the emotional intensity of AVENGERS: ENDGAME. We get to focus on one hero, and one super villain, and the fate of the universe, is for the most part, not on the line. This lifelong Spidey fan has enjoyed all of the Wallcrawler's previous movie incarnations, but I've been realistic enough to see that all of them never quite captured the spirit of my favorite comic book hero: Toby Mcguire's Peter Parker grew up too fast, and was saddled with a less than satisfactory Mary Jane, while Andrew Garfield always looked like he should going for his master's degree, even when he was still in high school. But Tom Holland gets it right with Peter Parker's fumbling attempts to do the right thing, fight bad guys, romance Mary Jane Watson, and keep his sense of humor. And while FAR FROM HOME might not have hit the ball as far as HOMECOMING (mainly because the former doesn't have Michael Keaton in it), it still scores.As the first post ENDGAME movie of the MCU, FAR FROM HOME has to tackle the aftermath of Thanos' finger snap, or The Blip as it is called in this movie, where half of the earth's population was decimated. Conveniently for the story, nearly all the principles, including most of the students at Midtown High, blipped, and then returned five years later. Seemingly, the most pressing problem is that the kids had to start the school year over, and then there is that little geeky kid who didn't blip, and now five later, has grown to be a dream boat and hitting on Mary Jane much to Peter's consternation. A world wide holocaust that would have brought civilization to a halt, and crashed the world economy for generations, is just laughed away, but it is a comic book movie, and they get a break.A comic book movie lives and dies on the strength on its villain, and in FAR FROM HOME we get one of Spidey's classic old school foes, Quentin Beck, aka Mysterio, the self titled Master of Illusion. I know the trailer presented this character as an ally of Spider-Man, but I'm not spoiling much when I say that was all misdirection. The script gives Beck's character origin some 21st Century tweaking, but other than that, they nail it. The casting of Jake Gyllenhaal as Beck is spot on, carrying off the feat of playing him as a sympathetic hero for half the movie, before he reveals his true motives in a expository scene (that does a couple of great callbacks to IRON MAN 1 and CIVIL WAR) that might have been much more clunky in the hands of another actor. You've got to wonder if Tony Stark could just not have been such a jerk a few times, the world might have been minus a couple of super villains.
Of course there is a lot of CGI, but it never overwhelms the actors or the story, and if the pacing in the early part of the movie seems a little leisurely, it does give the film makers a chance to establish Peter's circle of friends and family better. Aunt May and Happy Hogan apparently are more than acquaintances, Ned Leeds has a summer fling, Flash is still a jerk, and Mary Jane is not only hot, but she is smart. What FAR FROM HOME does have that many other comic book movies don't, is an exceptionally strong third act, where Peter, having made a bad error in judgment, must now confront Mysterio and put things right in an epic battle in the streets of London, where we are treated to a recreation of one of the comic book's classic scenes when Mysterio attempts to trap Spidey in one of his illusions, and our hero can't discern what is real and what is not.If ENDGAME disappointed in that there was no post credits scene giving us a hint as to where the MCU is going next, FAR FROM HOME MORE than makes up for it. We get a mid credit scene that not only shakes up the status quo of Spider-Man's world in a most dramatic way, but brings back a most welcome character from the Toby Mcguire franchise, and played by the same actor - clearly somebody was listening to the fans. The post credit scene pulls the curtain back further, and contains a big reveal concerning Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury and the Skrulls from CAPTAIN MARVEL, and raising the possibility that the MCU is going cosmic in an even bigger way.What is clear is that with Tony Stark, and Steve Rogers, no longer the center of the MCU, Peter Parker is being groomed to step up, hopefully with a role in a reconstituted Avengers. With Mysterio, The Vulture, and the Scorpion on board, Kraven the Hunter seems like a logical next Big Bad for Spidey to face, maybe a movie adaptation of Kraven's Last Hunt, with this villain going after Peter, along with his friends and family. Reboot Doc Ock, and The Sandman, and we've got the Sinister Six. Then there is Norman Osborn, no Spidey universe is complete without him and his son, Harry, and though he's been used twice before, their appearance has got to happen sooner or later. Hopefully, in the next phase of the MCU, they will finally do right by the Fantastic Four, and we might get a version of the original Secret Wars series, which highlighted Spidey and FF. Though they hint at the possibility of the Marvel MultiVerse, let's put the brakes on that for awhile, as it has been used too many times in the comic books by lazy writers and editors.The best compliment I can give SPIDERMAN: FAR FROM HOME is that it plays out like one of those great collaborations between Stan Lee and Steve Ditko; that is especially true in the credit's scenes. The movies have finally done right by Spidey; let's see if director Jon Watts and screen writer, Chris McKenna can keep it up.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Unfortunately the movie is as dull as the trailers. It was ok and somewhat entertaining, but this would never be the best Spider-Man.Spider-Man is on vacation to Italy with his school mates and has the hots for MJ. However, The Avengers need him to help Mysterio from this big elemental monsters and then stuff happens and yeah.The illusion sequence was pretty cool and that's about all I will remember this film for. Maybe the mid credits scene but that's about it. The movie just felt very flat and uninspired. It almost felt like a movie they wanted to quickly get through because everyone is tired of making Spiderman movies.Also another reason why this film just doesn't live up to the other ones is because all Spiderman really faces in this movie is the main villain and a bunch of drones. The drones are like the main enemy in this movie.I guess its worth watching because it is Spiderman and it will make money. It's average, at best, and it is still better than Spiderman 3.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

276,arabnikita,We have lost Spider-man forever...,4,4 July 2019,"Spider-man has always been one of my favorite superheroes. I have watched cartoons, played games and loved the original trillogy. Since the reboot, spiderman went from the world's top 2 supehero to a mere cog in the MCU who got ""chosen"" by Tony Stark to take orders from obnoxious Nick Fury like a soldier and not a hero.Gone are the days when Spider-man had to figure out how to solve problems on his own and be courageous to get back up every time he got knocked down. Now, like in Homecoming, everything can be solved with nifty gadgets and infinite budgets. There is no sense of danger and we never fear for Spider-man's life as everything is formulaic and weak simoly to fit into MCU. The movie had potential but instead of focusing on serious topics, it wasted it's potential on irrelevant parts.Jake Gyllenhaal did not dissapoint and Mysterio was spectacular from the look to the awesome special effects but even he couldn't save this mediocrity. The school trip plot was a collection of nonsensical moments full of irritating characters supplied with patheric dialogue and cheap jokes. Any time one of the kids opened their mouth, I wanted to take out my eyes and plug my ears with them so I wont have to see or hear them. Somehow after fighting alongside Avengers, Peter managed to become even more awkward to the point of absurdity. As a fan of original Spider-Man, I am extremely saddened by what was done to my beloved character.#moviesshmovies",Spider-Man - Far from Home
277,vailsy,Spider-Man: The Comedy,5,22 July 2019,"Although i did not like it much, I tolerated the first Spider-Man reboot movie and saw it as a reimagining of the character for a younger audience. something i could watch even with a toddler for example without them getting scaredThis second movie unfortunately takes Homecoming and amps it up to 20 .. Spider-Man is now fully just an Avengers side character.. and everyone is doing Tony Stark impressions throughout .. with that same jokey, non realistic, badly done sarcasm wit . It's like even the extras were told roll your eyes at this moment, make an awkward glance sideways there etcAll the characters in the movie talk to each other in this highly non realistic jokey staged way.. even the villain Mysterio does it ?.. the worst characters of the lot are the school teachersMost one liners were punctuated by really douchey sounding people in the audience guffawing .. 'the seat belt, ahuhuhu!' , 'it's broken, oohhhuhuu!'these douchey people are the very people that spider-man is battling against in the comic books, and now here they are guffawing at the character. horriblethe bad one liners and situations were relentless and non stop from the start until the very finish of this movie, which i was happy to get up from and walk out of before the inevitable end of credits jokeeven the music for the movie is also like an intentional joke, with super unsubtle strings and piano playing alongside the 'serious bits'the only good bits really.. the visual effects on 'hydro man' , and the updated story take on Mysterio which has him using AR technology instead of smoke and mirrorsi'm sure this movie will be looked back on badly since the humour in it already feels very dated. hopefully Spider-Man will get back on track again in one of it's many inevitable future reboots",Spider-Man - Far from Home
278,gk303007,A good action flick with excellent VR,8,4 July 2019,"I would say this movie had some elements of joy, good cgi and an ok story. Missed Stan Lee in an adhoc role although. Story line is same like many other movies, a growing teenager got a lot of responsibilities which he is nervous of for he wants his time and energy impressing his classmate and live a normal life. Basically MJ. However his fate is different for a small mistake leads him to unknown and dangerous situations from which he learns his mistakes and stands to fight the evil. Same old story of falling and rising. But thats not the point here. Point is after a long time I overjoyed seeing good VR. I myself have felt how your heart pounds when you are wearing 9D glasses and in game mode. Your mind knows its all bluff and still you cant withstand. There were a few scary moments, also.A must, atleast, one time watch in theatre. Go for the good CGI and if you are Marvel fan.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
279,achyutaghosh,Mind blowing!,9,10 July 2019,"Let's face it- every follow-up to Endgame was going to be a let down. Spiderman Far From Home though is the gentlest touchdown one could have, kudos to Marvel for that. More teen romance than superhero caper, Far From Home presents an extremely likeable friendly neighborhood Spiderman tale.It starts on an expected note. The world including Peter Parker has not yet recovered from the death of Ironman, and he plans to confess about his feelings to MJ on a field trip to Europe. Meanwhile ancient primal forces called Elementals ( wind, fire, earth and water) are appearing in random places on earth causing destruction. None of the Avengers seem to be around to tackle this threat, so Nick Fury recruits Peter who is in the midst of wooing the snarky MJ. Meanwhile a costumed hero called Mysterio with magical powers from an alternate dimension appears to help fight the Elementals.""I think Nick Fury just hijacked our summer vacation""- SpidermanWho says work and fun can't go together? Peter says so.
After all he is not alone in vying for MJ's affections. There is Brad, who irritates Peter so much that he summons a drone strike against him. And Peter is weighed by Tony Stark's decision of passing on the mantle to him. Yes, he gets access to Stark's latest weapons program- EDITH (Even Dead I am The Hero), named so with utmost humility by Tony Stark himself.""They will believe anything.""- MysterioIn this age of fake news and propaganda, nothing is what it seems. Mysterio emerges as master manipulator, playing on current themes of distrust and make belief. He aims to wiping out truth, and most people will find it more scary than Thanos trying to wipe out half the universe. With his Roman armor and cloak output, and goldfish bowl helmet, Jake Gyllenhaal gets negative points, but as far as his act is concerned- he is at the top of his game. He is great when he is required to be over the top, or emotionally invested, as and when the role demands. Tom Holland is probably the best Spiderman ever- playing angsty teen and savvy superhero with elan. His chemistry with Zendaya's MJ and Jacob Batalon's Ned is just right. Marisa Tomei and Jon Favreau as Aunt May and Happy Hogan make an endearing pair, as do JB Smoove and Martin Starr as the school trip chaperones.The best thing returning director Jon Watts does is to infuse humor in every scene in Far From Home. He also keeps the pace snappy, and does not let the aftermath of Endgame (imagine 4 billion people suddenly back) bog down the narrative. The action scenes involving the Elementals are intentionally cheesy, while those involving Spidey are arguably the very best MCU has served up. The villain itself is both ingenious and creative, and the roadtrip is full of laughs.Trivia- the Elementals are modeled upon classic Spidey villains- Hydro Man, Molten Man, Sandman and Cyclone.At the end though, Peter Parker does find his spider tingle, his heart, and his place in the world, and like his mentor, when he is on the clock, he does save the world. The end credits point to exciting future directions the MCU could go to. No Iron Man, Captain America, Black Widow or Vision around anymore, but all seems to be well with the MCU.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
280,jace_the_film_guy,"What is the world like after the 5 year ""blip""?",8,16 July 2021,"What is the world like after the 5 year ""blip""? How is everyone (especially Peter) dealing with Iron Man's death? Is Peter going to start pursuing MJ? All of these questions and more are explored in another great entry in the newest Spider-Man trilogy. In the MCU, there is a tendency for the second sequels to drop off significantly in value (other than The Winter Soldier).While I do not see Far From Home as better than Homecoming, it still did a great job of introducing the post-blip world and showing the strain that has fallen upon Peter Parker since Tony's sacrifice. That being said, Mysterio was predictable, the illusions got confusing and the sheer number of drones attacking Spider-Man in the third act were a little excessive.Complaints aside, the simple moment of Peter and Happy hovering in the jet over a tulip field, while reflecting on missing Tony, brought a depth to the film at just the right time. Seeing Peter struggle, yet naturally, fall into Tony's shoes sets the tone for the next phase of the MCU.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
281,n-kefala,Teenagers issues,7,6 July 2019,"""Spider-Man: Far from home"" is an effects-heavy superhero movie that can't quite match the inspired heights of its predecessor. But this is a fairly standard Spider-Man story, with good action sequences with adolescent, coming-of-age issues. Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio is great, even if it's a very different but familiar take on the Marvel character.
The emphasis is clearly on having fun, providing a crowd-pleasing adventure. This movie manages to develop a more intimate story, mixing up action and danger with more comedic and even romantic moments. And the truth is that it may not be necessarily groundbreaking, but it pokes fun at itself and knows that even if most of us don't have super powers, we all remember the super problems of being a teenager. nikisreviews.gr",Spider-Man - Far from Home
282,Semisonic,The illusion factory is back,5,1 October 2019,"It's been just a few months since we've witnessed the final episode of the Marvel saga that went on for ten years. A convergence point of such grandeur might suggest that from now on the Marvel world would follow a different path, giving us something truly new.However, the story of Spider-Man: Far from Home feels like an inverted mirror allusion to what the film itself tries to do with the established universe: selling us a bunch of illusions we'd be eager to believe in simply because we wanna be fooled.With the Infinity Saga, we came to believe that all that superhero sci-fi extravaganza happening on screen actually has a deeper meaning, a layer for every major focus group, something most of us would not be ashamed to openly like. With that saga over, however, we're left with a bunch of secondary guys previously introduced mostly as filler, a few major characters past their prime, and a golden kid. Who hasn't been charmed by that cute Peter Parker boy, his politically correct sidekick and a pretty but intentionally awkward love interest!And this is what Marvel is gonna sell us from now on. Cuteness, tolerable acting (nothing stellar, but nothing cringey too), and ok writing. Just like the posse Mysterio has gathered to prove his point, this set of traits seems to be just enough to keep the audience engaged, and the cash flow going in. Because nobody requires a groundbreaking story or insanely prominent characters anymore - now it's just enough to maintain the existing momentum without messing up.Was this film a mess? Definitely not. Was it anything more than just a pretty image hollow within? I wouldn't say so. But as long as everyone's looking at the colorful objects flying around with a loud boom, the magician is free to take out as many rabbits out of his fake hat. We just don't care to go deeper anymore. And this carousel of generic storytelling will just keep on spinning, until either we're so dizzy we start puking this Marvel drivel back, or their projectors start falling off and the illusion breaks apart.Unfortunately, none of the above is gonna happen any time soon. So, put the Cap helmet on and start saying ""Hail Marvel"" before someone finds your lack of faith disturbing.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Zendaya is a nice presence as Parker's love interest.

But one thing that I didn't like though is that the villain just felt quite lame. After battling Thanos in the last movie, you have Spiderman battling just some guy with fancy tech.The movie did try to make the villain really menacing and threatening, but in the end it just didn't work out for me.

Also at the same time Nick Fury is trying to stop these things called the elements and needs Spider-Man help.Spider-Man Far From Home was one of the best Marvel movies of the past 3 years. Of corse Endgame was better and maybe I think Ant-Man And The Wasp was around the same as Spider-Man Far From Home. This movie I would say was unique though. On top of all the action there was a love story going on between MJ and Parker. That was a great touch to the movies. It made it feel like he was always doing something. Also the effects where pretty good. The one scene where he jumps over the explosions was a masterpiece. The only thing about the effects I didn't like was the stunt part. There was one scene were Spider-Man flew back and hit a wall. He stood there for a second and then bounced off that really annoyed me. Also there was a scene a bunch of water getting thrown at him and he just slides back. Also the music I never thought was queued in the right time. It was always after something awesome happened. Not during the awesome thing was happening. Back to the things I did like. The score was unique, but like I said they didn't use it in the right times. The acting was obviously good.

The great scene in my point of view is that when Peter distract his friends and covered off the drone's attack and there are plenty of great scenes.
Good maturity level has been shown of Tom Holland as he looked very great in this movie as he has been. There are some critics that i must talk about like the plot went pretty confused when we discovered that the Mysterio is scammer and after that it was still being fine. There should have been like make the Peter responsible now for what he has to face, although i have really enjoyed the movie. In the end movie's story started to go nice then and the death scene of Mysterio could have been something more real.
It was cool, hilarious and pretty great romantic. Tom Holland's acting looked really good and he actually played really cool and funny.

293,bastille-852-731547,Another Terrific Marvel Movie,8,3 July 2019,"""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" manages to memorably continue the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"" while also feeling like something unique in and of itself. This dichotomy is hard to successfully pull off, so props to director Jon Watts for managing to do so. The film follows Peter Parker and his friend as they go on a class trip around Europe, which manages to get interrupted by Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal.) I won't say any more about the plot, but Marvel fans should rest assured: the film itself is terrific fun. Its action sequences are thrilling and engaging, taking advantage of the unique locales and spatial geography of each European location that the story takes place in. It's also very funny throughout and well-written. Tom Holland is great (as always) as Spider-Man, and brings plenty of charisma to the table.There are two aspects of this film, however, that manage to significantly elevate it above your average Marvel movie. The first aspect is the film's decision to set the film around Europe. The script and story manage to take advantage of a lot of the culture of the film's European settings (Venice, the Alps, Prague, Berlin and London,) which creates a far more immersive and memorable viewing experience than the typical superhero film. Despite the variety of fascinating settings, the film's pacing is always outstanding. Secondly, Jake Gyllenhaal is exceptional as Mysterio, and his character is fascinating and far more developed/interesting than supporting characters of key significance in other MCU movies. These two elements make ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" memorable, and certainly place it a tier above the fun but slightly banal ""Spider-Man: Homecoming."" There are a few minor plot holes which manage to slightly bring down the film's narrative, but other than that, this is a great superhero movie that both Marvel fans and more casual viewers will love. Definitely recommended. 8.5/10",Spider-Man - Far from Home

A guy who appears out of nowhere defeats this Elemental while Nick and Maria simply take his word and believe that he's from an alternate reality because... he wears a cape and has powers? Yeah, we'll go with that because... why not? Fury meets Parker while on vacation and gives him a pair of glasses that Stark bestowed to him which were meant for his successor. These glasses control a bunch of orbital weapons system's drones. Why Tony Stark would give this kind of power to a sixteen year old kid you might ask? Why indeed? Because he is responsible you might answer... Nope! No, no and no! He simply hands over the glasses to Mysterio who uses it to destroy London. I mean he literally hands over the glasses to a man he has only met for a few days! Why not hand them to Fury or another Avenger? Why didn't Tony give these glasses to Fury, or Thor or an adult with who has a drivers license or who is old enough to vote???

I thought that it will not be as good as Spider-Man: Homecoming, but I was wrong. It completely exceeded my expectations and was a great summer blockbuster after Avengers: Endgame. The way the movie addressed Thanos's snap (known as ""the Blip"") which wiped out half of all life was hilarious. The opening scene where Peter Parker's school memorialized the fallen heroes was extremely funny.The movie had a much lighter tone than Avengers: Endgame and it benefitted because of it. Tom Holland gave his best performance as Peter Parker and Spider-Man yet. He became my favorite Spider-Man after this movie.The twist that Quentin Beck aka Mysterio lied about the Elementals and the multiverse was unexpected and shocking. It turned out that the Elementals were fake and served as illusions to scare people so Mysterio could be seen as a hero in the eyes of the public. The multiverse is yet to exist in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The romance between Peter and MJ fit perfectly in this movie. Tom Holland and Zendaya have amazing chemistry. I definitely rooted for them to end up together. Peter and MJ have such a awkward and fun relationship which is enjoyable to watch.Spider-Man: Far From Home had two post credit scenes; one mid credits scene and one end credits scene. The mid credits scene revealed Spider-Man's identity to the whole world. It brought back J.K. Simmons as the Editor of the Daily Bugle which was quite unpredictable and unexpected. It was a nice wink to Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy. After watching the mid credits scene my jaw literally dropped. I could not believe they actually did that. Anyway, the end credits scene revealed to us that Nick Fury and Maria Hill were actually disguised as Skrulls. The real Nick Fury is in space with the rest of the Skrulls. This may have teased Captain Marvel 2. Nick Fury may be also appearing in the sequel as well.To conclude, Spider-Man: Far From Home has become my favorite Spider-Man movie of all time. It was so visually pleasing that it does not have any flaws. I recommend everyone to watch this movie on the biggest screen possible. It is truly worth it.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
305,thepriceofpayne,Spider-Man: Far From Terrible,9,3 July 2019,"This sequel had lots to live up to. Coming off the heels of The critically acclaimed and era ending ""Avengers: Endgame"" as well as the academy award winning ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse."" Far From Home stuck to its roots, and while it may not be ""the best Spider-Man film of All-Time"" it is an entertaining, action-packed Spidey film that delivers in all the right ways. Tom Holland continues to deliver what I believe to be the best portrayal of Peter Parker/Spider-Man, and Jake Gyllenhaal makes for a great adversary in Mysterio, with an excellent use of his character, I would be terrible if I didn't mention the performances of Zendaya and Jacob Batalon who are also phenomenal. Jon Watts builds on his direction from the first and gives the film much higher stakes, and greater emotion, that all comes together in the best of ways. ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" proves to be a beautiful well crafted High School/Superhero/Coming of Age/Vacation/Sci-Fi Film that delivers on all accounts to become the most fun and exciting of all the Spider-Man films.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
306,droog-56936,A Nice Summer Ride For MCU Fans,7,20 August 2019,Dialing down the irritating political quips from Homecoming really helped make this an enjoyable outing. Zendeya did a great job in fleshing out her character. Tom Holland's Spider Boy take on the character is still engaging. Even the irritating comedy relief best friend was not as grating this time around. Jake Gyllenhall as Mysterio is adequate though he doesn't hit anywhere near the menace of Michael Keaton's Vulture in the previous movie. Though Sam Raimi's trilogy still reigns supreme this was really good.,Spider-Man - Far from Home

Then there was a crash, a crash, a crash. No one will love you so much, no one will wait for you in the same place.

308,Paynebyname,Spectacularly average,5,16 July 2019,"I had hesitations about going to see this film. I was disappointed with Marvel after how poor Endgame was but I have to confess that I really liked Spiderman: Homecoming and the Marvel staple still gets me excited.But Far from Home was just so meh. The jokes felt flat and forced or were telegraphed a mile off. The action scenes had little or no tension, especially when the line is being blurred between reality and fake imagery, and the ultimate fight was Spidey fighting drones - yawn.Yes, I like Holland's portrayal of Peter Parker but the magic of Homecoming has gone and been replaced with something that has lost its wonder. MJ isn't likeable, okay she's quirky, but she's hard to like and unlike Peter's affection for Liz in the first film, in this one, I just didn't care.And the endless eulogising of Stark is just too much. To some extent, I liked the fact that Mysterio and his crew were disgruntled employees but I would have understood more if they just disliked Stark for what he was in the final film - an arrogant tool.Tony went on a journey through the MCU and by the time of Civil War he was a bit more humble and likeable but in Endgame, the writers got lazy, capitulated to Downey's ego and he went back to him being the self-absorbed guy he was in the first films and hence when everyone is going on about him, you're reminded that he wasn't that great or likeable.By the end of the film, when Peter is doing the same old swinging through NY with MJ clinging on to his neck and the crowds don't seem to care, you feel that the over saturation of Marvel and Spidey has arrived. I mean we've got shape shifters, talk of alternate universes, empty pointless destruction, bluffs, misdirection and it is descending into this ridiculous melting pot like that which other franchises have descended where keeping it all together has been thrown out to make another big buck.I don't know what is going on with Marvel; well actually I think I do. They've become so big, so greedy and so confident of the money that they will continue to make, that they've got lazy. 2019 has been an awful year for the quality of their products. I'm sure they're delighted with the box office receipts but they've lost creativity, continuity and integrity and are now happy to put out films that are just weak and mediocre with the sole purpose of making as much money as possible.Far from home is the cap on a trio of Marvel films that tell you all you need to know about the brand moving forward. They're obsessed with being PC, they have no more goals to achieve and hence won't take risks and they've clearly told their writers that they don't need to 'fine tune' anything or 'dig deep' on their efforts because the audience will blindly accept anything that you give them.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
309,Genti23,A lot of fun,8,3 July 2019,"Far from Home is a great sequel with a lot of very good action sequences, and very well developed characters that just make this entire movie very fun to watch.
Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man/Peter Parker ever, he is so charismatic and funny, plus he is great in the action scenes as well. Him and Zendaya have great chemistry, and thankfully they developed her character, MJ, a lot more this time around. Also in my opinion, Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio works for what the film was going for, and Jake is just great in everything he does so there's no surprise there.
I still love Homecoming more than Far from Home, but this is still a very good movie overall and I enjoyed it a lot.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
310,justinwfirestone,"A fun Spider-Man, thank you",7,20 July 2019,"Winsome is the word for Tom Holland as Spider-Man, maybe for Tom Holland in general. Although, Far from Home lacks the fresh-air punch of Homecoming and the touch of class that is Michael Keaton, this incarnation of Spider-Man is the Spider-Man kids all over the world will want to be someday (sorry Tobey and Andrew, but brooding emo-ness was so 1990s and 2000s). Heaven forbid that Spider-Man have fun in his teenage years, geeking out about multiverses and shooting his gooey webs literally pretty much all over the place. Oh, and we don't have to watch Uncle Ben die all over again or feel bad about That Whole Thing, yet there is a very small initial reference.There are genuine laughs, too. Somehow the writers milked the PG-13 rating for all its worth by combining jokes about bananas, Spider-Sense, and shooting goo. Happy gets one of the funnier moments via physical gag with a medieval shield. Then there's the confusion about who Spider-Man is, resulting in a new hilarious alt-moniker.Tony Stark is gone, but Happy fills in some of the emotional holes. The ultimate weaknesses of the movie are the plot, the villain, and Jake Gyllenhaal. While one can appreciate the attempt to provide commentary about fake news, social media, and whether perception is reality, Mysterio offers thin rationales for his actions and fails to menace.Is Samuel L. Jackson acting anymore? Zendaya is super-cute, and deserves a last name. Also, not enough Marisa Tomei!",Spider-Man - Far from Home
311,schroederagustavo,A blend of high school romance/comedy and Spider-Man!,8,3 July 2019,"I had a really good time watching Spider-Man: Far from home, it's one of the most relatable Spidey stories to date and I really liked what they did here in terms of certain characters and some of the choices they have to make.Once the movie starts, there is this great high-school video doing some necessary exposition to highlight the super important events of Infinity War and Endgame (just in case you forgot or if you're that one guy who doesn't watch Marvel movies, for some reason), I thought that was great.But let's talk about the core of this movie, because as I was watching it I was actually surprised to see how much this film is actually more about Peter Parker than Spider-Man. During the first third of this movie, there is barely any Spider-Man action, and most of it is focused around Pete's trip and his desire to tell MJ his true feelings about her. As a matter of fact, I'd say this movie is about 50% a high school comedy/romance and 50% a Spider-Man movie. And while I do think it's important to explore this side of Peter Parker and make it smaller scale, I found myself wanting more Spider-Man action during the first half of the movie. But one of the things I enjoyed the most about this movie is how relatable Peter Parker is, and Tom Holland is just amazing as the character. In this movie, we see him as what Spider-Man is supposed to be: A high school kid with insane abilities, who knows that he has to use them for good, but at the same time just wants to live a normal life. Remember, with great power comes great responsibility and this is the main dilemma in his life and I think that was handled very well.Eventually, Mysterio does show up and they do some pretty cool stuff together and the dialogue between them is pretty great throughout the movie. Jake Gyllenhaal is, as usual, great in this one, he's one of my favorite actors and I'm glad he got to play Mysterio.Something that bothered me a little bit is how many stupid decisions Peter makes throughout the movie. First off, you don't ignore Nick Fury man, come on. And it does make that scene when Fury shows up in Italy pretty sweet, but I just think Spider-Man should be smarter than that to know that if Nick Fury wants to see him, he will track him down with zero issues. And the other obvious one is he hands over like 10 billion dollars worth of military technology to a guy he literally just met. And it obviously misfires, since it turns out that *Drumroll* Mysterio is actually a bad guy! It's a little predictable, even if you don't know the comic book story.But I do really love the way they handled how he performs his illusions with the drones and his plan is like evil to the core. The absolute best scenes in this movie are when Mysterio is messing with Spider-Man's head and it's just like a full scene of insanity, with amazing special effects and just strangeness and it's terrifying, to be completely honest. I loved those two scenes when that happens. And I absolutely loved the final third of this movie, I thought the action, the music, the performances, the comedy, it was all very well handled.However, I must say that the high school drama parts didn't do much for me and the comedy didn't always land, even though I did enjoy specifically most of the MJ-Peter stuff and I think they did a good job with exploring that in a broader way in this film.Maybe one of my nitpicks with the film is that the opening, specifically that transition from the Mexico scene into the Marvel credits was weird and didn't flow well, it just felt weird, I don't really know how to explain it. The movie just starts in the middle of the action for like 2 minutes and then cuts to the opening credits. I wasn't the biggest fan of that.But overall, I honestly think this movie is worth watching in the theater because of that fantastic, action-packed final act of the movie and the two scenes where Mysterio is messing with Spider-Man, just illusion after illusion. The performances are great, specifically by Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal. And even though the high school stuff didn't really work for me all the time, I still really enjoyed this one.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

314,theredsky,Spider-Man: Far From Home Review,8,5 July 2019,"Spider-Man: Far From Home is a good movie and a good follow up to the events of Endgame. Here are the negatives. The first 30-45 minutes kinda suck. It's paced awkwardly and incredibly rushed. Scenes just kind of start and stop with no rhyme or reason. It gets a whole lot better after that point though. Peter Parker still MOSTLY has the same internal struggle of Spider-Man: Homecoming. Peter is trying to figure out if he should be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man or be more than that and I wished they had not kept that internal struggle from the first film. Half of the jokes in this movie weren't that funny to me. The visual effects in some areas were a little shotty but most were really good. My final issue is that there is a literal plot device item that comes into play about halfway through the movie and it doesn't make a lot of sense at all for me. Here are the positives. The acting is really good. Tom Holland, Jake Gyllenhaal, Samuel L. Jackson, and Jacob Batalon are standouts from the film. Jake Gyllenhaal and Tom Holland have outstanding chemistry together and it's a joy to watch them on screen together. I really hope those two work together again in the future. The rest of the actors do a good job. Most of the visual effects are really good for a Marvel movie. There is a sequence in the film that I think is absolutely amazing that I can't talk about due to spoilers. The Elementals look lifelike and both Spider-Man and Mysterio's visual effects look really good. I absolutely love Mysterio's actual costume. It just looks amazing. The action in this film is really good. You understand what is going on and who is who in each action sequence. I like the story for this film. It has this kind of spy thriller vibe while mixed with a romance comedy that I think works really well together and I like how each destination the group goes to is essential to the plot. I do enjoy the score a lot even though I prefer Homecoming's score. The cinematography is fine. It's not extraordinary but it's decent. The tone mostly remains consistent except for a couple scenes and after the first 30-45 minutes, the film is paced really well. Overall, Spider-Man: Far From Home is a good follow up to Endgame with great acting, action, and good visual effects even if the first part of the film sucks. I give Spider-Man: Far From Home a 7.5/10.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
315,pritol,Better without the Avengers!,8,1 March 2020,"After Avengers Endgame, I did wonder how the Marvel machine would continue to pump out films without that story arc end point to work towards, and without apparently many of the Avengers to play with in the story.The Spider-Man films have always had a sense of isolation within the Marvel universe, maybe it's because the superhero is a young kid at school as supposed to a career adult superhero.So with that in mind, I genuinely think this is one of my favourite Marvel films to date! Not only are Jake Gyllenhaal and Tom Holland fantastic in their lead roles, ( Gyllenhaal is particularly brilliant as Mysterio) but the story is a much more personal one focusing on Peter Parker adjusting to life without Tony Stark as his mentor, and trying to open up to MJ, who let's face it he's always destined to have a massive crush on...As expected it tees up a continuation for another film, but it could quite easily be its own story surrounding just Spider-Man without any place in a wider story, and that's what makes it so good, it doesn't try to be bigger or more important than it is.It's just a great story, which is all you're looking for!!",Spider-Man - Far from Home
316,chi_town_fed,A very entertaining and clean movie (comparatively speaking).,8,7 October 2019,"Bravo! Hollyweird finally made a movie without lewd sex scenes or foul language from credits-to-credits. This is an interesting, light-hearted installment of the Spiderman franchise. This is one of the few Marvel movies where the comedic moments were in sync with the movie. The action scenes were great too. I rented this film at home and enjoyed it.

317,joshbarton15,"If you thought the MCU was done for after Endgame, think again.",9,3 July 2019,"With the dust having settled from Avengers: Endgame, Marvel Studios close the Infinity Saga and kick off a new era for the MCU with Spider-Man: Far From Home. Following such an epic cinematic event as Endgame is never going to be an easy task however, with Spider-Man, arguably the most popular superhero of all time, at their disposal, this is probably the best route they could have taken.With the world a much changed place after the events of Endgame, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) must step-up in his duties as Spider-Man to protect the world from new threats, all while travelling around Europe on a school vacation.Considering Tony Stark's death in Endgame hit Peter Parker pretty damn hard, having his film close out the Infinity Saga seems incredibly fitting, the responsibility left on his shoulders after being chosen by Stark looming over him throughout. Homecoming saw Parker want to be more than the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man however, having seen just how vast the threats across the universe can be, Far From Home sees him content with his world being smaller. The great thing about Parker as a character is the internal struggles he must juggle with his dual identity and Far From Home does a great job in portraying Parker's emotional journey, the fact it all happens while he's still at high school, a battlefield itself, making it much more intriguing.Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers have done a great job in writing a film that throws us so effortlessly into the complicated web that is Peter Parker's life, whether it be trying to help save the world from new threats or trying to win the girl of his dreams. Both aspects are dealt with seriously but it would be a lie if I told you they didn't have some fun while doing it, jokes firing on all cylinders for the most part. There was one running joke involving Ned they could have done without, adding no purpose to an already stuffed plot, but I can let that slide when there is a huge amount of fun to be had here.One aspect that has improved since his first Spider-Man effort on Homecoming is director Jon Watts' ability to deliver an action sequence. They were good in the first film but they're much better here, particularly in the final act that includes some rather trippy yet visually stunning action, aided by some rather expectedly great special effects work.Coming to the performances, Far From Home proves further that Tom Holland was just born to play the role of Peter Parker/Spider-Man. It's often said about most actors who play superheroes however, Holland just oozes the screen presence to make the whole thing click and feel utterly believable, the naivety and awkwardness of both identities being strongpoints of his overall performance. Spider-Man is one of the most relatable superheroes and he's never felt as relatable as he does with Holland in the role.Zendaya introduced herself as MJ (Mary Jane to those who don't know) in Homecoming, triggering the nerd blogs with posts about her not being how MJ should be but she owns it in Far From Home, settling into the role brilliantly and sharing a good chemistry with Holland, key to making this particular relationship working on screen. Jake Gyllenhaal is a major coup for the MCU and he really does go all out to ensure Mysterio becomes a character it'll be hard to forget in a hurry, his quirkiness matching that of Quentin Beck to a tee.With Endgame closing a chapter for a few of Earth's mightiest heroes, Far From Home opens the MCU up to a whole new world of possibilities, for both Spider-Man himself and others scattered around the universe. The two credit stings are probably two of the biggest they've ever done in terms of the future of the MCU, so they're worth sticking around for. If you thought the MCU was going to run out of steam after Endgame think again because Far From Home makes it feel as if they're just getting started yet again for something big.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

324,intrepidami,Not without it's flaws,7,6 July 2019,"What have they done to Flash Thompson? He's obviously an amalgam of FT and Harry Osborne. He's basically Harry with Flash's idolization of SM. He's a mouthy bully, Flash was a physical bully. Why not just make him gay? Or a girl?The only way for Peter to be completely fooled was to have his Spider Sense turned off. They basically put that forth right in the beginning. There's no explanation as why it's not working, it just isn't.Nick Fury is not going to use a group of innocent kids to motivate Peter into joining. He's acting strange the whole movie. Way too hard on Peter. In my mind Fury would simply have Peter detained with an excuse like his aunts sick and he needs to go home, away from his friends.But then we wouldn't have all this class full of Jar Jar's BS.The jump out the top of the bus to stop a droid, and then back in before anybody noticed? Ummmm He isn't the Flash or Quicksilver!Conveniently all the other avengers, heroes are unavailable. Should I list off the many ones they didn't mention, because it's a lot! Dr Strange was simply unavailable. Like a bunch of Magical Elementals attacking the Earth would somehow escape his, and all the other wizards notice?I also found him simply putting back on the glasses and the system immediately giving him back control was kind of unimaginative. I was hoping Tony built in a failsafe, or Peter put one in. But no, Welcome back Peter...sheesh!But finally, I agree with Peters assessment of his place in the hero world and against these elementals, and that he's kind of like sending Hawkeye in to fight Galactus. What is he supposed to do against a huge fire elemental EXCEPT keep dodging it! What was the plan for his participation? I get why they didn't get anybody like The Black Panther, because it would be hard to explain how Suri couldn't see right through the tech trickery. Or the Wizards because it would be hard to fake real magic. But I'm not the one who created this ever expanding universe of characters. So when they leave them out now, it kind of makes you wonder. Even Antman would be more useful, at least he can grow big!That line by Fury ""Don't you evoke her name"" What is that supposed to mean?Also they know where the Elementals are going to appear 48 hours in advance , but Fury and his men are in transit?

However our hero deals with a regrettable decision. I love how the movie explains the plot hole in the Avengers Endgame while 5 years has passed. Also explains why their still in high school.Peter Parker is also going through the grief and death of Tony Stark. It's tough to see your best mentor gone. I can relate because we all lost someone close to us.The only bad thing is the love story of MJ and Peter Parker. They don't explain why he has a crush on her. It feels forced.

326,haydenluz,Spider-Man: Far From Home,6,14 September 2020,"Spider-Man: Far From Home, directed once again by Jon Watts, was a really fun time, but it came with a lot of baggage. The narrative itself was all over the place, being inconsistent, overused, and predictable. Watts created a couple unnecessary subplots, that essentially divided the film, instead of bringing it together. Watts tried to keep things light-hearted, but focused a lot on creating a story, based on the outcome of Endgame, so it makes the tones clash a lot more than he would've liked. The screenwriters did the best they could with balancing the humor and the emotion, but like every other Marvel film that tries to be emotional, it gets undercut by forced humor. I didn't mind the story being effected by Endgame all that much, but if they would've made it more of a sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming, while mixing in some Endgame aspects, and what happened to the people around Peter Parker, the narrative would've been tighter, and flowed a lot better. I didn't find the pacing of the film to be completely distracting, due to the great stakes and little amount of downtime, but there are some points that are a little slower than others, mostly due to the amount of filler they added, but the film kept adding fun layers to the story, to keep me invested all the way threw.Tom Holland keeps proving time in, and time out, that he is the trademark Spider-Man! Holland brings this tremendous charm, humor, and agility to the character, that makes him undeniably likable! Even though Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers aren't my favorite screenwriters, his character is always nicely written, allowing for great character moments, while also giving him a great emotional character arch this time! One of the best things about his character, and the film itself, is the fact that it's more of a Peter Parker film, than a Spider-Man film, playing off the lines of Iron Man 3. The only issue I have with his character, is the fact that the spider-sense is unbalanced. I enjoyed that they included it more, but it wasn't executed all that well. Zendaya returns as MJ, having more to do, but was still written poorly. I don't mind the twist on her character at all, while she does have great chemistry with Holland as well, but she just isn't all that interesting, while not being fleshed out as good as she could be. Jake Gyllenhaal makes his MCU debut, as Mysterio, and he nails it! He fits extremely well in the Marvel franchise, culturally suiting the character, while bringing this prestigious talent to the screen. You can tell he was having a great time, because it translated into a great performance! His chemistry with Holland was done really well, shining bright together. My only issue with his character, even though Gyllenhaal kills it, his character could've been given more to work with. Sam Jackson returns as Nick Fury, and like always, he does Nick Fury things. He really doesn't do much in the film, going underdeveloped almost as always, along side Maria Hill, but they still serve their important purpose. I enjoy Marisa Tomei as Aunt May, but she didn't do anything in this film to solidify her purpose in the film. If anything, she brings the film, and her character down, just because her motives are a mixed bag. Jon Favreau returned as Happy Hogan for a small portion of the film, and he's always a great addition. One of the characters I was expecting to be nicely fleshed out, and wasn't, was Jacob Batalon as Ned. His character had some decent potential for developing, but the writers took him his own way almost. For his character to work, he needs to be more focused on helping Peter.The action was really intriguing, intense, and intuitive! Watts handled all of the actions scenes really well, developing his own style of action. As for the effects, they looked rather well... for the most part. There are some effects that look a little hammy, but most of the effects were done extremely well.Overall, I think Spider-Man: Far From Home is a good film, but due to the inconsistencies, and forceful jokes, Far From Home gets a little homesick at times.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

After all the Avengers films, the best thing stupid film-makers could think of was to take almost the entire Avengers team and kill them all off? Some of these films, including Iron Man and Avengers titles grossed over a $Billion, so you kill off the characters? Seriously?This seems like what Democrats would do. If they had their way, the next (sic)'Super Hero' would look normal, but then when action is called for he could fire Twinkies out of his behind!AFAIC, there are no ""Avengers"" without Iron Man and Captain America -- using the same actors originally shown -- not substitutes.This movie was and is nothing but a joke. Spiderman can't seem to find that excellent suit made by Tony Stark? Seriously? I want to know what all those hundreds of web options are!Yes, fellow movie-fans, there are silly 'forces' out there who want nothing more than to kill and disgrace ANY form of Hero we have -- including comic book heroes. Why, you ask? Because then all you have to look up to is your government; and that government is pretty sad right now. Think this through for yourselves.Three Stars for this tripe is generous.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
328,rcolgan,Spider-man: Into The Marvel-verse,7,13 July 2019,"The MCU has now become so interconnected that it seems impossible to talk about it without spoiling the previous films. Heck, even the trailer for Far From Home came with spoiler warnings. So if you're the one person who hasn't got round to watching Endgame yet and you don't want to know any details about the ""surprise"" villain in Far From Home, spoilers ahead.Still reeling from the events of Endgame and the massive weight on his shoulders of everyone wanting him to be the next Iron man, Peter is looking forward to the chance to not be Spider-man for a while and hang up his costume to go on vacation with his friends at school. But when elemental monsters appear to be attacking European landmarks, Nick Fury enlists Spider-man to help save the world with the new mysterious hero Mysterio.But in the most shocking twist since it was revealed in Superman that Clarke Kent wasn't just a mild mannered reporter, it turns out the the famous Spider-man villain Mysterio is actually the antagonist of the film. He's a disgruntled Tony Stark employee who was manipulating Spider-man to obtain a dangerous A.I. designed by Stark which controls orbital weapons. So obviously Spider-man has to find Mysterio and save the day, whilst still trying to have fun on his trip and find a way to confess his feelings to MJ.As a villain Mysterio is fine. He's not the show stealer like some of the other recent villains like Killmongerer or Thanos have been, but he's not a forgetful dud like Zemo either. Gyllenhall has enough charisma that he can pull off being both a melodramatic perfectionist yelling at his team to get his performance as Mysterio right but still be completely intimidating as a psychopath willing to kill anyone to get what he wants. Plus Mysterio gets a fantastic Arkham Asylum style of nightmare sequence where he forces Spider-man in to one of his illusions. It's full of so much twisted and creative imagery that it rivals Doctor Strange for the trippiest sequence of the MCU.Though just like Homecoming, most of the films best moments comes from it being less of a superhero movie and more of a high school comedy. There's Ned who's still coming up with increasingly strenuous ways of keeping Spider-man's identity a secret.  And Brad the rival to Peter for the affections of MJ who has become far more butch than his classmates since he was one of the survivors of the snap.But the real stand out of Peter's school group is MJ, with the film cementing Zendaya as being the best on-screen version of Mary Jane. Largely because her nihilistic charm and random irreverent comments make for some of the funniest moments in the film. Plus Zendaya and Tom Holland have a great on-screen chemistry, largely because they genuinely see like awkward teenagers stumbling through their conversations and never sure of what to say to each other.Though in terms of capturing the character of Peter Parker from the comics, the MCU isn't quite there yet. Tom Holland is definitely the best on-screen version of the web slinger so far capturing both the quick wit of the web slinger and the relatable teenager that Stan Lee had always envisioned him to be. But a core aspect of the character has always been his ability and burden to overcome tragedy. They definitely make an attempt to capture this here with Tony Starks death casting a large shadow over the film, however through the films lighthearted nature it doesn't seem capable of reaching the heights of the franchises most memorable moments like Uncle Ben or Gwen Stacey which were essential building blocks for Spider-man in the comics. Holland has shown that he is capable of bringing dramatic weight to the character where he can, so I hope that the future films will be tonally confident enough to try capturing these moments.But for anyone who enjoyed Homecoming, Far From Home continues to capture the same humour whilst also upping the scale with some more ambitious sequences. It's a lighthearted epilogue to the epic scale of phase 3 of the MCU and a strong promise of the continued potential for the future of the post-Endgame MCU.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
329,KeremUlucay,A DELIGHTFUL SPIDER-MAN FILM,8,8 July 2019,"Honestly, Spider-Man: Far From Home has a lot of cool stuff. But in the same time, it has a few ridiculous parts. I can't tell because I don't want to give any spoilers.MCU goes stunning. I liked the way they explain how people see the events of Endgame, even it is not so realistic. Also this film has great connections with previous Marvel films. Especially, it is great to see that how people are grateful to Tony Stark and other heroes who sacrificed themselves.On the other hand, I liked how Tom Holland and director Jon Watts improved theirselves on their jobs. This franchise goes so realistic on Peter's character and his story. Peter's journey and his reactions to things that happening to him are just awesome. I can say that with no doubt: My Spider-Man is Tom Holland now, even though first trilogy has a special place for me. But there is a thing that I think Marvel should change it: Weird jokes during serious events. Recently, we can see this kind of things in some MCU movies and it is an obstacle on these scenes for being iconic. As an example, in Sam Raimi's trilogy, you can count lots of scenes which became iconic. But in Far From Home, there are no such scene even has potential to become iconic. While we watch Tobey Maguire, we can feel Peter's lover or friends are actually in danger. But in MCU, they prefer making a joke in these kind of scenes.Also, I really liked Mysterio and MJ. They have written very well. Jake Gyllenhaal and Zendaya are amazing. Those characters have some of the greatest scenes in this film.Finally, I can clearly say, Spider-Man: Far From Home has the best Spider-Sense scene and best visual effects in any Spider-Man movie. But I'm not sure that it is the best live action Spider-Man movie. I will watch every series all over again, then I will decide it.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
330,Venomage03,Spider-Man: Far From Home is a fun movie,6,30 May 2021,The story is good like the acting. Its very fun to watch. The villain is interesting. The CGI is on point. But this movie didn't really surprise me that much.,Spider-Man - Far from Home
331,TheEtherWalk,Great film about trusting ones self,10,10 July 2019,I've already seen this movie twice and I already want to see it again!! Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal absolutely nail their performances. The story is knowingly goofy but still heartfelt and carries on the great humor and character work established in Homecoming. Peter and MJ's relationship is unique and endearing. John Favreau also steals every scene he's in. JB Smoove's jokes didn't really land for me but it didn't bring the film down. The action is spectacular and worth seeing in 3D. The story has great twists and great themes about learning to trust ones own instincts and believe in ones self. Peter fully moves on from Tony's legacy and comes into his own in this film. In summary this movie has everything you want from a Spider-man film and from a great summer blockbuster. Go and see it!!!,Spider-Man - Far from Home
332,gerry_barnaby,"Rinse and repeat Spiderboy, cant call this spiderman",6,4 July 2019,"Likes: Right im not gonna jump on the bandwagon of Marvel fanboys who give this film a 10 out of 10, because it's far from a 10 out of 10 films. Let get real im, not a DC fanboy or a marvel fanboy, im someone that just loves movies, what I see from the new spiderman isnt good.Im not saying the film was Utterly bad there is the area in which this film is good like the acting and visual effects were good, there were a few moments through this film that was generally funny. The film does give some what of explanation to things that happened from the End game events.Iam kind of warming up to Tom Holland as Spiderman, but there is a lot of issues I have with this film, To be honest, the Film was great it was Meh! Jake Gyllenhaal does a great job with what he was given, Tom acting does portray someone that grieving, the action is great but this is all that good about this film, ending the phase 3, to start phase 4 of marvel it not a great start.Dislikes: There is a lot wrong with this film, One is a scene when a certain character give a coded message which made zero sense if you watch the end credit scene this was a major flaw in the film.The other issues where the fact the villian came off very weak written, even though Jake gave his best to deliver, I feel that Myteros origin change was necessary and felt more like a rehash of what has been done before in Iron man 3.The trailers didnt help the film iver as it shows to much of the film with spoilers, they didnt kind of bring that feminist comment slight in one scene which was a little cringe-worthy, as well as some of the humour which was funny the first time, but then repeating the same joke over and over through the whole film, it was just cringy and started to get boring.The main issue I have with this film which ive seen in a lot of Marvel movies is this rinse and repeat formula with almost every film ive seen, the only two I havent is infinity war and End game. Because if you compare Spiderman far from home with spiderman Homecoming, it's the same setup and formula as homecoming with a different villian which show a lack in imagination which is why this film came off Meh!The issue I see is they call this Spiderman, all im seeing is spider boy. There is nothing about this film that screams adult or Peter maturing, he the same kids that just want to have fun and be with his friends, this was all done in spiderman homecoming.The same thing has been written again with this film, which is a problem for the future of spiderman franchise, They seriously need to bring this spiderman into the adult world grow up and more mature because if they carry on with this childish safe writing for spiderman it gonna fall flat.We need more of what Toby and Garfield didnt with their spiderman film, not keep continuing this school theme crap, because this is what's wrong with this film, they need to write Tom Holland into a more adult spiderman because so far im not impressed with what I see.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

It was much better then Spider-Man: Homecoming which means this is now the best Spider-Man movie ever made, it is also in my top 5 for Marvel movies. I really liked how unlike every other Spider-Man movie, they actually left Queens. To make it even cooler, they traveled around Europe. The travel genre was something unique that Marvel hasn't done before, and I really liked it. I also liked how we got some good character development from Peter's friends, I am excited to see how they build off that in Spider-Man: No Way Home. Another thing I liked was how good Jake Gyllenhaal's acting was. He is a great actor, and he really brought that to his role as Mysterio. The visuals in this movie were amazing. The effects they used for the Elementals were some of the best I have ever seen, it was an amazing experience to see it in theaters. The last thing I liked about this movie was a plot, it was absolutely amazing, and it even had a huge revealing surprise that I won't spoil. I also won't spoil any of the plot, it was just that good.If you want to see what I am talking about, I recommend watching this movie. It was great in every way. I also love how it is leading into a phase 4 with the Credit Scene. I can't wait to what the future of Marvel has in store.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

337,wisemantonofski,A Charming Stand-Alone in the Franchise,7,13 September 2019,"Not many installments in the later MCU demonstrate how well its creators understand what the audience love about its characters but it's on full display here, hitting familiar notes of Spidey's chemical make-up while putting such a fresh spin on them as to be almost mistakable for original concepts. It may suffer from a romance that depends more on fan knowledge of the franchise than on-screen development, as well as a few examples of typically forced MCU humour and sporadic pacing, but the piece as a whole is an energisingly good time; tackling themes of duality and imposterism with a cleverly composed visual style, while remaining grounded and true to the previously established form of the series.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
338,MovieJunkie5,Good movie,7,19 July 2019,"It's a very good movie following Endgame. The Stark moments are simultaneously heartbreaking and comic, the plot is interesting and Gyllenhaal plays a very interesting character. Overall good movie",Spider-Man - Far from Home
339,T-ZER0,"Great Movie, But not as good as Homecoming",7,3 July 2019,"The sequel to the popular Spider-Man Homecoming takes place after Avengers Endgame, when Spider-Man is pressured with the task of being the next Tony Stark. Visual effects wise, this movie is better than the first. Storyline wise? It's a good story but the first was still better. I like the costumes for Mysterio and Spider-Man on this film. They did an amazing job on them. Speaking of which, Mysterio is done really well on this. Like most fans, I knew he was a crook all along. The funny thing was when I saw this in theaters, I found it amusing that most people in the audience fell for his tricks. They clearly never heard of Mysterio at all.
My big problem with the film is the love story. I know people will get angry at me for saying this, but Peter should have never been with Michelle. If you had the Spider-Man Homecoming app (Before it was the Spider-Man Far From Home app) you'll see that before Peter was into her, she was the weird girl who kept texting him every minute because Ned gave her his number. She would always call him names and just pester him. I don't know why Peter would fall for a girl who just bugs him every second on his phone, but it's a movie right? Most teens I am friends with ignore girls like that because they are annoying. But hey, I guess Zendaya's popular so we have to love her right??
The way Mysterio's gang is put together is as good as Vulture's gang, they are people who have a beef with Tony Stark. It makes sense, and it gives the characters purpose and a good story. So great movie, I will look for it on Blu-Ray, but not as good as the previous.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
340,rmarkd,"So, Spiderman Homecoming again",6,18 June 2020,"Seems like some of the same stuff as in Homecoming:
* Peter Parker likes girl who likes him, but the movie dances around getting them together while making it obvious that they'll get together.
* Main villain uses tech (alien tech vs Stark tech) to try to gain power. At least with Toomes, he was just trying to make a better life for himself and his family and got carried away. Beck, for some strange reason, wanted to conquer the world. His hologram thing could have made him billions (it's better than a friggin holodeck!), but nah, let's go all bond villain instead.
* Stark tech trying to provide comic relief voice-over. I hope this isn't going to be an ongoing theme.
* Peter balancing being a kid with being a superhero. I get it, he's in high school and there has to be some reason for his entourage for comic relief. Still, meh.
* Peter's gang for comic relief.Outside of that, the Peter/MJ thing just came out of nowhere and seems forced. MJ doesn't seem all that appealing of a character (arrogant, sarcastic, standoffish), yet two guys are after her? I do like the MJ character; I just don't see how the attraction came about.Peter's ""aw shucks"" character is starting to wear thin. I suppose we'll see that character change, and Tom Holland is great, but I just feel it's getting tiresome.Some of the comedic scenes just seemed forced. The bus scene with the kill drone was silly, as was the pants off scene.Yeah, MJ figured out Peter is Spider-man, but given they and Spider man were in DC, in Italy, in Prague, while Peter was nowhere to be found, I mean, that's not Sherlock Holmes level thinking.It's not all bad. Tom Holland is great and I hope to see his character mature. Special Effects were nice, the scene where Spider-man was in the illusion world was pretty neat, the high school gang had a couple of cute funny scenes. The Happy/Aunt May thing is cute-awkward and I enjoyed that. I was entertained but only mildly enjoyed, so a 6/10.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

The villain was very good at the level of the first one, the twist plot that he was actually a villain left me with his mouth open and I loved it. His plans were excellent and generated very tense and incredible scenes.A spectacular scene was when Mysterio used his drones to confuse Peter and not know where he is. It was the best scene and something very fresh and creative.In general the movie is at the level of the first and does not disappoint, giving us very good moments, great performances, futuristic technology, spectacular action scenes and the final twist plot is incredible.What will happen to Peter after what Mystery said?

342,mbhgkmsgg,Spider-Man: Far from Home,8,22 December 2020,"Spider-Man: Far from Home is the second Spider-Man film in the MCU and the final film in phase three. It follows a very similar style to Homecoming, and it works just as well in creating a funny and tremendously entertaining movie.I was a huge fan of casting Tom Holland as Spider-Man as soon as I had seen Homecoming. He is fantastic in the role, and feels the most like Spider-Man, out of all the actors that have played him. His performance in Far from Home is just as good, and as far as I'm concerned, the best thing in the film. Having watched some of his interviews, it's clear that a lot of his personality shines through in his performance and makes Peter Parker, as well as Spider-Man, genuinely feel like an awkward teenager. But thankfully, the supporting cast is also awesome. I especially like Ned, played by Jacob Batalon, who Holland has fantastic chemistry with. Most of the comedy comes either solely from Ned, or them together, and it all works. Indeed, I thought that Far from Home was a tremendously funny film. There were multiple laugh-out-loud moments, and the humour captured the awkwardness of teenage years perfectly, creating a surprisingly funny and lighthearted superhero film.This time, the story takes Peter and his friends on a school trip across Europe. Although he would like to enjoy his holiday and realize the plan he has made to woo MJ, things don't go according to plan. He soon realizes that he isn't going to get the holiday he was expecting, as an Avengers level threat is endangering the world and his friends. He, alongside a new hero from another dimension, Mysterio, must join forces to save the world from the new threat. However, Peter eventually finds out that Mysterio isn't who he has been claiming to be, and he is forced to save the world from someone he mistook for an ally.
While it isn't the most original story, and while a lot of it serves to tie any loose ends left behind by Endgame, it's a story that offers a bunch of great moments. And for those who love the MCU as a whole, myself included, Far from Home is a great way the end phase three and leave the road open to whatever might come in the future.With all that being said, I do have to admit that I'm a huge fan of the MCU and any films in it will probably receive a higher rating from me than they should. And that's also where a lot of the problems arise. Since the MCU is as far as it is, and has as many films is it does, it has reached a point where so much of the film's enjoyment comes from references to past events, that I genuinely feel like Far from Home would be quite unenjoyable if you went into it without having seen all the other films. While that is an unlikely scenario, it is, of course, possible, that fans of Spider-Man might only want to watch Spider-Man films and not an onslaught of other superhero movies. As such, it's hard to see Far from Home working as a standalone film, or even paired with Homecoming. There are so many moments, both funny and more serious, that rely on fairly extensive knowledge of the MCU, that even as a fan, I sometimes felt like I really had to dig around my memory to make the connections. But, that is also what makes the MCU so fantastic as a whole. No other film series has ever attempted anything as ambitious as the MCU and succeeded in it. And as a part of that universe, and for a fan like me, Spider-Man: Far from Home works wonders.This second instalment of these MCU Spider-Man films is as much another Spider-Man film, as it is a conclusion for phase three. It's the perfect companion piece for Endgame, and it leaves the saga in a place where it can go to any direction it wants to. But it's also a great sequel to Homecoming. With a familiar sense of humour, and a great cast all around, it really is a refreshing break from some of the far more serious films in the MCU, just like Homecoming was.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

345,Mara-Jade-Skywalker-23,"A Good Movie, Just As Good As Homecoming.",6,4 July 2019,"Intro:I had a fun time at the movies watching Spider-Man: Far From Home. I thought the villain was okay. I liked Tom Holland, and I even liked the romance, something the Spider-Man films had a hard time doing well. This film was the best to bridge the gap between Avengers: Endgame, and phase four of the MCU.Pros:Mysterio was an good villain, but in my opinion, he was no Vulture. He might even be my favorite of the villains. As we see him bond with Spider-Man, and have a hard time trying to kill him. Which is pretty interesting, but even still, he's willing to step over anybody to get to the top.I also like how his plan if pretending he's from another Earth, worked in the beginning. As in a world like that, people would believe something stupid like that.I also think Tom Holland is great as Spider-Man. I think his character arc, taking on the burden of Iron Man, really works.I also like that this film uses the Spider-Sense. As it was missing in the last film.I enjoyed the end credits scene as well. Where Mysterio gets the laugh, by revealing a video where he outs Peter as Spider-Man. And frames him for crimes.I thought Ned was hilarious in this film. And I like the character interactions and to romance in this film, as they all feel like teenagers. And the romance between M.J and Peter feels like a normal teen romance.Cons:The film has flaws however, such as, Mysterio's motives. He may have a good performance and I did like his character. His plan has some flaws, like, what would happen after his illusions work? Something would find out eventually. And also, he's evil because Tony Stark used his technology for a different purpose than intended, which is just weak, and feels like a rehash of Iron Man 3.The movie at times is also very rushed. Like Peter giving Edith to Mysterio right after the fight with the Elementals.And also, the film trying to trick us into thinking Mysterio is a good guy. It just didn't work for me.Conclusion:Spider-Man: Far From Home had it's issues, but I liked it overall. I think it could've been improved in many areas. But the people making the film, still made a descent fillm. It's one of my favorites of the year, but it was still a descent movie.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
346,cappiethadog,This is the third world,7,14 July 2019,"Nandang Karyas(Marlon Ramirez) has a job, a menial one, but it's the best that he can do. He helps out his sister Ludy(Nina Lorenzo) run a modest grocery store, which is really, to be honest, little more than a hole in the wall. It's not made clear if his sister pays him. He could be working for room and board. But still, that's better than the unemployed young men who sit on a bench outside their small business, layabouts smoking and drinking their days and nights away in a perpetual torpor, resigned, seemingly, to life passing them by without putting up any resistance. Nandang knows there is no future in Tondo. He has a plan, but it takes money to put that plan into motion, or else it's just dreams unfulfilled. Ludy's pretty friend stops by every day to shop for her mother. That's who Nandang wants to share his dreams with, or rather, his plan to get them out of Tondo. ""Insiang"", directed by Lino Brocka, played at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival, a first for the Philippines, which introduced the slums of Manila under President Ferdinand Marcos to an international audience. It was a cry for help. Nobody helped. Insiang(Hilda Koronel) also happens to be the girl's name. The conditions being what it is, deplorable and inhumane, forces Insiang to act in a transgressive manner as a method for survival. A scandal rocks their small world of barely-getting-by; the titular character has trouble at home, a bizarre love triangle, but Nandang doesn't care. Walking Insiang home, he confesses, against the backdrop of shanties upon shanties on an unpaved muddy road; he fools himself, believing that his goal to live ""far away from here; far away from all this trouble"" is plausible. Insiang lets her friend dream. It's not a plan. The young woman knows his lot in life, the day in, day out drudgery of being knee-deep in poverty and and the impossibility of escape, because she lives with the same hardship, too. Insiang saves the honesty for her mother. She deserves it. This is the real world. When the shopkeeper's assistant says ""far away from here,"" he means America, but down deep inside, the Tagalog-speaking daydreamer knows that his odds are slim. Down deep inside, Nanding knows he's going to die here.Just before their plane takes off, Ned Leeds(Jacob Batalon) advises Peter Parker(Tom Holland) to forget about Michelle(Zendaya). ""Europeans love Americans,"" he tells his best friend, Spider Man, who happens to be an Avengers candidate, a member of his school's Academic Decathalon team, and also a bachelor. Captain Marvel(Brie Larson) is available, but she's an alien. Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson) doesn't invite the extraterrestrial to Peter's orientation day in ""Spider Man: Homecoming"". She must be illegal. Captain Marvel is not a young American like Ned, a Filipino-American who is ""Far From Home"", which happens to be the United States, not the Philippines, where somebody like Nandang would love to have Ned's first world problem. He's a fat nerd. Even Peter Parker's life, despite the heavy lifting involved, beats stocking cans on a shelf. Instead of having a social life, Peter, essentially, a kid, is saddled with the grown-up responsibility of having to save the world over and over again. The first world is better, hands down. Ned, stuck on a broken Ferris wheel with Betty(Angourie Rice), his girlfriend, in Prague, watches Mysterio(Jake Gyllenhaal), with assistance from Night Monkey, a.k.a. Spider Man U.K., fight off the Fire Elemental, a monster composed of molten lava. The orange menace perishes when Quentin Beck uses his body as a cooling agent. Nandang is not the only one who would love to be a fat nerd.Julio Madiaga(Bembel Rico), the protagonist from ""Manila in the Claws of Light""(1975), considered by film buffs to be Lino Brocka's masterpiece(shown at Cannes in 1978), is a mere mortal doing a superhero's job. Julio's mission is to save Ligaya Paraiso(Hilda Koronel, again), his childhood sweetheart, from the machinations of the sex slave trade, which is, in a sense, scarier than Ned's calamitous predicament in ""Spider Man: Homecoming"", when the Chitauri grenade Peter told him to carry detonates at the Washington Monument. New to Manila, Julio, a Marinduque island native, takes on a construction job that pays two-and-a-half pesos an hour, if even that. Sometimes the contractor doesn't pay the laborers. He crashes the homes of friends for food and sleep. Ned, on the other hand, has enough money to build the Death Star with Lego. Like any privileged westerner, the overweight but supremely confident young man has problems like his third world counterparts, but it doesn't pass, both, the economical and sociological equivalency tests. Ned, albeit an American, is still a hyphenated one to some people, maybe even Betty. He hides his hurt when the pretty and pert blonde, who just survived a life and death situation with her supposed boyfriend, won't kiss him, claiming vomit as a deterrent to what should be potentially. a high romance moment. Ned should kiss her anyway. Vomit wouldn't stop Julio, with or without the breath mint that his American counterpart offers Betty. That's because Julio kisses other men as a job requirement. In order to survive, he becomes a ""call-boy"" for a short spell after the construction site foreman lays him off. Ligaya, just like her hometown beau, is every bit the same naive ""probinciano"". Back home, she buys the lies of Mrs. Cruz(Juling Bagabadlo), a sex trafficking recruiter, who promises the local island girls steady factory work and a paid-for education if they follow her to Manila, the city of dreams. In ""Spider Man: Homecoming"", Ned realizes his dream of being ""the guy in the chair"", Spider Man's sidekick. Ned helps his web-shooting friend track down Adrian Toomes(Michael Keaton) before he reaches Tony Stark's plane. Conversely, Julio is ""the guy in the bed"" with a client, dreaming not about America like Nandang, but the island of Marinduque, a place that now exists only in his mind's eye. There is no Spider Man to help Julio rescue Lianga from the man who keeps her prisoner at the Chua Tek Trading Company, nor an honest police department. Superheroes don't come to the aid of people in undeveloped countires.In ""Spider Man: Homecoming"", Ned, dateless at prom, follows Peter Parker out to the high school parking lot, belatedly, but in the nick of time. Spider Man is losing. Ned spots the misplaced web shooter and aims it toward the Vulture's minion, immobilizing the Chiaturi-powered gun in his hands with the sticky substance, just before Spider Man is about to be blown away at close range. In ""Spider Man: Far From Home"", it's not Peter Parker's best friend, but his former rival and tormentor, ""Flash""(Tony Revolori) who saves the day when he inadvertently helps Happy(Jon Favreau) locate the whereabouts of the American high schoolers by posting live updates from his Facebook account. Vulture, in ""Homecoming"", and Mysterio, in ""Spider Man: Far From Home"", arch-villains both, deliver soliloquies that have an incontrovertible political subtext. Toomes, in the former, rails against the one-percent, billionaire industrialists such as Tony Stark(Robert Downey). In the latter, Mysterio, as he lays dying, tells Peter that ""these days people will believe anything"". Eugene, who goes by the nickname ""Flash"", quite pointedly, is of Guatemalan descent. He is not a bad guy: Mysterio is. Quentin Beck utilizes holograms and advanced projector drones to create a menace that's not really there; it's all a big lie, the ultimate reality show, life and death hanging in the balance. Had Spider Man not put an end to Mysterio's staged chaos, these scare tactics, eventually, would have gotten somebody killed. ""Spider Man: Far From Home"", directed by John Watts, uses speculative fiction to interpret and extrapolate the notion of objective truth. CGI, just like misleading rhetoric, is nothing more than smoke and mirrors. Mysterio never was a hero. But he fooled Nick Fury, even Spider Man himself. It was MJ, like any good investigative reporter, kept her eyes and ears open at all times. She discovered Spider Man's true identity in ""Homecoming"". And in ""Far From Home"", instead of running away from danger, MJ hangs around, and notices the dropped projector in Venice. She picks it up. This action leads to the truth about Quentin Beck.He is not our superhero.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

This was a most enjoyable Spider-man movie. Tom Holland is perfect.The humor in this, apart from Jake Gyllenhaal's poor delivery of his several meant to be funny lines, was particularly wonderful.MAJOR SPOILER ALERT:My absolute favorite moment in the movie is when Spidey wakes up in jail with the three Dutch soccer hooligans.

I'm not even saying I dislike the movie, I am just confused that this movie is rated so highly. Anyways, this is a worthy sequel to Homecoming, and I think it was almost as good. The cast were just as good, or even better than in the first movie, the story was pretty good, nothing amazing, and Mysterio was a pretty weak villain, that was saved by Jake Gyllenhaal's amazing performance. Overall, this movie isn't as good as Spider-Man: Homecoming, but it is a pretty good end to the MCU's phase three.8.0/10.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
349,AleksandrBelenko,Even better than Homecomming!,10,11 July 2019,"Just got from the movies. Even though I picked up a lot of spoilers before seing the movie, still enjoyed it very much. (Thank you. Give me more!) I will try not to spoil it here though.
I do not understand why having 8.1 and now 8.0 this title is not near top 250. Probably because of top voters policy.... 6 years on this site still cannot understand the deal with voter's voice unequality...
Anyways, Tom Holand is the best Spidey and this movie is the best Spider-Man movie. Some might argue second instalation of Reimi's trilogy is the best one. I, personaly, not sure about that. I had so much fun watching it, even though the villain's true intentions are kinda obvious . We all know what kind of person Mysterio is, aren't we? So noone can spoil that part, yes?
The film relies a lot on comedy and after Endgame it is exactly what we need. Drama is still present, so it does not tilt to laughter all the way side.
The return of probably the biggest oponent of Spider-man is so much fun, and rises so many question to the future that protagonist holds in the MCU.
Zendaya is great as MJ, and mixed race cast is great overall in the movie. And does not feel obligated and SJW lobbied. ( Little Mermaid wink)
Finally, it is perfect modern Spider-man movie. Go to the cinema and watch it.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
350,mitchell5954,A Rough But Enjoyable Ride,7,5 July 2019,"Spiderman Far From Home is the second Spiderman film in the MCU, as well as the follow-up to the MCU's biggest movie, Endgame. So expectations were high for this, though not for me. I honestly wasn't looking forward to seeing this too much, but I'm happy to say I enjoyed it far more than I expected, especially at the end. This could be because my expectations were so low, but I do think this is a great improvement over Homecoming, though it's still far from perfect.As I said, my expectations weren't high for this film, because I'm one of the few who were disappointed by Homecoming, and thought it was pretty bad. The trailers for this made it seem like it was more of the same from the last one. Also, Spiderman's track record for movies in general hasn't been great. Sam Raimi's Spiderman 2 is still objectively the best one. My personal favorite is the first Sam Raimi Spiderman film mainly due to nostalgia. It's the first superhero film I saw in the theatre, and made me a Spiderman fan. The movie still has a sense of charm to it as well. I enjoy Into The Spiderverse. It's the best Spiderman film since Spiderman 2.However, Spiderman 3 and The Amazing Spiderman films are awful. Spiderman Homecoming was a massive disappointment for me. I gave it a positive review when it came out, because I desperately wanted to like it as it was Spiderman finally in the MCU, and everyone else was singing the film's praise. But the more I thought of it the more I grew to dislike it.While this film is a big improvement over Homecoming, it still has some of the same problems as that film. The first act was fairly boring. Aside from a couple good fights, most of it was the same high school drama and hijinks from the last film, which I could care less about. The humor still isn't that funny. Peter's friends and teachers are still as annoying and uninteresting as they were in the last film, and they're all major characters here. Peter and MJ's relationship doesn't do much for me. Though, to be fair, all of the Spiderman films have handled the romance angle poorly.Another issue is the follow-up from Endgame. This film doesn't take place long after Endgame, yet, aside from the exposition scene at the beginning, the world feels exactly the same as it was before Infinity War. What? Half the population was snapped from existence for five years. Now, just because everyone all came back the world just returns back to the way it was overnight? I'm sorry, no!What was greatly improved on were the action scenes. I found the action in Homecoming to be pretty lackluster, with mediocre to subpar special effects. Here Jon Watts, the director, vastly improved his stills on how to shoot action competently, and the effects are miles better as well.Tom Holland is still great as Spiderman. That hasn't changed. I also liked Peter way more in this than Homecoming. His character arc was done better. He has trouble balancing his normal life with being Spiderman, and he has to become more responsible and step up to the mantle. It's very similar to his arc in Homecoming, but it was done better here. I sympathized with Peter's plight much more here.Like with Homecoming, the best aspect of this movie is the villain. Michael Keaton as The Vulture was the best part of Homecoming (arguably one of the only good things), and Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio. His costume and abilities are great, and straight from the comics, and Gyllenhaal, unsurprisingly, gives an amazing performance. The fight between him and Spiderman in the second act especially is amazing. It's the comic come to life.Also, the post credit scenes are a must watch, especially the first one. Usually the post credit scenes for these are mostly unnecessary, but that's not the case here. I'll even say this has the best post credit scenes in the MCU since The Avengers, or maybe even Iron Man.Overall, Far From Home was a fun Spiderman movie, and a fun film in general. The beginning is rather slow, and the side characters aren't engaging, but it does really pick up by the second act.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Tom holland and Jake gyllenhaal stole the show. . I was hoping for some more minutes in Maria Hill's screentime. now let's begin with the bad things. The plot is a bit messed and some things are unexplained. Jokes failed at times and the Mysterio's past is lame. Some scenes were unreal for a spiderman movie and the cgi was over used .The post credit scenes were the best in entire mcu and they blew my mind.

Not only does it do this far more successfully than I could have imagined, yet it adds so much more to the film. From unexpected plot twits to silly romance.

362,hfreinoso,Dissappointed,1,21 September 2019,"I was a guest when I went to watch this movie on the big screen. I saw the trailers and I knew (IMO) it was going to suck ass. So I went to watch and it was really predictable boring and pathetic. I left the theater. Now let me tell you I LOVE SPIDER-MAN, he was a childhood hero that I could relate to. I am 20 years old and I still could reflect myself on this character, I really do. In the movies with Tobey Maguire, Miles Morales and heck Andrew Garfield I could reflect myself with their versions of Peter Parker. But with Tom I just can't. Everything that Peter does in this movie is really just pathetic. Like wanting to be an Avenger in the first film, now he just wants to go on vacation. Tony Starks death in Endgame doesn't affect Peter anymore... Yeah... How does this affect Peter... he grieved, sure, but he said he wants to go on vacation and date MJ (Michelle Jones){P.S how does Peter like Michelle now. In Homecoming she like Peter, which was obvious... but here it's vice versa. WTF]. That doesn't mix I am sorry. And with Mysterio Holy Shit he gives Mysterio the glasses Tony GAVE TO HIM to save the world, only 10 minutes they talk and he decides to give it to him. And his otive is nothing but embarrassing, casue of Tony Stark again. I could understand Vulture, in Homecoming, but with Mysterio again the same reason...really???) I don't understand Peter Parker in the MCU, he is an idiot. He doesn't know what ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility"" (OH Wait I forgot they decide to get rid of Uncle Ben in this universe. For no at all reason...morons) This Peter doesn't grow, he doesn't really change like at all. I don't see him becoming a man, he doesn't grow or change. I knew this movie was going to suck, and I was right, it sucked (IMHO). The only good things in this movie is the action scenes, like that's it, that's all I could say. The MCU ruined the character, and I was sick of it. This isn't Spider-Man, this isn't his actions, this doesn't feel like Spider-Man at all feels like Iron Man Web 2.0.

Tom Holland also did a good job as usual and can I just say that these are probably some of the highest stakes for a Spider-Man film? It got pretty intense at the end and the end credits scenes were mind blowing and genuinely made my entire theatre gasp in shock. Aside fromt hose moments, this was movie was a lot funnier than Homecoming, especially at the start of the movie. Not spoiling anything here, but they basically they go over the events of Endgame from the perspective of a high school student to just act as a pallette cleanser after Endgame wiped the floor with our tears and it really works. Overall, this was a great time and certainly better than Homecoming, and I can't wait to see what Phase 4 of the MCU has in store after those credits scenes.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

368,byson5186,Best Peter Parker/Best Spider-Man Movie,10,8 July 2019,"I'm going to start off with a comparison, as I've talked with other people about this movie and they had some of the same opinions I have, even in comparison to the other Spider-Man movies. To start off, there have been a lot of Spider-Man movies. We can remember the Sam Raimi movies from the 2000s where Peter Parker was Tobey Maguire. Mary Jane Watson was Kirsten Dunst, and Aunt May Parker was played by an elderly woman. I ought to say, I seriously can't believe how long it's been since those movies came out, already more than a decade. For one, watching it even back then in 2002, I thought it had some flaws and was overrated, still a good movie. A couple of flaws, one is while the 2002 Spider-Man didn't say the year it was, even when I first saw it, I thought it looked like it took place before the time it was made 2001/2002 as I noticed they didn't even mention the internet. Another flaw, is while Tobey Maguire isn't a bad actor I thought he seemed a little old, mature, and serious for the Peter Parker Role. He reminds me of Billy, the Blue Power Ranger in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. In Spider-Man, Maguire could play a geek, though I thought the way he showed emotion didn't exactly seem realistic. His relationship with Mary Jane Watson, didn't always seem so real, mostly a neighborhood girl he was attracted to, and got along with, but I feel like it barely showed chemistry between those two like they were a good couple together. Those original Spider-Man movies were great movies though, and I think they should do a Spider-Man 4 with the original cast where we could find out what they're supposedly up to years later?We have 2 Amazing Spider-Man movies with Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker. I feel like they should have just skipped those, especially since there'd be new Spider-Man movies with a new Peter Parker that would come out shortly after these ones did. I thought this Peter Parker was a cooler Peter Parker than Tobey Maguire, though he was also old for the part as a High School Student. I also thought the chemistry between him and Gwen Stacey, was more real than between Parker and Watson in the original Spider-Man movies. They might not be your favorite Spider-Man movies, but they're still entertaining!!Now, Spider-Man is a hero alongside The Avengers. The Avengers eventually added Spider-Man to their franchise. We now have Tom Holland play Spider-Man. Like a lot of people I've talked to, we agree he's the best Peter Parker. I mean for one, he's a younger Peter Parker. He isn't as much of a nerd as Tobey Maguire, or as cool as Andrew Garfield. Though, he is quirky and funny. He's younger and gives more of a feel of being a High School Student than those other 2. He also gives more of a feel of being an inner-city character. His Aunt May isn't the elderly woman we think of as Aunt May. He fights alongside The Avengers, and rather than in the original Spider-Man movies where he tries to save NYC from villains created by the technology of Oscorp, he is like a regular High School student fighting alongside the Avengers, saving the World from Avengers villains.I'll be honest, that I saw Spider-Man Homecoming, and didn't like that movie, feeling like it was too dull and focused too much on Special Effects, not plot or relatable world. But, this movie was so much better!! For one, as you can tell by the trailer, they spice things up. Rather than Spider-Man being an NYC hero, ""Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man,"" we see him travel to Europe with his classmates, where we see European culture and scenes in Venice, probably the biggest Hollywood movie ever shot in Venice, Italy. It gave a feel of traveling to Europe with classmates. I thought there was more realistic chemistry between him and the Mary Jane Watson character. The action was incredible, not something to bore you, but something to keep you watching. The allusion scenes were absolutely incredible, at times it was hard to know exactly what was going on?Another thing to mention is as I mentioned there should be a Spider-Man 4 with the original cast, taking us back to the Spider-Man we first knew, we see one of the original cast members of Spider-Man in a cameo. I won't say who, but I'll say we'll recognize him and feel like he acts just like his character in the original movies.The endings during the credits hinted a sequel. This movie is good enough where you want to see a sequel, you're anxious to find out what is going to happen next? Go Spider-Man, you belong in the Avengers Universe!! I rank this movie a 10/10!",Spider-Man - Far from Home
369,clock_me,not as good as homecoming,4,3 July 2019,"Really looking forward to this new spiderman movie loving homecomingbut alas it was not nearly as good spent to much time with him trying to get with mary jane

also by the last 2p mins I was so board and un entertained I was ready to just turn it off and then at the the last 10 minutes we finally see peter like in the homecoming actually coming and finally and I mean finally doing something about the villain
with homecoming it was fast funny and had a great villain but this is no home coming it was like iron man 2 and that's not good only one joke actually landed and the others just flew over my head and another thing that was really annoying is how many time they refence iron man in this movie even thou he died in endgame I say leave him alone and just end it and stop trying to get us to feel more sorry he has passedAlso spider man suit is to robotic and not anything like the original suit which means he gets l his powers except his super strength and senses from the suit and he really is annoying in this one I miss Toby maguire he is and always be the only true spider man",Spider-Man - Far from Home
370,winstonsmith_84,"Wow, really good!",8,5 June 2021,"Didn't hear too much about this one but as a lifelong Spiderman fan I gotta say this really made me smile. It had that perfect Spiderman formula of awkward teenager trying to save the world down to perfection really. Mysterio was well done, his origin, the actor, the way he created illusions. All well done. The ending... wow... and I mean, not the ending but the ending ending if you know what I'm saying. What a surprise.Ok, onto the things that have really been working. I liked Peter Parker in all his iterations in the comic book... from awkward teen to a man married to MJ. But this movie version of Spidey is my favourite so far. He just feels right. MJ is much different from the comics, but I like the totally new spin on her. It works and brings a new freshness to her character that I quite like and a little bit of a modern spin on her (she's also an awkward nerd) and I like that. The side characters such as the teachers and other students were done really well.So I gotta say, the formula is just... working! Looking forward to more Spidey!",Spider-Man - Far from Home
371,scott-sw,Spider-Man Returns with More Hits than Misses,7,21 August 2019,"Spiderman Far from Home is the last of the MCU Phase 4, finally bringing the end to the 23 film saga. Fortunately, the closing is far from being a bore, but also far from the perfection.
Our favorite nerdy super-hero, Peter Parker, has returned to his high school in Queens, along with all the others who were snapped out of existence by Thanos during Avengers, Infinity War. Yes, some of his friends did continue and became five years older. Amazingly, we are left to believe that all of his friends such as Mary Jane, Ned, and Flash were all part of the glitch. And the world is mourning the loss of Iron Man. Someone needs to take his place.
The clique is on its way to Europe. Peter (Tom Holland) is looking forward to getting a little time-off and getting to know Mary Jane (Zendaya) more. So deadest on this quest, he ditches some calls from Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson), infuriating the SHIELD agent. Peter also has doubts about Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) dating his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei).
However, Peter finds out trouble will follow him wherever he goes. While in Europe, some creatures called the Elementals stage attacks against some European cities where Peter's friends are. Fury brings Peter in to meet Quentin Beck/Mysterio, (Jake Gyllenhall). He is an agent from another Earth dimension, tracking the elementals, and needing to eliminate them. He asks Spidey for some help - and he gets it.
Still, it is not quite enough to do the trick. While they seemingly defeat the alien entities, Peter realizes that something does not add up. It is mostly with Quentin, who is not who he appears to be. Now it is up to Spidey to defeat the charlatan, Mysterio.
I must get my flaws out first - because Far from Home has them. The first one is the padding. The movie is probably thirty minutes too long - mostly dedicating needless scenes to peril and laughs that do not move the plot. The guiltiest scene was that of Peter trying to figure out Tony Stark's glasses, which are an engineering miracle. Peter accidentally launches a strike against Flash Thompson (Tony Revolori), so he has to stop it. Another has him put in an embarrassing situation with another SHIELD agent that Flash Thompson witnesses.
The other flaw in this one relates to the source material. Although a fan of Spiderman comics, I am not a purist. It is plain to see that if Peter Parker was in modern-day Queens, the characters of Ned Leeds, Flash Thompson, and Mary Jane could very well be minorities. However, the characters of Aunt May and Mary Jane Watson are betrayed. Mary Jane had a super-outgoing personality coupled with strength and confidence - but Zendeya plays it with emo, attitude, and smarminess. Marisa Tomei plays Aunt May as an outgoing, sexy older woman who is more selfish for her own interest. The original Aunt May was selfless, strong, quiet, and reserved. And it seems EVERYONE realizes Peter is Spidey faster than Lois Lane realized who Clark Kent really was!
Also, it seems like Peter Parker took a step back from what he wanted in Homecoming. In that movie, he wanted to be treated like an adult by Happy and Tony. He desired hero status, and wanted to do bigger things. In this film, he wants to be more like a kid and not have those responsibilities. Finally, since when can someone dupe Nick Fury as Quentin did?
However, there is a lot to like about this movie. First is Tom Holland who plays the character with such Ernst. He makes Peter complicated, conflicted, and confused. He has to finally take initiative in order to protect the people he loves. This was much appreciated as Andrew Garfield played the part with too much emo, depression, and reactionary.
Another strength, of course, are the special effects. As with most MCU movies, they do not take precedence over story, but rather add flavor to it. Furthermore, one particular scene laced with confusion and bizarre imagery matches what the Mysterio character was all about in the comics. It is truly mesmerizing.
Far from Home does have a lot of misses, but the hits are rock solid. Probably the biggest shot-in the arm comes in a post-scene cameo that should have an audience clapping and laughing at the same time as an old Spiderman staple returns.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
372,hooma814,Just another spiderman movie! Still worth a watch,6,19 April 2020,"Spider man far from home was interesting enough from beginning to end. Once you've watched all the marvel movies it seems weird to leave one out. But this is in no way as good as Gaurdians or Thor Ragnarok. Although it's still much better than the Incredible Hulk or early Thor or Captain America movies.Tom Holland is pretty much only motivated by his sexual drive the whole movie. It seemed a but naive for a superhero to try and care so much about holding onto his former life.The supporting characters didnt really add much to the movie. Happy and Aunt May's relationship seemed a but unessecary as did Ned and his girlfriend. The cliche ferris wheel scene was a bit frustrating not seeing the writers come up with something a bit more fresh or smart. Nick Fury and Maria Hill were a bit hit and miss. Maria looked like she was quite sick throughout the movie, so much I wondered if she was a hologram, maybe because she was the green aliens from Captian Marvels story?Jake Gyllenhaal was a bit random, he didnt seem particularly scary or powerful. The movie itself also had a few plot holes. How did Tom Holland get to Berlin from Prague so fast? Or how was the video released at the end credits? what did I miss?Overall it was not great. But the technology used by the drones kept it new and fresh. As did the Europe spend up going from big cinematic shot to the next. Obviously banking on a big return from Endgame and feeling licence to trip all around. Although it made for fun watching recognising some of the places I'd been.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

I like it, it's solid and it's still one of the best Marvel movies, but it wasn't as good on a repeat viewing. With the original fresh in my mind going into the sequel, I was a little nervous that I wouldn't think that it was as good as I remembered the first one being either. However, I think Far From Home might be better than Homecoming. That's still my first impression, it may change with time, but as it is right now this is right up there with Homecoming as one of my favourite Marvel movies. Far From Home acts as both a sequel to Homecoming and an epilogue to Avengers Endgame. What is the world like after *spoiler*? What is the world like without *spoiler*? How has *spoiler's* *spoiler* affected the world and Peter Parker? This film explores that. The comedy is hilarious, the characters are all loveable with great performances, the story is engaging and this movie probably has the most creative and thrilling action and effects out of any of the Marvel movies since Doctor Strange. The story of this movie has a lot of twists and turns and I don't want to give anything away, but if you've seen the trailers or even read the title, you know it's about Peter Parker going on a school trip to Europe. It's so great to finally see Spider-Man get out of New York in his own standalone movie and see all the cool stuff he can do in other cities. It was great. The big twist near the end was pretty predictable if you know anything about the comics, but the post-credits scenes are amazing and make me beyond excited to see what becomes of them in future movies! Overall, this is a must-see for any Marvel fans, but even if you aren't one this is a solid action-comedy with a lot of humour and a lot of heart for the whole family. Highly recommended.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

375,DeadMansTrousers,Tom Holland remains the greatest to ever wear the suit!,9,2 July 2019,"Tom Holland truly encapsulates the perfect version of Peter Parker/Spider-Man. I personally enjoyed Homecoming a little more than this one, but this one is still extremely enjoyable. The fight scenes don't drag and the humor is perfectly timed. Gyllenhaal did a great job interrupting the character of Quentin Beck/Mysterio and it was great to watch him act along side of Holland, they had some great scenes together. I think one of the best parts of this film though was the growth of Zendaya's MJ and I definitely look forward to seeing the next installment of these films.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

378,Benslie,Great sequel and follow up to Endgame,10,2 July 2019,"First of all, I thought there was no way of topping the whole Avengers Assemble fight scene from the end of Endgame but this movie comes pretty close to it. Jon Watts the director does some creative things to keep the audience invested. There is one fight scene that shows this creative style perfectly and trust me when I say it never gets boring. All of the shots are perfectly in frame so you know what's going on and where to focus your attention. Just like in the first movie all of the actors give it their all. Okay, I will admit that this sentence is probably biased because Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays Mysterio, is my favourite actor of all time but honestly he's amazing in this role. You can see him just giving it his all in this role from beginning to end. I can honestly admit that this is probably my favourite role I have ever seen him in. But the main showstopper performance was Tom Holland. Once again he plays Peter like an actual teenager who is going through grief. In every scene, you can see him questioning everything and not knowing what to do anymore because Tony isn't there anymore to help him out. After seeing him in this role I can say he definitely the best Spider-Man. Everybody else was great too and I'm happy that certain people stayed in the background. This movie doesn't overdose itself with humour and I'm happy with that because after Endgame I don't want a lot of humour in this film. But at the same time, there is some humour that was acceptable. There are 2 great post-credits scenes that you need to see especially because one teases Spider-Man 3. In the end, Spider-Man: Far From Home is a great sequel that took what was great about the first movie and improved it.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
379,richarddillomes,I'm walking into spiderwebs so leave a message and I'll call you back,8,29 July 2019,"Spiderman: Far From Home takes place right after the 'blip' where 50% of the population was wiped out then returned five years after the events of Endgame. This is briefly touched on when we see Peter and his crew are now in the same class as those who were 5 years behind them having caught on while they have not aged a single day. The movie could've taken a darker turn but this being a summer release and it's protagonist is still in high school, we're treated to seeing Peter needing a vacation and a break from all the superheroing (remember he had to be saved by all the women in Avengers, still one of the coolest sequence in Endgame) and the mourning of Tony Stark's passing. Let the kid be a kid for once I say and let's join him on his (mis)adventures across Europe (cue in heavy sigh of relief heard from New Yorkers.)Having found a second chance at life, he takes the opportunity to let his feelings known for MJ (short for Michelle Jones and not MJ Parker, seeing how casting a black girl for a mermaid has gotten people throwing a hissy fit) when they get to Paris. He enlists the aide of his reliable sidekick Ned (played perfectly by Jed Batalon) only to end up in one hilarious mishap after another for where would be the fun if everything went smoothly? Tom Holland is charming as Peter Parker and I would like to say he might even be this generation's answer to Michael J. Fox. Speaking of, he will need all the charm he can muster up because we've seen so many incarnations of Spiderman (Tobey Maguire: 3 movies, Andrew Garfield: 2 movies, and we've already seen Tom Holland in 4 movies before we even got to this sequel) and to some, fatigue is starting to set in. Zendaya is great as per usual, and with that face of hers and how confidently in charge she is of her career we should expect more from her in the years to come. I couldn't separate Jake Gyllenhaal from his role as Mysterio, like I think he's too serious of an actor to be here, especially in a movie centered for teens but he put in a good work, something to show his kid in the future that he can be cool too. But taking a quick look at his instagram he seems to have enjoyed his time so yes I still think he's doing it for the nieces, nephews and future kids, and now also so he won't feel left out when friends Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds don their costumes for their holiday photos. Lastly, it's nice to see Marisa Tomei logging in more minutes, and we should see more of her in the 3rd installment after the big reveal in the mid-credits. There's a lot more supporting actors that did well here so much so that I'm starting to doubt whether Tom can carry the movie on his own (Tony Stark in Homecoming, Nick Fury and Happy Hogan here.)Just when I'm about to declare Spiderman as a boring hero (nothing flashy, just spiderwebs and what Aunt May calls the 'Peter tingle'), the fight sequences here makes you reconsider so kudos to the fight scene choreographer. The writer and visual effects people also did good, for I having read a couple of Spiderman titles was thinking how can they make this boring villain interesting, which they did. Also worth commending is how timely it touches on believing what you're seeing and the proliferation of fake news (see mid credits, with a nostalgic cameo.) As Mysterio said in the movie: People... need to believe. And nowadays, they'll believe anything. So don't believe me when I say Marvel has another hit on their hands. Go out and see it.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
380,mjplysaght,A decent film; Holland is a worthy candidate of the friendly neighbourhood Spiderman,7,9 July 2019,"Tom Holland's second solo outing as Spiderman. A big undertaking, considering that this is directly following the conclusion of the Avengers Infinity Saga. Now, for starters, there's no way in hell that this film would match the larger than life standards and stakes of Endgame.That being said, what we're presented with is an entertaining and occasionally compelling character story, where Spiderman is trying to balance his two lives, as schoolkid and superhero respectively. Nothing we haven't seen before, but there's the different spin thrown in of Peter Parker trying to come to terms with Tony Stark's death from the previous film. There are obvious parallels to Uncle Ben here but I feel this deviation works just as well.The film is more or less a glorified publicity video for European tourism with added superheroes, as Parker and his class go on a Eurotrip through Venice, Prague, Berlin and London. Jake Gyllenhaal is introduced as Mysterio, a mysterious character, as the name would suggest, and Nick Fury returns, attempting to give Parker some tough love when it comes to his struggles between his two lives.For the most part, the film serves as an adequate extension of the MCU, post-Endgame. Tom Holland's performance as Peter Parker is fairly stellar and has great onscreen chemistry with his co-stars such as Zendaya, Jacob Batalon, Gyllenhaal and Samuel L Jackson.The stereotypical millennial tropes such as the constant livestreaming from Flash the bully was kinda grating though. It's a given that Marvel would need to update the teenage lifestyles of the younger characters to the current year, but I still find some of the aspects cringy.The mid credits scene caught me by surprise, with the return of JK Simmons, but the end credits scene felt completely unnecessary.In conclusion, this was a fun film with a lot of action and good performances from the cast members. Not exactly award-worthy but it's decent nonetheless.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
381,jackson_ro,Spider-Man: Far from Home,8,5 July 2019,"Wow, MCU is back with a bang. Love how the first movie back is about Spider-Man and how they are able to immediately transition from a movie with such grand scales into Spider-Man's field trip. I can honestly say Tom Holland is perhaps the best Spider-Man casted, unfortunately the same could not be said for the rest of the cast. Regardless, the film is able to carry on the torch seemingly seamlessly while still reminiscing the good old days. After more than a decade, MCU truly feels like an universe we all live in. The movie is also able to cram what feels like two plots into one movie, making the entire experience action packed, but still making us care about each and every character. Also the Easter Egg at the end is spot on and I believe it is safe for me to say that everyone is just excited for the next entry. I had questions after End Game, but after seeing this I believe we are in good hands, the folks at Marvel Studio does not and will not disappoint.PS: Still REALLY not a fan of whoever plays MJ. Growing up reading The Amazing Spider-Man, I think MJ's look is supposed to be cannon, this is really disappoint. But good to see Mr. Jameson at the end!!!",Spider-Man - Far from Home
382,darkwizard404,Another great addition to the MCU,8,3 July 2019,"This movie was great! Just as good as I had expected and some parts exceeded my expectations. I loved the change of setting from NYC to Europe and the plot of this film is the highlight.Coming to performances, Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal were fantastic. The whole movie belonged to the two of them. I'm so glad Gyllenhaal finally decided to step out of his usual dramatic crybaby roles and portray a different character for once. I hope he continues to do more action packed roles in the future. Samuel L. Jackson was great as usual with his epic dialogues. The rest of them did great in their respective roles except Zendaya.The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the unrealistic romance between Parker and MJ. Zendaya has a long way to go in terms of acting. She's the only one in the movie who didn't live up to
the expectations. The MJ we know is not the one shown in the movie hence I was disappointed. Maybe they'll introduce the original redhead MJ in the future and I really hope they do. The comedy was great and the jokes were hilarious.Overall it was a fun superhero film with lots of plot twists and great direction from Jon Watts.

384,shimenpf,Flawed script,6,10 July 2019,"The film per se is not bad. It achieved what one would expect from a Marvel movied. However, I think if fails in two of the most crucial moments of the film. First, the revelation: Mysterio is evil. It could've never been predicted with the information provided by the film, and it was too complicated and needed to explain a lot of stuff for it to make sense, which felt forced instead of shocking. Second, the climax, where Spidey fights Mysterio. We're shown at the beginning very briefly that Peter's 'tingle' has been failing. In the final battle, he relies 100% on it to defeat the villain. From the 'doesn't work' point to the 'I rely on it 100%', there's no arc, no change, no justification as to why it didn't work before and it does now. Therefore, it again feels forced and kind of a Deus Ex Machina. The comedy was good and most of the film was alright, but these two pivotal moments really marked the movie for me.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
385,ryanwinning1,Can't wait for the next Spiderman Movie!!,9,8 July 2019,"Spiderman has always been my favourite super hero of all. I can really relate with the part of him that is constantly doing everything in his power to help people despite barely being able to make ends meet in his personal financial situation. I've enjoyed every spiderman movie made to date (Even Spiderman 3), but this series with Tom Holland is truly heading in the direction that is truly inspired by the comic books. I mean it's a totally new twist to have Tony Stark and Happy mentor young Parker into the responsible super hero of the future, but the creativity is finally on par with Stan Lee's vision. Stan would be really proud of this movie if he was here to see it.I think Mysterio is one of the harder villains to make a whole movie around, but this director pulled it off, and once again I was blown away by some of the CGI scenes. I watched this in AVX in the Dbox seats and the scenes where Mysterio is using his illusion technology is like entering a whole other world the way the surround sound kicks in, and takes the viewer to another place.The last 2 actors to play spiderman were good, but Tom Holland is the first to truly capture the teenage kid who has this incredible power, yet still struggling in social situations amongst his peers. It makes for such an entertaining ride to see a kid that can save a city from super-villains, but can't find the words to ask a girl to go on a date! There's a lot on Peter Parkers plate in this movie and the director really does a great job of making this enjoyable and unpredictable for the viewer!!",Spider-Man - Far from Home

If there are no more spiderman movies, it will be no great loss.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
387,urthpainter,"Redundant and Derivative, Spider-Man: Far from Home is truly a bad movie",3,20 September 2019,"I thought this movie was supposed to be good! Imagine my surprise when not only is it a bad movie, but I was cringing at the dialog, cringing at the frivolous situations and (openly calling out) the blatant predictability of the story. I couldn't even watch this as an unintentional comedy - Spider-Man: Far from Home has very few redeeming qualities. I'd rank this down with the worst of Comic films, perhaps setting a new low.Spider-Man: Far from Home is another Marvel film that's IMDB rating is too high - this one is slowly coming down (as it should), as this movies merit is bringing in >5 reviews. I admit - this isn't going to be a great analytical review. This is more of an ax to grind against the current low standard of many AAA films, especially those in the comic sub-genre.To be fair - I dislike every single thing about this movie except a couple of the performers... but their talent is completely wasted with bad writing and uninspired direction. This movie starts out with a disjointed scene, then doubles down on nonsense exposition for about the next 15 minutes - only to get to the point about 20 minutes in... the problem? The point of this movie? Isn't very interesting! And as a movie that relies on effects and action? Neither effects nor action are that special or well thought out once these scenes begin to unfold.Just as a reminder to anyone who may of forgot - A movie should never be made like a TV show. A film is a unified, singular experience where everybody involved puts in max effort to make the best feature presentation possible. A TV show is a serial experience that generally depends upon content that has come before and then sets up what will come after. Spider-Man: Far from Home is another episodic, TV style project by Marvel. It is ironic that in the golden age of TV, most Marvel movies have gone to a TV style approach - the problem? They are forgetting to hire talented writers! Or the Marvel producers Want their movies to be dumb. Maybe they do! The dialog of Spider-Man: Far from Home is Childish in the worst possible way - it patronizes the audience, assumes they are idiots and offers zero intrigue or challenge.There are some things done right - even though the effects are not great by today's standard, the movie does have a nice bright look. Action is easy to follow, and by and large the cinematography is pretty good. But when so many conceptual elements suck so badly - the quality technical work just makes the movie less likable. If the production was up to the same standard as the writing, this movie would of cost $50,000 to make. Think about that for a second. Funny thing is? I'd watch that movie, and it probably would be more entertaining to see how a budget this small could be stretched to try and tell this story.Which might get to the heart of this movie's issues - too much bloat. Overpaid performers, directors, and crew funded by rich producers expecting a payoff by making a redundant film. I'm not surprised, and really no one else should be - but for a person with any sense of quality filmmaking - that says this is a good movie? You need to watch a good movie, then re-watch this garbage and get your head right. Don't be afraid to call out terrible filmmaking just because of fanaticism or some other ulterior reason. Be objective - Please!",Spider-Man - Far from Home
388,theemuhammede,"First half was rough, second half was much better",7,3 July 2019,"I tried not to get myself excited for this movie as I waited for the release date. This was a result of Avengers: Endgame and its outcome. I did not want to get my hopes up for anything so I did not follow too much of the media coverage for this movie; it was the right choice.The first half of the movie had a little good, and a lot of bad. I liked how they explained the outcome of all the snaps that took place between Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. I did not like Peter Parker's actions though. He was being selfish and did not really want to be Spider-Man so he kept on failing. It reminded me to Tony Stark in Iron Man 3. I also did not like how they kept on going back to Iron Man now being dead; it was done way too much.The second half was much better because of Mysterio. He was the right choice for the next villain to emerge after the plot of Avengers: Endgame. His illusions were so visually gratifying and catchy. The ending of the movie was really catchy. Mysterio made it seem like he purposely did what he did to catch Spider-Man and expose him. There were also many connections and throwbacks to previous movies like Iron Man and Captain America: Civil War. That is something that Marvel does really well; they perfected the skill of expanding the story and connecting the dots among multiple movies.I would definitely see this movie again. I would just need to be able to appreciate the first half a bit more than what I already do.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Being from the UK myself I loved seeing my favourite hero appear in England for the first time on the big screen. It's a great setting for a Spider-Man story and I love the story that is told in this one. Mysterio is a great villain to adapt in live action and I think they pulled it off quite well. Tom Holland and Jake Gyllanhall are great on screen together and the performances are great in this film. The effects are really good also, probably some of the best in a marvel movie. I like that the stakes are way bigger in this one compared to the first one, it's a much bigger scale of movie. The editing and cinematography are fantastic aswell. It's a really well made movie and a great sequel and follow up from Avengers: End Game. I loved this movie!",Spider-Man - Far from Home
390,WooderIce64,"Different, but still fun",7,21 May 2020,"After the events of Endgame, the MCU turns a new page and moves on to its next slate of films, with Spider-Man: Far From Home being our first look at post-Endgame Marvel. (Although it is still technically part of Phase 3) I will give Marvel credit for not jumping straight into the next Infinity Stones arc, as this movie doesn't bring in any sort of new Thanos-tier villain or major idea. What it does do is focus on Peter after he returns from the Snap and how he's affected by the death of Tony Stark. It's also the first Spider-Man movie to not be set in New York, as the title may lead one to assume. Peter and the gang travel to Venice, Prague, and London on a class trip. All three of those cities are lovely, but it is pretty odd to have Spider-Man not be set in New York.Along the way, Peter has to deal with his Spider-Man duties, the class at hand, and his desire as ask MJ out. It often feels more like a road trip movie than a superhero movie, even though the superhero element obviously continues through the entire movie. It also manages to feel more like a high school movie than Homecoming did, which is impressive. The Spider-Man movies are perhaps the best instances where ""Marvel humor"" actually works. Like all the MCU movies, it's got good action scenes, and the visual effects are pretty good.Tom Holland returns as MCU Spider-Man. He's different from the other movie versions of the character, as he still does feel closer to Iron Man than Maguire and Garfield. Speaking of, nothing really happens with his character other than having him grow into Stark's role and become a bit more self-confident. MJ is much improved from Homecoming, as she's much more fleshed out and part of the story than the comic relief she was in Homecoming. Ned returns as the fun friend he was before. Nothing much new, but still fun to watch.It was pretty obvious to anyone who knows the Spider-Man comics or shows that Mysterio was going to be a villain, but they put a nice twist on this one. This version of him has no powers. He has modified Stark Industries technology. He's like Syndrome from The Incredibles. He puts them to good use, and the sequences with him were some of the movie's best, backed by the performance from Jake Gyllenhaal. Although the film claimed that Mysterio died, I have a feeling we'll be seeing him again. The rest of the cast isn't much to report on, but at least there wasn't anyone who brought it down.The most memorable scene in the movie is easily the post-credits scene, which sees JK Simmons reprise his role as J. Jonah Jameson, which was certainly a welcome addition to the MCU cast. For those of us who grew up with the Raimi Trilogy, it was certainly nice to see. The hook left by the post credits scene definitely sparks interest in what's going to happen next.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
391,jebyvyson,This is a spetacular Spider-Man movie,9,8 July 2019,"One criticism I have with this movie is that the beginning of the film felt a bit rushed and felt a little forced like they're trying to get to the good parts fast. Overall, this was a kickass Spider-Man film.I like how the MCU is doing their own version of Spider-Man since Captain America: Civil War and Spider-Man: Homecoming. We see Peter struggling with a loss of a father figure. He never catches a break to enjoy himself and it kinda reminds of Spider-Man 2 a little bit, but that's all what Spider-Man is.The mix of comedy and serious drama works with this movie and I give this movie praise for its CGI effects, it has gotten alot better since Homecoming. I'll give this movie my Top 2 favorite Spider-Man movie.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Jake G. did an decent job as Mysterio but overall the character was written without much character strengths.
CGI was fantastic as always with Marvel Movies. This will make money, this will entertain. It isn't one of the better ones though.Slight Spoiler: For those that remember the Toby McGuire Spider-Man, there is a nice cameo character return from that movie in the mid-credits spoilers.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

395,eparazak,Spider-man: Far From Home brings Phase 3 to a close with a very well-crafted follow-up to Homecoming,9,18 July 2019,"Spider-man: Far From Home was brought to us by Jon Watts once again and focuses on Peter Pakrer's double life as a high school students and Spider-man once again, but this time alone. This time, he and his friends go on vacation in Europe, and discover the Elementals attacking the continent, which prompts Peter to swing into action to save the day with a new hero on the scene known as Mysterio.This movie felt refreshing and lighthearted to me, and I think we all needed it after the more serious Captain Marvel and Endgame. This isn't to say, however, that this film is without its serious moments. In terms of lighthearted fun, we obviously get to see some comedic moments thrown around throughout the film. As an example, we get to see how the world has been affected by the events of Infinity War and Endgame, and they are done in a fairly comedic way. As for the serious moments, we see Peter dealing with what happened to Tony Stark during the previous film, and how he feels the need to step up his game. This leads him into an arc where he needs to learn to become more responsible, especially since he is now on his own. I thought that the action scenes were interesting as well, as they tread some new ground by Marvel movie standards, though I won't go into it because it goes into spoiler territory.My only complaint with the film is with the villain. Once we find out who he is and what his backstory is, for me, he turned out to be generic and uninteresting in the longrun. I felt as if his backstory in particular felt rushed. In addition to this, his goal throughout the movie didn't feel original. Again, I don't want to get into spoilers, but I will say that he feels a bit like a clone of another Disney villain from his goals and motivation.Despite my complaints with the movie's antagonist, I still felt as if Spider-man: Far From Home was a refreshing film, especially after the previous MCU movies.9/10",Spider-Man - Far from Home

397,Nomad007,Letdown from typical Avengers movies.,6,15 July 2019,"Taken as a stand-alone movie it's fairy decent.As part of Avengers franchise it's probably my least favorite of all the films.Being the next film post Avengers: Endgame it's a complete let down. And there was an expectation as to who's the next Iron Man, where do the avengers go from here, how it's the world recovering.All of these topics were mentioned in the movie but pretty much most of the movie and a about Parker's life post Iron, going back to school, is love life, etc.In this more ensemble films there's always another Avenger or two that helps out. In this one. There was none. I guess we supposed to accept Happy and Nick Cage as the replacement for another Avenger, but even they are only casually involved.The ""bad guy"" Mysterio felt more like he was ripped out of a silly young child's sci fi sat morning show.Obviously the movie was a set up for what's to come, but they two hours go the set up that should have been an hour or so, but with some more intro into what's next instead of a quick 2 min sequence during the mid credits.I love Marvel and the Avengers including the first Spider-Man film and his appearance in Civil War but this was just for the most part a let down.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
398,Martinito_08183,"Spider-Man: Homecoming is way better, but i still liked the movie, even with it's flaws.",6,16 July 2019,"I've grown up with the character of Spider-Man, just like everyone else and watching all of his movies (Into the Spider-Verse being my favorite) and loving the Tom Holland's interpretation of the character and loved Spider-Man: Homecoming, i was excited to see what what kind of adventure and a threat will he face on and being the last movie in phase three in the MCU and set after Avengers: Endgame. After watching the movie in the cinema, i do think that it's a solid film, but lacking in some aspects, so i do have some things that i want to discuss about on what i liked and also the things that i didn't liked.The positives:
I thought the story was very good, even thought it's very corny in some moments, but the movie is self-aware, just like the previous one and there are many great moments, especially with Mysterio that i wouldn't spoil, but they were really cool.Peter, MJ, Ned and Quentin Beck / Mysterio are among the best characters in the entire film and i loved the interaction between Peter and MJ, Peter and Ned and the strongest is of course Peter and Mysterio and the scenes with both of them were the best. I really liked what they did with Mysterio in this movie, since i don't know him all that much (just like The Vulture in Homecoming). The writers did a great job of writing this version of the character and making him the most interesting and fun villain to watch.Everyone gave a fantastic performance, especially Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal that really carry the material.The sound is once again superb.The dialogue for the most part was well done and it does have some great lines and the conversations between Peter and Mysterio are great.The cinematography for the most part is great. Every action is very well shot and you can see everything, without shaking the camera for no reason.The negatives:
The visual effects are very mixed for me. There are some moments that looks really good, but the other moments they look very fake, especially Spider-Man's costume (just like in Homecoming), even when Tom Holland is wearing the real costumes, they still looks fake for some reason and the end battle (even thought it's great and also fun to watch) looks like a cartoon.The side characters were the weakest aspect in the movie. I feel like the inclusions of Nick Fury and Maria Hill was a waste, because they didn't even do nothing that was worth putting them in the movie, while Peter's teachers and his classmates were not very interesting. I'm not saying that every single one of them are bad, i just wish that they could have been way better written to fit in the story and including so many characters is also a issue.Michael Giacchino returns as the composer for the movie, just like Spider-Man: Homecoming. And like Homecoming: it's the most bland and forgettable piece of music that i've ever heard. To be honest: i'm very mixed on Giacchino's music in recent years. Sometimes he writes the best music that i've ever heard that makes me fall in love with him (The Incredibles, Up, Ratatouille, Medal of Honor series), but then he writes probably the most forgettable and bland music ever and get disappointed by him (Jurassic World movies, Planet of the Apes series and many more) and this movie is no exception.Many of the jokes didn't work at all, especially after in the beginning of the movie (or should i say the first act), but that doesn't mean that all of the jokes didn't make me laugh, it's just that the writers wrote so many jokes that the entire script relies on them too much.When the CGI is not involved, the cinematography is super flat and not impressive at all. There are many close-ups and camera positions that don't even change, they just stay on the same spot all of the time, even the editing suffers the same by cutting on the same shots when someone is trying to tell a joke and that doesn't work for me. It felt like a sitcom.Unfortunately Far from Home is not the best Spider-Man movie out there and in my opinion Homecoming is a better movie in many ways, but that doesn't mean that i didn't like it at all. There are things that it gets right that Homecoming didn't get and thing that Homecoming did get right, while Far from Home didn't do very well. For me it's almost a good movie, but unfortunately there are many things that holds it up from being that. Even with it's problems, i'll still watch it again and after seeing the mid-credits scene, i'm very excited for the next Spider-Man movie, because i don't know how they are going to execute the idea, but i'll be very positive about it and i'm certain that it will be very interesting.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

400,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Spider-man: Far From Home: Summer Fling and Blockbuster,10,7 January 2020,"The Stream: Slow to get to the action and some comedic redundancyThe Big Screen: Very fun movie, great action sequences and furthers the MCUThe Final Bill: A must see in the theater for all of the action and intense illusions.-S2SIt's an end of an era. The final movie of the third phase of the beloved MCU. They called in the neighborhood webslinger to close it out, like my boy Ricky ""Wild Thing"" Vaughn. So let's see how Marvel tries to upstage or accompany their blockbuster hit, Avengers: Endgame.Let's start with the stream, or the bad, part of the movie. Honestly, the issues are very minor. The movie moves very slowly for about the first 20-25 minutes. Let's put it like this, my Peter-tingle was not working. But, quickly this inertia passes. The only other issue with this movie dealt with some of the comedic relief. Some comedy hits very hard and everyone in the theater laughs, but there are certainly times where the comedy missed the mark. Specifically, there are repetitive jokes by certain side characters that just aren't funny, or they used the wrong take to engage the audience properly. These jokes don't make the movie bad, but I did find myself saying, ""Oh Lord, here this guy comes again with the same ol same ol.""With that said, Marvel has developed a roster of directors and casts that perfectly create the desired theme or essence of the hero. For example, the coordination of Ant-Man being a great comedy/heist movie led by Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas and Michael Pena. In Far From Home, Marvel created a nearly perfect teen/summer love/coming of age superhero movie. Tom Holland, Zendaya, and Jacob Batalon (Ned), for starters, played their roles very well. Just like in Homecoming, the actors play off each other quite well, even if MJ is slightly redundant and annoying. On top of that, the addition of Jake Gyllenhal, as Mysterio, was quite satisfying. He gave us superhero and super villain.Now for the best part of the movie, the action. I was skeptical about how they were going to pull off Mysterio's illusions, but Marvel did not disappoint. Several of Far from Home's action sequences rival that of Endgame's final battle - which says a lot. Marvel has cornered the market in great action sequences, especially with emotional or sentimental overtones. If for nothing else, the movie is worth seeing because of the action entertainment value.Finally, this movie's storyline is able to end and begin parts in the MCU universe. The end of Phase 3 was sad, but this movie gives hope to the future of the MCU. Can't wait to see Peter, ""thwiip"" his ways through the rest of this MCU.Long story short, this is just an all-around good movie. Marvel did it again. This movie is great for so many viewing audiences. I do not see how anyone will be disappointed by this movie. Get the biggest bucket possible at the theater and I promise you that you'll get a refill and it still won't be enough to satisfy you.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

402,helenbassett,Schools Out And Jon Watts Directs Tom Holland In Spider-Man: Far From Home With Samuel L. Jackson On Vacation And Jake Gyllenhaal Tripping,10,30 July 2019,"Schools out for summer and although Spider-Man: Far From Home has been out since July 2, it just made over $1 Billion and it's well worth a visit if you haven't seen it yet. Jon Watts takes on the directing duties again after his 2017's Homecoming. In another world he could have been Spider-Man himself, but Tom Holland is in the suit again, and wanting to have a summer off after the events of Avengers: Endgame. We know Tony Stark is dead and Jon Favreau's Happy tells Peter that Nick Fury needs him to step up to The Avengers plate. But Peter is packing for a school trip to Europe and he ignores the phone. That'll come back and bite him. Samuel L. Jackson's Fury wants Peter to be worthy of the trust Tony Stark had in him. Not a great move to ghost him then.He doesn't even take the suit. So intent is he on having a great holiday with BFF Jacob Batalon's Ned, and his plan to tell MJ his real feelings. Zendaya's MJ seems too cool for Peter to be honest. But Tom Holland is puppy like in his teenage enthusiasm for her. And why wouldn't he be, he's Spider-Man, but cannot tell her. But MJ has another suitor in the form of Brad, played by Remy Hii. He's like the hot Asian Robert Pattinson. Give that man the lead in his own film. Very handsome and aged 5 years when he went away with the Thanos click, but still 16 so he cannot drink!While Peter and pals fly to Venice, the Earth has been attacked by The Elementals. With Earth and Air's fury devastating parts of the world. Nick Fury could have used Peter's help but luckily a new superhero was in town. With the boffin like name of Quentin Beck he comes from the same dimension as The Elementals. But he is the only one left from his race as he describes how they came to exist. Jake Gyllenhaal looks particularly hot as Quentin, although he does wear a snow globe style helmet that detracts from the suited and booted buffed bod. Jake definitely fits in to the Marvel world. He's having a massive trip.In Venice another Elemental appears, Water picks the right place to cause havoc among the beautiful canals, with Quentin trying to save the city, and Peter helping this time. Nicknamed Mysterio by the Italian media, that night when Peter is brought to Nick Fury he is introduced to Quentin. But Peter wants to be the neighbourhood Spider-Man, not Iron Man's replacement. He cannot go to Prague to battle Fire with Quentin, because that's where the final show is planned by the Elementals. But Peter's going to Paris as he has his own show planned at the Eiffel Tower with MJ. Or maybe not.On the way to Prague and into Peter's mix of raging 16 year old hormones, and the grief he feels over his mentor Tony Stark, he receives a gift from beyond. Tony's E.D.I.T.H. glasses. Quite an incredible gift as they allow Peter total control of Stark's Empire. And one he feels compelled to use against Brad, who just caught him with his pants down. Until he realises what he has done and calls off the strike. Too late. Maybe Peter is not ready for so much power in his 16 year old hands? And just maybe there is someone more worthy of control of Stark Enterprises? Or maybe his Peter Tingle that Marisa Tomei's hot Aunt May calls his spider-sense, is a little off at the moment.Jon Watts keeps the plates spinning in Far From Home with everyone getting their moment in the sun with the comedy and action, as we jaunt around Europe. Run at warp speed with the ethnically diverse cast having a blast. I especially loved the story line with Aunt May and Jon Favreau's Happy. And the terrific CGI is working overtime into the spider-verse, with mind bending special effects, and even MJ gets to swing. But the end credits set up a very different future for Spider-Man. Until then it's 129 minutes of mayhem and action that goes past in a flash.And all the time Nick Fury is having a blast on his vacation!",Spider-Man - Far from Home
403,thebrandedswordsman-34028,Even better,8,18 August 2019,"This movie is pretty wild. And I think it's better than Homecoming in some respects. The action is once again nicely done. It's pretty intense, actually. The acting has also improved a great deal, and the characters are a little more developed. CGI/practical effects are really good, the movie looks fantastic, and it has great music. It also has excellent runtime. I never once felt bored!

404,DunkelheitVZ,This needs to be reviewed from two perspectives,6,26 November 2019,"Perspective 1: The Action Movie Review
If you view Spider-Man: Far from Home solely as an action movie you need to give it praise. The scenes are outstanding, the action great, there is great humor, a lot of talent, interesting twists and much, much more.
This movie just flows and it is doing an amazing job in captivating the audience.Perspective 2: The Spider-Man Movie Review
The 2nd perspective is about the essence of Spider-Man. And here, the movie fails gloriously. Spider-Man is a shy, bullied and unwanted pupil. He is not the ""next Iron Man"" and all that gimmicky stuff like the glasses and the costume that has additional Doc Ock arms only makes sense with an adult Spider-Man, not with the High School Spider-Man. Spider-Man comics always were about his life, how he struggles with growing up, how he feels that crushing responsibility which does not let him take a break.
He only became a member of the Avengers far, far, far later and it just does not fit that well.Whatever Marvel is doing, please do not stray from the original idea of the movies. Don't try to top the action of Endgame, don't try to get every single hero into the Avengers. There are world savers and there are neighbourhood savers. Spider-Man is the latter. If you want him to join the Avengers, we need to see at least his journey and how he is getting there.A High-School Spider-Man that deals with Avengers and Fury and is the ""next Iron Man""? No, this is just too big for me and I was personally really disappointed.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
405,sujanfaster,Far From the Usual,9,6 July 2019,"Spiderman Homecoming was a different Spiderman movie compared to the previous versions but it hadn't really impressed me. The more MARVEL touch version of Spiderman has always been more of a team person than your friendly neighbourhood shy individual. I expected no different in Spiderman: Far From Home, but MARVEL has done a lot more than just another addition to their fun and playful superhero movies.Spiderman Far From home is a post Avengers Endgame saga which most of you already know by the trailers. One would miss our quite a bit, if they are not familiar with all the stuff that has happened till the Endgame. This movie re unites Peter Parker with his highschool shenanigans and sets him on a Euro trip (just like every other American Teenager). However, the Avenger connection kinda never leaves Peter Parker as he is called to save the world again (or may be we can say beautiful European cities?) along with Beck played by Jake Gyllenhal who is from an alternate timeline (Multiverse much?). The rest of the movie is the adventurous journey of Peter Parker across Europe fighting weird demons along with some highschool Fun and playing hard to get with Nick Fury.The best part about this movie is that it keeps bringing up surprises all the time. Starting from the Spiderman character, where the Spiderman is not so much himself in the suit and figuring out things, growing up. It is clearly shown that Peter Parker has shades (quite literally) of Tony Stark in him. The next best part is the VFX, this movie required a lot of it and don't be fooled by the trailers there is much much more to it. The visual effects kind of reminds us Black Panther and Doctor Strange blended together and in a good way. The humour as usual keeps the audience full of energy. I also liked the antagonist concept and the ties back to the old movies which was quite well done.Tom Holland has really showed us a more outgoing and a confused kid version of Spiderman can also hold up despite the criticism from the fans of the old Spiderman movies. Samuel L Jackson gets to be him again after being in a sabbatical (until Captain Marvel). Zendaya carries the mysterious and cute vibe to perfection. Jacob Batalon, Tony Revolori and Angourie Rice all contribute the film's humour in their own ways.Spiderman Far From Home may not go down as a comic fans favourite, but it surely is another exemplary showcase of MARVEL's genius filmmaking.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
406,Nathan_Needs_A_Username,Movie Review: Spider-Man: Far From Home,8,24 July 2019,"With this being the 8th Spider-Man film to have been released in the last 17 years it is safe to say that I like most people have started to find it difficult to get exited whenever Spidey is back on the big screen. That being said I am a big fan of 2017s Spider-Man: Homecoming so I was fairly curious to see what director John Watts was planning on doing next with the character.I was pleasantly surprised by the overall quality of this film. Watts seems to realise that both Spider-Man and the MCU as a whole are seen as a little played out by this point, he attempts to breath new life into both in a way that may not sit right with everyone but personally made me love this movie. There are so many jokes, one-liners and light comedic jabs aimed at the conventions seen in this franchise that it almost borders on self parody. Given the grand nature of many of the most recent MCU films it is refreshing to see something like this that is able to take a step back and point out how ridiculous the whole thing is. Martin Starr and J.B. Smoove have so much more screen time than I would have expected and really get a chance to deliver some funny material. This could be a turn off to some comic book fans but I think they do a good job with the comedy throughout and so it never bothered me.That is not to say that the film never takes itself seriously, in fact the character interactions and dialogue in this film are consistently sharp and well written, with a few moments even allowing Tom Holland to fully show of his dramatic skills. Peter Parker's groups of friends are also just as fleshed out and interesting s they were in Homecoming with some of them even getting more screen time ans baring on the plot this time around.Jake Gyllenhaal (despite appearing like he has never seen any of these movies) delivers a characteristically brilliant performance bringing a fan favourite character to life in a unique an genuinely entertaining way.My favourite aspect of this film is best not talked about in a spoiler free review but I do have to give major props to the special effects department.While I feel like this does not have quite as much replay value as Homecoming this is well worth checking out as a fun summer blockbuster with some moments of genuine brilliance. Hardcore fans of Spider-Man may not be happy with the direction that the MCU is going with this character but personally I think if they keep making movies that are this good then I don't have much of an issue.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

408,benjaminwest-242,An adventurous sequel,8,12 October 2021,"Spider-Man: Far From Home is a solid second iteration of the namesake in the MCU, proving better than the original. The acting is well-performed, with good casting for each character. The plot is thrilling, given the spectacular intensity from the visual effects employed. The comedic tone of the film is mostly spot on, sometimes even assisting the emotional depth that naturally comes after the events of Avengers: Endgame. However, the direness of the situation is not as well-developed, but Spider-Man's opposition still proves to be extremely interesting. Overall, a surprisingly intelligent film that invites the audience in and captures its attention throughout.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
409,cyifly-2,Much Better Than The First Reboot,8,24 September 2019,"This time around, I liked Spiderman much better. Jake Gyllenhal was also a great addition. It was full of action, comedy, and had everything that makes for a great Summertime popcorn movie.I just can't get over the casting. I keep trying. I just don't understand all the PC BS of making the characters COMPLETELY different than what they were in the comic books, TV and movies growing up. Peter Parker is Perfect. But I can't look at MJ as his love/crush, Flash as a skinny, short Indian kid, or aunt Mae being so very different. It's not that I don't like them, personally. I would not have any problem with them acting in the movie. I just think casting BLEW their job and tried to make these new Spiderman movies into something they didn't need to make them into. Why can't white kids play white kids that were white in the comic books and just add new characters like the funny Asian sidekick? Why isn't that OK any more? I understand diversity and why they would want to mix things up, but why the main characters that were established for decades? I just have to shake my head at it and go with it. But -- It made another $billion$ without asking for my opinion, so what do I know?Getting past the casting fiasco, the movie itself, was great. I liked it. I liked watching my son enjoy it. I'd watch it again. In the end, I guess that is what matters.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
410,aaronjbong,"""Far From Home"" Brings Everything Home",10,18 July 2019,"""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" is the first movie in the MCU set after the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"", giving a glimpse of the world after the ""Blip"" although ultimately, is simply used as the source of some humor. In ""Endgame"", we lost three of the original Avengers: Iron Man, Captain America, and Black Widow. However, ""Far From Home"" only really takes into account the loss of Iron Man, considering how he has become a mentor to Peter Parker and sort of taking the place of Uncle Ben as a source of Spider-Man's motivation. Nevertheless, Spider-Man must now battle the Elementals threatening the world without the guidance of Iron Man......except that the Elementals are not real. But, it should be pretty obvious because if they had been the real villains, it would have been a huge step down the brilliant Vulture from ""Homecoming"". Instead, enter Quentin Beck aka Mysterio, someone who first pretends to be Earth's newest protector, but turns out not to be. Now, if you know anything about Mysterio or perhaps have looked him up on Wikipedia, you might know that Mysterio is a master of illusions, generating confusion using his witty tricks.I think Mysterio ranks as probably Spider-Man's greatest movie villain, aside from Doc Ock from ""Spider-Man 2"", in that he is very charismatic, aided with the brilliant performance of Jake Gyllenhall. Mysterio's skills lend to wonderful action sequences with Spider-Man that are unlike anything I've ever seen in a Spider-Man movie. It helps that ""Far From Home"" is the first movie since ""Black Panther"" that takes place entirely on Earth and better yet, doesn't have super large-scale war action, because after a while, watching it can be numbing. ""Far From Home"" brings everything to a smaller level, creating a more intimate and ultimately, more thrilling action experience for Spider-Man. It is a welcome relief from them to bring everything back home to Earth.I feel that the story here is an improvement from ""Homecoming"". One of the issues I had with the first installment was that it was too kid-friendly, which I found to be a bit of a letdown considering the more intense predecessors. Granted, the movie really captured the spirit of high school. Luckily ""Far From Home"" managed to increase the stakes and put Parker in a tougher spot which I really welcomed. Plus, given that he's been to space, it seemed more fitting to place him in more dangerous situations.""Far From Home"" definitely ranks as one of my favorite, if not my favorite ""Spider-Man"" movies of all time, along with ""Spider-Man 2"", and ""Into the Spider-Verse"". It's funny, charming, has a lovable ensemble of characters, and a welcome relief from the massive scale of recent MCU movies.

415,adamsmith-51004,A film of two halves,7,6 July 2019,"Spider-Man: Far From Home goes from New York to Europe. I didn't particularly like'Homecoming'. It had its flaws and pacing issues, but delivered when it came to Tom Holland's Peter Parker/Spiderman. Unfortunately for this sequel, it has far too many plot points to resolve acting as a sequel to 'Homecoming', 'Endgame', and closure to an entire phase of the MCU, to which it's overstuffed. So, after the infamous ""blip"" that occurred, everything is back to normal which sees Peter adjust to life post-Avengers as he attempts to deal with global responsibilities and growing feelings for his classmate MJ.Alas, life is never that simple for the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man, as he must help combat the Elementals with the assistance of the mysterious Mysterio. This film comprises of teen romance, high school comedy and superhero shenanigans. Three sub-genres mixed together that holds little to no weight. The film is entertaining. The blossoming romance between Peter and MJ is delicate and loveable. The high school comedy is punchy and well-written, albeit somewhat forced and failed to personally make me crack up. And the superhero efforts made for some blockbusting extravaganzas, in particular the entire third act (which suffice to say, saved the entire film).However, the heavy-handed execution of combining these tonal changes was mediocre to say the least. Immediately, the introductory scene allows Mysterio, an Elemental and various returning characters to enter the scene. Literally, ten seconds. But that's not my biggest problem. That primary issue goes to plot conveniences. In order to shift the genres, McKenna writes several unlikely conveniences (such as an Elemental randomly appearing in Venice where Peter was at the time) that sprays a huge jet of disbelief across the script. Oh but wait, apparently that was all planned. It's incredibly lazy.Holland was fantastic once again as the eponymous hero and was able to showcase a range of emotional complexities. Zendaya was magnificent with her deadpan delivery. But the standout, which comes as no surprise, is Gyllenhaal. He was a perfect choice for Mysterio. Despite a few directional choices regarding his character which I did not necessarily appreciate, he was charismatic and memorable enough to be an excellent supporting character. The illusory scenes were inventive, involving and a perfect demonstration of Mysterio's mischief. The visual effects, excluding a few human CGI moments, heightened the bombastic excitement of the third act. And heck, even the mid and post-credit scenes were of notable value.If it wasn't for the performances and third act, this film would have scored even lower.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Not to mention, the burden of being the successor of a dead legendary hero, who's expected to be at least as he is, or even better! How would you, even as an adult, respond to that?The villain is a little bit absurd, I know. He got a little grudge against the said dead hero, but eventually the motive isn't even strong enough to make him a villain of a superhero. And what more ridiculous is: he tries to fool the entire world, like maybe forever, without being worry or making a (or at least explaining in the movie) contingency plan for if someday, in his fraud superhero career, someone or anyone finds out about his fake heroism. Everyone will easily be fooled these days, the bad guy argued, but will the Avengers? will Nick Fury? will everyone for forever?As for you, Sam Raimi's Spidey Trilogy fans, don't forget to leave your seats AFTER the mid-credit scene.

The international locations were one of the few highlights. If you're a Marvel fan, wait for the movie to show up on Blu-ray, streaming or Redbox. If you're not a Marvel fan, skip it altogether.

422,dineshaishu,Spiderman: far from home,10,10 July 2019,"The film tells the story of the events after the Avengers: Endgame. Everywhere was Tony Stark because Peter was incredibly respected and loved him. Naturally, it is normal that Tony Stark's absence is brought to our eyes throughout the film. Even at the first opening of the film, the losses of the Avengers are shown and there is a pleasant sympathy. Peter's loss of his mentor affects his powers, leading him to difficult times. The film successfully manages to reflect this trauma. You're experiencing Peter's pain exactly. After many people disappeared for five years because of Thanos, the world is naturally in recovery. While some people have not aged in any way, some have lost five years of their lives.Far from Home reflects the line between comic book seriousness and comedy action mix very well. The fact that the action scenes are more than the first movie certainly does not bother. Adorned with stunning details, the action scenes look quite impressive, especially when you taste 3D and IMAX. The film offers an incredibly fun and visual feast. MCU films often go fast and are hard to follow, but director Jon Watts has done everything he can to get the important scenes for the audience to enjoy the movie. You will be happy to see faces smelling nostalgia for a few seconds. On the other hand, dress designs and especially the new costume of Spider-Man seem quite successful, of course it is impossible to overlook Mysterio's charisma.Even for audiences who do not master the MCU universe, Far from Home is a surprisingly emotional film. On the other hand, it's like a huge group therapy session for MCU fans. Far from Home has succeeded to be one of the successful examples of its kind. The line between action and grief is well preserved. Of course, if you're following the MCU universe, you won't miss out on unreasonable details.Finally, the film has two different endings. Obviously, after watching the first end, I wonder where they will tie the third Spider-Man movie and how they can get rid of such chaos.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

434,jcallows,Far from Good,6,24 September 2019,"Wow. Where to start. The filmmakers doubled-down on the elements that made the first film weak: strong ties to the Avengers films, a magical suit that did all the work, and other-worldly technology that belonged in a Harry Potter film.The plot was familiar but that's ok. I just wish they'd kept all the action back in Spidey's neighborhood. There was no reason for him to travel halfway around the world to fight his battle. I also wish they had kept references to the Avengers to a minimum and tried to make this film a Spider-Man film, not another Avengers film. I wish they'd kept the suit basic spandex with minimal functionality to showcase Peter's special skills instead of turning it into another Ironman suit which gave powers to anyone who wore it. And I wish they'd kept the technology at a more believable level instead of making it do whatever a 9-year old kid can think of. But alas, it wasn't meant to be.On the positive side, the performances by Tom Holland and Zendaya were great and their chemistry looked authentic.

437,Abranth-d,The best since Spidey 2,8,19 July 2019,"Here's my review of Spiderman : Far from home. So to be honest , I wasn't a big fan of Spiderman homecoming , I thought it was a good popcorn flick but that it didn't have what the og Spidey movies did. This movie however , is also a popcorn flick , but only 10x times more cooler. The story is set in a post endgame world , and it was interesting to see how things have changed since the snap's impact but in a less depressing way than how endgame showed it. Mysterio is the big baddie in this movie and his master plan is the same one from the comics and the animated shows . It's basically syndrome's plan from the Incredibles . Don't worry , that's not a spoiler. Ten seconds into this movie and you'll figure that out yourself . Despite being a cliched Mysterio plan , I liked how the writers tied his motive to the mcu , just like how they tied the vulture's motive to Stark's in homecoming. Cause if you think about it , spidermans villains have always been a part of his personal life , like the green goblin , his best friends dad , dock ock, his professor and so on. But since this version of Spiderman is more of a spiderboy than Spiderman, Its only right to set up his rogues gallery through Tony stark . Speaking of Tony stark , I liked how he was more of a mentor to Peter than a forced uncle Ben in this movie .Now the jokes , the running gags and the one liners in this movie were just wayyy funnier than the ones in homecoming. Like this romance b/w Ned and Betty , Flash Thompson's vlog and awkward convos b/w Happy Hogan and Aunt May. Also , all the supporting cast in this movie were really good and just really funny . Zendaya was also surprisingly great in this movie ! . In Homecoming when she said her name's acronyms are MJ, I was like wtf ?! But frankly she had great chemistry with Tom Holland in this movie , even though MJ doesn't stand for Mary Jane . The action scenes in this movie are insane ! Some sleek editing and cgi did the job right , there is this one scene where spidey's trapped in a trippy maze and that was just really cool to watch. The music in this movie was adrenaline pumping , especially the new score for Spiderman. Maybe I should've spoke about this at the beginning of the review , but whatever .. Tom Holland's Spiderman is actually great and has much character than in homecoming since he's in a post endgame world now . Jake Gyllenhaal was also great in this movie and had good chemistry with Peter. There were also a couple of nice Easter eggs like Morris bench the hydroman , spidermans new suit in the third act which payed homage to amazing fantasy 15 , the suitcase which has uncle bens initials and much more. So yeah ... I guess that's just about it. In the end , Spiderman : Far from home is pretty much 'Agent Cody Banks goes to London' but with the superhero juice. I can go ahead and say that far from home is an instant classic and is one of the perfect live action spiderman movies since spiderman 2 . And as always for the few who read my reviews , thank you for reading past zero paragraph breaks and punctuation errors and this long . Knowing how I type a lot when it's a superhero movie. Much appreciated . Oh yeah , and don't forget to sit in for the post and end credits unlike Endgame , you would've definitely not seen this one coming.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

This is true and succinctly defines whomever was behind the creation of this most recent reboot of the Spiderman franchise.The dialog and content of this and the prior Tom Holland Spiderman opus (Homecoming) are nothing more than a melange of... annoyingly banal rapport delivered with rapid-fire (ie, incomprehensible), breathless staccato that, alone, beats you senseless in the first 15 minutes of each movie. The cast is more or less a cadre of high strung, relatively clueless characters seemingly suffering from uncontrolled Attention Deficit Disorder and boundary issues. The ""adults"" are more or less just in the movie to provide character relief; equally as clueless to the surroundings and the wards under their watch.A most annoying movie in a most annoying franchise.

Spidy - But in the end he was willing to step up to protect the people he cares about which made him more serious with his superhero life, as he grew to understand just how the life of a superhero can tough and serious. This shows how he has matured in the film and he doesn't want to let down his late mentor as he had put his faith in him. So I think the film is even more amazing than its predecessor. it especially with the twists and I wonder how that's going to affect the next spider man film and the film gave a good ending to phase 3. This would be the first spiderman film to truly feel different.

Referencing the last two Avengers films and Captain Marvel in this film, the filmmakers were well-aware of the excellent superhero competition they had, but they did not succeed in matching that level of quality. Spider-Man: Far From Home lacks the gravitas of the Avengers films or the humor of Shazam!

But is he truly as stupid as he acts in this story line. Why would he refuse to be an avenger in the previous movie, after practically begging Tony to make him one. And now, why would he hand over the Edith glasses that Tony gave specifically to him. I realize he's 16 and is focused on teenager things.
But - that aspect of his personality irritated me.
He had the world handed to him. And he gave it away. All because he wants to tell MJ he likes her.
I know the Spiderman stories are different than the other Avenger movies, but he was more annoying in this movie than he was in the other ones. The other movies showcased his humor and let his teenage enthusiasm come through. But this movie was just too predictable for me.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
446,Eric266,Just Didn't Work for Me,7,2 October 2019,"I'm a diehard Spider-man fan going back to the early 1970s reading the comics with my friends outside the 7-11. I really enjoyed Homecoming, but Far from Home just left me flat. Its a good movie and Tom Holland is the best Spider-man ever, but the plot was just lame. One of the reasons I like Spider-man, and Batman for that matter, are the low scale of their stories. They are only defending their neighborhoods and the stories are low key. Having Spider-man globe trotting just took some of the joy out of it for me. Plus all the gadgets provided by Stark drained the character of his genius and adaptability. Spider-man used his wits and determination to get out of jams, not gadgets. The Deus ex Machinas ruined this character for me.I'm also not a fan of Zendaya's MJ. I don't mind them trying to create a different slant on the character, but they just went to far afield with her. There is zero chemistry between Zendaya and Holland. She was incredibly annoying in the first movie and she is not much better in this one. Holland had much more chemistry with Laura Harrier who played Toomes'/Vulture's daughter in the previous film. That would have made for an interesting plotline through all the Holland films with Peter loving the daughter of one of his enemies (whose still alive). Whenever Zendaya appeared on screen, the plot sagged.Quentin Beck/Mysterio was a let down for me as well. I like Gyllenhall's portrayal and he's a good actor. The dialogue between him and Holland had a real nice easiness to it and those scenes were great. It was the action sequences where the movie suffered. It was just too high tech for a Spider-man movie for my tastes. It was too fantastical. I guess I like my Spider-man more grounded.I enjoyed the film but I also found myself tuning it out mentally at times. The post credit sequences which tie Peter's story into the greater MCU (I won't spoil anything) just dragged him further and further away from his roots.

449,Chiller7,Iron Boy Jr. doesn't feel like he's Spider-man,5,6 October 2019,"It doesn't feel like Tom Holland is Spider-man. He's a kid with Iron Man tech. He's Iron Boy Jr.This movie made sure Tom Holland wore the Spider-man mask as little as possible throughout the movie, It's like he had some kind of clause in his contract ensuring that his face gets way more screen time than the Spider-man mask, so that's why he's constantly taking off his mask even when inappropriate, like when he's in full view of the public, who can see him with his mask off (but for some reason, no one around him cares). I don't think Tom Holland as Spider-man even climbed up a wall like a spider once in the entire movie.The characters, from the villains to the high school kids and teachers to Spider-man's allies, are largely hard to believe as real people.I mean, for instance, a new superhero, Mysterio, shows up, and no one even raises a question or starts a discussion about what his powers are or how he got his powers or anything like that. They just accept him like he's a new guy with unexplained powers, cool.The high school kids and teachers feel like comedy caricatures written by comedy writers, but they're not believable as real people at all. Everything they say or do is to aid some comedy gag, not to make us believe them as people.As for the plot, it's predictable. You can see where Mysterio's story is going from a mile away.But it's not all bad. There are good parts here. MJ, the weird sarcastic girl, was the most likeable character.

450,sackofwhine,"""People believe anything"" such as this being good",4,22 August 2021,"This film was a painful experience. A soul crushing reminder that we can't have a straightforward superhero film anymore- no, everything needs to be crammed into that 2hour runtime, establishing sequels in the last 10 minutes for the next film and all in all not giving the characters a proper conclusion. The problem with these movies is that they feel so weightless- there's no gravitas, no stakes, just constant cookie cutter buffoonery without giving us anything to care about.On every other level this film fails to captivate me as an aesthetician. Seldomly have I seen a film that looks and feels this fake and phony. There's almost nothing practical in this film with the exception of some actual authentic european locations. A constant barrage of awful green screen and CGI work plastered onto every shot, erasing any sort of immersion. There's not A SINGLE shot of Spiderman in an actual fabricated costume. He always looks like a cartoon character injected into the hideously lit scenery.The editing is piss poor, scenes just abruptly end and don't connect together. There's so many blatantly obvious greenscreen reshoots intertwined with the actual location shots, it's bafflingly bad. The film language in low budget movies is more sophisticated and ambitious than in this 200 million dollar turkey. Also a major disappointment: Giacchinos score. It's so bland and generic, just a conglomeration of previously established superhero scores. It doesn't emote anything remotely close to the iconic Elfman score, and you can't argue with me on that one.I'm sick of MCU films being some shot-reverse-shot improv comedy with some terrible CGI slapped onto them. It feels so incredibly lazy. I have a hard time accepting that this is what people want nowadays after being exposed to so many great blockbuster movies.The only impressive scenes are the ones that are fully CG but they stand out in an annoying way, because these sections are basically animated short films. And the chemistry between the actors is, as in many MCU films, very organic even though I thought the performances were all around extremely bland. This material just doesn't give them anything to feast on, it's such an easy paycheck movie. And thats why Raimis SM films remain undefeated.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

I've seen better Power Ranger episodes when I was a kid. This is clearly a Disney creation, they might as well have made it animated by Pixar.-No respect to Spider-Man and his fan base
-Everyone in this movie is too painfully ignorant, oblivious, and stupid (comically and cartoonishly) to know what's going on.
-Every character is miscast and nothing like they are suppose to be. Pick your own example...""MJ"", Aunt May, Flash, and so on...
-The dialogue and conversations are so cringe inducing that you might develop a migraine.
-The acting. I don't know a word fit enough to describe it. It's obvious it's acting. And it's a race to say the next one liner.
-This movie was purely made to make action figures and get more money in the pockets of Marvel and Disney. There's been better spider man cartoons.
-Disrespect to the villain Mysterio.And for God's sake, SPIDER-MAN ISNT IRON MAN OR NEEDS TO BE IRON MAN! Spider-Man never needed or should need to be under Iron man's shadow.

458,MovieTVRomanceFan,Spider-Man: Far From Home was Unbelievably Amazingly Spectacular,10,8 July 2019,"Ever since I saw the trailers and sneaks peek of the movie, I kept getting more and more excited, realizing that Far From Home was going to be even better than Homecoming and I Was Right. Far From Home was so AMAZING. There was so much more action, humour, heart and romance compared to Homecoming. I loved every minute watching the movie and I love Tom Holland as Peter Parker. He is by far the best actor to portray the character and he is even better than ever. I just love him SO MUCH. Everything about the movie was incredible, all the references and flashbacks to several previous Marvel films and the special effects were incredible.However, one of the main primary reasons why I LOVE the movie is the romance between Peter and MJ. I was never a fan of the romance between Liz and Peter in Homecoming since I never really felt any chemistry between them and there was not enough development or screentime for their relationship whereas it's completely different with Peter and MJ. I can really feel the chemistry and love between them which only grows stronger as the film progressed which clearly proves that Peter's feelings for MJ are a whole lot more stronger and serious than any feelings he ever had for Liz. Plus, I really enjoyed the love triangle between Peter, MJ and Brad as watching Peter fight for the girl he loves is what makes the romance even greater.I also loved the scenes between Peter and Happy. They are so close and it was so heartwarming to see them comfort one another since they are still grieving the loss of Tony. It was touching. The topic of Tony's passing and his successor is one of the main highlights of the movie. It shows how Peter is struggling, how he still hasn't gotten over the loss of his beloved mentor who was like a father to him and his fears that he will never live up to the legacy Tony left behind. It's wonderful to see how Peter and Happy are there for each other and one of the best moments is the look of pride and happiness in Happy's eyes when he watches Peter working on his new suit, truly reminding him of Tony. Not to mention, the romance between Happy and May was a nice touch and so HILARIOUS, Especially the Confession.In the end, I'm thrilled as Far From Home was everything I wanted and more. I can't wait to see the next Spider-Man film and I hope there are a whole lot more movies to come in the future. I'm looking forward to seeing what the next chapter will be for Peter since he will have his hands full no doubt following the shocking events from the ending credits. Overall, Spider-Man: Far From Home clearly surpasses Spider-Man: Homecoming. It was truly, Amazing, Spectacular, Stupendous and above all officially one of my Top Favourite Movies EVER.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

461,cliff_bd,Targeting teen audiences,3,14 July 2019,"Very much like the first Spider-Man movie with Tom Holland, this film is firmly targeted to entertain children and young teens. The humour was well below the normal standard of Marvel Movies.I really did not see the point why this Spider man movie was made (there is been so many). I felt the same about the first Tom Holland Spider-Man movie..... I Guess there was ""some"" justification for the first movie seeing as Spider-Man appeared in Captain America: Civil War.The story in far from home.... felt forced and was clutching at some very weak straws from previous films.... it was not a strong story at all.The teen element was really irritating with Tom Holland fumbling to ask his girl friend out through out the movie and the attempts at humour in the most part failed.No more Spider-Man movies please ..... and if anymore are made I will not be going to the Movie theatre to see it.I gave the movie a 3 solely because there was a couple of scenes that made me snigger...... but never laugh out loud.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

It is a fun genre roller coaster ride with elements of a coming of age film. In fact, the best moments find the young actors out of costume or CGI, as they are relatable and, something lost in many of these films, likable. While the villain is yet another disposable Marvel villain, he is a great adaption of the comic book character.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
463,ellimic,A good film to start off a new saga,8,4 July 2019,"Technically the last film of 'Phase 3', Spider-Man Far From Home is the start of a new saga for the MCU.
I thought the start seemed weird as you have Cline Dion playing over the opening credits, and then the pictures of Tony Stark, Captain America, Black Widow and Vision, but they made it out to be a tribute video in Peter Parker's school which made more sense.I thought it was a much better film than the preceding two; Captain Marvel and Avengers Endgame were rather big let downs for me so this is a strong start for this second saga.I liked how Mysterio played Fury and Spider-Man to get Stark's tech, and his consortium of fellow spurned Stark Industries employees was very clever, getting one-up on thier former boss and plagiarist.
Using each of thier talents to create these incredible illusions, but also able to choreograph the fighting with the simulated Mysterio and causing the relevant destruction.I think the events with Mysterio was the push Spider-Man needed to become a proper Avenger; before he was a bit immature, not totally dependable and thought of himself as just a 'friendly neighborhood Spider-Man' (although it could be argued that that last one is what Stark told him to be?)
And by his own admission, he only went to space with Stark 'by accident'.You could see the pride in Happy when Spider-Man took command in the jet in the Netherlands using Stark's own designs to build a new suit but also to customise it to the situation. The Back In Black soundtrack was a great throwback to Stark's old workshop.I think this film was a great hand-over (at the end of Avengers Endgame the elderly Captain America gifted his shield to Falcon), and now we have Stark gifting his greatest tech to the next generation.
With a final typically Stark joke - EDITH, Even Dead I'm The Hero.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
464,salonsoab,Outstanding Sequel: Can wait for what's to come!,9,10 July 2019,"Spider-Man: Far From Home is probably one of the best sequels found in the MCU, improving in many aspects from its predecessor. The story seems to be a lot more expansive and with higher stakes, and the relationships between Peter and MJ is explored in a really cute and fun way. The way of introducing the villain in this film is quite clever, and the evolution of Peter Parker´s character from beginning to end really made him one of my favorite superheroes in this universe. Not to mention the amazing VFX and the really funny moments, Far From Home excels as the previous films released this years have.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Despite finding the reason for the villainy really sloppy, Jake is a wonderfully talented actor and is a treat to watch on screen.The scenes with Aunty May and Happy were awkward yet a welcome addition to the movie. With no remorse, Peter forgets his previous lady love and decides to take a chance with MJ who is weird in the absolute coolest way.The ending was good and graphics throughout was amazing.

467,Thekeybaldemasterrises,The mid credits scene is the best part I'm not sure if that's a good thing...,6,1 July 2019,"Spider-Man Far From Home is a very middling Marvel movie. It's not bad, FAR FROM it..... But I wanted so much more. Tom Holland is giving his best performance as Peter yet(obviously besides his traumatic exit in Infinity War). He's able to hold his own in a movie that requires so much from his character, especially in a post Endgame world. Zendaya is doing great as MJ, and I was really digging the scenes with her and Peter together. The European vacation backdrop makes for a fresh Spidey story, and we get pretty fun set pieces as a result. I was also satisfied with the way they brought Mysterio to life, it was a clever and realistic take on the character, and I thought that part was visually fun. When it came to his character backstory though, that's where the issues began. Jake Gyllenhaal did fine with what he was given, but the way the character was introduced in terms of MCU building felt so tired and more of the same. Especially after coming off the Vulture in Homecoming. Story choices like this just made the movie way too predictable, and I had this feeling of ""Let's get on with it"" constantly nagging me. The comedy fell a little flat too, because it just spoke more like a Teen genre movie and not an MCU movie. The teen aspect is fine, because Jon Watts knows how to direct a good flick about coming of age in the 2010's, and that's why this Spider-Man has been so successful, because it stays relevant with today's generation. But I think my biggest issue with this take is the teen comedy genre is where the focus is, and not enough on Spider-Man. Holland's version of Peter Parker isn't being challenged enough and I don't feel enough emotional stakes in his story that even the Andrew Garfield movies do a better job portraying. It's hard not to talk about this more in detail without spoilers but let's be clear, if you enjoyed Homecoming and love all the Marvel movies then you'll like this one too. I will totally see it again just to see if I missed something, but as of right now, it's ok. Even though I liked Homecoming better I still really look forward to where they take things thanks to a very spicy mid credits scene, but it was at the cost of a mixed movie. 7/10.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
468,tomtalbotty,"Hilarious amazing lots of travelling, lots of action and special effects A must watch after Endgame Tom Hollands And Zendaya's chemistry is so on point in this movie",10,5 July 2019,"This is such an hilarious movie cracking jokes from the start peter having his summer holiday plans rather than taking the whole superhero job too seriously until it is ready to all kick in. We first start off with Peter trying to have his innocent Romantic plan with MJ that of course does not go to plan as after the hilarious ghosting of Nick Fury he tends to hijack their summer vacation even though MJ is the only person on his mind all summer as that is all that he wants to do is spend time with her. Constantly reminded of his Father figure who he loved Tony Stark shown by Iron Man graffiti on the side of the house the beautifully well done at the start really has connotations that there something missing in Peters life his father figure Tony Stark, therefore he thinks he finds it in Quentin Beck also known as by the kids Mysterio, showing that there is more than meets the eye with him as Peter is looking for another father figure as that hole will forever be there where Tony used to be. After screwing up to start off with Peter gets MJ this cute thoughtful gift that really shows his love for her. Not to mention Ned and Bettys cute romantic relationship hitting it off from the start after a cock up Peter pulled from trying to get with MJ, which was hilarious and so cute, so the man in the chair kind of becomes the man with the romance. Peter kind of goes unnoticed by everyone else even when he disappears all most of the time to fight bad guys and this is where MJ'S And Peters chemistry really kicks in as the only person that seems to notice Peter properly and intelligently as MJ is highly intelligent young women I would say more intelligent than Peter even though she does not seem like it until you get to know her when she lets her guard down in front of Peter. MJ starts her investigation for quite some time to try and uncover what Peter is up to having a 67% sureness that Peter is Spider Man and trying to find that out to have more of a romantic connection with him to see if she could open herself up to Peter that she does in a cute and awkward romantic way. Then there is a kiss that they share in the film is truly spectacular as they are well suited to each other and just shows that MJ is more than a damsel in distress kind of bad ass. I hope that MJ becomes a hero herself she kind of is already maybe a Spider Woman even though that is doubtful for the MCU and the Spider Man Films I can still be hopeful as Peter And MJ do work really well together with their amazing romantic cute chemistry. Well Done Marvel and the rest of the cast and crew on such an amazing job with this amazing film look forward to the next Spider Man Films hopefully. Aunt May is just amazing and her not so secret obvious relationship with Happy is just romantic and cute at the same time, which is so nice to see. I highly recommend seeing this film if you have a spare two hours and nine minutes and I highly recommend you watching it at the cinema soon as the atmosphere with everybody laughing and feeling all sorts of emotions together really makes the film too. This is the best Spider Man yet truly my favourite Spider Man Film. Zendaya's And Tom Hollands acting is phenomenal as always and their chemistry is just shown onscreen so well.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
469,jchen-07237,Not Disappointed,8,9 July 2019,"I was expecting for this film to be a letdown. You need something that is quite unexpected after the heartbreaking and hard-to-beat film of wonderful Endgame. We can still sense the tension in the beginning of Spider-Man: Far From Home. This film can hit home for many people, some people who do not have a normal life. Tom Holland acted his role as if he'd known his character ever since he was born. Peter, who is both awkward and struggling to understand the concept of why Tony Stark would choose him, needs to face the harsh reality that he is not just a normal teenager. Such a great storyline and this film contains humor for everyone. This movie was exceptional, not very much predictable for everyone, but I knew there was something off about Mysterio.
After Endgame, this was a perfect film for lifting up spirits and for us all to see that even though Spider-Man isn't the strongest, most useful superhero, he's still a teenager, with much to learn, and much to understand.
This film was very good, with scenes where even my grandmother laughed at. I was happy to see my entire family so enlightened by this hilarious and heartwarming film.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

473,ahmetkozan,Everything is just beginning.,8,5 July 2019,"The film tells the story of the events after the Avengers: Endgame. Everywhere was Tony Stark because Peter was incredibly respected and loved him. Naturally, it is normal that Tony Stark's absence is brought to our eyes throughout the film. Even at the first opening of the film, the losses of the Avengers are shown and there is a pleasant sympathy. Peter's loss of his mentor affects his powers, leading him to difficult times. The film successfully manages to reflect this trauma. You're experiencing Peter's pain exactly. After many people disappeared for five years because of Thanos, the world is naturally in recovery. While some people have not aged in any way, some have lost five years of their lives.Far from Home reflects the line between comic book seriousness and comedy action mix very well. The fact that the action scenes are more than the first movie certainly does not bother. Adorned with stunning details, the action scenes look quite impressive, especially when you taste 3D and IMAX. The film offers an incredibly fun and visual feast. MCU films often go fast and are hard to follow, but director Jon Watts has done everything he can to get the important scenes for the audience to enjoy the movie. You will be happy to see faces smelling nostalgia for a few seconds. On the other hand, dress designs and especially the new costume of Spider-Man seem quite successful, of course it is impossible to overlook Mysterio's charisma.Even for audiences who do not master the MCU universe, Far from Home is a surprisingly emotional film. On the other hand, it's like a huge group therapy session for MCU fans.
Far from Home has succeeded to be one of the successful examples of its kind. The line between action and grief is well preserved. Of course, if you're following the MCU universe, you won't miss out on unreasonable details.Finally, the film has two different endings. Obviously, after watching the first end, I wonder where they will tie the third Spider-Man movie and how they can get rid of such chaos. 8/10",Spider-Man - Far from Home

I think people can't see past the teeny bop garbage and cuteness and think that's what spider man was all about...it wasn't.Tom Hollands..... spider man continues to be a travesty to the spider man legacy and we can thank Disney for this garbage, no fault to Holland mind you..he is just acting out what the script and director is telling him to...Just like in Homecoming the villain is pretty pathetic and kind of reminds me of the bogus Mandarin in Iron Man 3, another travesty if I ever saw one.....I like Iron Man I thought Robert Downey Jr played him well but this continuing Iron man worship and iron man tech in the spider man movie needs to stop already it's getting a tad ridiculous....Never felt like there was any danger in this movie, and just didn't get ANY strong feelings in it other than sadness that they are ruining spider man with this reboot. In the Raimi and Webb one's we actually FEEL for spider man and the characters, we feel emotions because they got spider just that good but this reboot just doesn't get spider man so no feelings or emotions other than an occasional aww cute.....a real dud.:(",Spider-Man - Far from Home

485,Rainbowbeany,Keeps getting better,9,1 July 2019,"After seeing this movie I have to say Spider-Man keeps getting better and better. This movie gives us a breath of fresh air after Endgame left us exasperated and broken hearted. The humor is at its best here. I laughed almost the entire movie. The beginning brings us back to right where we left off explaining what happened after everyone returned from the snap. They call it the blip here. Spider-Man is still the local hero helping Aunt May raise money for charity. Marissa Tomei is still fantastic in the role. There was perfect amount of her and Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau). They have a budding relationship and it's very cute. I hope to see more of these two together in the future. Peter soon leaves for a school science trip overseas with his friends and hilarious teachers. Ned is amazing as always finding a girlfriend in Betty Brandt. They play up the super annoying high school/ first love relationship, To hilarious results. There is so many different kind of romantic entanglements in this film. All of which are very amusing. MJ and Peter have this great back and forth throughout the runtime of this film. Zendaya is very funny with the dry dark humor. I love her version of MJ. Having Nick Fury and Maria Hill back is familiar fun. Jake Gyllenhaal is really awesome as Mysterio. It's a different character than I'm used to him playing. But I loved it. Last but not least Tom Holland. He is my Spider-Man. He was born to play this role, it's quite obvious. Tom brings a beautiful sense of awkwardness, courageousness and pathos to the role. The movie's action is fast paced and fun. Although often times I wanted the action scenes to be over with so we could get back to the story. It had me so entangled. I hope a new Spider-Man comes soon. I want to know what happens next!!! I recommend you see this as quickly and as many times as possible. A great time at the movies!",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Do wait for the end credits!",7,4 July 2019,"This is not a film for those who are not so very well into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Being the last movie of the Phase 3, this movie was supposed to deliver lot more than it actual does. Won't get into technicality of acting and special effects... MCU takes care of those things very professionally. That leaves us with the story and the unanswered questions: The movie, doesn't answer many of the questions that have been making the round since Endgame.It breaks everything conventional that was left of ""Spiderman"" we know- from the comics and cartoons... The secret identity, the old Aunt May(Homecoming), the dead Uncle Ben, the punchlines, even MJ is not Mary Jane anymore and there is no Harry Osborn yet.This Spiderman is a lost adolescent going through a lot, he is a confused teenager unlike the previous Spidermen... Having said that, he still has all the ingredients of a solid Superhero- that is kind of dichotomy.This Spiderman is relatable, he is a hero in making and he is not the stereotype superhero we get to see elsewhere. And he is easily duped by a villain whose history has been cleverly reshuffled for the silver screen.This storyline is such a popular one that, it doesn't surprise one, when the truth is finally unearthed. It doesn't pack a punch and that is where the story writers fail. Despite so much of reimagining, they still miss the aim.Shocks:I went-in, hoping that there would be a multi-verse convergence as the trailers had suggested... that turns out to be a Mysterio gimmick.
You ask me, I had some Spiderman: Into the Spider-verse like high expectations from this film, that falls flat!
Also, Peter's identity, one of the things that was so fiercely guarded- that is gone!What Surprised Me:The next few Superhero films are about the Kree-Skrull War, or at least have a lot to do with the Skrull Invasion storyline. That much is clear from the post credits.
Mysterio managed to star as the lead antagonist for an entire film- all alone- that too, so convincingly... that counts for something. The way he announced his evil intent though was lame.
Spidey is the next Iron Man in making, it's kind of nice feeling.
Sam Raimi's JJ and Daily Bugle are back.
MJ and Peter are in a stable relationship... for now!
Happy and Aunt May have a thing!
The post credits are way more exciting than the movie itself.Disappointment:Was hoping to see Normal Osborn, or some other titular villain show up, at least in the post-credit.
I so much wanted Amazing Spiderman to turn up in this one from another earth... that is not happening, but there is a chance that Toby may show up in future.

487,SnigBhaumik,Just a few alternate thoughts,7,12 July 2019,"Far From Home is ravingly collecting praises all around. While this outing of course is great, but I cannot vote it as the best Spidy movie of all time. Tom Halland is gradually and quickly getting into the skin of spiderman, but even now after 5 appearances as spiderman he looks more like a confused teenager with superpowers, rather than your friendly neighborhood superhero. He is still Peter Parker, not Spiderman yet. Sorry, don't know about future movies, but I still like Tobey Maguire more as spiderman.Far From Home is a soft and future-proof launchpad of MCU, after that monumental Avengers series, after the massacre of the Infinity War/Endgame. So it starts slowly, not much actions, no heavy duty stuff, not those big ""earth-at-risk"" challenges, and definitely no colossal villains. More of a breathing space for our hero, and warm up for future. Time for him to revive from the shock of the loss of his mentor Tony Stark. So he focuses rather on MJ, than those usual and monotonous gibberish from Nick Fury. And we feel for him too, his pains and prejudices.Far From Home also gives us a comical and non-harmful brute as Mysterio. Though Jake Gyllenhaal did full justice with the role, still Mysterio somehow didn't fit in into the arena of MCU and Spiderman. Probably because we didn't saw such mushy and non-damaging villain in any Marvel movies? But he surely is suitable to give our down-for-now hero a soft kick to wake up.Far From Home tries to establish the next leader of Avengers gang (read, most powerful marketing material from MCU superhero league). But what happened to the Cap? Thor? Is it because the contract of both Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth has ended? Doctor Strange was never in the race, latest movies have reduced Hulk into a mere comic material and MCU is not sure about the future of Captain Marvel, so she is better to be on duty in other universes.Marvel starting with caution after the Endgame. And planning for the plots of next half-a-dozen films.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

490,jaapeelman,Another ongoing Marvel-adventure,6,7 October 2019,"This Spiderman-movie has a few flaws and one of it is that Peter Parker is a bit of an irritating youngster only busy trying to talk to a girl but evrytime he has the chance he's looking away. And very easy tricked and giving away a Tony-Stark device so dangerous that it is very farfetched he was ever entitled to get it at all.
The story about Mysterio, fooling evrybody with high-tech illusions and drones, is pretty fresh although far from realitsic but okay it is a Spiedrman-movie.
But the biggest flaw are the endscenes giving the movie an open end for a sequel.
Again.....Why is not possible to make a stand-alone movie for a change??
And the last scene after the ongoing credits is absolutely a big mistake.
Therefore a 6 out of 10 but it could have been better by deleting the last two scenes, shrinking the movie with 15 tot 30 minutes and by making Peter Parker not the pussy he is in this movie!",Spider-Man - Far from Home

This was far better than Spiderman Homecoming in my opinion and this is because we get to see Peter Parker tackle his personal problems without AND with the suit on.The acting was great from Jake Gyllenhaal and the psych out scenes with Mysterio were a comic book/tv series fan's dream.

This just in, we all weren't weird as teenagers. I killed aliens, fought Thanos on a planet after jumping onto a space ship but man, approaching a girl in my class is too difficult. I hate how they downplayed the mastery over his abilities. He goes from fighting Thanos, and his alien forces, to struggling against illusions with Mysterio? It was difficult for me to accept such limitations. Solid but not great. Still, to this day, the best Spider-Man movie is Spider-Man 2 arguably Spider-Man 1 with Tobey Mcquire.

I Absolutely loved Jake Gyllenhaal and his performance as Mysterio is my favorite part of the movie, and his costume is very comic book accurate, unlike the Vulture from the previous film, which always bugged me. Jake Gyllenhaal couldn't save this movie, maybe Donnie Darko can go back In time, and make it better. I do love Tom Holland as Spider-Man, and still hate the Indian kid playing Flash Thompson, imposing hardly, still incredibly annoying not intimidating at all. But we are back to Peter not making his own gadgets and suits, technically he did, but he's using Stark tech, so not really. Another thing I noticed Peter is really dumb, a lot of time, all he thinks about is getting with MJ, instead of focusing on being the greatest he can be. Better then Homecoming but still flawed, definitely not amazing, maybe 3rd times the charm.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
500,wms-92741,Terrific entertainment,10,19 December 2020,"Spiderman: Far from Home is not intended to be a serious movie, directed at hard-core fans of the comic books. It's intended to be fun, and it absolutely nails this. It's funny, with engaging characters and - unusually for a super hero movie - some unexpected plot twists. For a welcome change, the end of the movie does not require saving the world. It's well paced to boot; breaks in the action don't descend into boring explorations of angst and devotion to duty. If you want to spend a couple hours away from your life and have a good time, this is your movie.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
501,ksgillihan,Far from the charm of the source material,5,18 July 2019,"It's funny to think that the first few Spiderman adaptations were actually the closest thing we've gotten to what Spidey is supposed to be like. We see glimpses of him but unfortunately that's all we get. You don't need to make huge changes to something in order to make it stand out. You just need to be true to the character's origin. Tom Holland does an excellent job with what he's given though. I think he has the potential to be the best iteration yet; it's just a shame that the writing isn't up to par.To say that this movie feels flat would be and understatement. They chose probably the worst antagonist they could have to feature in this movie. Mysterio? Really? Fish bowl head gets the lead baddie role? Sometimes I think the people who make these kind of decisions have never actually read any of the material that the characters come from. An un-interesting bad guy fights Spiderman in an un-interesting way, in un-interesting situations. I also have a huge problem with what they did to MJ. Why did they feel the need to do this? It does absolutely nothing to the story to change something so drastically. MJ was a spunky, fiery and sexy redhead bombshell that came into Peter's life like a riptide out of nowhere. She's a force of nature for Peter's character and his life. Now she's been turned into a snarky and gloomy SJW who has as much charisma as a cheese sandwich. Don't fix something if it wasn't broken in the first place. This movie is mediocre at best.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

503,brandonmckay8,EDITH!,10,1 July 2019,"Major spoilers in this post!Even dead, I'm the hero.That summed up Tony Stark perfectly. This film had a beautiful tribute to the originals, starting with a video of those who have left us to the tune of 'I will always love you'it starts 8 months after the events of Endgame & it's quite clear Peter has been struggling with the loss of Tony.I personally wasn't a big fan of Homecoming but this movie ticked all the right boxes for me. It's humour was A-grade & perfectly well timed. There were some great scenes with Happy & Aunt May, a nice moment between Happy & Peter as they talk about Tony but the addition of Mysterio took this film to another level with the idea of 'multi universes' but it's not what it seems! Another massive success for Marvel as Spider-Man goes to another level behind Tom Holland.
For those shippers, MJ & Peter share a couple kisses at the end of the film before a massive post credit scene where a video is posted where Mysterio reveals Spider-Man's identity, setting up a huge impact going forward. How will Peter cope?",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Ned and Betty start to dater out of no where, and Ned talking about him being a man and how he has finally grown over a plane ride, and that they continually called each other babe really pissed me off. and then to ice the cake, they broke up at that very kind of like a long one night stand, it really pissed me off. so i give the movie a 9.9 out of 10 for that reason and that reason only.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

I was okay with Mysterio being different from the comics (as from the trailers), so I sit down prepared to have fun. First quarter of the movie, it's okay for a Marvel movie, reminds me of the previous Spider-Man but something was off. That something would prove to make the plot of the second and third part of the movie.It was AWESOME. The Mysterio moments are perfectly executed. I just couldn't believe they manage to make Mysterio realistic (as far as possible) and still feel fun.And there are like 2 (or 3) moments where you feel the movie is ended but then BAM, it's not over yet. And I love those moments if done well. And they are done close to perfection in this one.I don't score it for philosophy or being a movie that will mark you, no, I score it for the amount of fun and the flow of the story and how close to making sense it feels.

There's always some new creative stories in the Marvel Comic Universe.The most unique and original one is Dr. Strange. It's just incredibly mind blowing on how such visual effects of alternate reality can be. No one have ever thought of this kind of bizarre mind shattering universe. The next is Ant Man. I mean who could ever thought that the microscopic universe and normal universe can be so harmonically merged with back and forth size changes in such a tense combat with stunning visual effect?Then finally, it's this Spider Man story. The idea to have a realistic holographic enemy is just another one of Stan Lee's creative imagination. It's original and visually stunning and the story line is also great.

Especially seeing one of their greatest and popular heroes being reduced to a spider version of Ironman.Read the comics or compare the other spiderman films.

There is one plot point that really bugged me though - the fact that Mysterio and his cronies are all motivated by resentment and hatred of Tony Stark. Sure Tony could be egotistical at times. But he sacrificed his life to undo Thanos' snap. Statistically at least a few of these people would have been ""dusted"" and then restored. I mean, I've had a couple of bad bosses in my time. But if one of them literally brought me back from the dead, I could probably find it in my heart to forgive them.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
511,kikoydaba3,the latest Spider-Man instead merely serves as a palette cleanser to the Infinity Saga,4,28 July 2019,"Far from being a serviceable film, the latest Spider-Man instead merely serves as a palette cleanser to the Infinity Saga with a half-baked and disjointed story line. Sony has to strike with the Marvel craze while the iron is hot. Definitely one of the worst interpretation of the character in live action.First off, there are some good elements about this film. Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio brings sympathy, likeability and an underlying sinister element to the character. The design is wonderful owing to its faithfulness to the comics. Outside of the villain, the rest of the film is subpar. Lifting the film can't be done by a single character alone.The plot of the film follows Spider-Man and his classmates as they travel Europe for a class tour. None of it makes sense. The character does not grow and the different cities have no relevance emotionally and thematically. Setting this in New York City would have resolved this issue. After all, the character lives there. Plot details and decisions matter less over character development. However, the plot here serves little purpose other than to present ""spectacular"" visuals.Usually, jokes and comedy in the Marvel films land when they serve the characters or are not jarring to the point of being included for the sake of laughs. In here, everything is forced and contrived. Even the awkward teenage love story. Tom Holland and Zendaya, who plays MJ, frankly have no chemistry. Immediately as the film starts Spider-Man is head over heels for MJ who he has shown no liking for in Homecoming. While it is understandable considering the characters are teenagers, infatuation starts from something and this is something the film failed to present. Marrisa Tomei as Aunt May is worse here with her relationship with Happy Hogan, played by Jon Favreau. Teen drama does not mean being dumb down. Maturity can be threaded in the teenage love story without being caricatures.Thematically, Far From Home is a repeat of Homecoming and it does so on a lesser note. Iron Man is shoehorned, again. Spider-Man now seeks approval and meaning from Iron Man, again. Mysterio and his allies find motivation through Iron Man's past mistakes. It's time for Spider-Man to be his own man as he really is and leave Iron Man alone. Spider-Man is the same character as he was in Homecoming, which is disappointing after four previous appearances in the same continuity. Coming on the heels of Infinity War and Endgame, Far From Home should have explored what it was like for the world to recover after Hulk re-snapping half of the universe, but is mentioned only in passing during the beginning. The film is further hampered by sloppy pacing and editing due to these lapses in story lines. The technical qualities are poor, aside from the score and soundtrack. The CGI is also serviceable at best.If audiences care about concluding the Infinity Saga, Far From Home is a must watch. But as an engrossing film like its predecessors, it fails.4/10",Spider-Man - Far from Home

The Second Happy says to Peter (in a sheepish way, sounding like someone's five year old nephew) that ""Nick Fury scares me"", then goes on to flirt like a insecure teenager with Aunt May, pretty much sets the tone for the film- cringeworthy.
Far from home, far from ""with great power comes great responsibility.""
It is a teenage angst movie, riddled with PC comedy and kids being smarter than adults, characters cast as dark and brooding (Mary Jane) and overall a lackluster film relying on subpar CGI.
Disney seems to like writing for kids and teens, which is exactly what this movie is suited for. Slap-stick comedy and an overall lack of caring what happens.
Give it a shot, but I do not recommend any type of expectation.

Heck, he was given more to do than Vulture did in Homecoming.... Jake G. also KILLED IT as Mysterio..... MJ was also great in this! She was just a deadpan side character in Homecoming, Peter and her had GREAT chemistry and MJ is much better than Liz. Even with little screen, Aunt May was fun as well, and super hot as always, Happy was awesome and can probably be considered the new uncle for Peter! Not to mention, he has a thing with May now ;) Nick Fury was also fantastic as always! Holland as Peter and Spiderman, seriously the best adaptation to date..... Holland's Spiderman is given SO MUCH MORE...to do than in Homecoming. He was really nerfed in that one, and in this one.....complete opposite....Everything in this movie was fantastic. The teen stuff, whenever this movie was not in superhero mode, was great! All the teen stuff, super relatable.... and it was entertaining. Many complained it was too much or something, I didn't think so at all...This movie also had much darker elements than in Homecoming. There was like...one dark piece in Homecoming, when Toomes found out who Spiderman actually was. In this one.... Mysterio toyed with Peter to some INSANE levels!!!!! And Mysterio himself was also a fantastic villain! That entire bit with the illusions driving Peter crazy, MJ's fake death, those Spiderman clones attacking Peter, that was some SCARY stuff, and I was not expecting any of it.... That was amazing! Easily one of the best parts of the entire movie! ALSO THAT ZOMBIE IRON MAN SCENE!!! DAAARK!!!!It was also awesome how J. Jonah Jameson made a cameo in this movie..... I seriously hope it's official! Plus....Mysterio's revealing Spiderman's identity.... woah.....The second scene I didn't see. I had to leave the theater before it could show, but I did read on it....and Fury and Hill were skrulls THE WHOLE TIME IN THIS MOVIE???!!!!!!!! DANG! I am honestly not sure if I like that idea tbhThis was a great movie, though! I've got no reason not to give it a 9/10! This movie blows Homecoming out of the water! And yes, I think this is also better than Raimi's movies. A lot of things that took place in Raimi's movies didn't make sense, while this movie is a different story.One thing that I did not like about this movie was that the Iron Spider suit was not in this film.....whereas Peter was using it in the trailers...fighting a bunch of people.... Why was this not in the movie???",Spider-Man - Far from Home
518,Andy_MJD,Yeah. Gud stuff,9,4 February 2020,"Another solid addition to the MCU, and to the SMCU too. I love how we're in this post-avengers world, and the villain reflects a part of Peter's internal struggle coming to terms with his mentor (and father figure) dying at the end of Endgame. The graphics were incredible, and I was impressed at the illusion sequences. The film is both funny and tense when it needs to be, and background characters have nice detail in order to continue fleshing out their character (e.g. Flash's neglect by his parents; the joke-y relation of Ned (guy in the chair) and his gf. I'd like to emphasize how clever I find the use of an ""Avengers-level threat"" because Peter Parker has to live up to those that came before him, despite wanting to just ""be a friendly neighbourhood Spiderman"" (I love how they integrated that feature of his character into this bigger franchise). Speaking of integrating, let's talk about that bonus scene. J.K. Simmons returns as the famous head of the Daily Prophet, being able to call an end to his character arc by finally revealing who Spiderman is, as well as framing him, setting up for the next movie.

His charming portrayal of the web slinger elevates this rather ho hum Marvel entry (Peter Parker's European Vacation) into something more than the sum of its rather messy parts. He's just so lovable, vulnerable and adorable in the role. Tom was made to play Spiderman. Physically adept and emotionally relatable, he is totally convincing as a 16 year old kid, something which the excellent Maguire and Garfield, just didn't quite get - they seemed too old to be high schoolers, whereas PP and his squeeze MJ (Zendaya) look like kids and act like kids. The plot is fun but scrappy with Jake Gyllenhall chewing the scenery as the ever so evil Mysterio and Samuel L Jackson just playing SLJ - his portrayal of Nick Fury in this outing feels like he was going through the motions.

Maybe I should not have watched it at a cozy Sunday afternoon, when my sleepiness was so easily aroused. Despite my desperate efforts in staying awake, I could not help but dozed off a couple of times, but it did not affect comprehension of the gist of film. Though I was not aware that Gyllenhaal would play the antagonist in the film. The positive effects given by his dashy looks certainly helped mask his malignant intentions and deceive the audience. The whole length of 2 hours was not too monotonous, thanks to the bashful relationship between the muted superhero and his first love in high school.If you only seek to relax your nerves in the simplest way at the end of a tiring week, superhero movies may be the right medicine, and it has better effects when taken with the presence of your chummy friends. I would say this is a mediocre one among the ocean of superhero movies, but it was soothing and my brains got enough rest through the seemingly endless 129 minutes.

534,SouthernViews,Far from Believable,5,8 October 2019,"I'm a big fan of superhero movies. I love that today's technology can bring these fantastic characters to life. There have been some fantastic movies and some real stinkers. SM-FfH has excellent acting, directing, effects, score, etc. Unfortunately, the one thing it is missing is a solid story free of plot holes. I fear that Marvel slapped together a weak script in their attempt to connect Phase 3 and 4. Once you've had time to digest the story, you realize how rushed the script seems to be.SPOILERS BELOWLet's walk through some of the gaping plot holes that, IMO, bring this movie's quality down.
1) Tony gives the all-powerful EDITH glasses to Peter Parker. They allow death strikes from the sky, but don't come with instructions? Um, sure.
2) If EDITH is truly an all-knowing AI, wouldn't she know that Quentin Beck is a former Stark employee and not a being from another dimension?
3) SHIELD's own technology is so poor that it can't see that stealth drones are generating the attacks? While we're on the subject, the attacks are too insanely believable - a fist of water knocks out a building, but that fist is an illusion, and the drones are secretly knocking the building down somehow? With stealth lasers?
4) The final act with the endless projected illusions looked like an excuse for the VFX team to go crazy and seemed very hard to believe.
5) Once Peter signed over control of EDITH to Beck - a far too easy task - why would EDITH listen to Peter later? Did they have dual control? Shouldn't Beck have revoked Peter's access?These are the big ones, and IMO, contributed to a tough pill to swallow. I find myself rolling my eyes constantly as these issues surfaced. It came across as lazy writing. Captain Marvel was another letdown. If this is the future of Marvel, I'm done.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
535,skylermoore,Fun!,8,4 July 2019,Mysterio was the biggest flaw with this movie.

543,tadaia,Somewhat entertaining but not a great MCU edition,5,5 October 2019,"Spider-Man Far From Home had great VFX and a few good laughs, but a KEY character component of Spider-Man with the Avengers films to date has been his incessant pleas to ""Put me in coach!""... indeed, to the point of annoyance. Now, they write a sequel where Peter's acting like he can't be bothered with the Avengers when he's actually needed? Its not that hard to keep a character consistent. That kind of unnecessary departure is just lazy writing to me. In my opinion most of the films from the MCU put this one to shame.Also, since they're playing fast and loose with characterizations can we go back to an older aunt May?

There's a heartfelt subplot between Peter and MJ and as ever great effects with Spider-man bouncing effortlessly around the screen. That then is also the weakness as is does slip back into the typical grandstanding massive destruction, little regard for loss of life, not once but on several occasions.

551,watcher101,"Better than Amazing Spiderman, but not Sam Raimi's",6,21 July 2019,"Like Homecoming, Far From Home holds up as another good entry. It's better than both entries in the Amazing Spiderman series, but not as good as Sam Raimi's trilogy (excluding the 3rd movie of course).I'm really liking this version of Peter Parker. He feels more like someone his age who's in over his head but doing what he can, and I love the humorous side to him. I still preferred Doc Ock along with Dafoe's and DeHaan's Green Goblins to Vulture and Mysterio though. Also, I'm really not liking the personality of this series MJ. The MJ we're familiar with, while needy at times, is fiery and full of life, but this one is dispirited and uninterested most of the time, like some broody and morbid goth or emo kid. I don't know why they gave her a personality like that, but I don't care for it.While I enjoyed he film, there's one real... I wouldn't say problem, but issue I have with it. It's a little too Avenger-y. I get that it's part of the MCU, and so it's expected for some Avenger stuff to be in it, but it feels like they're getting a little too much Avengers in my Spiderman. I just would have preferred the movie be a little more stand-alone. Still a really great movie though, and I'm looking forward to seeing more.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

553,sagniknath,A step up from Homecoming in terms of character development and CGI,8,5 July 2019,"Spider-man definitely feels more fleshed out both as a concept and as a character compared to Homecoming within the confines of the MCU. Homecoming had felt more like a testing ground to launch the character of Spider-man into the MCU. Kevin Feige was probably unsure as to how much the late entry would affect audience expectations so he made Spider-man play second fiddle to Iron Man till the third act. Far from Home by contrast feels more like a conventional Spider-man film.Character interactions were enjoyable as well. I didn't like Zendaya as MJ in Homecoming because she had looked too much like a professional model to be starring as a character who is personally very close to Peter Parker in Spider-Man lore. However, she definitely seems more like a real teenager here. Jake Gyllenhall did alright. This was probably the first time I saw him in a mainstream popcorn movie and his character really did not have much dramatic depth where he could have given his personal touch. So I have no complaints about him.There is a plot twist which I easily saw coming even before the first act had ended. It's a very overused trope to create plot twists in general. Also, I wish the other school students were more fleshed out as were the main characters.However, the CGI in the third act really heightens the sensation of being in a Spider-man movie. It's drastically improved upon Homecoming where the CGI suit had looked so fake. Here when there is an action sequence involving Spider-Man , you can actually insert yourself into the character as he web swings to heighten the immersion. In terms of great CGI, this is easily very close to the entry scene of Spider-Man in TASM2 which still remains my personal favorite Spider-Man sequence ( too bad the rest of that film was so bland).There is a mid credits scene that is sure to bring back good memories to some audiences. Overall, I would recommend the film as light fun.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
554,terryzhangtianrun,A 8.0 movie,8,16 July 2019,"I rate this movie 8 stars for following reasons(I'm a primary student who is from china):

556,WillsFilms,Spider-Man: Far From Home Swings Further Than Homecoming,9,7 July 2019,"Spider-Man: Far From Home is a fun MCU outing that surpasses its predecessor in almost every way. Tom Holland delivers his best performance as the titular superhero and his character arc and interesting and sets him up as the new lead for the MCU's next saga. Jake Gyllenhaal is an amazing new addition to the franchise as Mysterio. He's an interesting character, with compelling goals and one if the most creative schemes in the franchise. Samuel L Jackson is as amazing as always as Nick Fury and Jacob Batalon is hilarious and likeable as Ned Leeds. The movie has exciting action and some of the best visuals in the MCU. There is one scene halfway through the movie with such creative and beautiful visuals that you need to see it for yourselves. The humour is well executed and never feels forced which, as much as I love this franchise, is a common crime shared by several MCU films. I also strongly suggest that you all stick around after the movie ends, as the post credit scenes are some of the best and most shocking in the entire MCU. I strongly recommend this movie to all that are fans of the MCU, Spider-Man and superhero films in general.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

558,Ryan_Barbakins,A Spectacular Surprise from Marvel,8,6 July 2019,"I didn't expect too much from this film, because I had thought that Endgame had met their amazing-ness quota for the year, but I guess I was wrong. Spider-Man: Far From Home was better than Homecoming and better than every stand-alone Marvel film since Guardians Vol 1! The thing I loved so much about Homecoming was that it put a relatable high school student into the MCU, and this film continues with that, while having some of the most entertaining Action Sequences in the entire MCU! The movie felt air-tight and didn't lag on with unnecessary scenes. Every scene felt important from a character or plot stand-point. It felt great to see another Marvel movie after the events of Endgame and Infinity War, and to see how the world learned to adapt and then re-adapt with the ""Bliped"" back in the world
The movie is pretty funny and had me laughing quite a lot. Of course this is thanks to the great character writing accompanied by great dialogue. Peter Parker and MJ's relationship felt so real and so awkward at times. The scene right before the Opera starts, you can really feel Peter's emotion and his want to not be spider-man and just be a normal high school kid. His dilemma of choosing Spider-Man to fill in Tony Stark's shoes, or just be a regular kid is quite daunting, and the audience relates to Peter when he finally does make a decision.
Mysterio being the villain was something in the works for a while, and it definitely payed off, because he was a really interesting vilian that could do a lot of Doctor Strange-esque things. This of course made the action really tripy while getting into the minds of the characters. At its very core, Mysterio is a lot like Syndrome from The Incredibles. He wants to be a super hero, so he creates his own villain that he knows he can destroy, so he looks good in the public eye. Syndrome in my opinion did this better, however Mysterio is still great and is definitely not just a Syndrome Knock off.
Overall, this movie felt much more alive and deep than its predecessor. And that's saying a lot, because I really liked Homecoming! The action was better, the villain was better, and the 2 twists in the credits get me really excited for what comes next in the MCU.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
559,Sumpmonster,Zendaya Shines,7,10 September 2019,"So Zendaya's character is ""MJ"" and not Mary Jane Watson, but there is no doubt she captures the MJ persona from the comics better than any other movie incarnation of the character. Smart, tough and sassy is exaclty how MJ should be and not some simpering, needy woman.
The movie is not perfect and the narrative is a bit thin, but it doesn't lack enteratainment.

Don't get me wrong I'm not criticizing the teenager approach since it's refreshing but I prefer a funny and yet intense Spider-Man and on this movie it was neither of them. I found the story pretty basic , the chance of the world on the verge of destruction and no other super heroes available , the tour around Europe like "" Spider-Man's got traveling around Europe"" movie ... I'm not a fan also of the heavy CGI... the suit looks more and more unnatural, sometimes I felt like I was watching a cartoon... and that made me feel a bit sad about one of my favorite heroes... But since Holland is a young lad , I hope to see this character leaving Spider-Man growing and hopefully lines like the one where everyone's revealing some secret because they think the end is near ... that's so dated and not funny!! All and all it was visually intense but with all that CGI, even that couldn't save this one.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
564,jctundis,"A couple of bright spots, but mediocre overall",5,13 July 2019,"So, yeah, I finally got around to seeing Spider-Man: Far From Home. Meh. I know it's primarily a YA movie, but I expected more ""pop"" and fun judging from all the positive feedback I've heard. I was largely bored.Other than Ned (or Ganke) all the supporting cast was lifeless to awful (looking at you, JB Smoove), having lost any charm they had from the first movie. Why anyone would be interested in this one-note, repetitively morose version of ""MJ"" is beyond me. Tom Holland is still fantastic as Peter/Spidey. Samuel L Jackson just looks tired and Jake Gyllenhaal phones in possibly the flattest performance I've ever seen from him. As with most MCU movies, the humor is plastic and forced. The writers also repeatedly screwed up the rules of the ""blip.""On the plus side, there are some very cool action and F/X scenes - especially during the final battle.There's also a scene in the middle of the movie that is EVERYTHING I've always wanted in an onscreen Spidey vs Mysterio confrontation. Pure magic!Sure, the plot was always going to be 100% predictable (unless you've never read a Spider-Man comic or watched a cartoon in your life), but these movies aren't made for comic book fans. So I was fine with that, as long the execution was good. It wasn't bad... just mediocre. A nice, safe film for the family.There are two post movie scenes - one mid-credits that screws up continuity, makes very little narrative sense, and looks awful - and a second one at the very end of one of the longest credit scrolls in history that ties directly into one of the worst MCU movies, is painfully unfunny, and seriously lowers my interest in seeing any further MCU product.In the end Spider-Man: Far From Home is, with the exception of 2 extremely bright spots, a fairly banal, tween product for the masses. So of course, it's going to make a crapload of money (636 million worldwide and counting).5.5/10",Spider-Man - Far from Home
565,deandsouza15892,Post credits make it a 10/10,8,3 July 2019,"I don't even know to begin. Let's start with a quick,though huge, compliment to Marvel, for actually listening to its audience. For understanding what we want and aspiring to deliver. Spider-Man Far from Home had the challenge of being both a sequel to Homecoming and a direct follow-up to the biggest film of the decade. How does it hold up? Really really well.This film is a lot of fun to watch; the writers and director have crafted a Spider-Man story so unique,that it can only apply to this specific iteration of the web-slinger. This isn't based on a comic-book,because none of them have had this story before. Yet, with such an action packed and comedic delivery, you're constantly entertained (watch the post-credits scenes).Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio is top notch; we have another excellent Spider-Man villain,ladies and geeks. Tom Holland as always, brilliant performance. I also love how all of Spidey's entourage and family grow with him through the film.But holy hell,the references and homages are off the charts. Remember 12 years ago when we used to be happy with an Easter egg or two; we're now a at a point where Marvel films drop universe altering knowledge bombs every 15 minutes (seriously,don't miss the post-credits scenes). There's throwbacks to the Spider-Man cartoon, the original comics, the Raimi films. Heck, fans of Spider-Man PS4 will love this film. There so much to process,and it's impossible to do without spoiling.This isn't perfect though; I did notice some really unfortunate editing. The CGI on Peter Parker,when he's not Spider-Man, isn't the best. And of course, the plot is a little more stretched out than it should be.
But at the heart of it, this pulls off a very contained story. (There are two post-credits; don't leave the theatre). It's relatable, funny, cute , quite emotional and also very light.As a film, and as a Marvel fanboy, this is a good summer flick. 8/10.
Those post credits scenes though, 10/10. The best by far in a movie! Incredibly bold; it's all you'll be talking about.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

I mean the story was spot on and there were no questions about how this movie was made but where's the spiderman slings a projectile back and the baddy with a funny punchline?

567,dtrani,Pretty average. But better than most...,7,23 July 2019,"Spider-Man Far From Home is a pretty average superhero film, which is good. Most hero films nowadays tend to leave out important aspects of a good film for realistic CGI fight scenes and funny jokes. Spider-Man Far From Home balances it all out, while still giving us good CGI, which is definitely respectable in my opinion. This movie is not without flaws and definitely had moments that felt unnecessary, but the good outweighs the bad in this case. The villain didn't feel completely developed either and the motives for his actions were very plain and simple. It some ways, that's fine, but it doesn't engage the audience into their emotions like Sandman did in Spider-Man 3.
The ""high school-traveling-field trip"" feeling they gave it was a good addition to the film and helped with relationship building, which was nice.Once again, the film is not bad. It is better than most recent superhero films but still has slight quirks. It some way it feels more like a high school movie than a super hero movie, which isn't bad.

Be confused as to why a man that supposedly swore off WMD's gave loads of them to a sixteen year old. Be baffled as to why the director/writer keeps forgetting that these kids are supposed to be SIXTEEN years old. And has a grown woman order a SIXTEEN year old boy to take his clothes off, and another boy take pictures of him in his underwear...and its played for laughs. That's not funny that's ephebophilia! It's also a crime in most states nowadays. Had it been a grown man ordering a sixteen year old girl to take her clothes off, and someone snapping pictures...I doubt quite so many people would laugh. Try to grasp why Tony Stark would have turned down hologram technology if he was such a brazziliant smarty pants. My god man! He invented holodecks!

They're spending more time out of their masks than in them. But now they want to annex the minute and a half you get now as well"".

Mysterio is also fantastic, Jake Gyllenhaal is such a charismatic actor, you can't help but love him.I believe this is one of the better MCU movies, like the first one it has got well written jokes and characters. I really enjoyed Mysterio's powers, especially that really cool illusion scene. The way the way the elements transition is beautifully done and with Jake Gyllenhaal's frightening monologue in the background it is just spectacular. My biggest gripe with the movie is the scene in the pub after Peter gives Mysterio the glasses and Mysterio gives a painfully bad exposition dump about their motives and how they did it. It's the worst scene in the entire MCU. It's so poorly written and ruins the moment. I'm not sure how they should have executed the reveal that he's evil, but there is a pretty big rule, ""show don't tell"", and this scene is entirely telling the audience the plot, which makes it really hard to watch.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

584,chasemykleby,excited for Spider-Man Home Away From Homecoming. ;),8,2 July 2019,"""Spider-Man Far From Home"" Review
(8/10)Serving as both a lighthearted coda to the decidedly serious and momentous Avengers: Endgame and the exciting kickoff to the next phase of the MCU, Spider-Man: Far From Home is an extremely fun, cleverly executed, and frequently hilarious adventure film.
After all the mass destruction and cosmic resurrection in Avengers: Endgame, it's about time that the characters in a Marvel blockbuster had a holiday - and that's what they get in Spider-Man: Far From Home. It's a holiday for the viewer, too. For a change, we aren't asked to worry about the fate of the universe; we're invited to tag along with the 16-year-old Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and his schoolmates as they head off on a tour of Europe. Souvenirs, not supervillains, are his main concern.
It's hard to write this review without spoiling a lot of the plot and the ""big twist"", but I'll do my best to state that I had higher expectations for this movie and it did it's best to live up to the expectations of that Kevin Feige put on it. Like its predecessor, Spider-Man: Homecoming, it works both as a superhero film and as a tale of teenage foibles and fun. But it seems to show some cracks when it comes to the 3rd act.
There is a scene featuring Spider-Man and the true villain after he learns the twist, and that action set piece I really enjoyed and was a creative way to show off the powers of the two characters. It's a shame that the final battle couldn't do the same.
The movie was great, thanks to its sweet humor, clever commentary, Far From Home continues the journey of Peter Parker from kid hero to Tony Stark's successor, but the final battle really left a sour taste in my mouth. Until the post credit scene started, and left me excited for Spider-Man Home Away From Homecoming. ;)",Spider-Man - Far from Home
585,CasualFnSViewer,"A sequel that packs in a lot more adventure and surprises than the first one, Far From Home does well in tying up the events of the former films from the MCU.",8,7 July 2019,"As Peter Parker (Tom Holland) gradually recovers from the events of the Infinity War and Endgame, he attempts to get on with his somewhat regular high school life. When a school trip is announced, he puts together a plan to earn MJ's attention, which isn't easy when you're a part time superhero with a responsibility.A main theme that was mainly evident throughout the film was Uncle Ben's iconic line: with great power, comes great responsibility. For how simple the premise was for this film, the minor details taken as inspiration from the comics adds a bit more complexity to its narrative. Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal), the primary friend (or foe?) in this film, becomes an integral part of Peter Parker's understanding of how his mantle as a superhero is important to the world.The auditory and visual aspects of the film are not too different to the previous films in the MCU. What makes this a unique treat however is continually seeing the character development chemistry of Peter Parkers classmates with each other. That was, for sure, a highlight in this film and adds more character rather than have these people simply be a part of the background.Very fun, comedic, and adventurous, the colorful cast of Far From Home makes this another exciting journey for viewers.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
586,nizzambaharuddin,KINDA OKAY. GOOD MONOTONE VILLAIN,6,13 January 2020,"MILD SPOILER ALERTFinally a Spider-Man film that includes my favorite Spidey villain, Mysterio! But for the film itself, it's pretty meh in my opinion.The plot twist doesn't really count as one, especially if you've even a few Spider-Man comics. The plot is pretty standard and tame, as is with most of MCU solo films (barring Captain America films).I like what they did with Mysterio. Mysterio is a guy with many tricks up his sleeve, so incorporating modern technology is a welcome change. All of his illusion scenes are easily my favorite scenes in the film.What I don't like and love to hate is everything has to somehow connect to Tony Stark! We get it, he's the MCU biggest character. Even after Endgame he stills need to be in the story. A little creative and new ideas to incorporate guys, please la.I've never been a fan of making Peter Parker a Stark errand boy. Never will be. It's like making Batman an apprentice of The Atom. Spider-Man's bigger than Ironman will ever be. Fact. Hopefully for his next film, they can finally shed this stupid mentor thing and he can finally be what Peter Parker is supposed to be. Better than Tony Stark that is. 😉Other than that, a pretty okay film. Thought about giving this film an extra half a star for making me (a Mysterio fanboy) finally see his favorite Spidey villain on screen. But the overall story and the standard template of the MCU films make this an okay-ish film at best.If you're the biggest MCU fan you've ever known, then you'll probably say this film is awesome. But if you're not, I'd say you're not missing that much. Unless you're a fellow Mysterio fan. Then go watch it. But don't expect too much of it.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

It's sort of a bad Miles Morales merge with Peter Parker. Or Saved By The Bell goes superhero. The characters don't even seem smart even though they are supposed to be science wiz kids.

591,lawrencekaneshiro,"Fun, enjoyable and an hour to long.",8,6 July 2019,"It has been five years since the ""Blip"" as they call it, that took away half the universe's population, a lot of Peter Parker's classmates have aged a bit for the exception of Peter who is still a 16-year-old junior in high school. Months pass after the Avengers beat Thanos and brought everyone back from the nether or wherever they ended up. Peter/Spider-Man (Tom Holland) feels that he needs a vacation to help him grieve for his friend and mentor, Tony Stark/Ironman (Robert Downey Jr.). Luckily Peter's class is headed to Europe This is where everything goes south.The gang is all here; Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), MJ (Zendaya), and Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon). The class first heads to Venice when suddenly a water creature called an element wreaks havoc on the group of students. Conflicted about staying with his class or jumping into the fight, Peter reluctantly joins forces with a new ""superhero"" Quentin Beck/Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal). Together both of these superheroes manage to beat back the water creature. Enter Nick Fury who insists that Spider-Man steps-up since he is the only remaining Avenger on Earth at the moment. The class then moves on to Prague and then London for the last showdown.The latest Spider-Man has plenty of action to complement the thin story that includes a lot of teenage angst. If it were not for the strong performances by the main cast this spidey version would have fallen flat. Diehard spider fans may not like the direction the last two Spider-Man versions (Garfield and Holland) have gone, however, Tom Holland's version is refreshing and fun to watch. I did have problems with the whole Mysterio thing. Although it was meant to be a roost, it was thinly played out and a bit awkward. It was not until Mysterio finally revealed his true intent that I got to enjoy the villainy angle, even if it still felt contrived.

Just a good time pass....,6,7 July 2019,"Its kind of illogical that since 2002 this is the third edition of Marvel's Spider Man franchise and in every edition there is a different avatar.

What's trending now-a-days with movie makers is just to add a new story in any franchise few logic are forcibly planted in the older stories. For instance, Mysterio (Quentin Beck) while justifying his position was accusing 'TONY STARK' as a FRAUD !!!! Is this a joke ???

Worth watchng though,7,8 January 2020,"Bottom line up front...This was a good attempt to change up the plot line a little with the same lesson to be learned which has been beaten to death in many other films. The major plot twist was very annoying though (at least to me). Liked the film overall but it was not a ""great"" film.Okay, for a Sony/Marvel film, this was on par with the others or maybe a little lower. I have rated most Marvel films in the 8 range (I rarely rate films a 10, have only done it 8 times in over 480 films rated). This one is a little lower though. As mentioned in my bottom line, the main plot twist was annoying and to me was naive and childish for any teenager to make. Thus, why it was annoying. I did like the hand off scene in the film (will not give it way) as I feel this worked well with the progression of the Marvel films. The culmination sequence seems a little over the top or very close to it. Again, at least to me.CGI as usual was very good which is what you would expect from a film of this type. Did not see any issues with the CGI ""eye candy"".On another note, this film seems to leave some things opened ended which may have been by design as it appeared to be set up to allow Sony to go its own way with Spider Man or the come back into the fold with Disney.

But somehow Nick Fury manages something and sends Peter on duty and he gives Tony Stark's glasses to Peter Parker. As a partner, Nick chose Mysterio for Peter to do the job.What you have seen in the trailer is nothing. The screenplay has a lot of surprise. There are 2 post credit scene in the movie. You should watch the post credit scene. And it is important because it is the last Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 3's last movie. This movie gives the answer of many question and you can see some poster of Iron Man which shows that how much people miss him. From the 1st half, the screenplay was not that much impressive but in the second half the action were awesome. 1st half they have shown us about the attraction of Michelle Jones and Peter Parker but the 2nd half had a lot of action scene. The CGI and the VFX was totally awesome.Tom Holland gave his best performance for this character. According to me Tom Holland is better than all other Spider-Man.

Significant just because they said-so, like they did with Captain Marvel, worth making but didn't turn out to be necessary like they made out.The end credits weren't as interesting as they made out either. It's ones that you could youtube or be told and not miss anything, visually.Peter Parker, Ned and Mysterio do their part real well as expected.Nick Fury is too much of a caricature now, compared to everyone else on the screen, who seem grounded. He needs to be replaced as the leader of the Avengers now, with someone younger and who can contribute to the action and pace of these movies. he has co-starred in the worst single-character Marvel movies, Iron Man 2, Captain Marvel and now this.Not the amazing movie that i've been led to believe, a poorer entry in the MCU, not that good especially for the final film in this Phase.

612,sophaljonesy,The best MCU Spiderman so far,8,6 July 2019,"When Peter Parker decides to go on school trip to Europe and woo his crush MJ, what could go wrong? Well, being a Marvel superhero movie, you know he will have many comic moments with his teen friends and face a supervillain on the trip. However, despite the simple template, the movie delivers on many levels.
The first level is the plot. The story is interesting because Peter Parker has a character arc. Since his character debut in Civil War, Spiderman was a comically side-character. In Spiderman: Homecoming, Spiderman seemed more like a teen rom com lead with superpowers. However in this installment, we see Spiderman becoming a true hero who could rise up to an 'Avenger-level' threat on his own.
On the second level, there is the challenge. Marvel manages to keep the stakes high by having Spiderman struggle internally with what he wants to be and puts him to the ultimate test when he faces his real challenge. Here we see Spiderman get beaten and frightened. We also feel for him and wonder how he could rise above the challenge and defeat his nemesis.
On the third level, there is the cinematography. Though it can be argued that there is a lot of CGI, the choice of using swing shots to immerse with Spiderman's action actually works and provides both fun and thrills. Of course the aerial shots of different landscapes are great, and so are the creature effects for the Elementals.
On the fourth level, there is the side characters. Many side characters manage to shine and provide more than comic relief. We see Happy Hogan and Aunt May play roles as father and mother figures for Peter Parker. There is Nick Fury being the authoritative figure, and Ned the friendly, comically sidekick. There is also MJ, Peter's crush, who is more than just a damsel in distress.
In fact, these four reasons are enough for me to believe it the best MCU Spiderman movie. P.s. Don't forget to see the mid-credit and post credit scenes.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
613,Simarium,Spider-Man: Far from Home,7,25 July 2019,"Not bad at all. So the plot is pretty meh with it basically being Peter Parker screwing things up, but the execution was done decently. So meh plot, but good acting overall, funny humor (especially with the frantic and overenthusiastic chaperone teachers), and fantastic special effects.

614,eden-rabatsch,Incredibly charming but equally forgettable,7,1 July 2019,"This film has quite the poisoned chalice - it is the last film in Phase 3 of the MCU so it has to put a capstone on the post-Avengers world and simultaneously set itself up for perhaps a smaller life back home in Queens. Oh and to rub it in, the last Spiderman film I saw was Spiderverse which was arguably the best pop culture film of 2018.Watts threads the needle almost - the first third which is just a teen road comedy is ridiculously charming...in fact, if anything the superhero plot which is utterly conventional gets in the way of the much more enjoyable film.The cast are great, as usual, and Jake Gyllenhall is excellent as Mysterio. They really needed an actor who could play a few angles and Gyllenhall delivers in spades.Totally enjoyable and totally forgettable...bring on Phase 4",Spider-Man - Far from Home

But Parker's vacation gets hi jacked by Nick Fury and Maria Hill and he tells Peter to help them to fight against the Elementals and along side Peter is Mysterio who is from an alternate universe.Far From Home is the Spider-Man sequel I enjoyed the most, all the cast did a good job of performance, especially from Jack Gyllenhaal playing the obvious villain and I also enjoyed seeing Peter journey his path from teenage superhero to Tony's new successor; the action is great (my favorite was Mysterio doing the Illusion on Spider-Man), the effects were great, good humor and it was well placing.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

626,benjamincallinicos,A wonderful sequel to Homecoming with really good performances.,9,31 December 2019,"Homecoming was a fresh and wonderful way to kick off this new series of Spider-Man movies for the MCU but Far From Home is really inventive, incredibly funny and with wonderful charm from each actor involved. Many fans of Spider-Man might disagree but I really like this movie.Tom Holland once again gives a wonderful performance as Spidey and we really see the inner struggles that comes from the events of Endgame in which his mentor Tony Stark was unfortunately killed. Tom plays those emotional moments so well and those scenes really show how talented of an actor he really is.But the one who really steals the show here is Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio and Marvel's new take on the character is actually really well done. He's more realistic and funny in places, he's very deceitful and also on top of that, he's a really troubled human being with inner vengeance against Stark Industries which really mirrors the Vulture's motivation in Homecoming.Zendaya is really cool as M.J who actually gets a bit more to do here than in previous movies and I really envy Tom Holland in actually getting to have romantic scenes with this stunning young girl. They play off each other so well which leads me to believe that they actually very good friends in real life. I know this version of M.J is nothing like how she's supposed to be and people don't really like it. But I don't mind her... fight me.Also let's talk about that ending... everything seems to be going fine and then suddenly Peter's secret identity is revealed to the world and we also get the return of J.K Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson from those Sam Raimi movies and oh my god, it's like he's never been away, he IS Jameson to me, he always has been so I am so glad they brought him back rather than cast somebody else and I am really excited to see how Holland's third Spider-Man movie will play out. The future looks very bright for Spider-Man in more ways than one!",Spider-Man - Far from Home

629,ljsmith-25626,Effective Phase 3 Epilogue,8,15 June 2020,"Spider-Man: Far from Home holds the unfortunate title of being the only film I've ever fallen asleep to while watching in the cinema. Having now rewatched Marvel's latest blockbuster I can firmly say that episode of snoring in Cineworld was induced by a lack of sleep the night before, and not the content on display.Tom Holland gives his best performance as Spider-Man yet. In other reboots it is often easy to forget (or even hard to believe) that Peter Parker is only a school aged kid, but Holland plays the role so convincingly. The viewer feels a lot of sympathy for Peter throughout Far from Home as he struggles with the burden of being expected to fill Iron Man's shoes, all the while proving to be more relatable than ever as he endeavours to enjoy his school trip and win over the girl he likes. Speaking of which, Zendaya's inclusion in Homecoming finally makes sense now - I should've known the writers would have more use for her character in later instalments.Jake Gyllenhaal also plays his role applaudably well, his character as unlikable as ever. Despite Peter's frequent references to pop culture throughout the series he clearly hasn't seen Nightcrawler, or else his tingle might've warned him against trusting the cunning Mysterio.I love how these Spider-Man films examine the effects of the Avengers on the microcosmic environment of Peter's high school, where they study Thor in physics. This dynamic was especially effective in highlighting the complications of the blip and how humanity has dealt with the outcome of Endgame. Therefore Spider-Man: Far from Home serves as an effective epilogue to Phase 3 of the MCU, and I am grateful that Disney and Sony have worked out their differences to ensure we get to see what becomes of Spider-Man after that jaw dropping post credits cliffhanger. Whenever the next instalment may hit cinemas, I'm certain that this time round I'll manage to stay awake.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
630,mike_moor,Bland characters. Boring. Disappointing.,1,20 September 2019,"Big budget movies like this one, insisting on stuffing politically correct garbage down your throat is just lame. I'm pretty sick of it and for that I award this movie with a solid 1 out of 10. Why not just go out and entertain your audience for once? Isn't movies made for the sole purpose of entertaining people?The characters had zero chemistry and I found them downright boring and uninteresting. The jokes where creepy at times and bearable at best.The story was very predictable and that is perhaps it's biggest weakness. A good story is gripping and you're always wondering what is about to happen next. All I was wondering about was when it will end so that I can leave and go on with my own life.The special effects were great. Interesting to look at and I'm sure they put in huge effort. It was quite entertaining to look at... But eye candy does zero to engage you like a good movie would.All in all a big disappointment. I was really hoping it would be a great movie and I had high hopes for it. The high rating it had made me look forward to seeing it but unfortunately there was no shortage of disappointment.It's great to go and see big budget special effect movies but not so great when the only thing that is interesting is the special effects. :(",Spider-Man - Far from Home
631,faisalisat,Spider-Man goes on school euro trip!,8,6 August 2019,"The title sums it up really. I'm a big fan of Tom Holland as Spider-Man, he genuinely looks like a kid so that helps. The film picks up from the events after Endgame. Fun to watch and enjoyable though I felt afterwards that some things were plain silly/plot holey. The initial pre scrolling credits scene ends with a ""whaaaaat"" but there's also another one at the end of the actual credits which I guess sets the scene for the next phase of the MCU.

632,hjemmefra,DisneyPravda,2,16 July 2019,"It started promising enough when Disney first bought Marvel, releasing well-made entertaining movies such as Ironman, the Capt. America trilogy and Guardians of The Galaxy. But then as the franchise progressed the identity-politics and dumbing down started oozing over unsuspecting viewers with the, let's say ""race-concious"" Black Panther and later the, let's call it ""gender-aware"" Captain Marvel. Now it seems, the machiavellian strategy is to target younger viewers with their propaganda, with infantile tripe like Shazam and this latest Spiderman. Disney does the same with other properties devoured, like Star Wars, where everything is digested and expelled forcefully at you, as septic DisneyPravda.

The chemistry between Peter, Happy and the rest of the cast is superb. There're explanations from ""Endgame"" which are interesting.Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio is pure gold. Another A-list actor which represent famous comics villain and he did it great.The story got layers and build up to the character of Peter and how he carries the legacy of Iron Man and so much more.The jokes between Peter and his friends are fine, but some are too childish even for Spidey movie. There a plenty of emotional moments as you can expect after the events of ""Endgame"".Michael Giacchino did a great job with the score again. The music fits perfectly in the context of the scenes you watch. Classic Spidey vibes.The action is on the same level if not better compared to ""Homecoming"" (expected), particularly the second half of the movie.After the end of the movie, you'll want to see what's going to happen next in the MCU.There're 2 credit scenes and they are interesting especially one of them...just mind-blowing!

636,dircpitt,Help!,5,21 November 2019,"It seems to me that all Marvel films lately suffer from the same problem, they start to be inflated. The fact is that a mechanism at the box office has been triggered so that if a new chapter does not come out every year, clearly a collection opportunity is lost but expectations are also reduced, there is no longer a taste for waiting, everything is diluted and consumed like a burger. In addition, the characters have lost their autonomy and their character, as they increasingly have to bend to the strategies of a world (Marvel) that is increasingly interconnected, where everyone is a protagonist and for this reason is actually an extras. You can see it well in Avengers (become a terrible minestrone) and also in this last episode of Spider-man where our superhero actually lives in the shadow of Stark. Of the figure of Fury then, which appears everywhere, we would gladly do without, since the times of Ezekiel (25, 17) are long gone and SLJ is now too unpublished to care anyone. I also understand that the product is aimed at young people and therefore, as a matter of identification, Spider-man must be very young, but in a little while he will become the elementary superhero. To make a comparison, between Avengers and Spider-man I prefer the latter but, despite being a great fan of the genre, I really start to struggle to look at these lousy consumerism meatloafs.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

But Peter here just wants a date , no matter what happens to the world.
And the Fact that Peter here has been spiderman even long before Capital America - Civil war , we should be watching a totally matured spiderman instead we watches a boring teenage athletic kid who just don't wanna be Spider-Man.

The entire premise of the film is based on Mysterio and the monsters he fights being projections that are backed up by drones.Yeah, scratch that, unless they have a giant water drone that can punch and drench Peter Parker on a bridge whilst smashing the bricks around him. In order to make a twist believable, they completely undermined the premise of the twist.I mean, you have to overlook that the projections can cancel out sunlight. Wait, what? That's not how projections work! However to get Spiderman into a world in which he can't trust his own shadow, that's how it is done.Also the idiotic behaviour of the teachers and classmates was unappealing.

645,jadongarcia,*Spoilers*,8,8 July 2019,"Even in Tony's death he is still leaving enemies behind.Mysterio aka Quentin Beck as he prefers to be called, portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal who at first seemed like a weird casting choice but at the same time Mysterio(at least I thought) never showed his face so it didn't really matter much, just the fact that Gyllenhaal of all actors was gonna play a villain in a marvel film, seemed a bit different or out of place if you will.Every callback to a previous MCU film such as Ironman and Civil War, was so intriguing. Just another reminder that Kevin Fiege and every one else at Marvel Studios, knows how to keep the storyline and continuity intact and the fact that they keep referencing it and calling back to their previous films that started it all really shows how far they've come in producing these films.Now, this film hits really hard, those that have seen it, know what I'm talking about, that scene where Mysterio is fighting Peter with all of his illusions and he gets really emotional, he really digs into Peters' consciousness and picks at his insecurities as Spider-Man, now in that very scene I realized this wasn't just some nice light-hearted film to fill the void that Endgame left inside of me as a comic book film fan, it needed that darkness and reality that Disney probably wouldn't allow if it was their actual film.To elaborate on my title, I think it's a cheap gimmick to leave villain's in I guess you can say Tony's inheritance, even after his death, I mean are you serious? Mysterio and Adrian Toomes were practically created by Stark's image and status in the money business?

646,mtrburrows,Mid-tier marvel,5,20 July 2019,"While Tom Holland is still the perfect spider-man, clearly possessing all the energy, charisma, and passion possible for this character, the same going for Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio, and Sam Jackson as Nick Fury, the confused screenplay, and uninspired screenplay wastes these incredible talents and performances.Spiderman: Far From Home is a mid-tier marvel film in the same vain as Ant-Man, in that it's fun and provides some entertaining elements, but lacks any real spark, memorability, or punch. The performances are by far the most entertaining elements, and the comedy is on top form, just like in Homecoming, but the action is uninventive, as is most of the direction, as a majority of the film consists of shot/reverse shot conversations, the special effects have taken a downgrade, especially in the sequence with Peter swinging around without his suit, and the villain and story are especially flimsy, rushed, and not given much thought to.As soon as Mysterio's plot was revealed, I was ready to see one of the best MCU villains yet, but Gyllenhaal is given nothing to work with as the character is given no motivations to accompany his charisma, resulting in a character that is much less interesting than the trailers suggested. We all knew he'd turn out to be the bad guy, but I never thought it'd be as underwhelming as this.The film also has a confused message, and journey for our main character. Beats are established and dropped until they're convenient (such as the ""Peter tingle"") so that they aren't fully fleshed out and satisfying, and the film can't seem to decide whether Peter should follow in Tony's footsteps or not.In conclusion, there have been much more confused and jumbled spiderman films, but this definitely isn't one of the best, and also not one of the best MCU films, despite having one of the most likeable protagonists the franchise offers.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

660,glstrom-14260,Really special,10,22 July 2019,"It took me some time to get excited for this for some reason, probably still digesting Endgame and its' aftermath. This was a perfect followup movie, clever, smart, quick witted, and mind blowing special effects like you're on a rollercoaster (must be something in 3D). Tom and his classmates are truly believable, the scene on the plane laugh out loud funny and touching moments between Happy and his new protege (EDITH...Even Dead I'm Still The Hero = brilliant tribute to Tony Ironman). I do like how they use teen romance and angst as a catalyst but do not over play it or make it the focus of the story, even downplaying it in the end in a totally unrealistic but refreshing way as one couple happily goes their separate ways) I did catch on to Mysterio's act as the world threat was resolved with half the movie left to go, but the CG and return of JJ at the end set us up for what should be an amazing sequel. Looking forward to it and hope the rest of the MCU and DCU can learn some lessons here.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

663,forpassord,As expected unfortunately...,4,20 October 2019,"Watched ""Spider Man Homecoming"" in the cinema and was VERY disappointed in how childish it was. In that sense, this movie is no better unfortunately. Technically it was amazing, the effects was great except for a moment where I thought that a part of a scene looked false. But the rest of the movie was technically great. But the slapstick humor, the childish comments and dialogues, the stupid sequences during the closing credits and so on was a real letdown.If you too associate Spider Man with the cartoons and live action movies from the previous decades with Peter Parker as an adult, and not as an insecure teenager, then you too will probably dislike this movie and the previous one as well. To me, the devolution from Peter Parker as an adult and student at a university back to his teens is just caused by the film studios greed and wish to get a greater audience regardless of the last decades of evolution.I have always loved when a character from another series/movie have appeared in another series/movie. But now the superhero universe and it stories are so entangled with itself, that if you as I am are no movie-going-fanatic you are guaranteed to either not understand references or/and see/hear spoilers from previous movies when watching a more recent movie because of the entanglement!So this movie, and the previous might be fine for newcomers to the Spider Man universe.

665,abasu0819,A colorful trip to the neighborhood.,9,4 July 2019,"Embarking on a school-trip 'far from home' to Europe, Peter Parker finds himself in middle of all kinds of unwanted troubles he could only dream of being merely 'Your Friendly Neighborhood.' However, as light as it may sound, let me be clear that it wasn't by any means. The grief, or the aftermath, of 'Infinity-Saga' was very much clear from the beginning. But at the same time, the story was wittily written and focused mostly on 'Spider-Man' as it should be while being limpid in answering out many mysteries 'Avengers: Endgame' left behind. And that's exactly why I had my doubts before watching 'Spider-Man: Far From Home.'""Will it be something like a spin-off to Avengers: Endgame?""
""Is it gonna be Iron Man 3.2?""
And many more.Therefore, I was definitely all up for seeking my answers & if I'm being honest here, I wasn't disappointed for even a bit. It was neither an 'Iron Man 3.2', nor an 'Avengers: Endgame' spin-off. But it surely was a brilliant follow-through with essence of an Iron Man theme, which was kind of obvious to begin with. For tall these, a lot of credits should go to Jon Watts for directing such an amazing and 'practical' story written by Chris McKenna & Erik Sommers.How 'Mysterio,' portrayed magnificently by Jake Gyllenhaal, drove the story all along with his cleverness and whammy intentions was probably the biggest plus point of the film. While it made the 2 hour long plot (with numerous easter eggs) far more interesting, it also allowed every single characters to shine on their own. The not so huge cast was spot on in terms of delivering the performances. The chemistry between them was even better. The short relationship of 'Betty & Ned' was, for me, the funniest point of the film! However, Tom Holland also delivered his career best performance as 'Spider-Man' as well as 'Peter Parker.' Without such brilliant performance, I don't think it'd have been possible to showcase the self-redemption while seeking answers to his own questions and the burden our 'Friendly Neighborhood' carries now that 'Tony Stark' is unfortunately gone. But at the same time, his growing maturity, humor and shy romanticism were spot on & his unique kind of dialogue-delivery made the character of 'Peter Parker' beyond just vibrant or colorful to experience.But apart from all those & on a technical note; editing and cinematography were definitely spot-on. While the cinematography captured the essence of Europe so beautifully, the intelligent editing allowed only the needed portions to not glorify the beauty of Europe to an extent where 'Spider-Man' feels like a secondary subject. But the film's second biggest point sure was its magnificent CGI & VFX. VFX of Mysterio's illusions, numerous action scenes & many more were a treat to the eyes, coupled with some brilliant sound effects. At times, the VFX was at 'Avatar,' 'Guardians Of The Galaxy - vol.2' or 'Avengers: Endgame' level & I am not even kidding. Though, the soundtrack or the themes by Michael Giancchino weren't as good as 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' & that's acceptable considering the amount of pluses and surprises this little extravaganza has to offer!Overall, a rollercoaster ride of self-redemption, humour, adventure, action & all, 'Spider-Man: Far From Home' is nothing short of a Marvel-ous masterpiece & can easily enlighten your boring summer days with a bang. Though while watching, keep in mind to not leave the theatre right until its very end for some even bigger surprises that'll absolutely make you go crazy!",Spider-Man - Far from Home

The European vacation is fun, if quickly sidelined. The central theme of Peter trusting his special abilities is a great symbol for learning to be himself, not living up to Tony's memory. But the role Stark-Tech ends up playing, and how Peter uses it, points in the opposite direction. Had the gadgets failed, leaving him with only his innate abilities, it might've been even stronger.

677,JC_Ride,A pleasant surprise!,8,7 November 2019,"This movie was better than i expected! It didn't shatter my expectations or anything, after all i was a fan of Homecoming. But it was much better than i expected!
First of all acting is great. Nothing oscar worthy but preety good nonetheless. Especially Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal both did a great job.
Directing and scenaries were great and i love the idea of Spidey visiting various European countries for a change! Also the hallucinations scene is one of the best in the MCU, period.
As far as plot is concerned its preety good for a superheroe movie! Granted the twist is extremely obvious but the ending sure was unexpected and i certainly did not expect the after credit scene! However, i get that Peter is naive and all but his decision to give Mysterio the glasses was beyond stupid. But other than that it's a preety fun story.
The action is also a huge step up from Homecoming. I liked Homecoming, but the action was preety supbar. Here that's definitely not the case. Spider-Man is much more fun to watch fight, much more experienced, the set pieces are better and more diverse and the final battle is preety nice. Glad it's not another *good guy vs bad guy who both have the exact same powers*.
As far as humour is concerned i think they did a great job! It's not amazing but most jokes land preety well.
Character wise, i really don't mind Michelle and i think her interaction with Peter are preety cute. Spider-Man is great (apart from when he's a bit too stupid) and I'm glad we got to see him more experienced and less tech dependent . Side characters such as Ned and Nick Furry are fun and thankfully not overused, and Mysterio is a great villain! His motivations admittedly are lacking a bit (not bad or too unrealistic/dumb just not strong enough to drive him to do such things), but still they got his manipulative character and the way he goes about his schemes down almost perfectly! Loved the suits as well!All in all a very good/fun movie with few flaws! A very pleasant surprise that makes me want to see more of that Spider-Man! My humble opinion is it's just as good as Spider-Man 2 (for different reasons but still). 8/10 from me",Spider-Man - Far from Home

The nostalgia here could of been played up, that was an opportunity clearly missed, that action became the focal point of the resolution of the final act in the movie.The jokes didn't land and the script reads like it was written for tweens when the largest portion of the fanbase is now 30s to 40sIn Marvel fashion we are given a new unresolved setup in the end credits for a glimpse of the next episode in the franchise series.

692,kevinthecritic,Spider-Man: Far From Home: Flawed but Ambitious Sequel Swings High,7,8 July 2019,"4 out of 5 stars for Spidey fans, 3 out of 5 for nonfans.Spider-Man: Far From Home is one of the most bizarre superhero movies I've ever seen. The action is bigger, the plot is zanier, but it lacks the heart and subtlety of its predecessor. While the first half suffers from pacing issues, huge logic gaps, and hit-or-miss running jokes, Spider-Man: Far From Home swings to a wacky finale and allows Tom Holland to redefine the character for a new generation.
The world is readjusting to normalcy following Avengers: Endgame. Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tom Holland) wants to take a break from heroics and woo his crush MJ (A snarky Zendaya) on their class trip to Europe. Unfortunately, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) forces him to work with the mystical Quentin Beck (a fun Jake Gyllenhaal) to defeat giant monsters. Now Peter must balance his desires with his responsibilities, made harder when a new threat emerges seeking world domination.
Spider-Man: Far From Home fixes some mistakes of its predecessor (which I enjoyed more on a second viewing). The action is visually dazzling, the humor better integrated, and Tom Holland would be the definitive Spidey were it not for Tobey Maguire's iconic portrayal, effortlessly balancing Peter's optimism and frustration.
The first hour of Spider-Man: Far From Home is a repetitive mix of teen angst and blasé fights with easily fixable plot holes (why are they going on this trip, what's their itinerary, and why do they have the world's dumbest teacher as a tour guide?) While fun, Gyllenhaal's character is underwritten and the actor struggles to fully disappear into his role. The 2nd half thankfully provides stronger momentum, a classic action scene, and better comedy. Spider-Man Far From Home may entertain Spidey-fans more than general audiences, but those seeking a fun, trippy superhero flick will have their spidey senses tingled. Swing to your nearest theater and See Spider-Man: Far From Home.
Rated PG-13 for Sci-Fi Action Violence, Some Language, and Brief Suggestive Comments. There are 2 mid-credit scenes.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
693,isaacj02,Popcorn thrills galore in this frenetic and fun Spiderman adventure,7,2 July 2019,"In the wake of the bombastic success of Avengers: Endgame, Marvel Studios return here with a smaller yet still lively summer flick starring everyone's favourite neighbourhood superhero. Turns out audiences are not the only ones who need to recover from the furore of recent events in the MCU (not least Thanos' genocidal antics now christened in-universe as 'The Blip'). Spider-Man: Far From Home sees our titular hero take a well-earned rest as he embarks on a school trip to Europe with his friends. He doesn't even pack his trusty suit... it's time for a bit of normality. Of course, events don't quite turn out as expected and Peter is dragged swiftly back into the world-saving game, this time to battle the multidimensional Elementals and other hidden and perhaps even more dangerous enemies.
Much of the creative talent behind 2017's Spider-Man: Homecoming return for this spirited and entertaining sequel that ends up being satisfying both for its character and in its place in the ever-widening MCU. Tom Holland dons the webbed suit yet again as Spider-Man; if he wasn't brilliant before, this time he seems even more comfortable in the role, delivering a charming, vulnerable and seemingly effortless performance. Director Jon Watts also returns proving himself to be a sure hand, his clear vision for the film shining through with distinctive style. There's a notable new addition however in writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers who deliver a smart script, often hilarious and always genuine. Far From Home is certainly a Spider-Man film on a sheer scale we haven't seen before; largely, it's handled quite well, remaining mostly grounded amid globe-trotting and narrative twists and turns. Occasionally, we lose some of the cohesion and it feels a little overstuffed and expository, but honestly this film is so fast-paced and energetic you can't help but enjoy the ride even when everything doesn't quite jell. Equally, there are far too many brilliant aspects to take in; take for instance the seamless action sequences which are neatly interchanged with intimate and believable drama. The temptation with movies of this kind is to fall into mindless action and forget the substance but Far From Home keeps its characters purely at its heart. There's nice references, for example, to Endgame that really inform Peter's arc in the film and provide the film's understated yet decidedly emotional impact. Whilst the overall package might not be as tight as its predecessor, Far From Home makes appropriate attempts to hone in on some characters and narrative vignettes in more detail (for example, Zendaya's MJ is far more fleshed out here and Peter's own sense of identity and responsibility is thoughtfully explored). Again, it's not all plain sailing; Jake Gyllenhaal's Syndrome-esque Mysterio is very hit and miss, his great moments bogged down by some of the lesser writing and obligatorily clunky exposition.
In the end, however, Spider-Man: Far From Home is an impressive film, more than making up for its faults. It's fiercely entertaining, packed full of humour, action thrills and plenty of unexpected twists to keep the audience gripped (speaking of which, stay for two critical post-credits scenes). Equally, there's some fantastic visual effects work that sometimes even echoes of the illusionary sequences in Doctor Strange. Jon Watts and his team deliver a satisfying sequel here full of interesting choices yet still staying true to the style established in Homecoming. Ultimately, regardless of its position in the Marvel canon, Far From Home has all the elements of the perfect summer popcorn movie; action thrills, big laughs, a likeable cast and brilliant visuals really allow it to recover from momentary snags and reach the finish line in splendour. Expertly crafted and with an unabashed sense of fun, Spider-Man: Far From Home is an assured Marvel instalment that hungers for a rewatch.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Well, the answer is 'just like Far From Home'.Unlike 'Homecoming', Far From Home finds that balance that has been missing from Spider-Man movies all the way back to Sam Raimis Spider-Man 2. It perfectly juggles Peters home life, his school life, and his web swinging career, while also growing the character from a jokey, wise cracking teen, into a jokey, wise cracking adult who is ready to take on the responsibility and the enormity of the task left with the departure of Stark.Gyllenhaal as Mysterio is also phenomenal. The way they managed to modernise a character who almost seemed impossible to bring to the big screen was exceptional and the visuals surrounding Mysterio anytime he's on screen are second to none.There are the odd moments that misfire in terms of the humour but these are lost in the comparative sea of triumph.Far From Home is the perfect ending to the third phase of the MCU, and leaves us with a matured Peter Parker, ready to lead this universe forward into a brilliant new era.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
697,joesiegel,the same as always in the MCU,6,3 September 2019,"It is supposed to Endgame was the end of a phase in Marvel so that Far from home opened another with many changes, but it remains the same, the same formula that obviously will never change, jokes without grace, absurd stories. If this is supposed to be an evolution for the MCU, where are the changes? Perhaps they plan to continue following the same formula for another 10 years and make another film that supposedly closes a cycle. That was Endgame, an end to something but an end of what? The ridiculous excuse of being the closing to a saga of 20 movies but is there really a difference now? You yourself may notice that no. What I see here is a door to 10 more years of movies and repetitive series, I do not lie, Marvel confirmed a lot of projects that will arrive in the next few years and invade our ticket offices until who knows when Who could get excited for a movie of these people, When are all the same? Anyway, Far From Home is a ridiculous movie that I can say that the best thing he has is his villain that is not the big thing, this seems like a mediocre film about exaggerated romances of adolescence.

My advise is if you haven't seen the trailer and don't know Mysterio please refrain from it, you will enjoy the movie a lot more.Now coming on the review, this is by far the Best sequel I have seen. We see spidey taking a Europe trip with school to get away from spidey routine and focus more on his love interest but things don't always go as planned. New threats emerges from another dimension that threatens the existence of earth and spidey now has to face that. Who is Mysterio? What's his role? What's next for spidey after Endgame? Is he the new Iron man? That's for you to watch find out and be blown away. The movie has a few surprises and has one mid credit and one end credit scene. The mid credit scene is the final end of the movie and end credit scene reveals a secret. The mid credit scene was the best scene I have ever seen in a marvel movie.Tom Holland has definitely taken Spider-Man to a new level. His sense of humor, facial expression and the fact this reboot takes place in HS days definitely adds to the movie. I was surprise how they continued the story after end game and how the mid credit scene shows what's coming next for Spider-Man.

701,valmont1702,Becoming a greater superhero : A poignant journey.,8,16 July 2019,"I really like the villain's motivations, his psychology and the way his ""powers"" appear (and are used) ; very interesting. Also, the conflicted trajectory of Peter Parker as a teenager and as a superhero, with all the inherent dilemmas & choices... These are strong themes, and it nicely shows the complexity of evolving into a greater superhero. With the questions that required to be asked when you constantly have to be the one who must step up.The core of the movie is all about trust/believe and all the hard choices that come with it ... Who you can trust and what is believable or not (which by the way is what Mysterio is all about). And how to see clear between all the things that happen on your journey... Especially when you often have to take responsibility of things that are much bigger than you.Such a perfect transition from the Marvel Cinematic Universe we all have known, up until Avengers Endgame. There is a lot of elements that have been introduced in this Spider-Man movie. And it definitely is a foundation for future stories to be told. Exactly like Iron Man (the first movie) had been the first stone of all of this.Ah and... Stay until the very very end.
There are two bonus scenes. One that is early, during the credits (and that is directly linked to the movie) ; and one that is at the very end of the credits. Each of these two scenes bring astonishingly huge plot points for the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Both scenes call these recent events into question, moving forward...PS: The movie is very creative. Whether it is for the visuals (in particular when there's Mysterio ""behind"") ..... or story-wise (with very numerous plot twists & turns) ... It never ends !

Just back home from seeing this and I'm conflicted.On the one hand this is a very competently made addition to the MCU but on the other hand it feels like it's confused about what it is trying to be?The heavy hints towards Peter becoming the new Iron Man feel too clunky to feel like a natural progression although one scene later does fit better. I really didn't like the suite at the start of the movie.The worst of it though is that the baddies in the first half of the movie are dull and I felt bored until about half way through after which it becomes better but is still a little dull :( it could be an anti-climax after Endgame though.It is ""fun"" though, but maybe aimed at a younger audience on this occasion...

1) Paid reviewers.
2) Reviewers are all about 15 years old.Badly paced, some very average CGI moments, cringe-worthy dialogue at times.
This movie ""jumps the shark"" too many times.
As one reviewer said, it's best approached as a High School romantic comedy.
John Favreau as Happy is the best thing about this movie, he is great in it.
Marisa Tomei is getting better looking as she gets older but her Aunt May is a huge departure from the original character.
Tom Holland does well, but Toby Maguire's shoes are big ones to fill.
I liked Numan Acar's stereotypical eastern-european assassin character as well.
The big reveal scene in the bar, when Jake Gyllenhaal's character goes into an overly-long, "" for all you dumb people"", explanation of what he's doing is truly cringe-worthy, contrived, and had me squirming in my seat.
I actually liked Zendaya's MJ!Took my 16 yr old and 13 yr old to see it, both big fans of Marvel and even they said it seemed a bit aimed at a young teenage audience.
The mid-credits and post-credits scenes were just lame.
Don't get me wrong, it's worth seeing and has some good moments, but 10/10? Nah, I don't think so.

714,nilsurban-50399,Spider Man: Far From Good,1,15 July 2019,"The two previous spider man movies have been ok. They were nothing special, but decent and enjoyable for teenagers and adults alike. This one here though can probably only be enjoyed by teenagers or adults with very low standards regarding humor and plot.HUMOR: 80% of the movie feel like a cheap teenager sit-com with poorly written or already heavily recycled jokes. And it's not only the jokes that fail. It's how awkwardly and brutally they were pressed into almost every scene in the movie. While the jokes in the Avengers movies feel like they are ""going-with-the-flow"" and have, for the most part, a natural feel to them, the jokes in this movie here feel like they are clumsily set up, poorly executed and pressed into every corner of it for the sake of trying hard to entertain. This issue makes the movie feel like a caricature of itself.PLOT: It's a clumsy, unoriginal teenage-love-story with a bit of action. Most of the movie evolves around this embarrassingly cringe-worthy love-story and thus leaves little time to flesh out characters and/or a decent plot.
The bad guy remains vastly undeveloped and only gets to speak for his motives once in a scene that feels again like a caricature of itself and straight out taken from a cartoon like Dexter's laboratory or the likes.
It is also very hard to believe that Spider Man entrusts him with Tony Stark's super Technology although he just knows him for a an hour at best. Ridiculous. It's also fascinating that such powerful and dangerous technology can so easily be handed over. The strange thing is, that Peter Parker needs to confirm the handover to the AI (Edith) for it to work, but in the end, when he takes the glasses (the AI) back from the bad guy, no account transfer is need....wtf?
The bad guy very much acts like a villain from the 70ies. He doesn't really try to Kill Spider-Man and he never double-checks and he never does it when he has the opportunity....yawn.ACTION: The best part of the movie are the maybe 2 minutes where Spider-Man is trapped in the bad guy's Illusions, which offer creative and interesting situations and confrontations. The rest is action of the ""been-there, done-this"" kind. Whoever thought that drones would be an interesting ""end-fight"" should be teleported back in time.VERDICT: If your sense of humor is on permanent leave and if you like teenage sit-coms with a bit of mediocre action: go for it!1/10",Spider-Man - Far from Home
715,IronManu77,Good but not great,8,10 July 2019,"Too much happening here in the movie making it an incoherent mess that surprisingly works well to give a few funny moments, some great CGI and good chemistry between Peter and MJ.

716,BoshArrow,"Spider-Man: Far from Home - delightful, cute and quite entertaining",10,6 July 2019,"Spider-Man: Far from Home is a movie which I would watch anywhere at any time. It was a relaxing experience, enjoyable comedy with some creative surprises. Tom Holland is not my favourite Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire is the hero from my childhood), but his approach to the role is very successful, he is clearly charming and believable as the web slinger.
Although this is a movie about Spider-Man and his adventures in Europe, the star of this film is once again Tony Stark whose actions and inventions bring the main conflict points of ""Far from Home"". MCU is still really dependent on Iron Man and Mysterio is another proof for that. Mysterio made this movie quite entertaining, his music theme was an extreme pleasure and his role in the film really exceeded my expectations. I would say people will link this Spider-Man movie mostly with the presence of Jake Gyllenhaal in the cast - great actor with huge experience.
The supporting cast delivered many enjoyable moments as well - Zendaya is gorgeus as MJ, her character is intelligent and fits perfectly in the plot. Another star is Jacob Batalon as Ned Leeds - a character who is a treasure for both Spider-Man movies, it is impossible to not enjoy his scenes in the movie.
To sum up, ""Far from Home"" is one of the best sequels ever made, every character was valuable and I enjoyed every second a lot. Go and watch it, Marvel delivered again!",Spider-Man - Far from Home

726,MarkassBrownie,One of the better Marvel movies.,7,28 June 2019,"Amazing visuals, thrilling action scenes, engaging story-telling, superb casting.....These are the making of a summer blockbuster.""Spider-Man:Far from Home"" is a perfect combination of comedy, action, and romance, with all the right ingredients and none of the genre tropes.Surprisingly enough, the centerpiece of this film is not the superhero's extraordinary world-saving, but the budding romance between the very ordinary human characters. It might be more accurate to describe this film as a genre fusion of romcom and action-comedy under the disguise of a superhero movie, since the scale of the ""world-saving"" and the stakes for the final showdown are very much limited compared to what just happened in Endgame.What impressed me the most is Zendaya's performance as MJ, which finally breaks the stereotype of superhero's love interest. Instead of your typical dumbed-down background eye-candy, Zendaya's MJ is intelligent, quirky, interesting, and absolutely lovable.Tom Holland is, at this point, Spider-Man's alter ego. I cannot imagine Spider-Man being anyone else other than him. As usual, Marvel simply could not have a more perfect casting than Tom Holland.The story-telling is engaging enough to keep audiences on the edge of their seats, with one particular dream-like action sequence standing out as the mind-blowing moment in this movie. The plot-twist and the reveal in the third act are typical of what Hollyhood writers have done countless times before and should not be unexpected by an experienced cinema-goer.The minor flaws of this movie reside within the potential plot holes incurred by the plot twist in the third act. Expositions provided by the film's narrative might not be sufficient enough to warrant the suspension of disbelief for some viewers.Overall this would be one fantastical popcorn entertainment movie for viewers of all tastes, but do not expect it to be great enough to be comparable to the likes of the LOTR trilogy.Highly recommend everyone to view this film in IMAX.

Any Spider-Man fan would know from the start that Mysterio would be a villain, but they executed it so terribly. The drones were a stupid idea. EDITH was a stupid idea. I didn't care about Peter and MJ. A lot of the jokes were not funny, the ""Peter-Tingle"" thing was overplayed.

734,trildog99,"Great Villain, Flat Jokes",8,3 July 2019,"Despite my heavy skepticism due to the trailers and the nature of Mysterio's character, I was very satisfied with Far From Home.The movie begins with a brief explanation of how the world has handled the events of Infinity War/End Game. The explanation was brief, mildly entertaining, but sufficient.In the meantime, Peter is trying to figure out his role as a superhero, while trying to live his life as a teenager/young adult. This is the main theme/struggle of the film, and it's handled very well. When his class schedules a trip to Europe, Peter plans profess his interest in ""MJ"". Without giving away any spoilers, I'm sure anybody can surmise how ""smoothly"" his plan goes.During the field trip, typical comic book disaster happens -- enter Mysterio. Peter is fascinated with this power being, and the rest of the movie takes off from there.Without wanting to divulge any spoilers, I'll just say Mysterio is easily one of the best depicted protagonists in the MCU, and is the only big screen Spider-Man villain that can compete with Dr. Octopus.The bigness weakness of the movie is it's humor. The jokes are often flat and too obvious to be funny. The style of humor reminds me of Ant-Man, but a notch better.

I'm not gonna drop a 1/10 on this, it's not BAD or awful as some DC movies, but it's probably one of the worse MCU movies easily..Sure I had high hopes for this after endgame but it's just a teenager eurotrip movie, I cringed so hard all movie long, if it wasn't for my gf I would have honestly stopped and do something else
some scenes are really nice, but then again Dr Strange was actually more impressive with VFX and it came years ago..
All that teenager thing really ruined my experience for me, the story was paper thin, just stretched behind a wall of ""shocking reveal"" (gosh that reveal scene was terrible, lazy writing at its best)There are tons of loophole in that movie starting with the elemental that just DON'T work, at NO point do they explain in the movie how they make them work! drones just shoot shockwaves, flames and bullets but they do not produce heat like the fire golem would nor throw millions of liters of water around town and so on
I know it's a super hero movie, not interstellar or the martian, but still make it at least plausible not straight down sillyThere are some redeeming factors, and I'm mostly talking about the post credit scene which makes you actually want to see what's coming in the next movie, or Jake's acting that was great (though a bit too much at the beginning), but as for ""far from home"" it's probably one that I'll never rewatch ever again.. it serves no purpose, it's random, it's executed poorly, might as well not exist it wouldn't change a thing for the MCU (except if the whole point of this movie was to give away peter's ID.. or they might just dismiss that within the first few minutes of the next movie, then in that case just forget all about this movie for real)Bottom line: as disappointing as it could get.. and MORE!",Spider-Man - Far from Home

739,loncarkristina,Endgame can kneel before Far From Home.,10,16 July 2019,"After the disaster Endgame was (in my opinion), I went into the theatre expecting absolutely nothing from this movie. I was ready to witness another example of a tangled storyline, character arc mess and ever-apparent fanservice, but I came to realize this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Watch and learn, Russos!The storyline is pretty simple and straightforward: Spidey travels to Europe and our villain, a cunning ex-Stark employee and visionary Mysterio, uses his wits to make Spidey give him ""Edith"" to try and make himself a hero in the eyes of the people using holographic projections. However, Mysterio is not the only problem Spidey has to tackle, but also his growing relationship with MJ and the whole entirety of the school trip.This movie's villain, Mysterio, is simply stunning. You know that he is such a well done villain when it takes half a movie and an unfortunate event to reveal his intentions and identity. Even though the snap offered a wide variety of possibilities to bring a villain from another dimension, I am extremely glad that the director decided not to do it. To have brilliant ex-Stark employees round up and take Tony's place in the Avengers is an idea as original as it can be. And Jake Gyllenhaal simply nailed the role.No other Spiderman movie had me feeling simpathy for Peter Parker like this one had. Peter is so confused and entangled in school, relationships, his hero role and in being the heir of Iron Man that it's simply astounding how the director managed to balance all the four sides of him without confusing the viewers. The absence of Tony Stark is clearly felt in the post-snap world, and all the burden of his legacy fell down to a boy who has to answer the big life questions while being only 16 years old. From crying to making big, world-threatening mistakes and getting beaten to the ground, Peter suffers a lot of trauma and yet manages to rise again and use nothing but his wits and instincts to beat the enemy. And that is, ladies and gentlemen, a true hero, and a great plot.The dynamic between the two is remarkable. I had previously known that Mysterio is the villain, but up until the end of the first half of the movie I was questioning whether he is actually the good guy. Never have I seen a villain that can beat Spiderman so easily and that is yet so realistic. It took all of Peter's power to beat him; and even when Peter thought he did, Mysterio outsmarts him once again. And I won't even start with the dream sequence... I could talk all day about that.The side plots regarding the school trip are a great comedic relief and the romance between Peter and MJ isn't forced at all. I can say I was relieved to feel no cringe in their interactions, and I was rather surprised that the writers decided to adjust MJ's character to what would appeal to younger audiences. It worked.To sum up, this movie is all about illusion, and despite that fact, you won't exit the screening feeling fooled. It's quite the contrary; I believe this movie is one of the most original ones Marvel has ever produced. You don't have to know Spiderman at all to be able to follow the story, so just sit back, relax and enjoy these two hours of absolute perfection.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

The special effects could have been better. Attention to details was missing. A busy place like Prague, gets literally empty in a fight sequence where only two of the side characters get stuck in a merry go round.Overall it's a entertaining movie, but if you want to analyse it scene by scene then it's not your movie.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
743,pratham048,Best Spiderman Movie to Enjoy,8,5 July 2019,"Spiderman far from home is another thrill ride by Marvel after the Endgame. The movie is very engaging and holds u till the end.So far ,this is one of my favourite spiderman movie now becoz, this installment fixes most of the flaws that we had with previous installment such as better storyline , charcater development etc.The story of the movie is also great with many twist and turns but at certain points it becomes predictable but still never fails to amaze u. Throughout the film we also see spiderman's love and afffection to his loved ones. But in this film the Ned and Peter parker doesn't hangout that much like in previous one. Throughout the film we also see so many refrences to our beloved IRON MAN and a short cameo of him which also plays some role in the movie for the mysterio.The screenplay of the movie is amazing, filled with lots of humor, it is also the comedy type film that u will enjoy a lot.The villan Mysterio was also cool & interesting character. In this installment they also pushed the boundries of the action sequences for the spiderman which r mindblowing.The VFX, CGI and other effects are super on point and very refreshing to watch.
In the movie there is also a action sequence where u can see doctor strange movie like effects that part is my personal favourite.Overall i could say ""Spiderman Far From Home"" is another SUPERHIT BLOCKBUSTER movie from marvel that is both entertaining & spectacular to watch.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

745,jimmyllewellyn,Disappointing,6,8 July 2019,"The links to Iron Man / Endgame were good. As was the reintroduction of the Skrulls. Liked the tone of the movie and the continuation of the theme of SM being torn between his regular life and saving the world. The set up to the next SM movie, with the Parker expose, was also good.
The problem was the core plot. The initial plot with multiverse and elementals was good. The real plot with drones and so called illusion tech was really boring. The movie built up to SM flighting a bunch of flying projectors. Really deflating.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

The CG was great, and you can say the same with almost all Marvel movies.A real average entertainer, watch it, only you have time to spare!",Spider-Man - Far from Home
750,The_Man_XX7,An OKAY Spider-Man movie is not good enough anymore,6,25 July 2019,"This was a complicated review for me to make not because this movie was complex or anything but simply that I expected more from a Spider-man movie matter of fact a Marvel more. At this stage an okay Spider-Man isn't good enough.Better I go on a mini rant I can say that Tom Holland does a good job as Spider-Man, the dude is just good at the role. He was the best part of the movie, he nailed the funny parts, awkward teen moments and emotional moments(i'll get into that more later). Another intriguing performance came from Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio, I have always wanted Jake in a Superhero movie and he gives a good performance although there is some corny dialouge he says but that was because of the script not THE MAN - Jake Gyllenhaal. His character had more interesting things to do but thats sort of spoiler territory also the scenes between him and Tom were good. The other cast members were either okay or forgettable. Jon Fanvrou as Happy was fine though he had one amazing scene with Tom Holland. Marisa Tomie was meh she doesn't give a bad performance or anything but so far she's been one forgettable Aunt May in the MCU. Zendeya,Jacob as Ned, Samuel L Jackson were fine. The other high school kids were completely forgettable.The romance arc between Spider-man and MJ was cute(I guess) it was nothing special but they did the whole teen romance thing well enough. The action was actually good and better than Homecoming, there were some cool memorable action sequences in Far from Home and without spoiling anything, what they did with Spider-sense was dope. One major shoutout to Mysterio though. Far from Home had one great,trippy scene it was awesome and weirder than anything in Doctor Strange, Marvel really went to town with the whole Magician thing. The visual effects were very good and my favorite scene of the movie involved an emotional and heart warming scene between Spider-Man and Happy and I wish the movie could have had more scenes like this. There was also one tiny thought provoking scene near the end that I didn't expect from the movie. Oh and the credit scenes were fire.Now there villain in this movie was corny and predictable, there's no other way to put it I say the twist from a mile away. I mean the reasoning behind the villain's story was weak but I have to say the consequences from the villain's actions were jaw-dropping (mid-credit scene has the juice) but other than that the villain was average the only saving graces were the consequences of the villain and a couple of interiguing scenes between him/her and Spider-Man and how Spider-Man was challenged by him/her.Now for all the stuff that bothered me. First off the humor, I am getting tired of Marvel humor man I mean there were some funny scenes in Far from Home but for the most part the humor attempts from Marvel was exhausting and forced . I mean not every scene has to be funny Marvel it felt there were no serious stages at times. The first half of the movie also took kinda long to get going as well and kinda dragged on. Also at times this movie was way too focused on Iron Man I mean I get that Tony Stark is a mentor to Peter Parker but it sometimes distracted from Spider-Man's story. The movie also couldn't focus on its mainline story there was the whole IronMan x Spider-Man storyline, then Peter struggling with being a regular teenager and a Superhero then the whole comedy vacation stuff x Teen Romance. I get that a movie can have multiple layers and arcs and still be an amazing movie but Far from Home could balance the storylines they presented to us. I mean yes I enjoyed Peter's struggle with wanting a normal life and being Spider-Man and how he deals with the IronMan situation while also being treated with some high school comedy but I never felt that Far From Home fully committed to any of those storylines leaving us with an okay story for a Spider-Man movie and again at this stage an OKAY Spider-Man, Marvel movie isn't good enoughI almost disliked Far From Home but when I looked back this movie was just fine, it had good performances from Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal, some dope action sequences and amazing visual effects, some funny scenes and some interesting story elements and the emotional scene between Peter and Happy makes Far From Home a fun pop-corn flick but the overall subpar story, average villain, cringey and corny scenes, unfunny and forced humor and some forgettable cast members brings the movie down a lot leaving us with an above average Spider-Man movie.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

At the beginning I was a bit skeptical when it came to the actor Tom Holland, but now I've also let this Spider-Man into my heart. Also worth mentioning are Zendaya and Jake Gyllenhaal with more screen time. Action sequences are awesome and the movie entertains you very well, which you know from Marvel Studios.To come to the conclusion I would like to say this movie thrilled me and increased my love for this superhero even more.

The whole movie felt like dumb decision after dumb decison. Especially when Peter accidently sicked the drone on the bus, and when he gave up the glasses. He is appranetly in love with MJ even though they barely talked to each other in the first movie. What ever just go with it. They coppied the first movie and had the villian be a suprise villian. He ripped off Syndrome's plan from the Incredibles. He felt under apprecated so he made his own villians so he could pretend to fight them and be a hero. It was frustrating to see Nick Furry get angry at Spiderman from runing away from his responsibilities.

I like how Aunt May and MJ discover Peter's identity early on instead of dragging it out into a predictable drama. I loved the Sam Raimi films, but that sort of storytelling won't cut it today, we've been there and done that.It was a generic marvel film, but a few underlying characteristics above pushes this a rating higher.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
764,MovieTim14,Turns out you CAN take the Spider out of the city!,8,2 July 2019,"Wow! ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" far exceeded my expectations, in part because it exceeded ""Spider-Man: Homecoming."" Admittedly, I had some difficulty getting on board with that movie, mainly because it felt as if it lacked the weight of consequences, which is a very non-traditional approach for the Spider-Man character. ""Far From Home"" is a sequel that changes this, managing to up the stakes in every way, and delivering a classic Spidey story in the process.After the events of ""Avengers: Endgame,"" Peter Parker is left dealing with the loss of his mentor, Tony Stark, and trying to figure it out on his own in a radically changed world. He's ready to temporarily put all of that side, however, and just enjoy his school trip to Europe. Of course, things don't work out in his favor, as trouble manages to find him even across the pond.I found that both the physical and metaphorical idea of being ""far from home"" did wonders for Peter's character and for the story. Where he feels trapped in the shadow of Iron Man in his first solo outing, here Peter actively wrestles with that legacy, and the end result is that it feels like he comes into his own as a man and as a hero. The movie overall is about as thematically deep as your typical MCU outing - which is to say, not very - but the character work is really solid, and a marked improvement over the first film.The other clear improvement in this sequel are the action sequences. Jon Watts has clearly gained more confidence in his abilities since ""Homecoming."" The action sequences are frenetic, and they somehow manage to be simultaneously very busy but also easy to follow. In addition, the nature of the abilities of newcomer Quentin Beck (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) leads to some real visual spectacle that was a treat to watch.In addition to those improvements, every other aspect that worked about ""Homecoming"" is amplified. The entire cast has great chemistry together. They create a very fun atmosphere throughout, but it's Peter's and MJ's relationship in particular that becomes a bigger focus. Tom Holland and Zendaya have excellent chemistry together, but also bring an awkward authenticity that feels genuinely adolescent, and as such, is easy to get behind.Overall, ""Spider-Man: Far From Home,"" is a perfect popcorn flick. Having improved on every element of its predecessor, this is a great cinematic outing for the web-head that promises a bright future ahead.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

767,Sabaher,"Another solid, entertaining, funny film from the MCU",8,5 July 2019,"I've heard a lot of people praising this film as the best spider-man movie. I'm not quite there. I think it's a very entertaining film, but not quite top tier spider-man. This is a movie that does a great job of bridging the gap between endgame and this film. They found some really clever ways to inform us of what's been going on in ways that are funny, but also make it really clear the dynamics of the world that we're in in the type of scernarios that would have unfolded. This is also a very funny film. One of the funniest films in the MCU. Likewise each of the action sequences in this film have something distinct and unique about it that makes them interesting and memorable, especially the one that happens at the SHIELD base. That is a very cool sequence and unlike anything we've seen inside a spider-man film or a comic book movie in general. Where this one started to lose me a little bit was somewhat in the villain situation. In general there's great things that happen with the villain in this film, but at the same time I think there's a motivation problem. There's a gap inside of the motivation that held him back a good bit for me. Likewise a certain plot device inside of the film stretched a little bit too much credibility. Also this feels a bit more like an MCU comedy with spider-man in it than an actual spider-man movie. With all that said this is a very entertaining film with some great moments wit the characters, standout action sequences with just some plot issues in there.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
768,arskhemnanilack,Spider-Man: Far From Home - 8.7/10,8,2 July 2019,"Homecoming was a great movie, and I'd been waiting for another film to see if the greatness of spider-man would remain and continue through the MCU. This movie definitely did the job in bringing my favourite actor to play spider-man yet to my redemption. This movie is yet again like Homecoming, the perfect summer movie. It's actually more fun than Homecoming because they're on a school trip and the comedy seems to just land a lot more for me. Jon Watts is also back to direct this one, and he did such a great job. There are many scenes that make me reminisce to certain spider-man things I just never thought I'd ever see on a movie screen. The CGI in this movie is incredible, and is uses so well other than 2-3 scenes. To continue the fact that Micheal Keaton played Vulture, another great actor, Jake Gyllenhaal did an incredible and outstanding job with his role in FFH. Mysterio is awesome and adds a lot to the franchise, with great action scenes. Zendaya's character wasn't so great in Homecoming, but she is in this movie and the interaction/chemistry between her and Tom are natural in the scenes they're in, especially towards the end. Tom Holland also reprises his role here of course as Peter Parker and does a great job again. Along with much of the other cast members such as Jon Favreau, Jacob Batalon, Samuel Jackson, Cobie Smoulders and Marisa Tomei do a great job and bring a lot to the table here especially towards the second half for most of them. I also feel that the story is good enough, with a few plot holes here and there though it still doesn't quite top the story in Homecoming. A few issues were that the first half feels more like a Peter Parker movie and the second half is very intense/feels like a spider-man movie. Some decisions and scenes are nonsensical and a few are just used to create comedy which I feel was unnecessary. The post credits scenes (there are 2) are really important in this movie so don't miss them. Overall, this is easily the best movie of the summer and is still an awesome time at the theater. It also feels like an amped up version of Homecoming. This movie is a better Spider-man film than Homecoming, with it's incredible action and higher stakes here in terms of the villain.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

It all just adds up. Modern technologies made it possible to envision a Mysterio character that absolutely nails the concept. It's amazing. Surpassed my expectations of a well done Spider-Man story. A must see and one of the best depictions of Spider-man yet. Raimi fans should bow down. One of the best infinity saga movies as well. Kudos to those guys.,Spider-Man - Far from Home
771,alex_moerke,"Weak story, but really original and surprisingly fun",7,18 September 2020,"This movie had some great opportunities to tell a relatively appealing story, but instead it started out disrespecting the deaths of some fan favorite characters from Endgame, which basically sets the tone for the whole thing. When it comes to plot, Far from Home is nothing more but a teenage road movie where every character is crazy and most jokes don't fly - the second being mainly due to the high frequency of silliness in the likes of Michael Bay's later Transformers movies. You know, the ones where nobody is ever doing or saying something's remotely serious and you end up forgetting to laugh entirely.But - and that's a big but - the whole visual style and the originality of the action scenes are some of the best the MCU has brought forward so far. Jake Gyllenhaal makes for a great Mysterio, especially since the popular villain is usually quite stupid and unlikable. The plot twist in the after credits scene actually had me interested in the next movie - something that rarely happens to me.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Spider-Man: Far from Home is at baseline an entertaining movie to watch and provides some big hints for what's to come in the Marvel Universe. But as the first Avengers movie to be released after Endgame, it was pretty boring in comparison.

774,kursadbugrahanyapar-40285,"To me, the best movie after the first Trilogy !",7,6 July 2019,"I never liked the first Spiderman movie starring Tom Holland. To me, it was like the Iron-Spider movie instead of Spider-man. I still couldn't get used to Peter's use of so much technology in the early film, as a person who loved the first trilogy. When Peter was preparing his own outfit, I began to accept Peter's use of technology after Happy's look at Peter and the way he remembered Iron-man. They managed to change my point of view with one scene, and to me it was the most beautiful scene in the movie. The most touching scene in the movie. Besides, the bond between Tony Stark and Peter Parker was beautiful. Peter feels the lack of Tony Stark and misses him. The people remembering Tony Stark, the Iron-Man's paintings all over the place were beautiful, emotional scenes.The script wasn't bad but not great also. It was simple. Someone who was fired by his boss and turned into a bad character was stopped by a good person. There was no scenario that promised something new. But the bad character of the film promised something new. Mysterio. Mysterio is the best thing in the whole movie. He is beautifully rendered in the movie. Also Jake Gyllenhaal doing a great job as an Mysterio. I hope we'll continue to see him in the other movies.Musics are good. Especially the Avengers music that started playing when Peter began to prepare the Spiderman outfit. I got goose bumps. Also Tom Holland proved to be the best Spiderman. No matter how much I love Tobey Maguire, it's the truth. Effects and cgi are good. Jokes are good like most Marvel movies. I especially loved the relationship between Ned and Betty.The point that I dislike in the movie is that the tempo is low in some places and the scenario within this film is simple. If there were more creative steps in the scenario and the tempo could be more orderly than the from beginning to end in the film, surely it would be one of the best superhero movies from my point of view. But even so, it's one of those movies that's pretty good and I'd advise you to watch. Especially if you're into superhero movies and you love Spiderman.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

777,KirkFogg,A solid film in the Spider-Man franchise.,7,7 July 2019,"Having grown up on the comics, cartoons, and now having lived through three cinematic versions of Spider-Man, there's always a lot to live up to. The web-slinger has always been my personal favorite super hero, and he's has a lot of attention in the last few years. I know people have a lot of gripes with them (what else is new) but I truly love the Raimi trilogy, and it will likely always be my favorite. I think that Tom Holland is a much better Spider-Man, but I just loved the Raimi universe so much more. There was a time in which we could go see a Marvel movie and just enjoy a detailed story about one hero, without having to keep up with the tech and story lines of a thousand others. I know, I know, that makes it more like the comic books, but with a new super hero movie launching every three months, can't we ever step away from the big picture and just focus on the protagonist? I say this because I was so excited to see Tom Holland' Spider-Man without the movie being infiltrated by Iron Man. It got to the point that every Marvel movie was basically Iron Man and friends, and that's just not what I'm looking to see. Now, here we are after Tony's death, and I feel like the movie still revolves around him posthumously. With those complaints out of the way, let's talk about the great. The visual effects in Far From Home were stunning, which I feel like isn't always a guarantee. Mysterio was well done and much closer to the comic/cartoon series many of us know and love. I felt like Michael Keaton's version of The Vulture was such a poor departure from one of the greatest villains in the series, and was extremely disappointing. Not so with Quinton Beck. The after credit scenes both packed a wallop, which I feel is very rare. The web-slinging and fighting action was pretty fantastic, though a bit under done in my opinion. All in all a very solid film and much better than Homecoming. I'm looking forward to seeing what's to come for our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Why in the world is Spiderman pictured as a mindless irresponsible moron in this movie? I thought he was supposed to be the hero, but apparently not. Also drones seem to be the do-it-all panacea here, which after a certain limit gets very hard to swallow and even ridiculous honestly.
Here's my wholehearted recommendation to all reviewers: wait until you see a movie at least for a second time before reviewing, you'll see it will either get better or worse after that, in the case of this one, much much worse.
A lot of the villain plans in this movie have an almost nonexistent probability of coming through, like they're really stupid and in my mind not even a 10 year old would come up with something so idiotic.

Mid-credit scene set up nice intro for the next Spiderman movie and the post credit scenes were simply mind-blowing. It literally made my jaw drop. After that the only thing I can think of is ""illusion"". The whole movie was about illusions and then at the end we find out that even Fury was an illusion, and even the real Fury sun tanning on an illusion beach.

And if this is any signs of the way things are going to be then
yes, I am worried. Compare this to Black Panther, storyline in BP was
captivating, and kept you on your toes all the time, this new spiderman feels
little lukewarm. Don't get me wrong, as a movie it was decent, but as part of
the universe this was lackluster at best.The character development was slow, the way the story arcs of the persons
in this story was like it could not decide if it was drama, action, romance, or
teen or whatever is in between so it mixes them together, and add a little comedy
to it and to me that mix was a brainless mixture of wannabes that never develop into
anything.At the same time as I would have loved the character stories to be more developed
I am seriously hoping they would never do that because of the boredom that would
entail.This was a teen movie, that maybe entertains teens, but to a more mature

Is very hard to believe. No spider give you magic when it eat you, but in this movie they dont talk about that no more. In this movie, he going to europe and that's it. I think movie abotu man who is spider will be better if it is scary movie, and they make him like real spider and not man wearing pajaams.Still the people who making this movie have not thought about this yet and instead of spendig money to make teenage man look like real spider, they spend money on making him fly around in air.

786,aquawave-84891,"Great Character Development and Intertextuality, but predictability kept it from 10 stars",9,8 July 2019,"As much as I enjoyed Spider-Man: Homecoming, I enjoyed this film so much more. We get to see major character development with Peter and his relationships with his classmates. Action sequences were enticing and just the right length. Humorous scenes were more well-rounded and the plot was more multi-dimensional. For instance, we get to see more of Peter Parker's science-geek side mixed in with his usual teenage awkwardness. However, the major plot was almost painfully predictable at times. And there are also several plot-holes regarding the blip (or, as we refer to it, the snap) that may become obvious for critical viewers.Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the subtle nods throughout the film to other mediated forms of Spider-Man (previous films, the comics, and, potentially, a video game). The soundtrack was also notable (with a nod to previous Iron Man films). Older viewers have also referenced that the character looks more ""high school age"" than he did in his previous appearances.The film touches on a few key lessons: 1.) Trust in yourself. 2.) Don't ghost Nick Fury. It also sets up for several potential plotlines for the next phase of the MCU (pay attention to BOTH credit scenes).",Spider-Man - Far from Home

788,petereviews,Trailing In the MCU's Shadow...,6,21 July 2019,"The Good: Tom Holland continues to be perfectly cast as an awkward Spiderman who brings a lot of heart to the film. Zendaya also brings dimension to what is a fairly standard love interest role, and she brings plenty of chemistry. This movie excels when it is a teen comedy and focuses on the ""coming-of-age"" aspect of Peter Parker.While most of the action may be lackluster (see The Bad), the final confrontation was very exciting and felt like it had good stakes. Moreover, the post-credits scene was one of MCU's best, and definitely hooked me for a sequel, especially with the surprise appearance of JJJ. While the twist about Mysterio was fairly obvious (at least to me), the concept of the character was still good...The Bad: ...however, his illusions were very ill-defined. I realize there needs to be suspension of disbelief, but there is a limit, and it didn't make sense to me how Mysterio could conjure things so realistically using special effects (ie. the scene where he scares Peter Parker).This particular scene had other problems as well, such as Peter being literally hit by a train full-on, but a few seconds later seeming perfectly unscathed with no explanation. If the hero can get up so easily, why should the viewer invest in any peril? This movie also had horrible exposition problems (ie. the scene where Mysterio gives his speech to henchmen who should already know his motivations).The core issue with this movie though is that it didn't feel quite like a Spider-man movie. With so many references to past movies in the MCU, particularly to Tony Stark, the movie felt restricted in its identity and couldn't become its own thing most of the time, particularly in the super-heroics.Conclusion: A breezy, passable movie on its own terms, but middle-tier Marvel and will definitely not win anyone who is not dedicated to the superhero movie genre.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
789,lertad-1,Spidey at His Best,8,28 September 2019,I love Marvel. Proves blockbusters don't have to be dumb and fans appreciate attempts at in-movie logic and detail. A fresh reassurance that the MCU will continue to inspire and entertain.,Spider-Man - Far from Home
790,ICMooVees,The next major MCU hero,9,6 July 2019,"After the Infinity War/Endgame events which contained the passing and dispersing of the heroes, after watching this there can be no doubt that Spider-man is going to be the next major MCU hero to carry the torch forward for the franchise. This was such a good movie with so much great content to unpack. And I would have to agree with another IMDB reviewer who cited his favorite scene as follows: ""When Peter is behaving very Stark-like in his manipulation of the suit-designing tech (in the jet) and Happy lingers for a moment as he notices the similarity.""
The challenge of making comic books come to life on the big screen takes a significant amount of insight and depth, mainly due to the nature of what a comic book is. A comic book is made up of panels (visuals and dialog) and it is up to the readers interpretation and imagination to ""fill in the blanks"" to kind of make a movie within their own minds. I believe that is the beauty and draw (no pun intended) of comic books. And it is with that challenge that makes for well-received and therefore successful super hero movies. And it is probably why some just bomb. Poor DC just can't cut it. While a few gems shine (WW and Aquaman for example), the rest seem to sputter and fail, which is somewhat surprising and sad since there is also a great wealth of DC material to draw upon that also have legendary characters. How could a JLA, Batman or Superman movie fail?
The MCU team continues to make great movies that have deep content, great writing, striking visuals, and casting actors who capture and convey the essence of what Marvel comic book reader/geeks expect. While not every MCU movie is a total home run they are still enjoyable and integral to the MCU and make for some great movie experiences. My kids love them.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

792,ThisisFizban,Great follow up to Endgame,8,16 July 2019,There's been a lot of reviews so I'll try not to be repetitive. First off they did a phenomenal job with Misterio. There's been a lot of speculation since the Sam Raimi Spiderman films whether they would ever bring Misterio to the big screen. It's a risky move because of his unusual powers and also how strange his costume looks. But it's clear they put a lot of thought into the story here. It has depth. The typical super hero movie would just have him show up and start robbing banks with lots of visual trickery.Lots of great humor throughout with emotional depth as well. But one of the things that makes my day is their casting of Zendaya as Mary Jane. Kirsten Dunst was just all wrong as MJ. Not that she's a bad actress or anything but she was miscast and the writing for her wasn't particularly good either. Anyways I'm glad they're finally bringing MJ to the screen in a good way.One complaint is that I wish they had included other super heroes. With a threat that size you would think others would show up to lend a hand. But the twists at the end were great and I'm really excited for the next chapter.,Spider-Man - Far from Home

794,thibault-li,The best Spider-man movie and the best marvel movie so far,9,27 July 2019,"(Review for people who had watched the movie)Buy your tickets, and prepare to fly throughout Europe with Peter and his friends. Don't be afraid of turbulences because travel will not be a easy ride.First let's talk about the first strong point of the movie which is its plot.
Some would laugh again about the unluck of Peter who always manages to be at the place where the villain appears but what do you expect from a superhero movie ?
Of course, the twist about the true identity of the villain is a bit obvious and an open secret for fans of Spider-man, but there are also three other ones at the end of the movie which had surprised me a lot.
Throughout the movie, there are a lot of things which are references to new technology : The use of drones as a military end, the use of virtual reality and the google glasses are really smart choices.
But the real thing about the plot is its abundance of references. Of course, there are plenty of references to the Marvel EU, the first being about the events which occured at the end of Infinity War. In fact, I was hoping to see some footages of the effect of ""the snap"" among the civilians in Avengers : Endgame and I didn't expect them to be in this movie, so it's a pleasant surprise. I also like the references to the other characters of the MEU (other than Iron man) : Thor, Captain America and Dr Strange because they are well presented and relevant. Because of the geeky characters, there are also a lot of references to pop culture, the recurring one in the new Spider-man franchise being references to the Star Wars universe. The sequence with the infinite mirrors is also a reference to one of the last Star wars movie in my opinion.
But the best among all of them is the recast of JK Simmons as Jonah Jameson. I can hardly wait to see him again in the next movie. Maybe there will be also a cameo of Tobey Maguire and/or Andrew Garfield in the future, it would be extraordinary.
The final twist is a great reference to the end of Iron man (first marvel movie).
The scenario focus a lot on the inner conflicts of Peter Parker who has to struggle about his identites as a teenager and a superhero, in particularly as the successor of Iron man.
The romances scenes are also great thanks to the cast, which bring me to the second strong point of the movie, that is its actors.Tom Holland has to play more dramatic scenes because of the context and manages it marvellously. He acts with ease the inner conflicts of Spider-man who struggles to reconcile his superhero life and his personal life. In my opinion, this theme is nearly as well-exploited as in Spider-man 2. The death of the fatherly figure in the person of Tony Stark (replacing the Uncle Ben character) is also well depicted.
Zendaya plays a nerdy version of MJ, and it's very refreshing. She and Tom Holland have great chemistry.
As always, Samuel Jackson is very badass as Nick Fury, has a lot of screen time and funny moments especially at his first apperance.
Jacob Batalon plays a very funny sidekick and his relationship with Betty is a cool depiction of teenage romance. I'd like to salute the general effort to show heterodox interracial relationships on screen, and bringing to light Asian male characters as romance interests is a real progress in the entertainment industry.
Finally, Jake Gylenhaal plays a very persuasive and memorable villain. He suceeds to look too cool to be true in the first half of the movie, being like a big brother to Peter, then he plays a very cold villain in the second half. His two costumes are well designed as his drones. The last two Spider-man movies really suceed in creating great villains. The vulture and Mysterio are the best villains in all the Spider-man movies alongside Doctor Octopus from Spider-man 2.Finally, the action scenes are breathtaking. Of course, as a real fan of virtual reaIity as a science-fiction concept, I particularly love all the illusion sequences which are really fantastic and psychedelic.
The movie is full of pyrotechnic effects, the swinging sequences are also verry convicing. The army of drones at the end of the movie is really impressive and the last acrobatic sequence of Spider-man among them is a real joy to watch.As a conclusion, it's a great finish for the third phase and the first cycle of the Marvel extended universe.VERDICT : 8.5/10",Spider-Man - Far from Home
795,cwatson2598,Fun but over hyped,3,12 September 2019,"This was a fun film as it's supposed to be with Spider man. Tom Holland is fantastic as per usual and Jake Gyllenhaal give a great performance which is no surprise.I feel like the villain was a let down, Mysterio in this just reminded me of Syndrome from the Incredibles and I've seen that and enjoyed that in the Incredibles so I wouldn't mind a bit of a more original villian",Spider-Man - Far from Home
796,judicmr,"Good, but something not right.",7,13 July 2019,"Basis story was good. Seemed mostly true to the history of the character. Acting was good, although some of the dialogue made me cringe at times. I guess that's a fine line to walk in a superhero movie. Nick Fury and Happy are just annoying for some reason. I think that the humor needed some polish. RDJ could always deliver a funny line, but none of these players can easily do it. Movie was all a bit too teenagery. But that may have been the target. Special effects where good, but nobody seems to know how to do drones; in look or reasonable quantities (thousands really?). The Mysterio ""Crew"" makes no sense. I laughed at Ralphie with the fake male pattern baldness. There is something with too hot Aunt May that would never happen in the real world. Over the top Jameson was unnecessary. There are lots of little things that distracted me from a great movie. I'm sure many will love it. It's worth the money, just don't expect a 9 or 10 rated movie.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

798,WYLION-SOTIRISKING,WYLION - Spider-Man: Far from Bad,8,9 July 2019,"Let's get straight to the point. I thought this movie was pretty good.Comparing this movie to Homecoming I think this one was slightly better. Why do I think this? Let me explain.In this movie having MJ (Zendaya) as the love interest makes a lot more sense than before. In Homecoming I didn't like the character at all as she was a bit bland and just felt rushed as the focus was more on Liz Allen (Laura Harrier) and setting up the twist. On the other side of the table thought I thought Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) was a better villain than Quentin Beck (Jake Gyllenhaal). Not in terms of acting as I though for both of the villains the acting was fantastic. I just thought the twist of Homecoming really made the relationship between Peter Parker (Tom Holland) and Adrian Toomes a whole lot more real and a lot harder. Plus the motive of Toomes was more understandable that Beck's, although Jake Gyllenhaal was brilliant as normal. One criticism I have with this movie much like I did with Homecoming, there isn't enough Spider-man action. Where was the scene from the trailer Marvel? I just really liked the cute little relationship between MJ and Peter. I also really enjoyed Peter growing up more in this movie and understanding that he needs to step up to his superhero duties.I think that where both movies have their differences I enjoyed Far from Home more. It was fun, which was needed after Endgame. This was fresh to see, especially as the movie handled the events of Endgame and Infinity War very well. I can say I am definitely going to watch this movie again and I think I will enjoy it just as much. I do think this movie is good but as explained it definitely isn't perfect.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

But the main thing that made me love it is Jake Gyllenhaal's amazing potrayal of Mysterio. Mysterio is also such a badass villian. My favourite scene was the scene where Mysterio created illusions and crashed Spidey into the train, the visuals are a absolutely breathtaking and it reminded me of Inception. Another thing that really captures my heart is the scenery and location which is Europe. Overall, this movie is a very well written and acted movie that will forever be in my heart.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

So yeah. But the movie itself was stunning.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
804,rstarzecmoviecritic,Clashing Romantic Comedy and Marvel,7,10 July 2019,"Is Spider-Man: Far From Home one of the best films to come out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe? Well, no, but does it provide quality entertainment that we expect from Marvel Studios in 2019? Yes and no. Comparing Tom Holland's Spider-Man to the previous live-action Spider-Men (Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield) is a difficult process. He fits the role well since Holland looks like a toddler in comparison to both Maguire and Garfield, and we can actually believe that he is a high school student as he should be (with the exception of Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3, in which Maguire plays Peter Parker in his college years).
Getting an actor who looks the part is one thing, but just like with Homecoming, the writers of Far From Home try to throw rapid-fire jokes at the audience like Groucho Marx, and in the first hour of the film, about ninety percent of these jokes fall flat. Granted, most of the attempts at humor are not necessarily ""cringe-worthy"" bad; they just fail to hit the mark. Perhaps the writers are catering the humor in the film more towards teenagers than the general public since a lot of the humor revolves around relationships between students on the vacation and the awkwardness that can come from such relationships. This movie is like a teenage romantic comedy combined with a Marvel Studios film.
Okay, so the comedy in the film seems to be overplayed, but what about the general story? The story in Far From Home proves to be a big improvement from Homecoming, even though certain aspects are unoriginal in the superhero genre. When Iron Man 3 was released, critics were comparing Guy Pearce's villain to Syndrome from The Incredibles. Without giving too much away, the same argument can be made about the villain in this film, so now we have two Syndrome knock-offs in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Or maybe Syndrome should be considered a knock-off of these villains if this is how the villains were portrayed in the comics?
Peter's part of the story, however, turns out to be a great feature of this movie. As noted above, Far From Home plays out as a romantic comedy for teenagers, so naturally, a lot of this movie deals with Peter's interest in M.J. and his adorably awkward way he goes about trying to get her attention. Since a lot of Peter's character arc deals with what he would rather focus on (M.J. or being Spider-Man) it proves to be a similar - though not identical - character arc to the one featured in Spider-Man 2, the best Spider-Man movie to date.
In terms of visuals and filmmaking, Far From Home proves to be pretty spectacular. The ""fight scenes"" between Spider-Man and the main villain are jaw-dropping and almost frightening since they have the audience constantly questioning what is real and whether or not the audience is on an acid trip during these sequences (not even kidding). It is beyond impressive - the editing, cinematography, and special effects blend together in these nightmarish sequences to put the audience at a feeling of unease.
Far From Home surpasses Homecoming in quality, but it is neither the best of the best nor the worst of the worst in terms of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is a solid movie that tries to jam humor down your throat early on, but gradually becomes a well-rounded cinematic experience towards its second half.

809,LinaInverse23,What a fun time!,8,12 July 2019,"Spider-Man: Far from Home is a fantastic followup to Avengers: End Game. Tom Holland is at the top of his game here, allowing Peter Parker to exhibit the trials and tribulations of a teenage boy. The best parts of the film are the ""hangout' and exposition moments, where the kids have screen time to be themselves- having fun on a field trip in another part of the world. Seeing this side of Peter Parker's life is similar to a teenage drama, but done very well. The movie benefits from having great scenes between Peter and his friends, and especially the budding relationship between him and MJ (a true highlight of the film).The film is shot beautifully, and takes its time in unfolding its story. Jake Gyllenhaal steals every scene he is in, and is wonderful as new character Mysterio. Zendaya is given a lot more meat this time around to show off her acting chops, and develop her character. It was very nice to see Jon Favreau have a larger part in this film as Happy Hogan. Overall this film did a great job developing its characters and allowing them to have fun with their parts. There was never a time where the script felt ""stifled"" and it carried the audience along for the ride.The film was extremely entertaining, and creative, allowing the characters freedom and connection. Spider-Man faced a threat he has never faced before, and the audience can feel that fear and unpredictability.

827,wesleyarledge-86836,"Refreshing, Fun & Satisfying - One of the Best and most Unique Spider-man movies to date!",10,3 July 2019,"Marvel Studios does it again! Far From Home is just as good (and maybe even better) than the previous entry, Spider-man: Homecoming! Tom Holland once again shines as Spidey, and once again proves why he is the definitive actor to play the Webhead! The film delivers a lot of heart and humor that we've come to expect from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and the film beautifully handles the devastating in film loss of Tony Stark/Iron Man at the end of Avengers: Endgame with a lot of grace, and the film handles who is going to step up and fill Iron Man's Golden Rocket Boots. Jake Gyllenhaal also was brilliant as Mysterio, playing the character as more of a ""cool uncle"" to Holland's title character. It was also cool to have Hydro Man and Molten Man as secondary villians this time around too, even though ""The Elementals"" as they're called in the movie are only realistic and advanced illusions created by Mysterio. Having Nick Fury and Maria Hill back in the picture was also a nice change of pace too! And I must say, that since Spider-Man is my all time favorite superhero, it was really great having one of Spidey's most unique and difficult to defeat foes as the big bad for this film!! He's also one of my favorite Spider-man villians too, and the film has some great Mysterio sequences and battles in the movie! Another thing that I appreciated was that the filmmakers added even more character development for each of Peter's classmates, and Michelle (MJ), Flash Thompson, Ned, and Betty Brant all get their own unique arcs throughout the movie!There are also heavy callbacks to the events of Avengers: Endgame, as well as Captain America: Civil War and the very first Iron Man film! Tony Stark's presence is heavily felt throughout the entire film, and how everyone who was resurrected by Thanos' Snap reversal at the end of Endgame is adjusting to being back in a world that has changed forever.The mid credits and post credits scenes are worth the price of admission alone, as the mid credits scene features a surprise cameo by J.K. Simmons as everyone's favorite Spider-man smearing journalist, J. Jonah Jameson, who thanks to some doctored footage published by Mysterio's crew, outs Peter Parker as Spider-man to all of New York City, kind of similar to how Tony Stark confessed he was Iron Man at the end of the very first MCU film!The post credits scene also delivers a clever and delicious twist: revealing that Nick Fury and Maria Hill were actually Skrulls Talos and his wife Soren from Captain Marvel the whole time, having been assigned the duty of imitating Fury and Hill by Nick Fury himself, who is in space in command of a Skrull spaceship!I don't know where the MCU is heading next in Phase 4, but I can't wait to find out!! I loved the movie and I can't wait to see it again! It's definitely a must watch for those of you who have burning questions at the end of Avengers: Endgame. Given the mid credits and the post credits scenes in this film, I'm left with more theories and even more questions as to where we go in Phase 4! All in all, one of the best Spider-man films to date, and it's a lot of fun and a very satisfying way to end Phase 3!",Spider-Man - Far from Home

That game made me appreciate and love Peter Parker and Spider-man (and this is after watching Homecoming - which I also love but didn't really appreciate it that much, at that point.)So now, after playing as Spidey and swinging across New York, this movie just give me the chills. More action, more tearjerker, more A-list actor too (love you Jake).You really get the sense of Spider-man from this movie and that feeling of fighting and swinging with him.

841,cathey-127,"Cute, but falls flat",6,5 August 2019,"I agonized a bit between 6 and 7. The movie's enjoyable, but it falls short compared to the last movie and pretty much every other Marvel installment, probably because Marvel didn't quite know where it wanted to go with this movie either.Homecoming kept Peter Parker a typical nerd teenager, screwing up missions, awkward conversations with Aunt May (parents), having a failed crush on Liz... it was relatable to most teenagers and adults who remember what it was like growing up. Far From Home seemed confused. Peter has now gone to space, become an avenger, blipped 5 years, and lost Tony Stark. He should be more of a man now, and Marvel has no idea how to do this other than making his next relationship a bit more successful, but it wasn't because he was a better guy this time either, MJ just happened to like him. And MJ was a great character in the last movie, stealing the show despite being a comic relief character. It would have been great to see Peter slowly seeing how cool she is, but boom, Peter just likes her now. Sigh and I thought this generation of movies would focus more on the inner strength of female characters (which MJ did have in Homecoming) besides just being a love interest... It also still repeats the story of Peter trying to juggle two lives, almost failing the avengers, and redeeming himself in the end. We've seen that already. It feels like the same story, just with a new villain. Oh and the villain... pretty much just popped out of nowhere with a paper thin backstory and almost no motive but to be a bad guy. He's also comically unlikable with the cape thing.Overall this movie's okay for popcorn, but I really wonder how dumb the producers thought their audience would be. Even Disney cartoons have more character development these days. Hopefully the next movie's not as one dimensional and predictable",Spider-Man - Far from Home

845,battlecrusadersgames,A worthwhile epilogue to the current phase of MCU,8,12 July 2019,"Watching this, i was trying to think of some negative criticism i could add here, but honestly, by the end of the movie, i still didn't have any. This is just a great and very complete movie.
This time round, Spidey teams up with a powerful superhero from an alternate Earth, while at the same time trying to woo the girl of his dreams, but all doesn't go to plan with either situation. This plot is handled very well by the writers, who keep a good balance between character development and action scenes. It's just the right length so we don't get bored or leave feeling short-changed and just when you think you know what to expect, they throw in another twist and keep you glued to the very end.
As for the special FX, it's on point, with some of the most magnificent coming towards the climax at the end and that's the way it should be.
It's great to see Fury getting more air time here too and Jake Gyllenhaal provides the mature Father figure that both Spidey himself and the viewers need after losing Iron Man.
Along with the incredible FX, the other best part about Spiderman is Tom Holland, who plays the lead perfectly and is ever watchable both as Peter Parker and his alter ego.
End game was definitely the end of a saga, but this is a through enjoyable and worthwhile epilogue.
By the way, make sure to watch to the very end, because this time, we have 2 credits scenes that will shake things up for the future of the MCU",Spider-Man - Far from Home
846,Mickey089,as expected.....,6,20 July 2019,"Not wrong to watch, but don't expect a masterpiece.To start with the second best thing: the villain. Though a bit diverted from the comics, they did a terrific job by creating mysterio, storywise, technicallywise and from the effects and carried by Jake Gyllenhall's on the point acting.Samuel's Nick Fury as always great, but he doesn't have to put effort in it after all this time.Zendeya was definitaly the best acting for the youngsters and brought a lot to the scenes where she was in.All other youngsters including Tom were mediocre at best. Sorry, but just looking cute and show some decent acting isn't enough to carry a whole movie for me. However, many of his lines were rather poor, which he tried to myke the best out of it. In the next sequel I surely hope they stop with showing him as an teenager who alternates between being overclumsy or a brilliant scientist (too much cliche).Story: all of the villain stuff is brilliant, the lovesotries were at times funny (good) or overly cliche with ""i am too shy to ask her"" all the movie long.THe BEST thing: the mid credit scene!!!!!

849,maxwelloreocookie,Way better than Homecoming in every aspect. Surprisingly very good.,7,7 July 2019,"I started to think the MCU would lose it's steam after Endgame, but after seeing this, I'm still on board.The movie utterly destroys Homecoming, which I found decent upon first watching, but as time went on and the more I thought about the movie, the more I realized it's just not a good movie, in my opinion at least. Homecoming has zero rewatchability for me.Zendaya was much better here, and she's given more to do. I didn't even want to give Zendaya a chance cuz I didn't care for her character at all in the first movie, but she massively improved here. The romance between Peter and MJ was surprisingly very well done. It's one of the best romances I've seen in a movie in a very long time, way better than all those cheesy cliche Rom-Coms.Mysterio was also amazing. His scenes are some of the best and most suspenseful in the whole movie. Jake Gyllenhaal kills it as Myserio, but that wasn't surprising, cuz it's Jake Gyllenhaal.I still think Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man and Peter Parker. I just think Spider-Man should be a little more quippy, but I don't think it was needed as much in a story like this. Maybe in the 3rd movie he will be more of a real Spider-Man, cuz these first 2 movies are more about him growing into Spider-Man when you think about it. Hopefully the 3rd movie doesn't do that again. It was great in the 2nd movie(and okay in the 1st movie), but I think it's ran it's course by now, and time to move on from that.So my main minor complaint of the movie is they go a little too overboard with the comedy sometimes, especially in the first act. But none of the comedy is awful, like how Last Jedi's ""comedy"" was.I also know some fans complain that this version of Spider-Man is not enough like the originals. I kinda get where they are coming from, but this is the 2nd reboot in less than a decade, obviously they have to spice things up a bit at this point, or it would get stale. Amazing Spider-Man was already stale cuz it was too much like the original Sam Raimi movies. I personally like the directions these MCU Spider-Man movies are going, it still has the themes of balancing being a superhero with his normal life, that aspect was especially good in Far From Home.The only thing I don't like in these MCU Spider-Man movies is they put too much emphasis on Iron Man. I get he just died, but still. This is Spider-Man, not Iron Man Jr. But I'm pretty sure they will ditch that or at least dial way down on that Iron Man stuff for the 3rd movie, hopefully. I also think MCU movies should start trying to be a little more self-contained, not always trying to reference other MCU movies, or building up to a bigger MCU movie. I rather just have every movie be great on it's own regardless. Don't get me wrong, nothing wrong with building, but I think the movies should be great on their own first and still be able to stand on their own. So just dont be like Iron Man 2, etc.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

It has to appeal to the lowest common denominator and include as much racial play as possible. MJ is now a half black girl, another friend of Peters is unrealistically involved with a fat south pacific looking guy that actually appears to be gay. Another guy is Chinese for some reason so of course the China marketing people are happy about that. Outside of the PC crap, the CGI honestly looks no better than the CG work in the original which makes no sense with all the radical advancements over the years. Oh yes, and the all important story is super boring and predictable. The list goes on. It's sad that anyone under 30 doesn't know how studios try to feed and control them with this kind of programmed, anti-art just so it will hopefully appeal to the widest audience. If any kids out there want to see real emotion and creativity, please check out indie films from the 90's and up, and find a big screen to watch them on. Netflix and the rest of the streamers just make all of this worse btw.

855,jelaniwilliams305,Spider-Man: Far From Home was....fine,6,8 July 2019,"Spider-Man: Far from Home was fine; it's on par with Homecoming, but I'd give the latter a slight edge because I think that Michael Keaton as a much better villain. Much like the previous MCU Spidey installment, this film tackles all the dealing with kids in high school that include: boy/girl crushes, making plans to move on said crush, those plans going straight to hell and then having to improvise on those plans. All of those things I can relate to because I've been there when I was in high school, so it was nice to see it portrayed so well on the big screen.The casting/performances were really good; Tom Holland really nails the awkward teenager, while Zendaya really sells that tell-it-like-it-is, tough girl but you know she uses that as a facade to protect herself from getting close to people. Ned was great; he's probably my favorite character in the film. Jake Gyllenhaal was was decent villain; it feels like he was dialing it in at the beginning but he got better towards the end. I will say there was something a little off about Samuel L. Jackson's portrayal of Nick Fury in this film but then I found out why, which, I feel, was ridiculous but I won't spoil that. The visuals were good for the most part; some of the sequences were amazing and others felt like I was watching a PS3 video game. It wasn't enough to take me out of the film but it was bothersome at times.My biggest gripe is that this is a Spider-Man film that lives in the shadow of Iron Man. The ""Will Spider-Man be the next Iron Man?"" narrative is irritating; I don't want Peter to have to ""live up"" to Stark but rather make a name for himself. Also, Mystero's motivation for his actions were a result of Tony screwing him over. He just wanted Stark's tech so he could be the ""next Iron Man."" Speaking of living in Iron Man's shadow, Peter is too reliant on Tony Stark's tech; I don't have a problem with him using it but he's too dependent on it, which, to me, overshadows Peter's brilliance. For example: in The Amazing Spider-Man, the film highlighted Peter's intelligence, especially when he was building his suit; we saw him do research about the fabrics to use, how it will respond to wind velocity (or something like that), and we saw him build he web-shooters himself in his garage. They made it a point to establish how brilliant Peter really was; even when he created the formula that made Connors into the Lizard, he rectified it by using his intelligence to create a solution.
While Tom Holland and Zendaya had really good on screen chemistry, I wonder: when did Peter start liking MJ? Did I miss something? He was all about Liz in Homecoming and there was no indication that he had interest in MJ. I'm not a guy that needs every detail spelled out for me on film, but that's a seed I wish was planted prior to this film (unless I wasn't paying attention). Another minor nitpick is that May/Happy dynamic; that was almost as awkward as Banner/Natasha relationship in Age of Ultron.Is this the best Spider-Man film? Not at all; Spider-man 2 and Into the Spider-Verse still holds that title but I did enjoy this film. There were a few neat call back to previous MCU films that anyone who has been watching them from the beginning will appreciate. Also, the mid-credit scene was really cool, but the end credit scene was dumb; I'm sorry, there's no other way to describe it. Overall, I'd give this film a 3/5.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
856,dragon3611,Far From Home- Far from Great.,4,23 February 2021,"If you look at the first 100 screens of reviews on here you would be forgiven for thinking that it is the best Spider-Man movie and the best movie that has ever been made. I can only assume that these people have been paid to put these
10 out of 10s up. Firstly I think Tom Holland makes a poor choice for the main protagonist.
For someone with his super strength and other abilities he goes about with zero confidence and exudes awkwardness. The film just feels empty with no soul. The acting is cheesy and the CGI is just so over the top - often with the non-reality sequences I just thought ooh look he's inside a CGI generator. All I can compare it to is a computer game with loads of graphics but one you don't want to play with because the gameplay is rubbish. I didn't care about any of the characters or what happened to them. To me the best Spider-Man was Spider-Man 2 directed by Sam Raimi - awesome casting, story, direction, everything.
This movie also just seemed another excuse for political correctness box ticking.
But I suppose if you don't mind that and just love loads of CGI fired into your eyeballs for a couple of hours then you too will think that this is the best movie ever and add your 10 out of 10 to the ludicrous amounts of the same on here.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

The ""villain"" does not look like a villain at all, not even after his ""true"" identity os revealed - and somehow his powers are beeing a super ilusionist - which on my opinion kiils every vibe of the rest of the movie.

861,UnculturedGeek,Amazing Movie! Just as good as the first one!,8,28 June 2019,"For those who give this movie a 4/10 or a 5/10, I'm sorry to you buddy, but you don't have good taste. This movie was incredible! Of course, there were some predictable parts, including the twist, but all in all, it was an epic movie.
In the beginning, it had a hilarious memoriam for the superheroes we lost in endgame, and they continue throughout the movie to dramatically and hilariously talk about the effects of both ""infinity war"" and ""endgame."" One example of this would be where half of the High schoolers are five years older than the other half of the High schoolers. If they disappeared during the events of ""Infinity War"" and ""Endgame,"" they would call it being ""Blipped."" Another example of a reference to endgame was Iron Man's death. His death developed Peter into his own sort of Iron Man. He even got Iron Man's glasses. In one scene, there is also a reference to the first Iron Man movie, so if you haven't seen that, you should see it before you go see Far From Home.
Now to tell you if this movie is kid friendly. Personally, I think that this one has a darker tone because it involves illusions(Green Fog, Spiderman trapped in snow globe, etc.) since the villain has the technology to do that, but all in all, if your child is older than 9, he/she should be able to contain it.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
862,RachelCop,"Awesome sequel, would watch again",9,20 July 2019,"Spider-Man: Far From Home is definitely a movie that I can watch over and over again! It's a cute and fun hero movie, Peter just wants to live a normal life and doesn't want his hero business to get in the way of that. You honestly can't blame him, he's fought Thanos like twice then had to watch Iron Man die right in front of his eyes.He's been through a lot, he deserves a vacation and try to be like everyone else. I can't find anything I really hate about that movie but the whole Ned getting a girlfriend just didn't go anywhere but yeah. Also I disagree with a lot of people thinking that the movie is only good when Mysterio shows up, because that is simply not true.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
863,diverdown-71966,Lousy. Save your money.,4,3 July 2019,"LOL. This movie currently has a 8.2 IMDB rating??!! I just got back from the theatre and believe me, it's nowhere near that good. I almost fell asleep twice! I'm giving it a 4 and that's generous. Marvel needs to close up shop entirely for a few years and do a complete reboot with all new writers. The storyline and acting were below average. The special effects were just barely average, nothing spectacular. This is basically another Marvel money-grab capitalizing on the past performances of an established character. There's quite a lot I could say about this movie that will become painfully obvious In the first few minutes if you watch it. Let's just say that it lives up to what you would expect coming out of Hollywood these past few years. Don't believe all of these 9 and 10 star ratings.

I guess comic book movie fans don't really know what a real quality movie is. It has all the panache of a made-for-TV movie. The writing is silly, the action boring, and the acting hackneyed. And this kid who plays Peter Parker. Really? No one has managed to come close to Tobey McGuire's Spider-Man. Of course McGuire is a fine actor with great range. Garfield took over the role and made it boring. And this kid just doesn't have an ounce of the gravitas needed to fill the role. Even though McGuire is of limited stature, he stood tall in the role. This kid is just a young squirt who isn't even a convincing high school student. Bleh.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
868,nickrichardson-16919,Popcorn Empire - Spider-Man: Far From Home review,9,6 July 2019,"""Far From Home continues Marvel's win streak with another charming, energetic, and fun action film... and the best live action Spider-Man adaptation since Spider-Man 2... 9/10""Spider-Man: Far From Home is the second solo Spider-Man film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Coming off the cusp of Avengers: Endgame, this film begins to transition us into a new phase of the MCU, and continues to develop Peter Parker as a character. Far From Home continues Marvel's win streak with another charming, energetic, and fun action film... and the best live-action Spider-Man adaptation since Spider-Man 2.WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!Following the death of Tony Stark, Peter Parker comes into this film with a lot of weight and grief on his shoulders. He seeks guidance from whoever he feels comfortable talking to about his struggles in balancing his two lives.
Mysterio becomes one of these figures, offering wisdom to Peter Parker, but he ultimately betrays his trust and complicates Peter's situation more than ever, endangering his friends as well as many innocent people. Peter makes big, difficult decisions throughout this story, but the film concludes with Peter striking a balance between being Peter and being Spider-Man. Things seem to finally be working out... until the film comes in with not one, but two knockout twists in the very end that will have you holding your breath for the next installment.While the plot of this film isn't revolutionary (if you know anything about Mysterio from the comics, you'll know something's fishy from the very start), the characters, both old and new, are very well handled. Once Mysterio's true identity and intentions are revealed, the story twists and turns in fun, unexpected ways. The effects are inventive and mind-bending, reminiscent of the reality warping effects of Doctor Strange. Mysterio is excellently portrayed here, and Jake Gyllenhaal plays a madman like no other in this role. He's intimidating not because of an imposing presence or some sort of superpower, but because he's a manipulative, unhinged sociopath with way too much power in his hands and a twisted sense of morality.While the ""good vs. evil"" plot drives the Spider-Man side of the film, what drives Peter Parker's Story is the awkward romance between Peter and MJ. Tom Holland and Zendaya have great chemistry, and they really sell the relationship and make it believable. The performances are great all around, and Tom Holland does an excellent job of embodying the anxieties and inner turmoil that comes with being Spider-Man, without sacrificing the charm and humor that also comes with the character.The movie is also really funny. The awkwardness between Peter and MJ puts a smile on your face while also making you cringe (in a good way), and comic relief characters like Ned and Mr. Harrington have a lot of hilarious one liners.What elevates the Marvel films, and is especially present here, is their sense of self-awareness. Mysterio's entire plot revolves around playing into the tropes of superheroes. He knows what cliches to follow to put on a convincing show, and because of this, the film itself pokes fun at these cliches. There's a lot to appreciate in the meta-humor and twisting of genre conventions, especially for die hard fans. Speaking of which, MCU fans will also appreciate the tie-ins of minor characters from the Iron Man trilogy. The way Marvel has been carrying over characters from previous films helps make the whole universe feel lived-in and thoughtfully executed.Marvel Studios is somewhat of an anomaly in Hollywood, pumping out blockbusters like there's no tomorrow... and yet they still manage to stay fresh, inventive, and of high quality. The Infinity Saga is an unprecedented accomplishment in cinematic history, and it's clear that Marvel has no plans of losing their momentum with Phase Four. Marvel fans, (especially Spider-Man and Mysterio fans) should have a lot of fun with this entry, and walk out of the theater anxiously anticipating what Marvel Studios has in store for us next.9/10",Spider-Man - Far from Home

873,gaamst,Best Spider-Man in years,8,14 September 2019,"I was actually pretty impressed with this movie. They made some good decisions throughout. The story and escpecially the character development is tremendously well written.I was a bit worried to begin with, but without trying to give anything away, the twist really worked out and took the film to a whole other level. I also really like Tom Holland as Spiderman, it was the right decision to go with a younger Spiderman for the reboot. And the identity crisis the character experiences is a thousand times better handled than the one Peter Parker went through in Spiderman 3.Easily the best Spiderman-movie in years, and I would've said all time if it hadn't have been for the first two featuring Tobey Maguire.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
874,RichFlower,Too PC for me,4,11 December 2019,And too far fetched. Peter is the new voice of Tony Stark. Outer space monsters. MJ is a black girl. Peters high school class has burka clad moslems.

875,mcmcormick,What the hell did I just watch?,3,8 February 2020,"Cringe worthy comes to mind when I think about this film. I'm glad I waited for the DVD to watch this because I could fast forward the scenes where a bullish MJ degrades others just for the heck of it and a spineless Peter follows her around like a lost puppy. Puh-lease! The CGI was rendered so obvious in parts it should come as normal (like vehicles where you can pick out the fakes) that you'd think you were watching a TV series. The actions are good though, if only this was purely an action film. This movie is just a notch better than that DC wreck Aquaman.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Lots of action, jokes (nice star wars reference by Nick Fury) and locations. Watching these news takes on Spiderman I am starting to miss the film's where he was just the friendly neighborhood Spiderman like in amazing Spiderman, not a fan of going all over. That's why I liked Homecoming so much. But as a whole it's a good film and fits in nicely, not a fan of Nick Fury, too much of an arse in this film.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

879,sourish-561987,Visually Marvel !!!,6,8 April 2020,"The story and the concept was extremely nice, with is it should have done wonders but sadly it didn't. This movie lacked a definitive Anti-Hero, check all other Marvel movies, every anti-hero has a vision, a motto, a reason for his/her actions but this one looked like a child prayed to God and when the wish is not fulfilled, he got annoyed and wants it forcibly. Its like, ""Mommy, I also want to fight some really bad guys, to become a superhero"" And he started making the, or just say started faking them. His motto made this character ""A Dumb"" and ""Hilarious""No second thoughts on how exceptional this movie looked with all the CGIs and other graphics...but yes, its just the looks, there was a story but the anti-hero character arc ruined it completely...should have been way much better for an Antagonist to call himself The Greatest Superhero of all time.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
880,saghy122,It was better than Homecoming,7,4 July 2019,"The movie itself was very entertaining, I had a great time watching it, most of the issues I have I had already in Homecoming. Like M.J., who's not that M.J., because she is a completely different M.J., but people call her M.J. too, so get used to it. What's the point in that? Or the young and sexy Aunt May, who literally has no other purpose than the jokes, that everyone wants to bang her. Or the totally ruined Flash Thompson. I thought they are going to correct these things with the concept of the multiverse, I was very excited that it's finally happening, but then it just ended up as one of Mysterio's lies, which is such a ridiculously missed opportunity. Now let's talk about the pros. I think Tom Holland's overall performance was a lot more mature than in any of his previous films, and Mysterio is one of the most interesting villains of the MCU to date. I'm a huge fan of the comics and I was very pleased with Jake Gyllenhaal's portrayal. However, since I already knew the character it didn't surprised me much, that him being a hero was just an act. But I'm sure the people, who only know Marvel from the movies were like ""What???"". So it was fun, and a lot more memorable than Homecoming, and the post-credit scenes really got me hyped. I can't wait to see what's next!",Spider-Man - Far from Home

883,andresromerocompain,One of the best Spider-Man Films today,8,29 September 2019,"Now that I've seen it twice now and some time has passed. I can finally come to my final thoughts from my first viewing in theaters. Overall, Spider-Man Far From Home is a really good movie, it was funny entertaining, exciting, and charming. All the characters in this movie are great and given a lot more to do, everything involved with the villain is actually brilliant and way better than Homecoming, performances from everyone are wonderful, the story is funny, goofy but very self aware, entertaining, and engaging, the action scenes and the visual effects are super cool, there is tons of great subtle commentary, the soundtrack is still fantastic, and everything involved with Peter Parker and Spider-Man was great especially in the new direction they took him. But it has similar issues with Homecoming, the cinematography is a bit weak and I wish they highlighted the locations they went to more, not saying that it's bad at all but didn't really convey the tone that well. Characters like Brad and Nick Fury were pretty weak at points and kind of brought the movie a bit down at some scenes. And as for the last issue I have which is a personal thing and related to Homecoming, I wish the movie has a bit more heart. The biggest thing about the Sam Rami Spider-Man movies and even Spider-Man Into The Spider-Verse is that those movies have so much heart and even emotional scenes, and I felt that is what this movie and Homecoming needed is some emotional scenes and some heart. But I think the material and script are still there, and it's still a really good movie and it's still hilarious, and it always manages to capture why I love Spider-Man as a character and his connection with me. All it just needs is better cinematography and more heart, with more of those it could be a masterpiece and be up there with Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Verse possibly. In conclusion, the movie is really good, I enjoyed it a lot and I could see myself watching it again and still enjoying it, but it could have been a bit better, but at the end of the day it was trying to be a good movie and it succeeded.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
884,AnkasaurusRex,Spectacular,10,15 July 2019,"Okay i love it! It once again proves that Tom Holland is buy far the best live action peter parker/spider-man, i love the whole setting, unfortunately i pretty much called most of the plot before it came out so it it wasn't really a surprise, but it was amazing to see!, and my god the first mysterio vs peter illusion scene was.... absolutely brilliant felt ripped straight from the comic books! Everything about mysterio was incredible..... only 3 things i had a problem with. 1 i personally don't know how i feel about his identity being reveavled to the world.. especially so soon, 2 i don't know if mysterio is really dead but i really hope not because I'd love to see my along side Vulture, Scorpion..... Shocker... i guess (still annoyed they blackwashed him mid movie) a Doc Ock and Sandman then have the sinster six or use scorpion and socker as a side villain and use electro and Kraven and boom the original sinster six but thats me, 3 i do know how i feel about aunt may and happy but oh well it made for some good content. all in all i absolutely loved it!",Spider-Man - Far from Home
885,stop_thebeat,Bored now,5,7 July 2019,"In a nutshell, I didn't like it.
Like the first film the bad guy holds it together. Jake Gylenhall is charismatic, funny and holds your attention when he's on screen. It's nothing against Tom Holland or the cast, I certainly couldn't do it. But to date the villains are the main attraction. I love the big screen version of Mysterio, honestly I wasn't too bothered about what was happening when he wasn't around.
Spider-Man, at least this version works great as part of an ensemble. He's a great addition to Captain america Civil War & Avengers but his single movies don't impress me at all.
I know it's the younger years maybe when he's older wiser and more Spidey like I'll enjoy it more. To me it felt like watching a children's film with a few superheroes thrown in to meet the current trend. So far the Spider-Man films have been a dramatic change of tone compared to other Marvel comic films, but they really need to make it more appealing to audiences over the age of 12.
It's cheesy, childish, predicable and pays lip service to previous films.
For me, this is one spider I'd spray with Raid.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
886,caleblimsw,Not quite your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man,7,15 June 2020,"Peter Parker returns in an action-filled romp, that, true to formula, stays funny, relatable, but with enough menace to it, although at times it seems to betray its own roots, forgoing the ""friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man"" for the usual Marvel fare. The stakes are boosted to a new level, something slightly disappointing considering how great Homecoming was by having a ""smaller"" villain. Tom Holland, Jake Gyllenhaal and Zendaya pull off some great characters, but the amount of spectacle here seems somewhat excessive and Peter's own character doesn't quite grow as well as he could've.Still, enjoyable, fun, and definitely worth watching.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
887,mddwave,Surreal,5,9 November 2019,"Overall, I don't really like Spider-Man and all the special effects. The hologram part was fascinating and was one thing that made the movie worth watching. I have never seen a special effect like the hologram. It was so surreal.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
888,tripaditya-80289,Rivalled Into The Spider-Verse...,9,9 July 2019,"This was the kind of movie which you go in to watch with a lot of expectations, and Far From Home delivers just that and more.I used to think Tom Holland as a good choice for spider man but I felt a little something missing when I saw him in Homecoming(not that the movie wasn't still good)....But this time he truly made Spider Man his own much like what RDJ did with Iron Man. Everything was right, the emotions connected to the character, the teenage drama and struggle of Being the next Iron Man. Not to state the obvious but the effects were Endgame level.This movie was not just another movie it was a proper send off to a great era. And the beginning of another. I literally screamed ""Yaay"" when I saw JJ Simons cursing Spider Man again, it just made Tom Holland's Spider Man now complete and perfect.The Talos part in the end was just gold.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
889,terrykennethbarber,Possibly my least favourite MCU movie so far.,6,13 February 2021,"Another underwhelming villain, reminded very much of Iron Man 3's villain. Mysterio could have been an awesome villain and he looked cool, but the twist with the drones and holograms was lame. Seemed more like a full on comedy, which would be fine...if certain characters were not acting completely out of character to fit into a comedic movie. Also, Peter acting so dumb and making such dumb decisions was out of character. Peter suddenly being more concerned with a girl than with saving lives...when he desperately wanted to be taken seriously as an avenger in previous movies. The writing was sloppy.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
890,notastrawhat,Fantastic!,10,13 July 2019,"After Into the Spiderverse and Endgame, I had pretty high expectations for Far From Home, and I was completely blown away about how good it is. As always, the cast is great, especially Tom Holland, Jake Gylanhall, and Samuel L. Jackson. The story stays together and never seems to farfetched, unlike other superhero movies (i.e, Captain Marvel; Aquaman). Like other Marvel movies, the writers do a great job with the characters. The way they wrote the characters made even minor ones like Flash, Brad, and Betty entertaining to watch. Jake Gylanhall's Mysterio stands out as being one of the best villians in the MCU. Rather than physically hurting Spider-Man, Mysterio tears him apart on the inside, using Tony Stark's death as an advantage. The effects were great and the action was also some of the best in the MCU. Overal, Spider-Man Far From Home is a great movie and easily one of the best (if not the best) in the MCU.

With the series booting thrice in 15 years, and latest affiliation between Sony and Disney over Spider-man has shown the story from a different angle never experienced before.Marvel's Spider-man theme music sounds very much derived from Avengers Theme, does not have the impact like that of Avengers. ""I Will Always Love You"" plays during the MARVEL titular opening gains the attention. Rest of the soundtrack seemed quite the Average.
The movie covers majority of Europe like Prague, London, Berlin, Venice which is well covered by DoP. Marvel pulls best CGI throughout its 23 Movies run after Doctor Strange.
Screenplay was okay.. No Hidden Meaning and simply written in plain text.
Zendaya as MJ drifted from conventional love interest roles. Portrayed as Smart, Strong and Non-vulnerable.
Tom Holland as Friendly Neighborhood Spider-man seemed a little too buffed up for a 16 yr old kid, portrays the role aptly but no exception.
Jake Gyllenhaal as supporting role/main antagonist was very poorly portrayed. MCU should stop starring such great superstars as Spider-man's villain.
Story as a continuation to Endgame rushes the introduction and leaves with so many open questions. Character's Development from ""Spider-man Homecoming"" is very baseless. Ir-relative. Besides the predictability in the story, it seemed fresh and well crafted.
Direction was a let down as well. Wall Crawling and Swinging Spider-man was not to be seen until the very end. Disappointed. So many characters were compromised - Flash, Maria Hill, Ned, May etc. which could've made the strong impact throughout the story - Failed.
The story re-characterizes the Billion Dollar Superhero Franchise deviating the only moral he ever stood up.

903,Xiphoner,Far from Good.,7,5 July 2019,"Obviously, the film is still entertaining to watch.It's a Marvel movie, which means insanely high production value, a massive budget, great cast, a lot of familiar faces, and well-choreographed action sequences & visual effects. So, that's a lot of boxes checked and because of those the rating is already a solid 7/10, purely due to being entertaining.But other than that, the flow of the movie is very predictable and dull, and the writing is sub-par even for a ""fun action movie"". Perhaps I would enjoy it more if I was 15 instead of 25, since a lot of the dialogues and events depicted in the film are very childish, and it seems as though the targeted audience for this one specifically was exclusively teenagers. Very corny, unoriginal & predictable writing.Despite the aforementioned lazy writing, the movie is still worth watching.

904,bcmantonya,Mediocre 7.5,7,30 October 2019,"I'm a Marvel fan. I love Tom Holland as Spiderman. But outside of a few parts of each of his standalone movies, the movies just feel rather flat and weak to me.Tom Holland is adorable and believable, genuine and strong. I appreciate that it's his strength of character that shines through. Same with Aunt May, Happy, and MJ. Everyone else felt like an extra, like a stock version of whatever character type they were paid to portray.Villians in both Spiderman movies were underwhelming. And it's disappointing because both actors are incredibly good at their craft. Again, it feels like the villians were written by some step by step process learned in acting school. No depth outside of revenge towards Tony Stark. Both felt cartoonish and unbelievable, as well as unrelatable. The tie ins to Tony Stark's background felt forced. It was done much better in Iron Man 2. Which begs the question... why are Spiderman's villians actually Stark's? Why not give Peter his own personal villains?I did like how this movie dealt with the 'blip', from the kids' perspective at least. And I liked how they dealt with Peter mourning Stark, both as a father figure and as the protector of the world. How he felt hopeless in filling Stark's shoes. How he didn't want to miss out on being a kid and enjoying his vacation and hopefully working on something with MJ. But again, I think that's more credit to Tom than necessarily the writing.The CGI was over the top. The villian was blah. The school trip in the midst of one attack after another was so far beyond belief it was ludicrous. And don't get me started on Fury. Yes, I saw that he was actually a shape shifter, but the subpar way he handled everything made it obvious it wasn't Fury for literally the whole movie.My kids love Spiderman, so I've watched these movies along side them.

Right from the beginning itself, Peter is put under tremendous pressure of filling in the shoes of Tony Stark while also trying to fit in with everybody else who were left alive by the merciless decimation.
This movie really shows how dependent Peter was on Tony or how dependent the entire MCU was on Tony and the kind of impact it had on both the good and the bad guys. His decisions, his arrogant nature form the foundation of the main conflict and the way it still leaves poignant feel.
The European setting breathes a whole new life into the MCU, which had all its fight scenes either in New York or in a CGI battlefield.
Overall, the film delivers both as a conclusion to the 23 films long Infinity Saga and also as a foundation to the unforeseeable future of the MCU.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
907,donz-8,Another fantastic Marvel movie,9,6 July 2019,"While I still enjoy the first movie (in this series) slightly better due to its more charming yet thrilling and surprising story, I was extremely satisfied with Spider Man: Far from Home. The plot was a little more predictable but the action was intense and there were plenty of laughs (yet not overdone like a few of the previous Marvel movies). The first half of the movie made me feel like I was watching a continuation of Avengers: Endgame for a short while, which was in some ways good and some ways a tad stale, but the action and story pick up in a very good way about halfway in, and from that point on, it's one heck of a ride that you don't want to miss. Having said all of this, I'm really looking forward to seeing what's next in the MCU, and the next Spider-Man film too!",Spider-Man - Far from Home
908,MaxwellFury,Good movie.,8,1 September 2019,"Direct follow up to the events of Endgame, Far From Home is both a heartfelt story and a tough one. It has poignant moments that will remain in memory. great plot and amazing CGI.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

912,ernestolindley,Spider Man in Europe!!!!!,10,4 October 2019,Simply amazing directing from John Watts. Tom Holland did his part well with filling this new kind of spider man after losing Tony Stark and continuing his journey to be strong and to fulfill Iron Man's legacy. Just the best Spidey film by far.,Spider-Man - Far from Home

914,beobnoxious,A Disneyesque rom-com sprinkled with Marvel action,8,3 July 2019,It's a bit sappy but the preteens will eat it up there's a few treats here and there thrown in the dialogue for any one over twelve.With that out of the way this movie may have some of the best writing in the genere the dots come together here the MCU gets connected it's story telling at its best even if we've heard the story before.The visuals are made for Imax or 3D absolutely stunning.Coming off of big baddies like Thanos and Dark Phoenix Spider Man Homecoming had a lot to look up to in the villain departement and it delivers.All and all a thrilling and entertaining new addition to the MCU.,Spider-Man - Far from Home
915,mats_astroem,Best Spider-man ever!,10,4 July 2019,"This movie is by far the best Spider-man movie ever, and it is up there among the best marvel movies of all time as well.
It delivers great pace, great story, an understandable story that is connected to reality although it is a superhero movie with a lot of visual effects. And I should also say that the effects are really good.I have always loved the Spider-man movies, although not so much when it was andrew garner, he's a great actor but he doesn't bring the same amount of emotions and acting as Tom Holland does. Tom Holland is as much Spider-man as hemsworth is Thor and RDJ is Iron Man. They are irreplaceable. Those are now the characters, and never should they be removed.The movies story is really good, it has depth, and emotions, and directly connects with the last marvel movie (endgame). You don't want to miss this.Also it has great humour. Thor Ragnarok had this great balance and Spider-man far from home is no exception.You must see this movie.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
916,beornmatt,Could have been a solid 8 but...,7,4 July 2019,"...JB Smoov cost it a star. His one-liners were supposed to be funny but fell absolutely flat and disrupted the pace of the dialogue. It happened enough that it was an active annoyance.Otherwise, pretty solid movie. The two post-credits scenes were spot-on; I'm still baffled that 23 movies into the MCU people still leave.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
917,originalchc,Meh,5,13 September 2019,"Too long, too much teen awkwardness, phony evil guy, too much bromance for Stark and other nonsense. I must be getting old but I do remember the first Spider Man movie to be enjoyable. This just seems like a cash cow with underdeveloped kids as the main audience. I sure hope my kids won't find this junk worth their while.So yeah, don't pay money to see this unless you want to see more of this cgi nonsense in the near future.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
918,rmachio,I'm glad people enjoyed this movie more than I did...,3,5 July 2019,"...It didn't turn me on at all. Story was goofy. Villain was boring. The movie seemed to be going for a lighthearted comedic vibe more than anything, but I don't think it worked very well. Even the special effects were blah. The actors are too old to still be playing high school kids. I look forward to them evolving spider-man from being a dorky high school kid.... This movie made me miss the old avengers crew more than anything. It almost seemed inappropriate - to soon, maybe, after End Game... Just a big miss (as opposed to a hit) overall for me.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
919,MichaelKamalEzzat,Marvel's two-hour-therapeutic session for Endgame's PTSD,8,17 October 2019,"By now , In a well established Marvel Cinematic Universe, Any Marvel Production would be a fan favorite and get a wide critical appraisal .. Far from Home makes use of this and , yet, succeeds in pushing the bar even further being the last in phase three , wrapping a semi-perfect era in a decent way .. with the friendly neighborhood spider-man far from his neighborhood with his godfather/father-figure gone against Avengers-level-threats or so they seem (literally) ,
This is a funny high school summer vacation movie with a well established funny spider-man fighting self-doubt and his own demons and proving his eligibility to become the new Iron-Man , The movie is one of many good ways to end phase three , Marvel is continuing to outdo itself in pleasing the crowds and critics alike ,
With a funny smart script ,
Jaw dropping visuals (especially that Mysterio Deceptive illusions' sequence .. Damn .. talking about Dr. Strange Open your eyes level's visuals, here) ,
Decent performances ; the movie has Jake Gyllenhaal and Samuel L. Jackson , enough said ,
An iconic villain who is a true EDITAH
(Even Dead I'm the a**-hole)
I'm sure and happy to see more of him in the future,
A GREAT Mid-credit Scene and a mind-boggling Post credit Scene ,
which is a true Cliffhanger ,
We just miss the Peter Parker/Tony Stark chemistry , The MCU is missing RDJ already .The verdict (and sorry for the messy review) :
Far from home is a decent funny super-hero movie which knows how to please fans and critics , wrapping up a semi-perfect phase in a smart fashion and subtly paving the road for Phase 4.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
920,lachlan_langbein,Same old. Well executed but so many flaws,7,26 September 2019,"A nicely put together film but A low rating as all the plots were so obvious and annoying. Bad guy obvious. And Supplier, I'd they hare holograms how could there be damage afterwards. Also Spidey's uniform caught fire ?? All this annoyed me but I must add the film looked good.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
921,maxim-delaet,"Good, yet not Great.",8,17 September 2019,"That is what I've come to expect from 90% of the Marvel movies. Some are Bad, and very few lean towards being Great.However childish the movie may feel for some, the story was perfectly fine which is not common for action movies including some of the post 2005 Marvel movies... And even if it doesn't feel very special, unique or whatever you expected it to be, you cannot deny that the directing work was decent to say the least!Most of all, my 8 out of 10 is earned by the acting in this movie.P.S.: If you are rating this movie a 1/10 you're simply having issues with it being different from what you were expecting and cannot accept that not every movie is a Stark movie. But I tell you, to be a good reviewer is to see the beauty in differences.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

923,jcucchisi-77-755989,Great sequel,8,28 July 2019,Spider-Man: Far from Home is a fun and exiting superhero movie that is never boring and super funny. Peter and Mj's relationship in the film is great and Jake Gyllenhaal is great as the villain Mysterio though his motives are not very believable. The action as always is great and Tom Holland delivers us an other great performance in a great Spider-Man film.,Spider-Man - Far from Home
924,sn3z,Entertaining blockbuster,7,22 September 2019,Hmmmm are Marvel films getting a little tedious. It's a question that keeps me awake at night. I walk to the bus thinking it and I sit on the toilet thinking it. Am I getting superhero fatigue? Probably. I am pretty old after all.Marvel's final Spider hyphen man film was a thoroughly entertaining movie though I must say. Sure the cast look nowhere the 16 year olds they are playing and sure the effects are getting a bit samey but Jake is here and he adds a lot of class.The plot has a great twist and the way the movie carries on from Endgame is done very well but then it should be. Hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of man hours means everything is going to be tight and polished and it doesn't even pander to the East Asian market like most modern blockbusters.Give it a whirl if you like this sort of thing. Blah blah blah.,Spider-Man - Far from Home
925,nukhetagar,Not my Peter,4,17 April 2021,"This movie (along with the first movie) truly destroyed what makes Peter Parker special. Peter Parker is not a whiner who will ruminate about whether he should help save the world or whether he should go to Eiffel Tower to potentially kiss a girl. Peter Parker is savvy and smart. They made him into a wimp who keeps on saying ""please grown-ups, include me in your grown up superhero stuff."" In the previous movies (ones under Sony), his character is at least preserved to some extent that you can root for him. Definitely not this movie's Spider-Man.Best part of the movie: mid credits scene. Save your time and money and just watch that. Anything else was like watching a Hannah Montana episode.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
926,robinerrin,Too much teen drama / angst,6,8 July 2019,"Really enjoyed the special effects and how Mysterio was done, HOWEVER, there is way too much teen 'crap' (drama / angst, stupid love story) that definitely detracts from the rest of the movie, and really don't like Zendaya as MJ (too 'pouty' / irritating personality). Homecoming was much better. I thought it was 'good-ish' but nowhere near all these 'amazing' reviews it's getting.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
927,Attakaay,A great write-up with a befitting visuals,8,6 July 2019,Impressive write up with matching cinematography. Absolutely loving Tom Holland as Spiderman. The way he conveys hid emotions and body posture is truly magnificent. The movie seems to prep us for some of sort surprises Marvel is planning to hit us with. No over bloating of scenes and they kept it a universal pleasing tone. Characters handled their roles perfectly well and I'm impressed. A great movie for the MCU and its fans.,Spider-Man - Far from Home
928,wescartee,What's with all the tens?,1,9 July 2019,"This movie is for children. Complete waste of time.
I'm seeing so many people review this mediocre movie with tens. The graphics were good, but cheesy acting and script. I have lost so much respect for user reviews, I honestly think they are fake reviews to build up the rating on these movie sites. The older Spider-Man movies weren't the greatest, but most definitely better than this. I'm a Jake Gyllenhaal fan, but he couldn't save this movie.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
929,santhoshunnithan,Spiderman - far from original,1,17 September 2019,"The movie sucked, remeber the good times with old Tobey maguires movies, this is an embarssment fot that, marvel has certainly spoiled this franchise also, Sony taking it back makes sense and hopefully next movies will be better. casting is also terrible except spiderman",Spider-Man - Far from Home
930,verohmarin,I will never complain about Homecoming six screenwriters ever again,7,17 July 2019,"It's so refreshing to see Spider-man: Homecoming, especially after a 30 hour marathon of the MCU where most of the battles involve world threatening villains and rays of light to the sky; and the biggest superhero of them all is so local, he's our friendly neighborhood Spider-man and stays close to the ground fighting a local villain with real intentions you can even sympathize with him. But then Far From Home rips all that and tries to duplicate the villain's motivations along with big battles that make you wonder where are the rest of the 20 superheroes that probably would fight whatever Peter doesn't want to.
I kinda blame Endgame for the weight that whatever follow up movie had to carry and all the answers it had to provide, cause that leaves us with the biggest coincidence in the MCU which is that all of Peter's friends (and family) disappeared with the snap and they returned just that they can take a random trip to Europe.
I don't think I'm satisfied with the conclusion of the Phase 3, but I don't think it would've been a great introduction to the Phase 4 either 🤷‍♀️",Spider-Man - Far from Home
931,annlyelsfirst,Rocks!,8,23 September 2019,"I had read some spoilers for this film before actually watching it when it arrived on Digital. I thought I knew everything about the movie. Turns out, this film still managed to blow me away. Don't listen to the 1/10 reviews because those people are absolute haters (or Disney trolls.) The humor is spot on, the awkward flirtation between Peter and MJ is SUPER cute, Nick Fury and Agent Hill manage to not steal the show but have an enjoyable presence in the film, and Mysterio is the best villain (outside of Thanos) since Erik Killmonger in Black Panther. This is a must-watch for any fan of the MCU and a great finale to the end of Phase 3.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
932,vinniec-53536,The Best Live-Action Spider-Man Movie Yet!,10,8 July 2019,"In 'Spider-Man: Far From Home', your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man goes on vacation! The film follows Peter Parker and his classmates/friends as they travel abroad on a school trip to Europe, but as we all know, evil doesn't take a holiday! I don't wanna talk too much about the plot, because there are some twists and reveals that I do NOT wanna give away, but what I WILL say is that the story is very fun and engaging. The European setting is a welcome change of scenery from New York City, where all of the Spider-Man films have taken place. 'Far From Home' is a perfect mix of 'feel-good vacation movie' and 'comic book movie', and I honestly felt like I was right there on vacation with them. I've seen some people say that the first half is a little slow, but I don't have any problems with the pacing. There's a lot of comedy in the movie, and it's hilarious! A few jokes fall flat, but most of them made me laugh out loud. Pretty much every character gets at least one comedic moment to shine, which is nice. The action is exhilarating, and the visual effects are some of the best I've ever seen. There are a few scenes that feel like they were ripped straight out of a Spider-Man comic, and the film takes advantage of it's international setting to produce some incredible action set pieces. Three scenes in particular are in my Top 5 scenes in any Spider-Man movie. The characters are all very likeable, and each one brings something unique and special to the film. The acting is fantastic from the entire cast, but Tom Holland (Peter Parker/Spider-Man), Jake Gyllenhaal (Quentin Beck/Mysterio), and Zendaya (MJ) really steal the show. In my opinion, 'Far From Home' cements Tom Holland as the definitive live-action Peter/Spidey. Jake's Mysterio is PERFECT, and has become one of my all-time favorite cbm (comic book movie) characters. I love how they made Mysterio feel modern and realistic, yet stayed true to the source material at the same time. As for MJ, I wasn't crazy about her in 2017's 'Spider-Man: Homecoming', but after 'Far From Home', she might just be my favorite live-action Spidey love interest. They really fleshed out her character in this film, and she had much more depth and personality. Zendaya has phenomenal chemistry with Holland, and it shows on-screen. I'm very much looking forward to seeing their relationship grow and evolve in future installments of the franchise. Another thing I really love is the music, which compliments the film perfectly. Overall, 'Spider-Man: Far From Home' takes everything I love about it's predecessor, 'Spider-Man: Homecoming', and improves upon it, while fixing a lot of problems people (not me) have with it. It's fun, funny, action-packed, visually stunning, heartfelt: everything I could want in a Spider-Man movie, which is why it's definitely my favorite live-action Spidey feature yet! If you're looking for the perfect summer movie, I HIGHLY suggest you web-swing to your nearest movie theater and go see 'Spider-Man: Far From Home'!",Spider-Man - Far from Home
933,D4mnDaniel,After rewatching all Spider-man saga I finally understand that Far From Home is perfect movie for nickelodeon.,6,28 August 2019,"First of all, I'm huge Spidey fan, I like Tom Holland, he is perfect as Peter Parker and as Spidey and FFH really great movie, but I don't like what's going right now in this universe compared to the other Spidey movies. I see that Jon Watts doesn't bother the superhero stuff and he want to do what he can do best - teen comedy. You all know that bad trip Mysterio what a damn bad ass scene but the other things sucks and it sucks so much that is actually..... hmm embarrassing? Jon Watts really has no excitement to play with setting, no entertaining fight scenes, it feels like some random dudes made action scenes because they needed to put somewhere the superhero stuff. But who cares when the last fight in the movie about Spider-Man and Mysterio was fight with drones. Is this what Spidey deserves? REALLY? It would be ok if it was creative. With London's awesome architecture you can give something cool but no. The CGI Spidey jumping around the drones is ""much cooler"". No improvements after Homecoming. Tom's Peter as was a little and pretty Mary Sue, as it is now. It was ok in prequel, like they changed uncle Ben to Tony Stark and he showed what is really like to be hero. It was ok in crossovers. But it's not ok to watch in the second time these ""little pretty teens problems"" within universe are impossible. Peter Parker is a legendary character with own drama, own story and with big scale. But Tom's Parker is just a Tony Starks little filler which looking at all pretends nothing. For two movies he didn't made something significant as character, all his decisions doesn't feels like it was made by human. It feels like decisions was made by figure to match canon or something because they seek to be likable all categories of viewers which is disgusting. Like remember Andrew Garfield performance in Spidey, you could praise or hate him or make atleast some kind attitude for what decisions he made because his Parker had an actual personality with his own attribute who could cry, kick some ass, make mistakes by emotional dullness. I believe some will say like ""bUt tOmS sPIdEy only 16 yEArs old aNd aFtEr 20 MILLION MOVIES THEY WILL SHOW TRUE DRAMA 18+"" mmm... I believe this some kind insane level and let me give you some examples about Spider-Man first years from another universe(15-17 years old)Most recent one Insomniac Marvel's Spider-Man for PS4 (15 years old P.Parker) Even games takes place after 8 years old Spider work, games still mentions the early stages of his superhero stuff. 15 years old boy for a trash talk with katana takes a hit right to the liver with love from 200kg Wilson Fisk a.k.a. main criminal boss in NYC. After that, half death collapsed on girlfriends yard and probably would died if she didn't steal dads car to take him to the hospital which was first time in the practice.15 years old Ultimate Spider-Man. After uncle Ben death Parker always came back home literally dying with broken face, bullet wounds. Was mentally plagued by best friend dad who almost sewed his girlfriend and knew his personality and after his stupidity revealing personality to Fisk who first of all broken kid's face with his comrades, removed the mask and roasted a young boy who had tears in the eyes, Fisk was threatening that he will do his surroundings right in the ahole. After that, holding his throat threw away from multi-storey building. And yes, after that he still going to school while mentally crushed.17 years old Tobey - nothing to say here, you all saw it with your own eyes lol. Everything happens after spiders bite. Uncle Ben death, surviving the legendary Willem Dafoe who first of all kidnapped aunt May, ""had fun"" with Mary Jane. Then Peter almost get slaughtered by glider. In conclusion, greeny died in front of Peter and yet completing his request ""that concerns Harry"". Remember Peter's look at moment when camera zooms right to the face with torn mask. Damn.17 years old Andrew Garfield - Well you know already. Starter pack with uncle Ben, the crazy lizard who has the only connection with his missing father, and the captain Stacy who right before death asked leave his family alone.So, do you know what all they have in common? BALLS! FRICKIG BALLS! But not just fricking balls, but the balls of a youngster. This dudes don't even got a tip, a help or a lesson that lead to the right decision. The only lessons that they learned is in school while they got they ass kicked by psychopaths where experienced cop would be already hiding under the bed. Most important, is the first lesson that Parker gave to itself when cried over uncle Ben body. Parker never was a perfect superhero AND a man version of Mary Sue. Parker always made mistakes even in the obvious one and what is important he always faced the responsibility. Even he was doing his best, still he was making everything worse. And that's how he was learning from his OWN mistakes because he faced a serious consequences. You screwed up? Here's the sword on your chest. Screwed up again? Look that's Gwen Stacy laying death on your hands. Once again? Look without the mask when tomorrow fatty with his friends pay a visit to your aunt. He cried, he was broke, but still tried to hold the situation on his hands, he fought throught his last breath to do right thing. And what important he did all alone, without no help. He was making own decisions to do that or another and he doesn't care what the hell Nick Fury is saying or another authority d***. If Parker have opportunity to do something with his own hands, he will do it because he is a young boy with strong wills. And that's his thing.The beginning of Spider-Man story it's not a funny gatherings, it's a dramatic story of a young boy who solo tries to change much in adult world, who doesn't have lucky ticket dropping from him consequences and responsibility. This is why I love Spidey. But now what happens in MCU, it sucks, feels like Marvel doesn't care, they like spare Parker, making a smooth transition for growing up which contradicts idea that understood Raimi, Webb and even Sony. Take away from Parker determination, responsibility for his actions and wish to help people on antinative world, it's just a school boy who climbs the walls.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
934,columbusbuck,Off Target,5,11 July 2019,"I thought the Gyllenhaal character was corny, Spidey taking selfies too out of character for a selfless hero, and the Fury twist really unnecessary. Tom Holland continues to be a charming presence, though.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Its only show a glimpse of the world post endgame. Shouldnt they end the phase with something more conclusive?This movie should have been titled spider-BOY 2. Peter parker in his own movie is such a whiny and mess up character. A boy with a normal friend (zed), never experience real bully, never experience to be different from other (he is not the only nerd in there), easily get the attention from the girl she like. Is this peter parker?Some of the action scenes is so irritating to watch, guns and cannons is fired, theres explosion everywhere but no ones really hurt. even this spiderboy only got a few bruises. Like... really?
The plot isnt really good, you can even say tony make his own villain again. like... come on...
And the last battle scene with mysterio is so dissapointing, all the MC got to do is close his eyes? Like wth?
All the mambo jambo suit making, and in the end it serve nothing. He only add parachute and 1 time use e-bomb.

The plot is nonsense. The climax scene is laughable. The suit making does nothing in the end.,Spider-Man - Far from Home
938,indyshafa,Better than expected,8,7 July 2019,"To be honest, I've never interested in Marvel/the Avengers. Never bothered to keep up. Saw MCU as kind of 'overhyped', so when I decided to watch this, I wasn't expecting anything extravagant. And truthfully, when I rethink the whole script and plot, it's not too mindblowing. Classic ""hero's maturity/turning point"" kind of thing. However, the part where Happy said Tony Stark had never doubted his choice of choosing Peter-that really warmed my heart. Also, Mysterio had been fishy since the beginning. Either Peter's really that dumb not to notice how literally no one minded the fact that Quentin had his armored suit on when Mysterio was literally Talk of the World on TV at that moment or the scriptwriters just decided to play along with it because, hell, why not. Even when Peter had confirmed the transfer of EDITH to Quentin, he already sort of broke character? Like, from good guy to true bad guy self. Peter's kind of, really, oblivious. Even for a sixteen year old teenager. Even so, I was amazed by the usage of technology displayed in the movie-it was really cool and amazing. The holographic projections, Peter constructing a new suit for himself, everything. The presence of Peter's bestfriend's relationship with the blonde girl (I forgot their names, sorry!) was a good choice. Peter and MJ's relationship was sort of cute too. Made me laugh quite a few times. Also, I like how even non-fans can still enjoy the movie. I mean, I'm a non-fan and still enjoyed. However... I managed to fall in love with Tom Holland through this movie. Might no longer be a non-fan after all... Huh. Didn't see that one coming. The cast did a really good job with their acting.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

So if you are not much of a Marvel fan boy and just want to watch a fun movie this is the movie for you and your family. It might be a little predictable for those who really follows the MCU and comics but I guarantee that you will enjoy it.The comedy, action, acting and everything else is great. There may be times when you might question some decisions of the characters but you will realize why soon enough, so save your criticism and watch till the end.

It had all the DNA of the old Spiderman cartoons and had the feel of a comic book story.The CGI was stunning and the storyline worked perfectly.With some kickass action a great Spiderman/Peter Parker and an actual bad villain this is now my favourite Spiderman movie.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

947,djp1997,Strange dichotomy,7,20 December 2019,"One one hand the film portrays the awkwardness and discomfort of youth extremely well but on the other hand requires a massive suspension of belief (waaay beyond the normal suspension of belief required for a film of this genre). Tom Holland and Zendaya are impressive in capturing the angst and uncertainty of teenage life and are bright spots and rising stars! However, we are expected to believe a bunch of disgruntled ex-employees (all wrongfully terminated megalomaniacs?) have banded together to create the most realistic, immersive holographic technology that must have cost millions upon millions of dollars all to do what? Hoodwink a teenager into giving up some other tech that they probably should have not known existed in the first place? Couldn't they just have sold their system and retired as a bunch of billionaires? Wouldn't that have been the ultimate ""in your face"" to Tony Stark? And hasn't this plot line already been explored in a similar fashion with Edward Nygma in the Batman franchise? It just feels like covering old ground and lazy writing. Don't get me wrong, the film is fun and visually stunning but the plot seems contrived and Spider-Man is conveniently chosen to shoehorn in out of necessity to drive a weak story along.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

The first thing you're going to notice about this film is the humour and VFX simultaneously. Tom Holland who played Spiderman, Jake Gyllanhaal who played Mysterio were out and out great with their acting. This movie is probably a great end to the MCU phase 3, because of many reasons which you should surely check out in 3D in your nearest theater.
Buck worthy, fun watch, gripping and this will movie doesn't let you forget about the Avengers.
'Far From Home' revolves mainly around Europe and it's countries. But does Spiderman still show up there with the same zeal is the question?
For the answer, stop reading reviews and just go watch it.

This movie doesn't do any of this. Not only that, but they also force comedy in every second possible, turning their movies into badly written sitcoms. They did that with Thor: Ragnarok and did the same with this movie.I did not go into detail because it would have been a 10 pages long of review of how they failed to pull the movie together. but overall it's just a mess.A 5/10 just for the entertaining and rewatchable values.

955,ThePeruvianPost,Terrible! Spider-Man still dwells on Stark in order to provide his own instalment!,6,19 July 2019,"After nearly seventeen years of watching Tobey Maguire at the screenplay while performing the unforgettable teenage-so-timid Peter Parker I deduced one thing: If you want to make a successful franchise, you require more than a prestigious cast and a big budget to finance either the visual effects or some other features, that is called straightforwardness. I am afraid this 2019 sequel did not attain it whatsoever. It hardly reminds me about the failure Iron Man 3 signified after portraying the first superhero epic crossover the year before: The Avengers.The names are changed indeed, after watching the poignant finale of the Avengers we start with the left foot due to the incapability of director Jon Watts in providing the audience a calmer-yet-satisfying Spider-Man experience. If the prequel demonstrated a Peter Parker getting involved in The Avengers, learning more about responsibility and showing Tony Stark the maturity it involves to be great, then the sequel melts the inner frustration young Peter has, awkward high-technology he masters in a matter of seconds, the sixth vengeance -which means taking into account his trilogy, Age of Ultron and Homecoming- of someone associated with Iron Man and the redundant Iron-Man-sacrificed-his-life fact. Overall, we see the manner a sequel becomes confusing and sometimes frustrating because of its formula. It is true we do have to comprehend the continuity in order to fully-understand the meaning of the movie, however, it goes beyond repeating because usually someone from the cast reminds you the snap, the Stark technology, etc. Moreover, the laughs and the sense of humour are only based on adolescent-affairs such as love, social media, stupidity. The superhero is just lost with a great deal of subplots. Furthermore, the sentimental thing is probably the most simulated of all the Spider-Mans ever appeared on the theatres. Andrew Garfield at least made such a delightful chemistry with Emma Stone to the point they ended up being a couple for some years, Tobey and Kristen made the same with the treasured up-down kiss. Tom Holland seems way distant with Zendaya whom, by the way, did not find any attractive during the first movie, at the contrary, he and his buddy Ned mocked at her clumsiness.Even though MCU might not have made the right moves with this instalment, at least it stands as an entertaining, daze-looking flick for common viewers. Still, at its times, feels a little disappointing. (63/100)",Spider-Man - Far from Home
956,iizthatiiz,Spider-Man: Far away from Spider-Man,6,18 September 2019,"""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" is a somewhat competent addition to the MCU, though with lots and lots of problems. Way too much homage was paid to the irritable Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man. I was pleased to see Jon Favreau's Happy Hogan play a prominent role. After all, Favreau as director of Iron Man 1 was a key constructor of the MCU, and Happy Hogan, an underutilized character within the franchise.In this current ASM iteration, Marisa Tomei remains 40 years way too young as Aunt May, and Uncle Ben remains non-existent as the crucial factor who propelled Peter Parker into becoming Spider-Man. After four appearances in the MCU, I still cannot buy into this revisionist version of the Amazing Spider-Man. Whatever the original Sony trilogy of Spider-Man films got wrong, they did get the Stan Lee/Steve Ditko beginnings of the character very right, in ways that the MCU has completely failed.In the MCU, everything we see about Peter Parker is just wrong. His relationship to Aunt May and Uncle Ben is wrong, Mary Jane Watson is wrong. Flash Thompson is wrong. J. Jonah Jameson is wrong. Where is Gwen Stacy? Everything about the origins of this character is just effing wrong. In the MCU, Peter Parker/Spider-Man is the creation of Tony Stark's Iron Man, and THAT is a complete betrayal of the character.Moving on to the events of the film, the introduction and reveal of Mysterio is well played. Despite all the errors within the MCU of the Peter Parker/Spider-Man character, we still get a satisfying film. The action sequences, the CGI are competent. The storyline progresses within the film logically, aside from an end credit scene that blows the entire film into disarray.All that is missing from this feature is the characters as originally developed by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. They are nowhere to be found.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

966,whippan,Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019),8,6 July 2019,"Spider-Man: Far from Home follows Peter Parker (Tom Holland) as he and his high-school classmates embark on a school vacation across Europe. While abroad, Peter is forced to grapple with his position as Tony Stark's successor in a post-Avengers: Endgame MCU, and his desire to just be a ""normal"" teenager. While on paper that may sound like another retread of Spider-Man's eternal ""with great power comes great responsibility"" conundrum, it largely feels fresh here thanks to its perfectly cast ensemble (especially Tom Holland as Spider-Man, Zendaya as MJ, and Jake Gyllenhaal as Quentin Beck/Mysterio). Far from Home is brimming with a youthful energy, and features a few of the most elaborately-constructed action set-pieces ever before seen in a Spider-Man film. By the time the credits rolled, I was already anticipating the next chapter in Peter's adventure, and by that fact alone, Spider-Man: Far from Home is an easy recommendation.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

969,JordanMccPhoto,"A little predictable, but endlessly entertaining.",9,1 July 2019,"Spider-Man: Far From Home is as close to a perfect action comedy movie I've seen. While the story beats are a little predictable, it avoids any of the glaring flaws Endgame had. As a result it's one of the most interesting and fun movies I've seen in a while.Holland and Gyllenhaal both do a fantastic job. At this point Holland has such an amazing grasp on his character, he has turned Peter Parker from a character into a real person. Gyllenhall, as always, brings a layered performance as Mysterio, which leads to one of the most interesting supporting characters in their universe.The comedy was spot on. I can't recall a single joke that fell flat. It has the same goofy atmosphere as Homecoming, without taking away from the story. While the story didn't move at a breakneck speed like Infinity War, I never found myself bored, which is more than I can say for Endgame. I never felt like the film was just spinning its wheels, every scene served a purpose.If I had to give any kind of critique it would be that the story beats, as mentioned above, are a little predictable. I didn't watch a single trailer or read anything about the movie. Other than knowing Holland and Gyllenhaal were in it, I went in completely blind. However, even without any information about the movie I was able to predict the outcome and motivations about 10 or 15 minutes into the movie. It didn't ruin the movie, but it meant I wasn't surprised or shocked by any story beats, but I'm not entirely sure that I was supposed to be.The only other small critiques is that not everything needs to be 2 hours. I was thoroughly entertained for those 2 hours, but it's something Marvel should take into consideration for their movies without the same level of writing and acting. Also, while it fit the story, the introduction of even more Spider-Man suits came across as a desire for more toy merchandise. However, the fit well enough into the story.One final thing. The mid credit scene was both funny and left me excited to see where this franchise goes next. Also, there is a character introduction that I think every fan of Spider-Man has been waiting to see on screen again.
Kudos to the filmmakers for knowing how to adapt that character to the modern age, and for choosing the only person who can do them justice. I haven't smiled that much in a movie theater in a while.If you're a fan of Spider-Man or Marvel, this one is a must see.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

977,kennybelliveau15,Visually Ambitious and Amazing MCU entry.,9,21 July 2019,"Tom Holland was the man tasked with bringing Peter Parker to life for the third time on the big screen while keeping him fresh. Homecoming brought him back to where he belonged and Far From Home placed him as the key piece moving forward.With this being the first MCU film post Thanos it was expected the film would mention the fallout. It did so while also quickly moving the world forward and in comes Quentin Beck, the man of the hour. The man responsible for ridding the world of its newest threat the elementals. Gyllenhaal was great. He added layers and while the reveal was predictable it did feel genuine thanks to his ability to sell it so well.However despite the impressive visuals the heart of the film was with Peter and MJ and the chemistry shared between Holland and Zendaya. The affects are cool with the elements coming into play Peters powers evolving but it his teen crush on MJ that adds depth and reminds us that Peter is a 16 year old kid still with all this pressure. It is what seperates Holland and his counterparts and the side story of MJ deciphering it before Peter could tell her gave Zendaya some comedic power in this film. She is a great young actress and displays a lot through her reactions. With Zendaya it's not all about delivering the key line it's about an expression through body language and facial movement. It adds a level often overlooked in comic book films. The human element.While it is easy to get lost in such a great villainous portrayal like Gyllenhaals a film like this is not complete without a supporting cast that brings it all together. Jackson of course is his usual self and it was nice to see Cobie Smulders get some screentime. Tony Revelori is the comedic relief as Flash Thompson who is less of a bully and definitely more of a spoiled rich kid. His juxtaposed opinions of Spider-Man and Peter add a fun little running joke that may be over thanks to my favorite moment of the film. The return of J.K Simmons as J.Jonah Jameson who dropped yet another Bomb on Peter and his family.It was a great movie with a smooth story and very ambitious visuals thanks to the Illusions that Mysterio was creating and the level to which those were taken during the final act when being used against Peter.The Post Tony Stark Era has just begun and is off to a solid start thanks to Tom Holland and Zendaya. Tony your presence will forever be felt but this is a new era and phase 4 is going to one hell of a ride.It has a different feel to it than previous Spider-Man endeavours. There is a trust factor that is handed over by audiences to the powers that be at Marvel and so far they have delivered a very energetic and ambitious Spider-Man series for the MCU.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
978,ralfberserk,Your expectations will NOT be exceeded,6,18 July 2019,"This movie has fun moments specially when the story digs in the teenager awkward situation jokes and the classic stereotypes of the classic hillbilly hill American tourists embarrassing themselves in Europe. Besides that, it's very predictable, acting is poor by a majority of characters including some of the main ones. The MJ character has zero charisma and she always acts one character: the stone faced ankward antisocial teenager and the developing love feelings between her and Spider-Man feel forced and artificial.

This movie takes place right after the events of Endgame.This film blends nicely with the audience with raw humour, CGI battles and great special effects. Judging by the aspect of pacing, it's way better than ""Homecoming"", but the third act of the film is what really makes it worth watching. With full on entertainment the film accomplishes what it needs to do but it left us wishing for a more satisfying conclusion of all the good pieces. Overall it is a wholesome high school teen comedy disguised as a superhero film which really sets up the stage for the next era of the MCU.

988,garycofield,"No, no, no",6,10 July 2019,"I really love Holland as Spider-Man. He's great as Peter Parker. But my issues with this iteration lie entirely in the creative direction of the films. Marvel has done so much to ""reinvent"" Peter Parker and his alter ego, he might as well be a completely different person in the solo outings we've seen. As someone who reads the comics, I can't tell you how many aspects were copied from Miles Morales and his Spider-Man.I don't dislike Zendaya as Michelle, I mean ""MJ"" (a not-so clever change of name from Homecoming to Far from Home) but what is this? Who is she *supposed* to be, really?People absolutely hated Ultimate Spider-Man (the animated series), Marvel was 1000% aware of this, so they completely rebooted the animated Spider-Man. But then, they went and placed the MCU's Spider-Man under SHIELD, giving him suits and missions, which felt completely awkward, and completely took away from Parker's solo life & identity. Which brings me to another point.In Homecoming, Peter only really worried about his friends. He stated this on numerous occasions. In Far from Home, he only cared about his trip, and getting to spend time with Michelle. While the latter was more in line with Peter's usual motives, there's never *really* any good, hard, solid reason why he chooses to don the costume. I mean, sure, The Avengers can't do everything, especially in recent times. But why does that create a dilemma for Parker? I never really feel as if it's his responsibility in these films. Even if he did look up to Tony Stark (now deceased), why do these things become Peter's responsibility? I'm just not sold on these movies. I'm 100% sure this lack of danger & responsibility is the reason they chose to reveal Peter's identity. It's literally the only thing that could've put fire underneath him as who he is. It was an easy cop out.This trilogy for me has been one and done (completely fine with one viewing) up to this point. These movies don't give me anything to look forward to, everything is just an easy mess made to look pretty.I think writers wrote the MCU into a hole with the masterpiece that was Infinity War. As incredible as that film was, I think it put the world and it's heroes into a state that was too shattered to fix itself by any other means other than the easiest possible turnouts to cause turmoil.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1008,cinemaloversclub,Locationally-Diverse with a More-Accurate Spider-Man and Perfect Mysterio,8,2 July 2019,"Locationally-diverse with a better + more-accurate (independent) Spidey, stunning VFX, personal-growth arcs, romance with a softer MJ, & brilliant Gyllenhaal Mysterio, FFH corrects most of Homecoming's flaws for a fresh web-slinging European adventure. 8.6/10....Review: Far From Home. When the title first leaked after a dust-filled Infinity War cliffhanger, theories flooded the internet of a possible dusky, orange-hued backdrop for our web-slinging hero. They went a different route tipping his return in a light-hearted trip to Europe, complete with a new suit and one of Peter's most famous rogues: Mysterio. After the disappointment of Homecoming to true Spidey fans (cringy-humored Iron Man's lackey, a *far*-cry from comics Spider-Man. 4.2/10), I was intrigued to see this dramatically-different direction they took one of my overall-favorite heroes (and easily favorite Marvel hero) in. They did not disappoint in this fresh, different take on the character. Locationally-diverse with a better + more-accurate (independent) Spidey, stunning VFX, personal-growth arcs, romance with a softer MJ, & brilliant Gyllenhaal Mysterio, FFH corrects most of Homecoming's flaws for a fresh web-slinging European adventure.Far From the cringy tone of the first with a stronger, more-accurate Spider-Man. Perhaps the thing I appreciated most of all is that Holland and the crew clearly listed to fan criticism to correct most of Homecoming's flaws. Spider-Man is actually (*gasp*) independent and able to do things on his own, with spectacular acrobatics and power sorely lacking in the aforementioned original. Gone is RDJ talking down to Marvel's greatest hero like he's his own personal donkey and smartly-twisted is his presence to that of inspiration and aspiration more in-tune with the character we all know from the comics as almost a makeshift Uncle Ben (still have no idea where he's been without mention two films in.. but I digress). The tone is also far improved to become more wondrous and mature, keeping the light-heartedness awkwardness that made Holland such a hit in Civil War but with less cringy jokes like ""P*nis Parker"" - a step in the right direction growing just as its titular hero is.Romance-centric with personal-growth and a softer MJ. Another smart decision taking into account fan backlash was MJ. Zendaya is still a questionable choice for MJ looking absolutely *nothing* like the redhead version sacred to the character of Spider-Man, but at least she's less offending and dark/sarcastic spouting conspiracy theorist and feminist tropes looking visibly angry every frame for no reason. She exudes a much calmer air about her, and even actually (*gasp*) smiles every once in a while for an MJ that (although still not accurate) is at least rootable in romance with Peter that gains some happy traction towards the end even swinging through the city together (+ Ralph and Aunt May's flings too!). Peter's personal growth arcs are great too having to face that time-honored hero's parable of choosing between heroics and happiness in personal life more pronouncedly than the first.Locationally-diverse with an innovative plot choice. Perhaps FFH's biggest selling point is its innovative decision to base all the (thrilling) action in a place we're not used to: Europe. It was extremely refreshing to see the spectacular landscapes of a Venetian Canals or London Bridge or Netherlands tulip gardens instead of the same old NYC buildings-backdrop used for most superhero movies and blockbusters. Perhaps this will fuel interest for more diverse filming outside of places like Georgia as Hollywood finally comes to a more world-friendly realization: hey, there are so many more-spectacular places to see outside of the U.S. too! The plot choice and screenwriting motif of a superhero going on vacation is also smart being an angle not often explored and making for some hilarious gags like the 8-hour plane ride and tourist-y Instagram Stories.The VFX work and Mysterio. Finally, Mysterio. Oh boy, what a twist. I came in ready to hate Mysterio for their anti-villain/actual-hero rewrite from the trailers, but I was so happy to be wrong. The plot twist for his true motives and theatricality reality-distortion is absolutely STUNNING. The VFX when he sends Spider-Man through the darkest recesses of his own psyche to psychoanalyze him and twist him around so many times he doesn't even know what's real: unbelievable. It's also cinematically-impressive both in innovative camerawork and special FX making all this imaginative dystopia come to life, and giving a behind-the-scenes glimpse into film direction it's intriguing to see fourth-wall while also hinting a veiled critique at big-shots often overlooking the small guys' contributions with call-backs to multiple MCU film from Civil War all the way back to Iron Man 1.Flaws in Far From Home include some minor MCU humor, major plot holes, and strange post-credits scene again failing to capitalize on the finality of ending an entire phase of 23 films. Although the humor is thankfully toned down and more serious with the jokes it does place more-hitting on non-silly themes, a couple of cracks show through like the infamous ""peter-tingle"" (because funny words are funny) mentioned about 1,000x for giggles it does not succeed in getting. The film creates some massive plot holes as well (just like Endgame's time travel problematic writing) like the whole 'Blip' situation and where exactly they were all that time while the rest of the world aged, plus why when Spidey gets E.D.I.T.H. back (if they make Peter the face of the franchise for Phase 2 like RDJ was in Phase 1, I will sincerely apologize for ever complaining about HC/FFH) from Beck she obeys his commands even though to transfer control earlier there was an entire initiation/transfer ritual?Finally, that post-credits scene (2nd one. First one was wild and sets up an interesting trilogy closing for Spidey) was weird and makes little sense being while again failing to close the Infinity Saga with finality or a concrete look at what's coming in Phase 2 - give us an X-Men or (true) Eternals glimpse already, WTF. It's a messy, unsatisfying way to close the Infinity Saga I'm again not sure why they didn't just close with (END)game when FFH has little to do with the rest of the films and Endgame was perhaps the best MCU film to date....Summary: Overall, Far From Home is far from the comparative mess that was Homecoming. Locationally-diverse with a better + more-accurate (independent) Spidey, stunning VFX, personal-growth arcs, romance with a softer MJ, same spot-on Tom Holland Peter, & brilliant Gyllenhaal Mysterio, FFH corrects most of Homecoming's flaws for a fresh web-slinging European adventure that feels more like a Spider-Man film - and is amongst the best of them to date.Overall Score: 8.6/10",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1009,kchikwete,That was fun but...,7,8 August 2019,"As a marvel movie Spider-man FFH does the Job and follows the usual formula self aware jokes, easter eggs, hints of upcoming movies and events etc, final fight filled with cut and paste goons you know it ticks the boxes.
As a spider-man movie not so much. Spider-mans main theme is with great power comes great responsibility and this spidey is so irresponsible!!! This might come from the lack of the uncle Ben dying because he didnt stop a crime even though he had the power to and realizing the sacrifices n price of being a hero.

Regardless I went on it in cinema with a friend. The movie started off very good, the first 70 minutes there was a good flow in nice pictures, good story, romance etc. It was also entertaining and I liked it very much. After 70 minutes the movie started going a bit downhill still being good. A lot of good characters that makes it fun with good acting, however I think the main actor playing Spider Man and the to be girlfriend does not act in the best way at a few places witch dragged the movie down a little.

1017,danielbiland,"Unexpectedly Good Film, Closer to a 6 though.",7,21 July 2019,"I had no high hopes for this film, but it turned out to be actually pretty good.Tom Holland is good, and Jake Gyllenhaal is very good in this film. The cinematography is pretty good in some parts, the wit and jokes land pretty well. The villain, Mysterio, is done in a way that goes beyond the call of duty in some interesting ways. The way he manipulates and controls reality makes both Peter and the audience question the reality of the film after the first 'fight' (if you could call it that). The way the villain is toned is perfect in my opinion. He is both scarily intimidating and quite lighthearted. A villain much better than Thanos in Endgame, but that's a review for another time.The final confrontation between Spider-Man and Mysterio is done in a pretty interesting and outside the box way. That brings this film to a good space in my eyes. If you couldn't tell by now, the villain is the main thing that makes the film good, though the movie is still kinda decent on it's own.Overall, Far From Home is a good film that is worth a watch if you want a Marvel film that does something a little different and goes beyond the call of duty a bit. Also, a better movie than Endgame in my opinion.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1018,Comicfilmnerd,Amazing CGI!,10,19 August 2019,I would love to watch again due to the dynamic nature of the story. The use of Mysterio and introduction of the multiverse idea has given me hopes for future films. I'd love to see where the next Spider-Man film takes place and which story-line the ideas are taken from due to the ending as where the Spider-Man's alter ego of Peter Parker is released. Spider-Man is shown through a whole new light as the next Iron Man and Tony Stark. 10/10. Excellent movie and would totally recommend.,Spider-Man - Far from Home

1020,tryniti987,Spiderman: Far From Good,3,26 July 2019,"I am highly disappointed. Spiderman was one of my favorites growing up as a child in the early 90's. I would put this one next to the third Sam Raimi spiderman. It was pretty bad, and that hurts me to say because I love zendaya and marisa tomei. Aunt may's casting has been a struggle for me for a long time with this rendition, it's very hard for me to picture her as anything but over 50 years old. Plot and character development were completely non existent in this film. They tried to mash everything in to this film with so little time. The reality is that this film should have been three hours long. Instead it was just hyper focused on spiderman trying to talk to MJ, just to reveal she pretty much already knew who he was and had a crush on him, which we was revealed in the trailers, so we already knew this going in. I didn't much like Garfield's portrayal of Spiderman either, but both of his films were better than this movie.Pros:

Acting was very goodCons:
Casting of Aunt May and MJ
Character development

Although I get upset when I think about how a movie with a huge budget can be flawed and that those flaws are overlooked. Don't they watch the movie before it hits the theatre?The flaws that bothered me the most were the fact that when Peter puts on his EDITH glasses, he can read all the info there is about the person he's looking at. But when he puts in on and looks at Beck, EDITH fails to mention that he was a former STARK employee and therefore not from an alternate universe.A smaller flaw is when Peter is in Jail in the Netherlands. He is surrounded by real Dutch actors who first great him in Dutch and who talk about a pregnancy in Dutch. But when Peter breaks the lock and the Dutch prison guard hears it. He yells: ""Are you guys okay?""to his fellow countrymen instead of saying it in Dutch. I know it is a small flaw but why they don't spot this is beyond me.Nonetheless, it's still an enjoyable movie.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1022,s-ireland,Did other reviewers see the same movie as I?,5,18 July 2019,This after Endgame? This Spider-Man outing was pure popcorn I'm afraid - yes some good moments some humour & some action but what was lacking was story. It was truth be told a bit lame & it detracted from the overall film leaving this reviewer underwhelmed & at times bored. Action without reason is pointless,Spider-Man - Far from Home
1023,Impsman,Enjoyable but forgettable,7,2 July 2019,"Spiderman Far from Home picks up Marvels business a few months after the end of Endgame . The figure of Iron Man looms large in this story despite the characters demise with much time spent on Peter dealing with that loss coupled with how Tony seemed to identify Peter as his natural successor in the role of planet guardian.
The film itself is plotted around Peter and his friends taking a short whistle stop tour of Europe which coincides with dangers presented by a group of monsters called the Elementals and the introduction of the character of Mysterio, a name familiar to Spiderman comic book readers.There are several parts of this film which work really well. Primarily this involves the character of Mysterio. The key to this is again casting with Gyllenhaal being fantastic in the part. The trailers made much of his heroic side, but comic book readers will know how this story pans out and this change of emphasis at the mid point shows how good an actor he is. His motives are also very nicely linked in to previous films in the Marvel canon with several call backs to scenes from Iron Man and Civil War which shows how much attention Marvel pay to their product.
Other performances were on the whole fine with Holland growing into the role as the film progresses. The older actors in the cast do much with relatively short screen time though less time spent with the two accompanying teachers would have been preferable as their 'comedic' performances grated on me.
The scenes with the younger actors dragged a little for me but I suspect that is more to do with my age than anything else as they will appeal to younger viewers. They also reminded me of the John Hughes films of the 80's which I personally detest but I know others will disagreeSo overall Spiderman Far from Home is a fun enjoyable film and far removed from the tone of Endgame. It's perfectly fine and will do well at the box office but isn't one which will remain long in the memory compared to other Marvel films over the past decade.It does provide 2 post credit scenes which show where Marvel are going in the future and the return of one actor to a role within them will make everyone smile",Spider-Man - Far from Home

He's still that, you know from bbk till now - JG.
Tom is great, I don't know maybe too many fans of him praised him from long long ago, and I was impressed? But he really IS great. I like his humble(?) look/attitude(?) and done a great job.
Favreau is another I specially got impressed guy in this movie. Maybe bc he looks humored(?)
So the whole movie is good, despite I don't like the tourism-heroic formula, I don't like the VR story, basically I seems don't like anything, but I thought the rest of them are all good. Hmm.. the monster figure is not good....no I can't think of it in case more and more elements I dont like. But to be honest, I really feel the movie is good.
Last but not least, the memoriam at the beginning in the students' broadcast TV is the most moving and unforgettable thing in the movie, and it is the basis of the whole time in some way.

1034,Scott27,Good But No Classic,7,2 October 2019,"While good movies that stand on their own, what Homecoming and Far From Home fail to capture is the personal connection of the Spider-Man saga. S1 & S2 made everything personal to Peter, using Spider-Man as a plot device and manifestation of Peter's personal struggles. They were intimate and compelling, and while Tom Holland provides a great adolescent spin on the character, the story never feels too personal. Both of these latest spidey films seem too preoccupied with keeping the connection to the Avengers/MCU and won't let the character stand on his own.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

I LIKED it (that means it was good), but I was still a little disappointed because I LOVE Spider-Man and felt like it just lacked something. With that said I was definitely going to see this movie at some point but it wasn't one of my top priorities because I knew it would be at least OK.This movie blew all my expectations out the window. All I will say is it has just about everything you could hope for in a Spider-Man movie and the performance from Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio was absolutely spectacular.Go see this movie",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Far From Home did so many more things and it felt like it actually had a plot where Homecoming was all over the place. Mysterio was awesome, the characters including MJ are actually much better this time. Tom Holland once again shines as Peter Parker/Spider-Man and he's completely evolving even more! He does things on his own this time without everything handed to him. It was interesting too to see this film takes place not in New York this time but in Europe. Peter gets sent on a mission after running into Nick Fury while on a school trip with his friends. All the things I heard about Jake Gyllenhaal's Mysterio not being done right were totally wrong.

We could get a film about Peter's feelings, about his attitude towards Stark (and no, not one short scene, but more). But instead we got the usual ""relationship"" and the same story.

First off, the plot is not a good fit for what happened in the past movies to Peter Parker. So the guy goes to space, gets involved in a few major battles with Thanos, gets Bliped and finally loses his idol and all these will not have any impact on him?! I would rather have created this Spider-man a little more darker. Probably, he should no longer attended high school or at least continued through home-schooling, struggled with some dark times. I would rather created him more mature. Secondly, it seems to me that script-writers of comic-movies write their scripts based on latest genius codes written by software engineers - not based on a what they have in mind. What Maestro does and the imaginary monster he created is ridiculous. What happened to those superhero movies like Iron-man, The Avengers (2012). In those movies, what superheros and villains possess as so called super-power somehow make sense and not ridiculous. They are great movies and make you watch them again and again. Also, they almost destroyed every character they built in previous movies, Spider-man himself or Nick Fury only because the film-maker trying too hard to be cool. I hope this trend stops in Hollywood real soon. Some people are just destroying Hollywood because they have mixed up film-making with making of video games!",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1059,g3trans,Fun watch! Enjoyed most of it!,6,20 September 2019,"Seriously!?
I was about to give this movie 8/10 and when all of the sudden this plot twist happens!
So Spiderman was just duped like three times in a row by Mysterio, revealing sensitive information and now the scene right after it he meets Jon Favreau (Side topic, isn't it weird how everyone else is a different character and Jon Favreau is just himself?) and he's like.. ""tell me something only you would know! Mysterio can dupe us and bla bla "" so he shares something only he would know and he convinces him it's the real him.
Fast forward 10 whopping seconds, they're on the plane and Spiderman asks Jon to give him his cell phone, which he does.. He asks him to give him his password... which he does...
I mean.. come on!! You two are supposed to be our heroes! Have you learned nothing!? Then I'm like, here it comes, now Spiderman's an illusion created by Mysterio.. but NO! It doesn't happen, the movie keeps on pretending that nothing happened... Did the script writers really not notice this huge slap in the face to any sensible social engineering aware viewer?
Kinda made up for it when his password is just 'password', so I can expect revealing the password by Jon, but if Spiderman was half as smart as the movie makes him he would never ask Jon for his password - or he would and then slap the **** out of him to teach him not to ever tell his password to anyone.Awesome movie apart from that! 6/10 final mark.Oh also! Props to Tom Holland!
When I saw the trailer after the credits of some other movie he seemed really narcissistic and I was sure this movie would suck but he actually surprised me by having me believe his character is really humble and timid.

Those kids clearly have not watched the more developed and mature version in the early 2000's because this new version of Spider-Man is being force fed to the audience and it's disgusting. From the start they want him to be the new tony stark and the plot from there becomes so predictable you're going to want to turn it off then. If you do somehow make it to the end and think maybe there will be an awesome battle between Mysterious and Spider-Man but nope, just Spider-Man fighting a bunch of drones. Yup, you read that right, DRONES. The kid literally fights drones. Even the lackluster Spider-Man 3 has a better final fight scene than this film and the rest of the plot for this film does not really make up for it.The point is, Disney is out of ideas. All they have are these popcorn flicks that spark no real emotional attachment or any excitement to be led from their future. I could really care less what the MCU does from here on out and this is coming from someone that is, scratch that, was, a die hard fan of the entire MCU. I called it right after I saw Endgame and they ruined the entire timeline, the MCU from then on out was going to be crap and this is the start of that.

Tom Holland is the quintessential Spider-Man/Peter Parker, for me! Zendaya ( as Michelle 'MJ' Jones) and Tom have excellent chemistry along with the rest of the cast! Jon Favreau still captures the wonderful charm as Happy Hogan, great to have him back. Marisa Tomei as Aunt May does an incredible job being the protective nurturer and it's so REFRESHING for her to KNOW Peter's secret. I must tip my hat to Jake Gyllenhaal as Quentin Beck aka MYSTERIO! Great choice! Jon Watts gives us Peter's Junior year in High school post Endgame and things are as turbulent as EVER for our kid hero! He is in the throes of adolescence, trying to find a balance between being a student, teenage kid, nephew, best friend, potential love interest, protege', and super-hero (in his own right). Then, in comes the Elementals and a new hero who has more experience, skill, and maturity in Jake's MYSTERIO.Having Samuel L. Jackson's Nicky Fury back is both fun and intense to see as he attempts to recruit Spidey. Cobie Smulders returns as Mara Hill, awesome. The movie is fused with the kid-superhero vibes and humor! Over the top action sequences set in beautiful locations like Italy and London! The CGI is pristine with my only concern being the Iron Spider suit which was a little better in the Avenger films.

1077,Smith-jordan431,Something New.,9,11 July 2019,"After the events of the biggest cinematic event in history, Endgame, there was a lot riding on this movie, and boy did they knock it out of the park. A lot of people may be tired of superhero movies, especially Marvel super hero movies, but this is a nice (sort of) breather from the epic Infinity Saga. At its core, it is a movie about a young man finding his way admits the pressures that we all faced in high school, as well as the pressures from pretty much the entire world in becoming the next leader of the avengers and fulfilling Iron mans shoes. It took a little bit for the movie to get going and for the jokes to begin to land for me, but it gave us one of the best villains in Mysterio as well as a coming of age story that also reminded us of the same ""horrors"" we all faced during high school. On top of all of this they brilliantly thought through what the world would be like after the snap if it really happened and the humor found of that is nothing short of hilarious. This movie is terrific and MUST be seen in theaters for the epic action sequences. And be sure to stay for BOTH post-credit scenes. You won't want to miss them ! 8.6/10Be sure to give my podcast, Reel Sons of Cinema, a follow on iTunes and Spotify!

I obviously love the MCU and I also love Jake. However, the first half hour if this movie I just wasn't feeling his acting. It got better and better, reaching a high point when he outs himself as the villain and lasting until the very last scene. Even though I knew Mysterio would be the villain, the beginning of the movie made me confused if I had read that villain part correctly, because how could he be?? Tom and Jake have such great chemistry off the screen aswell, if you look at the interviews of the two of them. It shows on the screen.Not only is the acting in this movie great, Mysterio is a great follow up to Thanos. We're done with bad guys wanting to end the world, with Thanos we reached the ceiling with those kind of villains. Mysterio targets your feelings, your mind. We feel the grief of losing our beloved avengers, and what is worse than someone using that grief to trick us? I can't believe he only got one movie. This character deserved so much more than one movie. I'd have loved more depth to his character like we saw with other Marvel villains.All in all, in my opinion, this movie was an amazing follow-up to Endgame, breaking and mending the hearts of the MCU fans the best way they possibly could.

Especially Ned. Betty and Mr. Harrington, who was a personal favourite.Mysterio has been my favourite Spider-Man character (apart from Spidey himself) since I was a kid playing the PS2 game, and this film depicted him perfectly. With scenes that look they were took from the game but improved the look.Action scenes with the elementals were beautiful and all unique. The chemestry between Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal was also amazing. I laughed so much during this film especially at Mysterio during the back half.And... That... End.... Credit.... Scene.

The visual effects were stunning especially during the spidey vs Villain scenes (no spoilers) it was perfect.The composition of the movie kind of reminded me of the sequences in the Kingsman movies or a Guy Ritchie movie which i adore and think it's a fresh new way for marvel movies- especially a fun, but action packed spiderman movie.Again no spoilers, but the 2 end credit scenes were mindblowing and finally feel like they hold more meanings so definitely stay for them.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

The acting is amazing, in my opinion, this movie has the best effects that marvel has made for one of their movies yet.
The mid-credit scene has a hilarious cameo by the original J Jonah Jameson!!! It's amazing, and the twist that they made at the same time is incredible!
the only thing that hurt the movie a little in my opinion is the villain twist, marvel tried to confuse us with the marketing but after you watch the first quarter of the movie, you can already notice and predict the villain twist before they even show it which was a bit disappointing.but still, this was an amazing movie is amazing! hilarious with great twists and amazing effects and acting, so obviously you should definitely go watch it!

During the film the partnership is visible only in existing it can not bet on the future and suddenly the film takes the astonishing bet to do it so the end is not an end, but is an opening.

A perfect story after the amazing Endgame film that really sets you up and gets you excited for the future of the MCU movies! Once again Tom Holland is amazing as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, gives you such a comic feel about the character and that makes me so happy! It also had sick twists that weren't expected (unless you are a true comic book fan like me) and so much action that throughout the run of the film! I would really recommend watching it!

1103,Zabdiel38,What's going on here?,6,18 August 2020,"I have to say that when I first saw spider-man homecoming I didn't like it, but with time I liked it and I knew what marvel was trying to do, but far from home makes spider-man lose all interest.And here's my problem: The Characters:
In far from home it seems like we're back to square one, it doesn't feel like the characters have evolved, especially Aunt May, I was hoping to see how she was assimilating Peter being a spider-man but there's just no impact, she brings practically nothing to the story.And this also happens to the other secondary characters, there's no need for them to be there, they're just there to make the audience laugh.For me it was very exhausting the excess of jokes, not bad that there are jokes, this can serve to make the film more dynamic and especially because it is Spider-Man, but the jokes of the secondary characters are not necessary.If the secondary character is not going to bring anything to the movie, then don't bother to put him in the movie.There is simply no character development (except for Peter).The only thing that makes me want to see the third one, is for the post-credit scene but I said the same about homecoming and...What I can rescue is Mysterio, they made a secondary villain into one of the best villains Spider-Man has ever had in the movies, and that's not easy, plus Jake and Tom have excellent chemistry.And of course, Tom does an excellent job as Peter Parker/Spider-Man.And finally, Tony Stark as the 'MCU's Uncle Ben' is something very good that can be used in future Spider-Man movies as character development for Peter.I really hope that the third part corrects all these mistakes, but if this continues the same for the third part, I think I won't want to see any more MCU Spider-Man movies.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1104,braydenndavis,You Just Can't Replace Tom Holland,10,2 July 2019,"I am a big fan of Spider-Man and I can assure you that this movie is worth seeing after Endgame. I am sad that Stan Lee did not have a cameo in this movie, but it still was good. I feel really bad for Spider-Man having to fill Tony Stark's shoes cause those are pretty big shoes to fill and he's still a teenager. Another thing you should know is that the post-credit scene has a very special surprise and you will know if you've seen all the Spider-Man movies, I won't tell you what it is, but I will tell you your jaw is going to drop.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1105,bizomatei,Fun and entertaining Spiderman movie.,7,8 August 2019,"Marvel does another Spiderman movie that portrays the character particulary well. The comedy is a big stepup from most MCU movies. I love the way they make fun of the Thanos snap! The villian of this movie is one of the best MCU villians. All the acting is good with Jake Gyllenhal being great. The action is also really well handled. Sadly, the cinematography and editing are very bland, with almost no wide-shots, I think. The drone fight at the beginning of the movie is lame. The mid-credit and after-credit scenes where awesome.

1107,ansonbehind,The transition of an era,8,21 November 2019,"""For the next Tony Stark, I trust you"". Spiderman Far From Home basically created the whole sequel by this quote from the only Ironman who has sacrificed himself for the greater good of mankind. This sequel is also the end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe 10 year era, marking the end of the remarkable story and hinting of the beginning of another chapter. Spiderman at first was just a freshman from high school until one day he was bitten by a spider then gained superhuman powers. He was then recruited by Tony Stark to aid him during the civil war with Team Captain America and that is how he gained his reputation as a superhero and joined the Avengers during the events of Infinity War.
Spiderman Far From Home is the next Marvel movie established after the events of Avengers Endgame. The whole movie is talking about the life after the heroic sacrifice of Tony Stark, also known as Ironman in bringing back all the lives that has been taken by the snap of the cold-blooded Thanos. With the absence of Ironman, Captain America and Natasha Romanoff in the current world, everyone is asking who will be the leader for the Avengers team, and the spotlight all went to Tony Stark's disciple, Peter Parker also known as Spiderman. The mountain was too high for him to climb and he did all his best to run away from his responsibilities. Instead of saving the world, Peter Parker went on a summer vacation with all his classmates. During his vacation, danger strikes again in the form of the water element and has endangered the safety of his classmates. While dealing with the first enemy, an unknown ally came to help and fortunately no casualties were caused. The unknown hero flew away after defeating the water elemental and has left everyone at the scene thinking who is that guy? The attack worried Peter but he tried not to think about it, but everything changed when Nick Fury showed up in his apartment after darting Ned to sleep. Fury brought Peter to the his hideout, along the way, he gave Peter a pair of glasses named EDITH (Even Dead, I'm The Hero), which was given by Tony Stark. Edith was an augmented reality security, defence and artificial tactical intelligence system. At first, it was meant to be a parting gift from Tony Stark himself, but this gift turns out to be the start of all catastrophe.
In this movie, there are a few scenes that are worth mentioning. The first scene that I want to talk about is the scene where Spiderman is getting swarmed by interviewers during a welcome party for all those who went into the ""Blip"". The scene was shot through the shoulders of Spiderman, representing his point of view during the moment of chaos. It also expresses the emotions of Spiderman during that moment. Feeling of unworthiness, avoidance, fear and stress all came to him and in the end he flew up to the roof, facing a portrait of Tony Stark. At that moment, he just wants to be a regular high school kid, with no pressure of saving the world, no monsters to beat, no cities to save.
Second scene that is worth mentioning is the scene where Quentin Beck also known as Mysterio, the villain of the sequel request to buy Peter a drink after their victory against the fearsome Fire Elemental. Quentin Beck was a former worker for the Stark Industries, but inventions of abusing the augmented reality was claimed useless by Tony Stark, therefore he seeks revenge by getting his hands onto EDITH to show the world that you can be the hero that everyone wanted in the augmented reality world. The scene was shot with the 2 characters present at the hologram bar, which was disguised by augmented reality. Quentin know that Peter has the glasses, therefore he created a series of psychological strategies to bait Peter in giving him the glasses without hesitation. Firstly, Quentin starts off his strategy by asking what he really want, Peter avoids the question at first but in the end stresses that he wants to confess to the girl that he liked for a long time, making Peter lower down his self-defence towards him. Secondly, Peter didn't know that he lost his glasses, but Quentin could not gain access due to encrypted code of the user itself, the transfer of users must be confirmed by the user itself in order to complete the transition. Quentin arranged a helper to pick up the lost glasses and gave it to Peter as it was really found lost outside the city during their fight. After that, Quentin asks Peter to put on the glasses, but then jokingly say that he looks ugly on the glasses. The reason that Quentin uses this strategy is to let Peter feel that he is unworthy of that multi-billion technology that Tony passed on to him. He made Peter think off the quote that Tony gave him, but he misunderstood the underlying meaning of it. In the end, Peter gave Quentin the access of the technology then ran off to fulfil his plan in getting the girl that he loved. The scene shows us that Quentin is a master of phycology, he manipulated the emotions and thoughts of Peter and made him look like a clown. On the other hand, we can also say that teenagers nowadays feel very insecure of themselves, they are easily broken down by harsh words and stress, making them easy to manipulate, easy to put their trust on others.
In a nutshell, this sequel is demonstrating how a teenager manages himself when all the stress and responsibility are thrown towards him. They chose to run, hide, avoid everything that they possibly can, but things come eventually and they will go into a mental breakdown state. However, people always adapt, they will eventually know that the best way to embrace your responsibilities is to conquer them. Secondly, this film also showcases the transition of an era, with all the old faces disappearing from the big screen, it is indicating that Marvel wants a change of new blood into the upcoming Marvel era, introducing more superheroes into the squad. Thirdly, the film also showed us that teenagers are easily deceived and manipulated, therefore the film also serve a purpose to remind teenagers about how cruel the outside world is, everyone will risk everything to get what they want.
This will be the end of my movie review. Thank you.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Not sure what Marvel universe this Spider-Man came out of but it seems to be the stuck adolescence of middle school.Can we get Andrew Garfield back now that Sony and Disney are on the outs.
At least Andrew has some acting chops. I can't figure out Tom Holland.. he is not that good.Best part of this is Mysterio and it would be nice to get a Spider-Man movie with Spider-Man.. not Iron Man worked into everything (this is why it's not a Spider-Man Movie and neither was the first one)",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1112,Chloe-h1994,Scripted and Unsurprising,6,5 August 2019,"While the acting on the part of Tom Holland and crew was great, this movie felt campy, scripted, and none of the twists surprised me. I didn't feel like anything new happened and it seemed like the conveniently forgot much of their own cinematic lore. Many of the plot devices felt like plot devices and the villain was unoriginal and forgettable.I found it hard to believe that the same man who essentially put training wheel's on Spider-Man's suit in the original movie would have given high tech glasses to the same teenager and left no safety measures in place. Also, watching the glasses get tossed around during action sequences was painful - why are the controls to the entire Stark system in something so easily lost and/or broken? Much of the plot dealt with Stark tech but seemed to forget all the earlier films, particularly Avengers 2 and Iron Man 3, where Tony learned that his tech could be used for evil and taught him to install safety measures and generally be more cautious than he had previously been. Also, everyone in the film kept acting like Spider-Man was the only superhero left on earth... like, what? Apparently Black Panther, Scarlet Witch, Valkyrie, and any of the other superheroes still around are completely irrelevant? That was hard to believe and so was everyone's expectations that Peter and his webs would be able to take on elemental monsters??? What are sticky webs supposed to do against a water monster? All to say, I didn't find the plot to be very believable or surprising.Looking now at the good, the acting on the part of Tom Holland and the rest of the ""high school"" cast was great. Both of the teacher's were hilarious and the sub plot with Ned worked way better than I had initially thought it would. The visuals were amazing - I know that will surprise zero people.I think you can definitely wait to see this movie until it comes out of theaters.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1113,jonathanboyd2006,Is there a Spider-Man Homecoming 1.5 somewhere?,7,13 July 2019,"I'm just going to jump right into and I don't really like starting off negatively, but 10-15 minute in I wasn't feeling it. Right out of the gate the whole Michelle/Peter relationship was super forced. Was there a Spider-Man 1.5 shown somewhere and I missed the part where all of a sudden everyone wants to be with Michelle? Nobody was interested in her in Homecoming and she was just comic relief. Also I don't recall her even being called Michelle in this one. Sorry but she's not Mary Jane, so why the need to even call her MJ at all? Also that whole taking her swinging through the city was unnecessary and made no sense which leads to another complaint. Next problem I had was the amount of times and time spent by Peter unmasked. When the post credits identity reveal happened it was like who doesn't know at this point. If he wouldn't have instantly ripped that mask off as soon as he entered the room with Beck and SHIELD he wouldn't have a problem. That all just seems very uncharacteristic of Peter Parker since he keeps his secret identity very secret in comics. Happy even gives away Spidey's identity in the vault when he says he has a thing for Spider-Man's aunt. When those kids see him with May they are going to know that's Peter's aunt. Marvel seems to be replacing Uncle Ben with Tony Stark as well. I get the Uncle Ben thing has been shown and told several times, but it's still a key part of the character and I want ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility."" The kicker was showing the initials on the suitcase and then blowing up the plane later. I don't need or want Spider-Man to be the next Iron Man, I just want him to be Spider-Man. On to the positive aka MYSTERIO! The Mysterio stuff was great and brought this True Believer back into the movie. The changes made to his character made sense and worked for me. The parts where he had Spider-Man trapped in the illusions were awesome. Those scenes made the movie for me along with JK Simmons back as J Jonah Jameson! I hope Mysterio's death was an illusion as well and he comes back later. I'm glad the multiverse thing was a lie, it's too early for all that stuff. The Skrull and Fury post credit thing threw me for a loop and confuses me. Where is Fury and why is he working with Skrulls? When Spider-Man was shown in Civil War I was really excited for him being added to the MCU and before Homecoming I'd put Civil War on just to skip to his part. Since Homecoming and now Far From Home I feel let down. Marvel seems to be trying really hard to be different than previous iterations and the character/story is suffering. These are my initial thoughts though from just the 1 viewing.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

The love story of Peter and MJ also brings back the traditional relationship which is always nice to see.
Misterio becoming the villain of the film comes to a shock to many who were fooled by his charm, while if you pay attention, that wasn't even half way through the movie itself, so you figure there's gotta be more!
The comedic aspects of the film enhance your love for each and every character from Peter to Fury to even the teachers and students who are along for the vacation.

It seems that some people have difficulty differentiating between fun and mediocre filmmaking. I could not understand the Endgame hype, hence I avoided this movie for a long time until I finally decided to give it a go because of Jake Gyllenhaal, who I think is one of the best actors working in hollywood today. I tried my best to be open minded but I could not find anything positive about this movie.

1144,calebdrums,Better than Endgame By Far,10,10 July 2019,"I'm not going to hold anyone in suspense. I'm going to cut right to the chase and make a declaration that, I'm sure, will upset a lot of Marvel fans everywhere: this was better than Endgame. This ranks right up there with The Dark Knight as one of the best superhero films I've ever witnessed. It had everything in the superhero formula wrapped up in one neat little package, and then it exploded and did a lot of creative stuff with its characters to make it stand out. It had the right amount of action mixed with the right amount of character development.First, the action in the film was superb. It was a thousand times more entertaining than Endgame was. The action here was well paced and it made you feel like you were watching a superhero movie, not a cut and dry soap opera drama. The special effects in this film were top notch, and I'm a bit of a sucker for a good, old fashioned film where stuff blows up. It's entertaining, some might say a bit mindless, but overall, it works. Where it doesn't work is when you have a movie that has a ton of explosions and action, but no creative characters or interesting story to back it up.Thankfully, Far From Home has all of that and a whole lot more. Peter Parker is classic in this movie. He's still the same shy, awkward teenage superhero we've come to know and admire. But they've added another level to his character in the aftermath of Endgame's conclusion. Since Tony Stark died, Peter's been asking himself the question, ""am I the next Iron Man?"" That question alone makes Peter's character even more interesting to watch, as he not only has to wrestle with high school and being ""your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man,"" but he now has to balance all of that with potentially being the biggest superhero on the planet. He's been taken out of the neighborhood, and put into society as a whole, and that's an incredibly interesting new tenet to the character.The side characters are not to be outdone in this movie. Ned and Betty's silly relationship that only lasts for the entirety of their vacation is hilarious to watch unfold, and the fact that they consider this a ""journey"" that they've both been on speaks to the shallow nature of high school romance. Flash's complete ignorance to the fact that he's constantly insulting the one hero he loves and admires above everything else is a delight, and the two bumbling teachers on the trip are hilarious without being insulting to anyone's intelligence.Then there is my least favorite character in the film. His name is Brad, and he's a generic pretty boy popular high school teen whom every girl in the galaxy wants to be with. He's basically a cardboard cutout of characters in every teen movie that's ever been made. From Fast Times at Ridgemont High to American Pie to Twilight to The Fault in Our Stars, the same Brad has laced his way throughout the teenage movie universe. In Far From Home, his character is incredibly bland and they do nothing with it, except have him become a part of a rather hilarious misunderstanding. But even there, he's carried by the other characters and how great they are.At first, I thought Mary Jane was going to be my least favorite character. She's turned into this hipster goth character who loves things that are either ""depressing"" or ""hilarious."" For the first half of the film, I didn't like her. She was way too brooding for a movie whose tone wasn't exactly Batman levels of dark. If she had been in one of The Caped Crusader's films, then I could've seen the character working better. But until she comes to terms with her feelings for Peter midway through the film, she's really just taking up space. For a character that's synonymous with Spider-Man, that's really disappointing. Then, in the second half of the film, she comes to life. She begins being that interesting character we've all come to know and, if there's a third film, I hope they explore that a little bit more.Then there was the story, which was incredibly solid. It wasn't the most original story I've ever seen put to film, and I think we've all seen the ""incredible secondary heroic protagonist turns into amazing antagonist"" thing before, but it was so well written and well done that it felt refreshing. I went from laughing to wide eyed excitement to caring about a character in the time it takes the average person to snap their fingers. It keeps you involved, and for a movie with an over two-hour runtime, that's saying something.It also keeps its science to a limit, which is something I love. There wasn't too much of it, but just enough to tantalize the imagination. Instead, it focused more on the characters themselves and building this incredibly immersive environment where you're thrown around like a rag doll during the action scenes, but you're allowed to slow down and appreciate the film when it's appropriate to do so.Overall, this was an action film for the ages. I rank it up there with The Dark Knight and the last three Mission Impossible films as the greatest action films I've ever seen. It was funny, creative, well paced, well written, and it did a lot of justice to the Spider-Man character. I highly recommend it, and I cannot wait to see where the new Spider-Man series goes from here.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1149,evanscorey-91700,So Entertaining,8,10 January 2020,"So i went to go watch this in an imax cinema with a friend and let me tell you, i loved it. this movie i one of the best MCU films ever made and it was so necessary because for the most part its a bit goofy but after the emotional roller coaster that was Avengers Endgame i needed something like this to lighten me up.(SPOILER WARNING) The plot of this film happens right after endgame and has peter dealing with tony stark's death and becoming the next iron man even though its not that focused on and he goes on a trip around Europe but mysterio appears with nick fury and maria hill and it turns out that mysterio is from a different dimension and the elemental monsters who destroyed his world have come here and threaten to do the exact same.But near the end of the film it turns out Mysterio is evil and is using drones to project the monsters to become a real superhero so spider-man has to fight him and then gets together with MJ ant the end of the movie. So at first it does sound like a generic superhero movie but trust me its better than you think.Now the Tom Holland Peter Parker movies can actually write a teen comedy so this film is pretty funny and peters emotional arc in this movie is really good and entertaining and the side characters like Ned and MJ really elevate this movie as well. But let us not forget this villain Mysterio Because he is one of the best MCU villains of all time because he is unique and just really fun to watch also the character effects look pretty good for him.So in conclusion i really think you should go watch this movie because its just so fun and entreating to watch and i can say with confidence you will not regret it.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

I love watching a movie where every 5 minutes they tell you something you just saw wasn't real. Like a high priced magic show. Generally you get done with a movie and you have great scenes you remember that you want to see again. I honestly can't remember one scene like that. Even the crappy superhero movies will have a couple scenes you want to rewatch. I'd say this is probably the worst Marvel movie, just a bit worse than Ironman 3.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1156,NicelyPutMovies,Good Stuff. Tom Holland is a star and a less well-know director paid off,8,22 April 2020,"As the ending of any MCU movie shows with the unspeakable amount of people involved, it is difficult to justify assigning any credit to any departments. So, saying X person deserves credit for anything seems unfair. To that end, with Marvel movies all credit is aimed at the director, it is for them to distribute. So individual accolade will be feudal
Set immediately after the events of Endgame, this new incarnation of the MCU sees Peter Parker take the helm. We learn that the Thanos incident was called ""The Blip"" and using careful yet light exposition showing amateur footage during a tribute to Tony Stark and the other fallen Avengers of a basketball game to humourous ends.
The relatively unknown director, Jon Watts had something of a mammoth task. He pretty much had to go on after The Beatles just split up live on stage. Was his low-fi profile maybe a tactical decision by the board at Disney to be able to disassociate itself from the glorious success of the MCU up to Avengers: Endgame by giving it an indie roster to pass it down to ""cult hit"" if required? Not sure, it seems like a strange choice given the well-known players that would have fought for a chance to direct this. Either way, he handled it well.Starting off in the usual setting, a war-torn zone, we see Nick Fury and Agent Hill (although agent of what?) in the remnants of what actually turns out to be an ""Earthquake with a face"" (no one has explained who Nick is now and how he is funded, perhaps it is by Audi, he seems to be advertising them). Greeted by the usually dramatic opening incorporating Marvel's usual spellbinding special effects and some expo-logue (a neologism, figure the meaning) and the drama is settled by Jake Gyllenhaal dressed as the alien leader from Mars Attacks! and shooting Harpic dust from his hands.
Well dealt with is the phenomenon of people ageing five years while those who vanished in ""The Blip"" didn't. So, especially for younger folk, it was awkward where younger siblings were now older siblings, best friends who were eleven, now had one that was sixteen. An amusing offshoot that is touched upon but not laboured, to the writing team's credit.
There is a lot of reference to Tony Stark. Verbal and visual, and unspoken. Now some would say this is gratuitous, but its Iron Man. Remember what he did? What were they going to do, ignore it? He bought trillions back to life. Celebrate Stark, have at it. Embrace your options.
So, we see Peter, Aunt May, and Happy Hogan continuing without Tony. Happy and May have a burgeoning romance of zero plausibility and Peter, ghosting Nick Fury, just wants to go and have fun with his pals, including the always delightful Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon). Off on a trip to Europe with the hilariously uncool teacher played by one of the best deadpan comic actors around, Martin Starr, a clumsy yet clever little pantomime executed poorly results in Peter NOT getting to sit with MJ but instead love-rival Brad is moved next to her instead. This is a new trope I see in millennial-influenced productions where the love rival is a nice guy. The obnoxious Flash is peripheral and needs writing out. Now that Peter is not a teen kid anymore, an annoying bully is surplus to entertainment. Yet moreover, one constant is true, Tom Holland is an absolute joy. The perfect Peter Parker.So, engaging is the chemistry of all the players that I forget the whole ""Weather had a face"" thing and suddenly, it appears, and the action begins. Starts off a little clunky with Peter hopping from one Gondola to another and is not of the usual MCU standards. Then it finds its feet and the effects kick into excellent levels. Peter, disguised as Peter wearing a little mask, helps the unnamed weird looking Jake Gyllenhaal fight the gargantuan creatures soon explained as ""Elementals"". A clever idea that is a kind of living version of the infinity stones.
Back at the hostel, Peter still jonesing for MJ (played by the elegant Zendaya) is blindsided by Nick Fury in a very funny scene that had a lingering thought of ""why not close the door?"". Anyway, comic relief spent, after another Audi commerical, in a scene that emulates more of a Bond-style 'Q' scene of exposition, Peter joins the inexplicably well-resourced Nick Fury and the outer-space visitor Quentin Beck (yeah) but lately-monikered ""Mysterio"". A kind and Tony-esque tonic to Nick Fury's aggressively demanding and somewhat mildly insulting persona. We learn Beck's tragic back story, a little unimaginative and strangely enough a character in the film, and someone watching at the same time as I was, asked ""Is that not Dr Strange?"" This could be pointing to the fact they MCU are running out of ideas. Still running with it, here is a definitely entertaining yarn. Mind you, love-rival Brad is becoming a bit less likeable.
There are further remnants of Tony in his EDITH glasses. A device that will have the fanboys gushing, and I have to say, they are right. It is a grand and exciting concept to have such tech available post Stark Industries. However, as is proven almost immediately, Peter is not ready to have them.
All danger is over. By now, I really hate Brad, and as it is halfway through the film, we know a twist is coming. and it is far from over. A twist that is somewhat obvious but still intriguing to see how it is played out. Sadly, therein lies a few faults. Many questions are raised. The explanations are both complex and inefficient. At this point we see the sides begin to split a la Homecoming on the ferry. This time there is no Iron Man to fly in and save the day...is there?So, there is much left to play out. Holographic stage plays and images that are clearly distracting in a pleasing way. Anyone who enjoyed Tron will be right at home. Through a frankly fantastic and eerily psychedelic scene traipsing through Peter Parkers fears and insecurities (think back to when Brian took mushrooms in Family Guy in the storm episode) we approach the final act.
It is possible, even simple, to overdo the action. If you agree that this can be the case, you will almost certainly believe it here. Also, something about the overall threat is not so grabbing. How do you create a villain after Thanos, the Elementals are not Thanos. He was simply the villain to end all villains. Back to being on stage after The Beatles again.
The usual comic relief of a Spiderman movie does not escape. There is a very funny scene in Holland, although to that end, the Gondolas in Rome, the Tulips in Holland, the open-top red buses in London and the Tower etc, it does often find itself being a little guilty of clumsy or lazy cultural labelling. Fine for Wayne's World, this is Marvel. Try harder please. Not to mention Tom Holland flexing his muscles as Happy Hogan is handed a necklace. Caught you out Tom!
Not fair, as Mr Holland is a star. He has none of the smug bedazzlement of Tobey Maguire, or the misplaced athletic handsomeness of the over-charismatic Andrew Garfield. He is quite simply Peter Parker. Long may he reign.
So, in conclusion, while the action can get heavy-handed and the storyline a little forgotten, it is overall a definite winner and deserves the accolade of being part of the MCU. Jon Watts has handled it well and maybe he will return. On that subject, this annoying habit of mid-credit and end-credit scene that is part of the movie and should have been in the main picture is certainly redone here. So, stay till the end. I would give them credit but making paying fans wait is frankly a despicable tactic and a reminder of why the world hates Disney. Mid/Post credit scenes are supposed to be cute little add-ons, not incredibly vital plot points.

1157,vainblood,Spider-Man: Far from authenticity,4,25 May 2020,"FX gets ridiculous amount of attention, while the story, characters and their emotions are spider-web thin. The action scenes are so overdone that it becomes ridiculous and you stop believing in it. They don't even take advantage of the FX to create dramatic scenes. They are just showing off with it ""Look, this is what we can do now...cool right?"" I thought we had come further than this.I'd recommend the movies with Tobey Mguire instead, because they feel much more authentic and are shown from a more interesting perspective than your average super-hero kick ass movie. They show the vulnerabilities and problems of a super-hero who is just an ordinary guy most of the time and that's much more interesting than watching X number of drones transform the sky into a theme-park of holograms.I know this is an Avengers spin off, but this is far away from the usual quality and entertainment value of those movies.

Pretty excited about upcoming films!It didn't feel like a sequel to Spider-Man, but more like an Endgame epilogue, which is not necessarily something bad given the fact all the films are interconnected. I really liked that the human side of Spider-Man made half of this film, unlike the rest of MCU, where the focus was on the powers within and the moral v immoral issues rather than the social interactions and it was a delight to see the characters evolve on screen in a natural and almost believable way.All in all, it was way better than I expected and I will definitely watch it again.

The special effects were top-notch, and Michael Giacchino's music really blended in with the action scenes. For the acting, Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal really delivered the scenes, and I loved Jon Favreau's role in this movie.In terms of the narrative, I think the plotline is a little too packed so I wasn't really invested to the story, and for some reason I even think that the ""trip to Europe"" wasn't necessary at all, they could've travelled inside the US and it won't really change the story, because the cities they traveled to were just a mere background setting. Also, some of the supporting characters were a bit under-utilized, there were one or two students that added nothing to the story. Also, I have an issue with the scene where Peter roams in Germany and Netherlands wearing his stealth suits. Does people realize who he was when he was found in the train, fainted? Or did I miss something here?Despite of the storyline, Far From Home is still a very enjoyable summer blockbuster movie, hence the score.PS: it would be a lot better if they gave a little, juuust little, callback to Uncle Ben.

1166,parbjorkman,Mismatch in casting,6,12 June 2020,"In this movie it's sadly clear that some actors really are giving their all to their role ... and some just do it as a ""job"" to get paid.
I have the highest respect for Jake Gyllenhaal in general, and I understand his wish to not take just any role in the MU out of a kind of respect for his own limitations. But sadly, even though he said he liked to play a vilian, he just lacks the ability to sound really credible and natural .. as for example Tom Holland or RDJ. But to be fair, he was not as bad as some of the minor roles like Peter Parkers classmates (expect MJ) or the female Shield agent giving Peter the stealth suit.
But if you can look past this and just enjoy the movie for the shear joy of another MU movie with all the special effects and all the Spiderman we missed so much with Tobey, then you will for sure enjoy this movie ... and not just one time.
Perhaps it's time to stop using big stars when casting new MU characters, but just look for who really can make a character come to life in the best possible way. Since the cliffhanger in the end of this movie did almost ""promise"" another Spiderman Home-movie, we can just hope that they take the chance to introduce some more new fresh blood (as good as RDJ in first Ironman, Scarlett Johansson in IM2 or Chris Hemsworth in Thor) in order to avoid burning out the already melted candles that Chris H,Chris E or even Jon Favreau has shown examples of in Avengers Endgame or SFFH.But in order to end with a positive chritique, I really do think that Tom Holland have given to the MU a Spiderman that will stick in peoples memories as the most action-like and youthful ""goofness"" representation that we fans could ever have imagined.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

To be completely honest, I was a bit underwhelmed by this latest release in the MCU. While it has a very fresh rating on both Rotten Tomatoes and Reddit, I would only give it a 7/10. It was an enjoyable watch and it follows the same high quality that all Marvel/Disney films are accustomed to, however, both as a stand-alone film and the last installment of Phase Three, I am a bit upset that I didn't enjoy it more. The first act of the movie was slow. Nothing about the story was surprising; in fact, the most surprising part of the film were the two after credits scenes. There is a certain sequence in the film which involves AR tech and while I must admit it was incredible from a technical VFX standpoint, I thought it was extremely out of place in the film aesthetically. Marvel, and Spider-Man specifically, is known for humor, and while many in my theater laughed at most all of the jokes, I found only a few funny.On a positive note, my absolute favorite part of the movie was MJ as portrayed by Zendaya.

A hokey, cheesy, bubble gum poppy god awful piece of crap with endless jokes that never land and are super cringe. Worse than Sharknado but at least that movie is SUPPOSED to be a joke.Every character including the adults acts like a child. This is probably one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen in my life.I have seen every spider man film ever made and this one is the greatest departure from everything that makes spider man great.-No sense of responsibility (Fury and everyone else has to basically force him to nut up and do his job)
-No spider-sense - at least 3 different times spidey is somehow blindsided despite this being one of his most basic powers.-He doesn't even crack and Spider-Man puns during combat or ever say anything funny for that matter.This movies target audience is an 8 year old and they've alienated an entire existing fanbase and crapped all over decades of established awesome stuff.I could go on forever but long story short Spider-man is dead and his replacement is abysmal.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1181,lavashop,This film is deeply problematic,7,2 July 2019,"This isn't the first Spider-Man film starring Tom Holland. So to portray Peter Parker is a bumbling idiot, who is not only gullible and naive, but also exuding poor judgements in character and hand-to-hand combat, is really surprising.
I have always held that Toby McGuire Peter Parker as the standard, especially the second Spider-Man movie director by Sam Raime. Peter Parker has his down moments but he was always competent, skilled in combat and extremely intuitive. Tom Holland's Spider-Man is not only deeply flawed and not someone I would root for. The guy is girl crazy and has his priorities completely screwed. No wonder he was swindled by more than a few characters. Really very out of character for Peter Parker. His spider senses (or Peter Tinkle) somehow disappeared until he willed it back later in the movies. You cannot switch the Spider senses on and off like that. It makes no sense.There is also another problem area for me: The CGI. OMG, the special effects not only look fake but so rudimentary. You can see the Elementals are fake. I have seen better rendered elements CGI on screen. This is not it.And there are so many irritating and nonsensical characters in this version, especially Peter Parker's fat friend, Ned Leeds. That is not a good friend. The comedic timing of Batalon (who plays Leeds), is problematic. Very awkward and force. I really would not suggest watching this terrible movie in the cinema. Stream it when it's available. There's time since Phase 4 won't be out anytime soon.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Spider-Man homecoming was really good, but it was a smaller story not really that big of an event, but Spider-Man far from home was epic! It was the story of peter not becoming the next iron man but becoming Spider-Man!If you like comedy and great action, you will love this movie!
____________________________________________________(Spoilers further down!)
one of my favourite scenes was when Mysterio was making Spider-Man hallucinate! It was truly epic, it really made it feel like a Spider-Man movie! You just didn't know what was going to happen next,
It was not only the best scene of the movie, but it was probably one of the best scenes in the mcu!!! It felt like it was from the comics, but also new and fresh, I had never seen anything like it!!!!!Go see this movie to make your summer extra exciting and fun!",Spider-Man - Far from Home

The special effects as always were great but that was about it. The MJ character was just weird and weak and so cliche as to what people think a modern female character should be that it detracted from the whole character.

1188,natebarbone,It was alright,6,4 July 2019,"I watched this movie rather objectively as I am not a huge Marvel fan, so I didn't know what to expect. I feel like everyone else loves these movies just because. Overall, it was entertaining and had some good laughs, but it wasn't really amazing or different. It's just another copy and paste superhero story. I have a lot of questions about what happened and why, but I won't give any spoilers.Everyone's performances were great except Jake Gyllenhaal. He seemed really apathetic and didn't come across as genuinely caring to say his lines. I wanted to really like his character but he had no character. He was incredibly bland. Also they could have done more with Mysterio and the plot. It just wasn't compelling or particularly fleshed-out. Sure, there were some cool action scenes, but the premise was pretty weak. Oh I guess we gotta save the world... again!Also I didn't realize what the movie poster was, and it is one of the worst movie posters I've ever seen. Did they actually pay someone to make that? Give me a job designing posters.Anyway, I say 6/10 because it was entertaining enough, but lacked any depth. How many more times can superheroes save the world? It was a big missed opportunity to do something cool with Mysterio. I feel like he was just shoehorned in there for Spiderman fans. He didn't get a great showing, which I feel hurts the whole movie. When they remake this movie 20 years from now maybe they'll do it right.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1191,subhaanmalik-37282,A good film overall,8,4 July 2019,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film and it's definitely the best spider-man film to be made with homecoming coming very close. This movie was an excellent continuation of the mcu saga and it did very well in that regard. It nicely tied up the loose ends about endgame and it's definitely the epilogue endgame deserved. It did not rely too much on endgame but rather it's about Peter Parker getting along without iron man which is a difficult journey for Peter but he manages to find his way throughout the movie.The plot of the movie is rather generic I must say. The fact that mysterio created the villains was controlling them through illusions was something that was pretty obvious, though the multi verse idea was definitely a nice though and it sold the story very well. However, it was obvious that mysterio would be the villian from the start and the overall plot and motivation of the character was nothing special or amazing.All the actors played their role very well and they really made you feel the emotional impact of what was happening which definitely added to the character of the movie and sold it as a well rounded film instead of a generic superhero movie.The visual effects were absolutely amazing and it truly felt like you were watching a comic book movie.One thing I did not like was it felt way too disconnected from the mcu which almost seems contrary as it tied up endgame. It felt like it tied up endgame and then did it's own thing which is fine but it's still part of the mcu and that was not shown in an organic way. The movie did feel a bit short and it sort of lacked cohesiveness in certain areas. Some scenes would have benefitted from being longer but overall, it's a solid film with a great mid credit scene which sets up the future of spider-man nicely.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1195,silentholygaming,Not as good as they say,3,3 July 2019,"I don't understand how so many people have this movie rated insanely high, calling it the ""best spider-man movie"" & ""one of the best in the mcu."" To start I'll say that i didn't enjoy Spider-Man: Homecoming when i first viewed it and I still don't, I have nothing against Tom Holland's Spider-Man, I love him as the character and I think he could be great if he just had some better material to work with. Onto the actual movie, I'll start with the stuff i do like; The new suits for spidey are great & I love Mysterio's suit too, some of the action is pretty good & there is solid acting for the most part throughout. Everything else was disappointing, from the cgi to the story to just how enjoyable it was to watch, the film dragged on for a while and it isn't worth a watch at the cinema, unless you're a huge spidey fan",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1196,Adityaaaaa,A pretty good film overall that does what it set out to do... (Spoiler Warnings stated throughout review),7,4 December 2019,"Spider-Man: Homecoming is one of my favourite movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a franchise in which I am a big fan of, so it's definitely saying something. I would watch an MCU movie anyway, but the fact that it's a Spider-Man film that's a sequel to Homecoming got me super excited.The film has more than a few flaws, which I'll talk about soon, but, honestly, it's a very fun film with many high points as well. The likeable cast were made even more likeable this time round, with the supporting characters being much more well fleshed-out. The romance had a better mix of humour and drama compared to the prequel, and is woven better into the plot all the way through. And the visual effects were brilliant. It was so fun to see a small-scale Spider-Man movie given a bigger budget.On top of all this, this was a very risky film to make. And I have to credit Jon Watts for keeping a strong, sure hand throughout the narrative, which did falter but never in a visual way, or in terms of pace, so the direction was very well done. Mysterio is also a very risky character to play, and many weren't sure how well a character like him would work on film. He's a fantastic comic-book character, but his powers just seem a bit too cartoonish. However, Gyllenhaal and Watts did a great job in managing to keep him serious.Also, the mid-credits scene and the post-credits scenes here... they blew my mind. The post-credits scene was probably my favourite ever, and the mid-credits scene was 3,000 times better than that(yes, the 3,000 was intended). It was mind-blowing and brilliant on numerous levels. For one, it actually had a connection to the movie. It expanded upon the movie, and added a great cliffhanger with a great twist, accompanied by a fantastic guest appearance. I will not spoil this for you. Go and be surprised just like I was. Oh, and the post-credits scene. It wasn't as brilliant, per se... but it's crazy. Very crazy. Prepare to be surprised for that scene as well.As for flaws, there are more than a few, as before mentioned. There wasn't too much visual subtext, which I have always been wanting from Marvel movies ever since The Dark Knight showed everyone how comic-book films can be just as technically clever as any other films. The action and comedy could have been a bit more visually engrossing as well, in terms of editing, rather than relying on the screenplay and visuals to convey the entertainment.Aside from that, however, the movie is just a bit too far-fetched. Even for a superhero movie. So far-fetched, in fact, that it sometimes makes you want to just sigh 'Seriously?' as loud as possible. But that I can kind of let slide. I get how this film is, ultimately the epilogue of Endgame and the last of the Infinity Saga, and that they're setting up a completely new era of Marvel movies. To set up something with such an epic scope is hard, and it feels a bit over-the-top to us because we are yet to experience it. So I get it. And I can let that slide. However, because of how far-fetched and insanely over-the-top it is, the plot just derails every so often, and it just makes too many plot holes, and a story which can only be tied up of very loose and lucky coincidences because of how ambitious this film was. It often felt like they bit off way more than they could chew. Normally, I don't care about plot-holes as long as they make a good story out of it. The story was fun, but it just lead to more plot-holes, and it started to annoy me.However, purely because of how enjoyable the movie was, I can say that this otherwise painfully mediocre was actually good. Normally, I wouldn't have given over a 3-star review if a film gets this many cons, but it was just too fun. I had a blast with the film.I can't explain further without getting into spoilers, so, if you want to avoid spoilers, (which I highly recommend you do, as the film is full of surprises), please skip to the conclusion at the end. Thank you.SPOILERS: There is a twist that the elemental monsters which attack the cities are actually just projections. That was a cool twist, but then surely someone must have noticed how they weren't getting wet or they weren't getting burnt or something. I mean, there was so many people, one of them are bound to notice something.And there's also other things. They really pushed the boundaries with going over-the-top, as I said, and Nick Fury is some really powerful man capable of doing basically anything. This leads to various different plot holes. He could have set Mysterio up in the final act, or actually sent forces to confront him, rather than putting Peter's life in danger, but he didn't. When he believed that the elemental monsters were real, and gained knowledge that they were going to be attacking a carnival, he could have simply just closed the carnival rather than booking the entirety of Peter's class opera seats to keep them safe. Stopping the carnival would have saved everyone, and would have been a win-win policy. Like, there'a bit where Peter accidentally sends drones from space to kill a rival. The fact that drones can just be sent from space like that is incredibly over-the-top, and it sort of lost me, but I just managed to shrug and say, ""hey, it's a superhero film, it's fine"". So that's not what bothered me, It was the fact that this over-ambition led to plot holes which bothered me.As well as this, the fact that Peter and MJ could deduce Mysterio's whole evil plan from a projector of the monsters is just a huge coincidence. It's pure luck, it's a pure coincidence. So much of one, in fact, that no-one would ever guess that. It's just too loose.CONCLUSION:
'Spider-Man: Far From Home' has way too many large inconsistencies, plot-holes and coincidences in it's overly ambitious, far-fetched and over-the-top plot which felt like it bit off more than it could chew, but it's sheer enjoyment value and it's great cast did the impossible by making up for its many cons to become a pretty good film overall and does what it set out to do.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1199,indiaodonohoe,Phenomenal Movie,9,5 July 2019,"The first Spider-Man was exceptional, and I honestly didn't think it would get any better and then boom. Far From Home happened.Firstly- the acting. I want a moment to discuss Jake Gyllenhaal. He was absolutely incredible, especially given the complexity of the character he was playing. I couldn't have asked for a better Mysterio. He and Holland had an amazing dynamic and created some mind-blowing scenes. Whilst we're on Tom Holland, I couldn't miss out him and Zendaya. Their chemistry was incredible and both of their acting capabilities really showed in this film.The plot was also incredible. It had so many mind blowing twists and I was 100% captivated 100% of the time and I can honestly say that I spent half the film with my jaw physically dropping. Also the end credit scenes were two of the best end credit scenes that I've ever watched and blew my mind even further. Remember to stay for the end credits :) Also don't even get me started on the humour that features in this film. It's absolutely hilarious and ranks in my top 3 list of funniest MCU movies. My one criticism, and there is only one, is that because the plot was so dense and exciting, there were a few points where I was sat there wondering what was going on, although these periods were very brief as it is relatively easy to figure out in the end- what I'm trying to say is maybe don't bring kids under the age of ten as there may be a few bits they don't get.Basically- I loved every second of this film. It was a brilliant use of my time and money and I will probably watch it again and again. If you're reading this wondering whether this film is worth your time the answer is yes, for sure. It's totally brilliant and will really make you laugh, and also hold your breath within the span of 10 seconds. Go and watch it.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1205,EJ_The_Reviewer,Spider man far from home review,9,31 July 2019,"So, i was going into this movie hoping that it would be as good as homecoming.... and it was slightly better, here is why. also spoilers if you havent seen the movie.
1. tom holland. i cant stop talking about how awesome tom hollands spider man is, the other spider men were older and not very funny but tom holland captures the essence of peter parker, he i just perfect, he looks like a teenger and acts like a teenager would and even does somthing no other spider man did, he gave the character a queens accent, its someting very few people notice. but overal he is my favorite spider man.
2. it takes spider man out of new york. i loved that they took spidey to a new location for this movie. he had always been in new york and it was really cool to see him in a new setting.
3.jake gyllnhaal as mysterio. i loved jake as mysterio. his potrail as the character. it was somthing new and exciting and i loved the sort of mentor type relationship between peter and mysteiro.
4. the post credit scenes. the first post credit scene is where peter finds out that mysterio revealed his identity to the public and joe jonah jameson anounces it and he is played by none other then j.k simmons which will make fans of the sam rami spider man films go wild. and the second post credit scene it turns out that nick fury and maria hill are skrulls and shows that nick fury is up in space on a skrull ship probably helping them find a new home. and it expands the marvel universe with just that scene.
verdict. so if you are a spider man fan or a fan of the mcu you will probably like this movie, its fun, entertaining, and new. its a fresh take on the character and its a fun thrill ride that you could watch over and over. but if you were a fan of the rami films and are not looking foward to watching this you might like the first post credit scene and thats it. if you were a fan of marc webbs edgy spider man movies you wont like this because this is a funny movie that is very vibrent in many ways so you probably won enjoy this movie. if you are a casual movie go'er you will probably be very entertained and satisfied with this movie. so ill give it an A.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1207,caidjohnson,A heck of a lot better than Homecoming.,8,15 September 2019,"I'll be honest right off the bat, I didn't really like Homecoming.
In fact, I didn't like it because I felt like Tom Holland was too whiny, or maybe he didn't seem that amazing to me, or something... I'm not sure exactly what it was, I just didn't really care for the first one.So, I was hesitant to see this one, fearing I'd still have the same feelings for this current generation of Spiderman.
Thankfully, I actually enjoyed it quite a bit. I took my two daughters and my wife, my wife stayed awake for the whole film (this means the movie is good, as she'll fall asleep in almost every movie due to boredom), and I... actually... liked it.The acting was quite decent, Spiderman seemed a lot more confident than the first one, ""coming into his own"" sort of thing, the villain was surprising. Yeah, it was all quite good!I'm really interested to see how Sony is going to do the next one, what with Sony and Marvel having their falling out, but here's hoping it ends well.If a third doesn't get done in this generation, I feel like it'll become a cursed franchise, doomed to two before inevitably falling on its face.Who knows... :P",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1222,marcus_sparrow,"Best live-action Spider-man movie, and best stand-alone MCU movie so far",7,4 July 2019,"Story:
Oh... My... God. This movie is a road trip to Europe, to the mind of Peter Parker and to the amazing world of Spider-Man. While having older values, like the villain's motives, it has fresh new amazing ideas stored for Peter. He has to deal with so many things in this movie, while this one being shorter than Homecoming. He has to deal with his love for MJ, the loss of his mentor Tony Stark, he has to protect his friends, his identity, deal with the villain who is totally out of his mind, and even has a weird situation with his Aunt May, and her new partner (even tho that's just a joke storyline). And that's what always made Peter's character so loveable for many, because he has to deal with everything in the same time.Characters:
Peter's character and Tom Hollnad's overall performance was the best in this movie, and he finally had so much more stakes on hand, than in the previous movie.
MJ was more likeable and understandable and she and Peter's storyline worked together perfectly with one of the main themes of the movie, lies.
Peter's classmates and teachers were so goddamn hilarious, I had no laughs left after some huge laughs because I didn't left enough energy anymore :D They got a bit more character 'development'? At least we get to know them more.
I love Jake Gyllenhaal, so thanks Marvel. He as Quentin Beck is brilliant. The Volture portrayed by Michael Keaton in Homecoming still gets the slight edge for a better, and more original motivation, but Beck is great too, and the performance is just as good. Love both of them.Visuals: This movie looks like the 2018 video game's and the comics' love child, especially with those jaw dropping Mysterio scenes, the one on the construction site is one of the best sequences in the MCU, with ease. The fights were all Spidey like, fast paced and total mayhem at the end, but still very clear-cut. You just can follow it easily while being amazed by it.Sound: Made by Michael Giacchino who made the soundtrack for The Incredibles movies, which have really cool beats, and this movie has the better MCU soundtracks too. While the effects great as always.Verdict:
Far From Home is the most comic booky Marvel movie, and has similar elements to the PS4 game, and I just love it. Best stand alone movie, while being a weirdly shorter sequel, and has much more going on. Incredibly funny, and still has great drama. Interesting character work. And just an epic, wholesome movie with lots of surprises, even if it has some predictable plot twists or jokes, it still manages to make those enjoyable. Other Marvel movies mostly become worse when I think about them, but this one just keeps getting better. Works on every level, and gets me excited to Spidey's new adventure. Don't miss the mid and post credits scenes, post is good, the mid is the best in the MCU.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1223,eamonnkenny,Predictable with effects house issues,5,10 July 2019,"I was really looking forward to this movie but knew it was unlikely that it would live up to the quality and scope of Endgame. That said there wasn't that many trailers knocking around so immediately using the inverse rule of ""ads on buses"" = ""very poor movie"" I was then thinking this is going to be very good.I can't give it away, but the trailer tells you too much and if you are any way a laterial thinking you will know that it is selling you lots of red herrings. That said, the movie was then very predictable.As with Star Trek Beyond the score by Giachinno was incredibly poor and this is usually a good indication of a flop. If the movie is poor the soundtrack tends to be poor also.The backstory was relatively good, given modern evolution of drone technology and suchlike, and the use of Stark technologies was also very clear. But the mood and tone of the ""theatrical group"" in the movie was not set correctly at all. It was all pretentious and annoying.The effects were appalling also. This suggests that there was a whole set of effects houses at play and given pass failing you would think that Sony didn't come up with goods. Its very distracting watching a movie and saying to yourself, these effects are annoying me.Gyllenhaal and Zendaya were very good in the movie and almost were able to save it from complete doom. Zendaya's character was very strong with lots of good lines and it seems that some thought when in to her character.As for much of the scene's with drone attacks and non-interaction with mysterio this was a major failing. This made the film very weak. I just couldn't get over Happy's role. He was so poor.Overall the storyline was very weak. The lack of interaction with Mysterio and interaction with monsters was just foolish. The effects as well being so poor did not help the story along.Marvel is trying to be too happy but putting in grittiness which was needed. Basically its very difficult to beat Spider Man 2 where Peter is jumping between rotating exploding bombs in slow motion whilst being skimmed by blades. There was absolutely not grit in this movie. No stylisation. Very little emotional interaction as in Homecoming or recent movies, excluding ""Captain Marvel"" which was also a very weak movie.Overall, a very average movie.

1226,xjamesourownx,Far from Home,7,12 November 2019,"Homecoming was so much fun that, in a way, ""Far From Home"" had an almost impossible task. In the 10000000th reboot of the comic hero favourite, Marvel got it spot on, having this Spiderman be a geeky kid on a journey of self discovery, awkward in his neediness and unsure of his capabilities. Its created a vulnerable Spiderman that everyone can relate to and love and most importantly root for.Far From Home is post 'Endgame' and sees Spidey thrown into the unwanted position of being one of the few Avengers around. Now he has to take on a ew threat where things are not all they seem to be but no spoilers here.What lets this film down compared to its predecessor is there is a lack of surprises and character growth for Tom Holland to play with. However its still a lot of fun as we see him become night monkey and fight the forces of darkness once again, this time through various locations in Europe (I'm sure the writer just put some European cities on their wish list and wrote a movie around it just so they could stay).Its still a lot of fun and loveable.

1235,james-53665,The best spider man movie out there!,9,18 July 2019,"Spider Man Far From Home is a great movie, to keep it short and sweet.
There's so much in this movie that builds up to create an epic adventure, Tom Holland as always is excellent, he is without a doubt the best Spider Man we have had and personally I think Mysterio is one of the best MCU villains we have had along with Thanos.
What makes the movie stand out is the light hearted tone but the also serious story, it blends together very well without making the movie go tone deaf.
What I really loved about this movie was seeing Spider man suffer a defeat against Mysterio during one of the best and most breath-taking scenes in the movie and then overcoming that defeat to rise up and defeat Mysterio at the end!Jake Gyllenhaal's performance does not disappoint! he really does fool you at the beginning as you believe Quentin Beck is actually a good guy but If you know mysterio from the comics then your suspicions will be raised from the very beginning, the twist is very well down as it turns out Quentin does not actually have any powers, he is just a former employee of Tony Stark who is using drones to create holograms to make him look like a hero so he can get recognition from the world like the avengers do. This makes him a very compelling and smart villain.Overall I recommend this movie to anyone! It is an absolute blast and the best Spider man movie we have had yet.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1241,RKM343,This movie gives me a Peter Tingle,8,11 July 2019,"Over the past decade or more, Marvel has set the bar pretty high and will have to continue to produce solid films in the future to keep fans happy. Spider-Man Far from Home is a competently made film that gave me the ""feels."" The casting is absolutely incredible, and the addition of Jake Gyllenhall is a breath of fresh air. Mysterio is portrayed exactly like he is in the comics, so kudos to bringing him aboard. The rest of the gang are just as great as the first movie. MJ stands out in this round and is absolutely adorable, awkward, and eccentric, and makes you fall in love with her performance. Another solid performance from Ned, and his romantic relationship in Far from Home pretty much sums up teenage love.The action was stellar and had more clarity than the previous film, especially in the last battle. Call me crazy, but I like to actually see what is going on in a fight and Far from Home delivered. Marvel has great moments in every movie, but only one movie up to this point gave me a moment of awe, and that was Dr. Strange. The visuals in that movie were just insane, but there is a moment in this movie that will blow you away. I think that this one particular scene will have you legitimately wondering, ""how in the heck can you beat something like this?"" For a comic book movie to have me question something like that, makes me cry tears of joy.Of course, there are some flaws, particularly with exposition from one of the characters. This scene was so heavy handed that it might as well punch you straight in the face. Sometimes you don't have to come right out and tell us literally everything up to that point, you can simply show us a quick flashback or something and we will get it. Another disappointment was the lack of inclusion of Flash in most of the movie. I really enjoyed his jabs at Peter in the first film and was hoping he'd come out swinging. Instead we get introduced to a few throwaway characters, which was unfortunate.Overall, Spider-Man Far from Home is a wonderful escape from the somber comic book movies that have been more predominant over the past year or two, minus a few. It's getting harder and harder for me to justify giving high scores to comic book movies, unless there is a clever villain and compelling story, which this movie delivers on. Spider-Man Far from Home hits all of the hallmarks for a great film, so you should stop reading this, give me a ""helpful"" thumbs up and get yourself to a theater to watch!",Spider-Man - Far from Home

The writing, action, story, and characters are all at a higher caliber than we've seen in most of the previous MCU films. I did not once find myself bored. I was always entertained by some aspect of the movie. The high school romance, the elemental battles, and most of all Mysterio.Mysterio was the big highlight of this. I never thought I'd see Mysterio on the big screen and now we have him in movie where he is done PERFECTLY. He was absolutely flawless and a big stand out villain of the MCU.

1265,reepicheepsfriend,Solid sequel,9,20 July 2019,"This movie's challenge is following Endgame, and it does so as gracefully as can be expected. Those who are unfamiliar with the MCU might find some plot points confusing, but can probably enjoy the story as a whole.Peter is still a high schooler in this movie, and though he has matured a bit since Homecoming, his character still feels refreshingly youthful. There is a big difference in his motivation between Homecoming and Far From Home, though, brought about by the events of Infinity War and Endgame. All the characters are back in style, just as enjoyable as ever - MJ is much more important, and very skillfully played by Zendaya. This movie feels joyful and summery but still manages to address a very real issue, and give Peter some definitive character moments.My main complaint about this movie was that it felt too short! I wanted it to keep going, possibly having been influenced by Endgame's super-long runtime. However, it has everything a movie should have. I feel that it falls just a tiny bit short of the mark set by Homecoming, lacking something to live up to that one jaw-dropping moment in Homecoming (you know what I mean). Yet, it continues this Spider-Man's story very convincingly, so I can't really assign fault there.

The story, the cast, the jokes, the summer love, the action, everything in this movie are insanely amazing and a great ride. Even better than Endgame. Thanks Sony and Disney for playing well together and brought Spider-Man so much more value and important within the MCU. And guys, if you're a Marvel nerd like many of us, stay through the mid-credit and end-credit. So so important for future of MCU.Endgame didn't end that well with nothing to look forward to.

Incredible CGI, hilarious moments, fantastic acting from everyone involved, edge of the seat action, and a great plot twist.
The romance that always has to be in a Spider-Man movie was also very refreshing, as it didn't involve many of the cliches, and actually made sense during the course of the movie.
I also feel they managed to get everyone up to date on what happened in endgame without spoiling too much for those who haven't seen it yet.

But the way the MCU has clashed great comedy with the action that the original trilogy did right, just gives me what I want in a superhero movie-fun. Pure pure fun. I was surprised at myself a few years ago when I said Homecoming had become my favorite Spider Man movie. I'm even more surprised to say that Far From Home is now my SECOND favorite Spider Man movie.

I know it's a super hero movie but come on. Also I get the jokes, like as if he doesn't look exactly like himself when he uses that crown mask bc in super hero world everybody is oblivious and only used for cheering HAHAHH. No I get it, it's just poorly executed, it's a good idea if it was done right. I'm not offended by this btw, it's a common trope.Another gripe I had is the actors where too obvious on who they where and didn't line up right in the casting. This to me means bad acting, or just actors who are good but don't do many parts.The saving grace is his friends who knew who he was and had his back. I liked the interaction change once they where alone with the insiders.

1280,The_Crow18,"Weak, childish, and takes away from the independence of the character.",1,28 August 2021,"The MCU version of Spider-Man takes away everything we love about the character of Spider-Man and change it completely to appeal to a very specific demographic that doesn't allow the character to grow and evolve.Once again, Spider-Man in the MCU can't rely on its own strengths, without a constant support of more established characters in the MCU, smacking the hand of the little kiddo that has been degraded to a sidekick.Its already been five films (going on the sixth) portrayal of Holland's Spider-Man since the great 2016 Captain America's Civil War, and the character have still yet to grow, evolve, and learn the power or responsibility that comes with his powers.Either leaning on Stark's tech, that's now imprinted within the DNA of this interpretation, or have every Spider-Man villain connected to either Iron Man, or former more evolved arcs of the previous versions of the character (in the upcoming No Way Home).The result is a boring weak, unfunny, extremely childish film and story, that takes away from the tension of the action scenes and forgettable bland direction of Jon Watts, that seems more like a studio's ""Yes Man"" that put the pieces together of Feige and the executives have in mind.The motive of the villain is more than ridiculous to a point of it becomes parody of itself, with scenes that I don't know how they can get overlooked.You take away from an extremely independent character, and turn it to be completely dependent on other more charismatic cast, and characters, to lead and take control of the film, even if their screentime is significantly lower.The action scenes feels like a cheap CGI fest, with very little memorable scenes and thrills in between, and all happens so quickly, and poorly shot, that its hard to enjoy it.Spider-Man peaked with its former cinematic interpretation with the Raimi series.A director that understood the character, and grew and read on the source material and treated it with the respect it deserves.

Jake Gyllenhaal does a very good work with a good villain.But yet another villain motivated by Tony Stark.Peter doesn't learn responsability after two movies and the side characters are just so boring.The CGI is the best of this movie, and in a personal take I still doesn't like how the suit looks, but the final fight is greatI feel like the Spider-Man we find at the end of the movie is no different than the one we met at the start. I thought at the end of Homecoming he was gonna change, but it seems that this Peter doesn't evolve and doesn't learn what spider-man means, responsability and hope.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

He has been taken so far from his roots that he is now almost unrecognisable as the character that you fell in love with. Where is the little guy, fighting alone and using his brains as well as brawn to overcome incredible odds while having to deal with a sick Aunt May? Where is the burden of responsibility that failing to stop a burglar ending up creating? Whereas the MCU has given us some great moments (Iron Man, GOTG, Endgame etc), Sony's Homecoming and this latest effort have been rife with awful casting and ridiculous dialogue. The CGI, however, was impressive (as it should be), and the 'illusion' scenes with Mysterio (a very competent Jake G) were well staged, but this was by far the worst Spider-Man outing so far (and the worst of the MCU). The 5-year-olds may love it, but that's because they don't know any better.He's probably too nice of a guy to say it, but Sam Raimi must wonder what the hell he did wrong...Awful",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1288,jameslamplugh91,"Could have been better, but no bad.",6,14 September 2019,"I didn't mind this movie, it was a mindless CGI action movie, which is what I expected going in. Comparing it to films within that same genre, I would say its above average, if only slightly, so for me it was a solid 6 out of 10. Could have been a lot better but is better than a lot of other mindless CGI action movies.The premise/story was good in concept but the execution left a lot to be desired, riddled with plot holes it was hard to get invested and my suspension of disbelief was stretched a bit too far. The bad guy was interesting and had more development than a lot of other Marvel/DC villains on the big screen, unfortunately, his evil schemes are just as full of plot holes as the rest of the film, making it hard to buy into his plan.Great performances all the way around, Jake Gyllenhaal was spectacular as Mysterio, even hampered by the poor writing and plot holes, he was a great casting choice. The CGI and the visuals were spectacular and the film didn't disappoint for the most part.At the end of the day, I got exactly what I expected out of the film and I had fun with it. If you have little kids, they will absolutely love it and most of the plot holes and conveniences will go right over their heads.Would Recommend: 6/10 Stars",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1292,tristan-j_is,"Dope looking action, but lazy writing",7,2 July 2019,"The lazy storytelling didn't ruin the movie. The amazing action scenes, and brilliant performances saved it from that shortfall. But I believe the real thing that hindered this movie most was how it shined a light on how useless Spiderman is in the grand scheme of things. Don't get me wrong, I love Spiderman as a character, but you get a full view of how useless his super strength and webs are against otherworldly foes. Normally that wouldn't bother me, but when you are pitching him through the entire movie as the next Iron Man, you draw that comparison. I almost started to become annoyed watching him fight thinking of him supposedly filling those shoes. He was useless in almost every fight except the drones, and even then he was struggling. It was frustrating watching him. ESPECIALLY when they gave him the oppurtunity to make a suit and he stayed basic with it. No acidic webs? No combustible webs? You're going with just regular webs, not even blasters? Ok. Now I'm not saying that everything should be easy, but atleast make me believe he can win a fight. Not that he just wins because it was written that way. Still, great movie. This, and a few other minor things, were just issues for me. I still enjoyed it, it looked really cool, and I would recommend watching it to anyone.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1293,mack_89,How can you give this a 10?,5,9 August 2020,"First of all, i like to say that i have been a spiderman fan since i was just a small kid. This movie has like most of you know, made some huge changes to the old ones and to the comics as well. Spiderman is not a 24 year old journalist/student anymore, now instead he is a 15 year old kid. He is however still as educated as his old self, which to me makes no sense at all. He is still in love with M.J, but she is not a hot redhead anymore. Why changes her appearance? Aunt May is not an old woman, but a hot milf. Why?
Peter also has this new black friend (instead of the Harry Osbourne) and a new small and rich black bully in the class (instead of the white poor muscle head brock). Why?Now to the story. Peter is on a school trip to Venice, where the new hero (mysterio) arrives. He is played by Jack gyllenhaal, and he does an ok job i guess. The story is ok but it do however have some serious plotholes. Why is there no other heroes to help save the world? Does not make any sense. How can Peter survive been hot by a train? He is not superman you know. How come his spidersense does not work? In the comics it sure does so i dont understand why it should not work in this movie.This movie also tries so hard to make you laugh but does a poor job of delivering. Therefore i gave this movie a 5/10. But hey, if you dont care about plotholes, about the old spiderman movies or comics then by all means, this might be a movie for you.

1297,captaincreeepz,Not quite as good as Homecoming - and no where near be original trilogy,7,7 July 2019,"This will be without spoilers. Some MCU movies take a unique step and really tell a unique and captivating story, others feel a bit closer to filler movies and feel like just more of the same to pass time.Unfortunately, to me, Spider-Man: Far From Home felt like the latter. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good movie and it's nice to see our favourite characters back - but it does feel like a step downcompared to previous Spider-Man movies when it needed to take a bigger step if it were to live up to the originals.I don't believe there is much character development within this movie. Everything ends similarly to how it begins, and there isn't many scenes of the fallout/after the conflict part of the movie. The end credits scene is great, and absolutely should have been part of the movie.Make sure you know your MCU story pretty well, and are pretty connected to Tony Stark because it all plays a big part in the story - perhaps too big. The movie had a few too many references and I don't believe it can stand very well as it's own movie the way the originals could.For a reason I can't get into, a lot of the tension is quickly dissolved within the movie. The ending felt a little underwhelming compared to what were used to.With he above all said, I'm still going for a 7/10 because it's a good fun movie with lots of nice one liners, some good action and it's nice to see our favourite franchise back on the screen.

It may seem like Marvel is trying to fill Tony's gap with another character and while they do share some similarities, we are seeing something completely new.I love all of the Spider Man films and this, by far is my most favorite rendition of the character. His character feels so human and real, like it almost hits you somewhere that's somewhat familiar.The best part of this film was the very awkward, awkwardly realistic his relationship with MJ was. It was very fresh and wholesome and I love where they are going with it. And they probably showed the most realistic swing date reaction, like you know that's how a person would react normally.I am really looking forward to the future of the next phase of the Marvel franchise and hope to see this version of Spider Man take the lead.And I swear, I solemnly swear... if Sony or Disney, or whomever cancels this rendition of Spider Man...''You and I will be going to another funeral''.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

The storylines keep rebooting or ending too early because of money. First they did Raimi dirty and cut him off before he could have a definitive ending, and TASM1 was a nice change but 2 was trying to do too many things at once.

What I did not like about this movie was the tech used in it. I know what you are thinking. It is a comic book movie and they are allowed to skip some technicalities. What went too far for me was the glasses and the drones. First of all, did you think that the billion dollar glasses would have been handed to a kid who could just give them away? There should have been a fail safe to shut them off as soon as they were found out to be compromised. In computer science we call this an API token or key. It would have been as simple as changing the authentication token the key the glasses use to communicate with the satellite.

1303,audunystgaard,"I wish I could give this an 8/10, but some very specific parts made it lose two stars.",5,3 July 2019,"The actual plot of this movie was amazing. The concept of Mysterio and the monsters simply being an illusion to trick people into thinking that a new iron man was born, was a fascinating and original idea. Some of the parts in which they were remembering or talking about Tony Stark and his departure were quite good. The parts with Happy and Peter's aunt were great and set a little bit of a humorous tone every now and then for which the Marvel movies are known. When Mysterio had Peter in just one big illusion just manipulating him every step of the way was amazing. That scene alone was a 10/10.There were some details in the movie which were either really stupid or confusing. When Mysterio took Peter to put him into that ""virtual reality"", for lack of a better word, I didn't know if Nick Fury was actually Nick Fury there and did get a grasp of what was going on or not. So during the entire final action scene in London, I had no clue whether or not Nick knew what was going on or not. Also, when Peter called in the drone... How can it be possible that Peter, wearing the glasses which have full command over the drones, did not have time to cancel the attack when the missile had to launch and then fly all the way to earth from space to initiate the attack. It made no sense, and to be honest, that whole bus scene was a little bit ridiculous.Finally, the whole reason why this didn't get an 8/10:WHY DID THEY TURN THIS INTO A FREAKING CRINGY ASS TEENAGER ROMANCE?
Why? Why would they base almost all of their time outside the action on Peter trying to get some with a girl in his class. I'm all for some love and romance in movies, I often think they can enhance the story because we get more connected with the characters, but it was waaaaay too much. And the worst part of it all, every scene was as cringy as they could possibly have been. I don't care if the plot, the acting, the general directing, the cinematography, cgi etc. are good. If I am straight up uncomfortable in my chair while watching most of the non-action parts, I am going to point that out heavily in my rating.All in all, great action, great plot, cinematography was nothing different from every single marvel movie in the past few years it seems. The acting was great, the CGI was stunning, and Marvel is still able to do a great job with making the movies feel kind of comedic while still creating good action and story. Sadly, all is in vain when 20% of the movie for me is trying to shrink down in my chair almost closing my eyes because it's so uncomfortable to watch.

If placed in the Marvel universe, Spider-Man's growth and the missing feeling for Iron Man are enough to touch people deeply.
I was pretty sad the whole time when I watching the movie because I already know the ending and everything. Peter Park, the 16 years old boy, has suffered way too much. He is not Tony Stark, but everyone wants him to be. After the end game, he is no longer the young boy who is high-minded and dreaming to be the big hero to the world like he was in the Homecoming.

1314,sdumistracel,"Great summer blockbuster, with deep themes",10,5 July 2019,"I think I loved everything about this movie. Tom Holland was great, as always, but Jake Gyllenhaal was phenomenal. The humour was just right, like in any other Marvel movie (watch out for ""I Will Always Love You"" and Led Zeppelin), and the villain was, what can I say, intense, but great.
The things that happened in Endgame are really affecting the hero, and the whole movie addresses the theme of legacy. And oh boy, the visuals. I haven't felt that mesmerised by a movie's visuals since Doctor Strange.
Go watch this movie. I think it's a little better than the first one (which I also loved). And make sure to stay for the end credits scenes, as they give an insight into what is to come next.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Why Jake Gyllenhaal ever agreed to this is beyond me. Tom Holland is as annoying as ever. His schtick was funny during his first appearance in Civil War but now Spiderman has permanently become a neurotic Man Child Millennial. I am starting to prefer dancing Tobey over Tom.

I am definitely disappointed by the choice to put an insecure teenager, in the middle of an hormones storm given by puberty, to be a superhero. Perhaps they made this choice to capture teenagers attention and get them to the theaters, but it results in an idiot jumping around and get beaten by the bad guy all the time. He wins at the end because this is how it has to go, but i really doubt this could happen in practical. Too stupid to be a hero.

It kinda seems like an excuse for Marvel to keep Spidey longer in MCU. It doesn't feel like they tried to make a good Spider-Man film.

I went to watch this movie with high expectations but the first half was super cringe, filled with lame humor so much so that I felt like I was watching DC movie. The first part is just awful and just when I was about to be hopeless, second half kicks in and how. Amazing fight sequences, vfx and some great cinematography. Still persistent bad humor but all and all satisfying action at the end. It's not as good as the hype but it's watchable in theater for the final one hour.
Some major loopholes in the plot too. I mean Iron Man designed EDIS and has no failsafe not to be used against civilians or Tony's own successor Peter? It's just an insult to Tony's intellect. Also MJ and Peter's lovestory seems so forced. Ok that's it. Make your own call.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Right out of the gate I knew I was in for something much more than a super hero movie.Far From Home is an action packed, deep story with little to miss, beautiful action scented and quite frankly a rom-com. In a good way! Tom Holland is quite possibly the polarizing if the remaining Avengers. He's a kid who just happens to have an innate ability to be the goofiest but the smartest in the room.Mysterio might be the second best villain in the Marvel Universe behind Thanos. Jake Gyllenhall captures the classic essence of Mysterio.To a avoid spoilers, you will not be disappointed in this movie.

They were the perfect blend of dark, serious and with good comedic jokes. The villains had depth and none of them were bad for the sake of filling a role.I enjoyed them quite a lot as a child/teen and as I got older I now enjoy them for different reasons. They are very entertaining, which cannot be said with other works portraying spider-man, including this movie.I don't even know where to start... Who thought it would be a good idea to put Iron Man and spider-man in a blender and see what comes out? The jokes are horrible and repetitive. Counting how many times he took off the mask in public, you might think he was acting like a rock star and not as a vigilante protecting his secret identity in order to protect the lives of the people close to him.Plot holes a dime a dozen and the way everything was dumbed down to the point of being unwatchable. They say ""yeah but it's for kids so it must be like that""; but is that really true?

I had one in my mind and when watching the movie, it was different. My guess on Mysterio's role was nearly right bt wrong. So that's a great part. The visuals was lit.

It also had some sequences that in my opinion didn't work (like the drone attack on the bus that happened because of Peter)For me, the movie had two great moments that I consider to be some of the best scenes to happen in the MCU movies :I loved the whole scene where Peter arrives in Berlin and that ends with Peter being hit by a train. That was my favorite sequence in the whole movie.The scene where Mysterio nearly shoots Peter in the head was also awesome.So, a bit of a slow start with some weird pacing but some amazing action scenes, visual effects and a great villain.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1347,Basma123,A great way to wrap up phase three of the MCU,8,12 July 2019,"This movie takes place after the event of Avengers : endgame. It shows how the world and especially Peter parker, deal with a world without Tony Stark. The pacing is a bit slow in the beginning, which is understandable. It needed to adress everything that happened after the first snap (or blip) and the following one, both from a worldwide view, and spiderman's, but some scenes still felt too stretched out and didnt seem to add much to the story.
Tom Holland, yet again, portrays spiderman as I have imagined him while reading the comics. It was a delight to get see him be an actual teenager dealing with loss and love. The rest of the cast was amazing especially when watching the movie a second time and picking up on little clues about the movies' twist ending (endings if we count the post credit scene).
The dialogue was a bit cheesy and predictable at points, a little lacking when compared to the witty writing I've gotten used to in the MCUs movies lately but the cinematography, score and special effects made up for it.
The mid credit scene however, was the ultimate fanservice for me and any marvel fan who grew up watching the 2002-2007 movies.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Great plot, high stake action, and probably the best villan besides Thanos in the MCU to date. The action scenes had me on the edge of the seat, in a way that I haven't felt ever sense I went to see Infinity War. And Tom Holland's Spider-Man was obviously the best part of the movie.

Very boring scenes, has nothing to do with the movie, unoriginal dialogue, with uninteresting characters and actors. Really bad.Tom Holland could be reasonably good as spiderman, but not how they do it in this movie..
Jake Gyllenhaal is a good actor, but sorry, his character sucked. Both are just not convincing...There is too much bad comedy in the movie. Why do this? I don't understand..There is nothing serious in this movie and all is very boring.
None of the characters are serious, even for a popcorn spiderman movie. The special effects can not save this movie.
The story is very simple.This is absolutely nothing compared to Sam raimi films and Tobey Maguire's spiderman.The future of movies from USA is not looking good at all.The best scene was seeing J.K. Simmons. Man, what a perfect cast he was..",Spider-Man - Far from Home

It takes action choreography and storytelling to the next level and delivers every bit of the Spidey fun fans needed. Tom Holland as Spider-Man does a great job as usual, but Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio truly impresses big time. I can call it one of the best action films of the year so far.The film was so fast paced that when an hour passed away and the cinemas placed a random intermission, my first reaction was, ""What? Why so early?"" It was when I looked at the time I realized that an hour had gone already, and the film was so gripping that I didn't even feel the need to leave my seat. The second half went on to intensify with a couple of very serious moments, but also present were the heroic elevations that made the viewer not just cheer for Spidey but also feel that yes! He should fight and save the day!And of course, what's a great Spider-Man film without action? This film's biggest highlight are its white-knuckle action sequences. The stunt directors really went creative with the fights and other action scenes, and I couldn't help but feel exhilarated. Visual effects were done very well, and the cinematography, especially during the final fight, was outstanding.But what has really left me surprised is the mid-credits scene that has also made me restless to know what would happen next.Spider-Man: Far From Home is a top-notch action flick that has got something for everyone.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1368,deekleeshy,Fantastic Movie On Holland's Second Outing,8,26 July 2021,"After ""Homecoming"" being such a love letter to the Spider-Man character, I was cautious about what this movie could bring to the table and it did not disappoint, the themes really work here, a kid trying to get over the loss of a loved one, being burdened with responsibilities that fall on him at a time when he's just trying to take his mind off things and get the girl.Tom Holland is fantastic throughout, Zendaya is charming and you find yourself really rooting for them as a couple as they navigate the various pitfalls that Peter has to deal with while moonlighting as Spider-Man.The star of the show here really is Jake Gyllenhaal, to those who know the Marvel universe, it's obvious from the beginning that his character is not a good guy, but I know people who had no prior knowledge of Mysterio and Gyllenhaal's performance fooled them completely in the first half, he is charming, charismatic and manipulative in all the right ways!When it comes to visual sequences it doesn't get much better than Mysterios illusions in the third act, they way his ""powers"" are portrayed here is a fantastic representation of the character and whoever was in charge of that needs some serious kudos!So in summary, Far From Home is a fantastic movie, both in standalone terms and as a follow up to Homecoming & Avengers: Endgame.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1369,Splinter90,Far from Perfect,3,20 July 2019,"The Marvel blockbuster success formula is definitely showing signs of wear and tear. While Tom Holland gives an amazing performance, I couldn't connect with the story and side characters. I feel like real character development in those pivotal coming-of-age moment was siderailed for bigger (and also more chaotic) fight scenes.In contrast, the sequel to The Amazing Spider-Man gave us the best on-screen chemistry between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy while Andrew Garfield was also given much better and deeper material to connect with. The scenes in which he struggled with the normal versus the super life were just that much meatier and better handled, not to mention the romance between him and Gwen. That scene at the clocktower will always be my number one Spider-Man moment precisely because of a deeply rich character development and superbe acting performances.Here's hoping Phase IV will focus more on individual stories and favor character and plot development over bombastic CGI-heavy set pieces.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

My wife and my son (just turned 17) got asleep and I made an effort to finish watching this boring and stupid movie.

All these 10/10's really made me cringe almost as much as the movie itself. They then proceed to buy offshore bot companies to up vote all 10/10 reviews and down vote any critical review that is 8/10 or lower. It is quite clear to see that some people rate the movie 10/10 but in their review deconstructs how terrible the movie is. The bots up vote it only cause it's 10 and the algorithm is still in place. Sickening.Now onto the movie, frankly the Tone of this movie is most accurate to what a comic book movie should feel like. Corny! It really is corny and takes no apologies for it. I respect that. Tom Holland really is a great Peter Parker. Actually acts like a 16 year old. Jake Gyllenhaal really brought Mysterio to life. Costumes were great but had a bit too much CGI in them. But for the most part that is all I liked of the film.My main issue with this is the Comedy. It just was so much of the film and for me and my dad it never hit. I laughed at nothing not even the Samuel L. Jackson swear. It all felt just cringe worthy. Not much chemistry besides between Tom Holland and Jacob Batalon. Nothing like Thor Ragnarok where I actually found it funny. The funniest part was Mysterio saying ""Now this is an Avengers level threat!."" As it felt like a joke in of itself a parody of it. Worse part was I already saw it in thousands of memes on the internet.A big fault is how the movie seems to just forget the characterization of Peter from all the Avenger films where he grew and became more of an adult as he went through you know a Civil War, died technically for 5 years, and had 3 father figures die doing what they believe in. This stuff is the definition of Tone Deaf. Others have pointed out the continuity errors from previous movie so i wont get into it too much. The plot itself is actually pretty tight and logical albeit way over the top and dumb in of itself. Hence Corny. But at the same time you have Marisa Tomei as Aunt May always thought that was weird choice but here it gets cringe as opposed to corny. Am i supposed to be attracted to AUNT MAY!!!!????? There is a blurred line from Corny to Cringe and this one moves from one side to the next.Where I really lost it was how they went through Europe but it literally serves nothing to the plot at all. This could have all happened in New York and no one would have noticed. All they had to write instead of ""This is where the Elementals arrived in my world."" to ""All the elementals are coming to New York."" no one would have noticed. I wanted a stand alone Spider Man film with no Avenger exposition. Something that stands on it's own. Nope. Tony Stark guys!!! Mysterio is in Tony Stark's shadow. Isn't Uncle Ben, Peter's father figure, not Tony Stark? What?? Stan Lee Dies and they just ignore on the pre-established characterizations of everyone sort of like how the new Star Wars films did too. I would much preferred Mysterio's original origin as an actor/stuntman who was forgotten and chastised.It's one of those movies that the more you think about it at all you start going ""Huh? That didn't make sense."" Using Illusions generated by drones with Shocker (CAN YOU SEE THE NEXT VILLAIN GUYS) like blasts, rockets, and guns really leaves me scratching the head. How do we know anything we are seeing is ever real then like come on. And there in lies the beauty of it they can just go next movie like they did with Star Wars and write this genius level dialogue; ""Somehow Mysterio Survived because of an illusion."" The most interesting part was the end when Spider Man has everyone finding out he his Peter Parker. Would have made a way, way, way better film. I won't go into the confusion me and my dad had with the MJ character. Is that Mary Jane? The red headed beauty? No its Michelle Jones how could I be so stupid?!?!?!?!? Now let's see if all my reviews get down voted by the schills. I could go on and on about this film.A 6/10 at best but tired of the review brigading saying these Disney films are as good as Godfather, Lord of the Rings, Schindler's List etc. This cracks me up.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1377,stephypop212,One of the best spiderman movies so far,10,14 July 2019,"The movie starts off with answering the question, ""What happened to the students that ended up in the Blip"" and gives off the impression we're just about to sit through this film and find out how Peter Parker has been dealing with the events of Marvel's Avengers: Endgame. (Spoiler, it'll make you feel something if you're attached to these characters like I am).The actors in this film make it such an enjoyable experience, especially the chemistry between Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal, who really captivate the 'Struggling Hero/Villian' storyline. The CGI in this film is outstanding and needs its own appreciation.
The film in general is excitingly entertaining with the well timed comedic relief in an action film.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1380,tolga_ribery28,Loved It!,9,8 July 2019,I did not like the first movie and went to see this movie with lower expectations. However; I must say that; this movie is one of the best Marvel Movies. Ps: Experience it in Imax if you can.,Spider-Man - Far from Home
1381,winterlovery,Old style hero movie,6,4 July 2019,"I almost slept in movie theater and come on , who was real leader actor?",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1382,iKnowFilm,No depth at all,4,8 July 2019,"First of all, the stuff I liked: Mysterio's costume and illusions! I loved the fact that it was more classic and not trying to put a new ""modern real world"" spin on it. I liked how they showed the illusion suit as well as the ""behind the scenes"" suit (which I guess is their way of making a real world suit). I think they nailed the illusions and gave good explanation as to how the illusions were dangerous by using drones. It was top-notch stuff. Jake also played the part well. I don't think it was a masterful performance, but you can never go wrong with Jake.
Unfortunately, aside from that, there's not much to the movie that I actually liked.My biggest gripe in the movie were the jokes. A good Spider-Man movie needs a good amount of jokes. But this isn't Deadpool, not everything HAS to be a joke. It was as if they were worried that if there wasn't a joke every 30 seconds the audience would get bored. With the overwhelming need to insert joke after joke there was little room for anything else. There was no good buildup to important scenes, there was no deep meaningful dialog, no impactful plot development. Every scene appeared to be made just to get to the next joke.For example: Spider-Man's identity is an intracal part of who he is and a well kept secret for fear of people he loves getting hurt. This movie (and the last one, which I thought was better) turned it into a joke. Aunt May finds out he's Spider-Man, it's a joke. MJ finds out, it's a joke. Happy makes a comment that could somehow raise suspicion later about Spider-Man's identity because it was funny and they wanted another joke. Mysterio tells the world who Spider-Man is, it's an end of credits scene. Nothing is impactful. It's all played off as nothing really matters.Because they spend so much time making jokes there is little time to build actual worthwhile story. Peter gives Beck the glasses after 5 minutes of meeting him. Where was the build up, where was the emotional connection. There was none because they spent all the time before that making jokes. Again, nothing is impactful. (contrast all of this with a movie like Spider-Man 2 when his identity is reveled or anything else important happens, we feel it. It's heartfelt or suspenseful, everything wasn't all about jokes).Beck makes a speech about why he's a villain. It's one of the poorest ways to go about writing a story. They should show us, not tell us. Jake did a great job with the speech but again, it wasn't impactful. They didn't have time to invest us in his character because then when would they make jokes? So instead the character makes a speech to bring the audience up to speed so they can go back to making jokes. What if in Spider-Man 2 half the movie was jokes and then Dr. Octopus made a speech about why he's a villain instead of them showing us and making us invested in the character? It wouldn't have been as impactful. We wouldn't have really cared.
The reasons he was a villain was also poor. He was an angry ex Stark employee. Had nothing to do with Spider-Man, Spider-Man just got in the way. Can we PLEASE have a Spider-Man movie where Stark isn't taking over?Speaking of Stark taking over Spider-Man movies, in this one it's no different than the first. Spider-Man is being babysat by Stark, Fury, and Happy instead of being the awesome character he is in the comics or the other films. He's nothing without Stark tech and he's more like a foot soldier who's ordered around than someone who struggles and figures things out for himself. And when he wants to stop helping he sounds more like a brat than someone struggling with morality and the dynamic between is personal life and superhero life. He doesn't want to help when so much is at stake because he wants to hang out with his friends? He sounds like a kid who doesn't want to do his homework because he wants to go to a party. (again, contrast this with Spider-Man 2 and how impactful that one is because they took time to make you care about the things going on).Spider-Man is supposed to be someone who struggles and grows because he faces so much on his own. It's one of the main things that makes him a lovable character. But in this movie everyone seems to know who he is, he has billion dollar tech at his fingertips, he never has to really struggle mentally and come to terms with himself being a superhero, whether he's Peter or Spidey he's the man, he's just a brat kid that wants to forsake all that because he wants to go on a field trip...are you kidding me? It's like in Transformers 2 when Shai's character told Bumbelbee (a totally awesome robot that wanted to be friends with him) that he didn't want to be with him because he wanted a normal life...what kind of idiocy is that?There's more to why I think this is one of the worst Spider-Man movies (though I can still enjoy it) but these were the main reasons. They need to cut out a lot of the jokes and add depth and character to the next movie. If they did that it could go from entertaining to a masterpiece.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1383,garret-mccann,My new favorite MCU Villian,9,13 July 2019,"This is up there with the revolutionary Spider Man 2 by Raimi with Doc OC. Mysterio steals the show.

1386,jddv,Shockingly I...hated it...sorry,2,1 July 2019,"I know, I'm a bad person. I didn't like the cutesy schmaltz everybody else did. You can vilify me if you want, but if you're honest and fair, you'll at least hear me out.I don't know if the following would be considered a spoiler, as anyone who read an old spidey comic or saw any news on this movie would know Jake's (Gyllenhaal) character Mysterio was a baddy. But just in case you didn't, I'm labelling this as containing a spoiler. If you already know that fact, you can read on without fear of any other spoiler.I gave 2 stars because I liked JG as the antagonist. To make a character interesting and likeable when you already know he's only pretending to be good, then to be able to believably change and portray menace, that takes good acting talent. I think that was something that worked with Tom's (Hiddleston) portrayal of Loki originally, and Jake emulates that here.The rest of it was embarrassingly underwhelming. I did try to like it, like the bits from the trailer with Fury's comment about space and Flash's nut-punch, but it all just left me so flat by the end. I wasn't invested in Tom's (Holland) Spider-Man or Peter Parker, and it ended up feeling like I was sitting through movie to see how trailer highlights lined up.Did I miss something great here and I'm just not seeing it? Or does it feel this way because we were recently subjected to over 5 hours of Avengers finale (AIW&AE)? Probablymaybe time will tell...it'll still make more money than any of us will ever see in a lifetime. I hope you enjoyed it more than I did.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1410,mustaballama,"A superhero movie, nothing more, nothing less.",7,3 July 2019,"I enjoyed the film, the romance aspect was good. The plot was okay, it was predictable for Spiderman fans. The villain wasn't spectacular. (spoilers ahead- turn back now). This is because he was supposed to be introducing us to a multiverse but is actually just from the same universe as us, which is fine but they set the fans up to expect one thing, then plot twist, it's suddenly disappointing than what we expected, an introduction to the multiverse.I just didn't like anything about the villain because he wasn't creepy, wasn't scary, wasn't crazy, wasn't even normal like from the 1st Spiderman movie. He was just a guy good at tech hating on superheroes. The movie starts and Spiderman is at a bad place, the movie end, after the credit scene, he's at a worse place. So I didn't feel pumped after the movie, I didn't even feel any profound emotion. I was just like, ah they've set us up for the next one. Great. Like very marvel movie.I mean I love the characters aside from the villain, who I thought would be easy to defeat if Spiderman had just taken him out when he saw him on the bridge but instead fought with the drones wasting abit of time. It's not that I think it's a bad movie, it's abit unbelievable compared to the movies with Toby or Andrew. Because Spiderman is no longer the kid fighting petty crime, he's a rich kid now with huge amounts of tech, that's the marvel/Disney version of him I should have accepted by now though. I mean Iike character growth but I like simplicity and heart too. Which I didn't find too much of. I can't imagine a 16 year old going through the things he did and be able to fight that level of threat.Then a group of kids are going on a life threatening class trip and just continue with the trip. They're like, to Italy! gets attacked by a water monster, next, to Prague, gets attacked by a fire monster, to UK! I think I would have PTSD, after almost dying the first time around.
Good movie, and if I was better with words I could probably explain why I just didn't connect with it. Yet I recommend it, obviously. It's fun and worth the money spent.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1411,seblivingston,"Funny, character development lacking, a few other notes...",7,3 August 2019,"First off, this is a funny film, the comedic interjections are fairly well placed and of good humor. However, you may be caught off guard by a few elements.My first pet peeve with the Tom Holland-Peter Parker is that we have lost touch with Parker's scientific-geeky side, and where is the camera at, am I right? The second issue was the vacancy in Mysterio's character development and the failed dropshot throwback to his true identity. Then there is Mary Jane, which is a combination of awkward and tom-boyishness that seems offputting among other things.The shotty plot and half-decent relationship building make the film watchable but honestly for Marvel collectors like myself, a pain in the rear to have to buy in order to fulfill the obligatory ""Marvel Bluray Collection"". Tom Holland isn't the worst SpiderMan, but the writing and acting were off and I think he can redeem himself in the next film. We shall see.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1414,iamshiva19,Better Than Homecoming,8,15 July 2019,"First thing first, why in the world movies do that ""Removing Scenes that we've seen in the trailer""
the action scene in the trailer where Spiderman is fighting along with police is not in the movie.For the first time, Spiderman is not completely in NEW YORK, he is in London/Venice lets say Europe as peter is on a school trip.
In this trip, they encounter some crazy stuff including Mysterio.
after a very long time (since Tobey Maguire's Spiderman) we are seeing an actor taking steps to become Spiderman.
in this movie something is always happening, here peter barely has time to relax. On one hand, he is trying to impress MJ, spend time with his friends and trying to have a relaxing time after all that happened in ENDGAME and on the other hand is NICK FURY like we've got some problem so we need you.
And I have an awesome experience watching him figuring all this out.
Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio is awesome I mean he is Jake Gyllenhaal
but there should've been more information about Mysterio.
The action sequence in this movie was better than homecoming but there could've been more action a bit higher stakes

1416,ptgn123,Mediocre,2,7 July 2019,Jake Gylenhall is mediocre as Mysterio. Tom Holland is good at playing the goofy Peter Parker and not much else. When did Spider-Man need stark tech to be a super hero. He doesn't. The crap joke about the spider sense. It's sad when the best scene is the mid credits scene with JK Simmons back as J Jonah Jameson. The only hint of Ben Parker is the initials on peters suitcase. Ben is the reason peter is who he is and why Spider-Man is such a good super hero. MJ is horrible. Zendaya can't act at all. Her lines are dry and without emotion. They need to recast desperately for the MJ character. I don't mind the race change or the fact that her name isn't Mary Jane. All in all this movie is middle of the road and a let down. Should have brought back Michael Keaton as the vulture. He was the best thing about Spider-Man homecoming.,Spider-Man - Far from Home
1417,adriandunwell,One of the better MCU films 9/10,9,22 July 2019,"I went to watch this on the week of its opening, and it was brilliant! The film as a whole was very entertaining, and yes the formula is standard for Marvel now but it worked well here.The villain was better than most MCU villains and actually (following a post credit scene), really left our hero with a dire consequence.
I loved the whole Drone aspect as it was not too far from our current technological advances so the feel felt more grounded.The follow on from Endgame and Tony Starks death really was a key plot point here, and they pulled it off expertly with the glasses he leaves for Peter. The action sequences were fun and exciting, and there was more emphasis on Peter's spider senses here which was nice. The reason I have marked it down by 1 star is because I feel they could have utilised Jake Gyllenhaal a bit more given his talent and screen presence. And there is also one scene in a bar that felt WAY too heavy on exposition.Apart from that, its worth the ticket price! Go see it! 9/10",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Tom Holland was fantastic in his role once again but Jake Gyllenhal stole the show as Mysterio.

1426,jtgarcia-13987,Jon Watts just doesn't understand,4,30 September 2019,"Jon Watts doesn't understand Spider-Man. Spider-Man isn't supposed to be a hero relying on Iron Man's technology. These movies rely way too much on Iron Man and the MCU itself. It can't stand on it's own. This Spider-Man doesn't actually feel like Spider-Man. Spider-Man is supposed to be a hero who actually struggles, solves his own problems with his intellect and skill, and takes responsibility with consequences. Also, a MAJOR part of Spider-Man's character is supposed to be his relationship with Uncle Ben. The fact that Uncle Ben hasn't even been mentioned is really upsetting and kind of feels like a slap to the face for us Spider-Man fans. Instead, we've got Iron Man as Spider-Man's father figure and Iron Man just gives him gadgets rather than teaching him important lessons and how to take responsibility. I have it a 7 because it was at least enjoyable. Also, the villain was kind of ehh. This isn't Spider-Man.

1431,virginiatide,"Was OK, once was enough for me tho",7,8 July 2019,"I think Marvel may be heading in a direction I'm not particularly interested in e.g. trying to hook in the up-and-coming generation and keep the dollars rolling in for the next 10 years.Well, OK, I've never been a big Spidey fan. That said, think Tom Holland is a very good actor and a fine choice for Spidey.But, lately from IW on, just getting the feeling Marvel just isn't paying that much attention to doing stories with any real depth - lots of fluff, or trying to churn up Tumblr angst. Or something. Wasn't too happy with the hammering away at the Stark/Spidey relationship, as IMO it's not realistic anyway. Unlike previous movies where we've seen relationships built up, along the way it gets implied Peter had this huge relationship with Stark. I don't remember that - and I mean seeing lots of everyday moments; spending time, that kind of thing.E.g. it was the same with Captain Marvel - I get TOLD there's a ""thing"", but I never get to see the thing. Anymore it's like Marvel just wants to TELL me something and that's it. Also the hamfisted imitation of Iron Man building stuff that shows up - Tony ostensibly passing the torch, or Peter channeling Tony - boringly blunt treatment for me.Also IMO Jake Gyllenthal was wasted - and lots of IMO over-use (e.g. cheap to do) acid trip effects at one point. It's not IMO that this isn't fun to watch, and has some good moments. I just didn't feel much of anything, and ended up really, really, missing the more complex Vulture of Homecoming. This film was too cutesy for me, and at the same time seemed to throw away opportunities for cameos where other MCU characters could have showed up.It's fine, especially if you are a teen or preteen. But IMO pretty lightweight and done with some cost cutting, tho the Mysterio effects are pretty good. Kind of like watching a teen movie on the Disney channel. Just not something I need to see again.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Tom Holland is growing on me as everybodys favorite friendly neighborhood SPIDERMAN. Jake Ghyllnhal as MYSTERIO is AMAZING I love how he has a crew of disenfranchised Tony Stark employees helping him create illusions of elemental monsters rampaging all over Europe so that he can fight the monsters and be a bigger hero than the GREAT IRON MAN AKA TONY STARK HIMSELF SERIOUSLY DON'T LISTEN TO NEGATIVE REVIEWS SPIDERMAN FAR FROM HOME IS AWESOME IT'S AS GOOD AS AVENGERS ENDGAME,Spider-Man - Far from Home
1447,jasonchristopherbecker,Another Bad Spider-Man Sequel,4,3 September 2019,"I am among the majority of people who believe Tom Holland to be the best Spider-Man to date (except for Shameik Moore as Miles Morales, of course), but not even Holland's depiction of the iconic Peter Parker could salvage a screenplay riddled with so many blatant plot holes.For the first hour of the movie, as well as the trailers leading up to its release, the viewer is made to believe that Mysterio, alter ego Quentin Beck, is not a villain, but another superhero. But anyone remotely familiar with the Spider-Man comics will know him to be a villain (I've read only a handful of them, and I knew this going in). And while we're entertaining the possibility that the writers inverted his role in this movie, we're given dull ""villains"" to face. Mindless elementals are not compelling as villains and add to the obviousness of Mysterio's clear purpose in the movie.When it's finally revealed that Mysterio was indeed playing Parker to get to EDITH, we are bombarded with the worst vomiting of exposition I have ever seen in a movie. Beck speaks for what feels like ten minutes to illuminate us of backstories for characters that we don't care about and that the writers apparently don't care about either, as they're seen minimally in the rest of the movie.Once Beck finally has EDITH, he's discovered to be a charlatan much like the Mandarin from Iron Man 3 (which should have been indicative that this style of villain is inadequate). Quentin's lack of powers makes for a lackluster and unsatisfying final battle, as Parker fights a bunch of drones, rather than having much of a real combat with Mysterio at all.The Doctor Strange-like scene where Mysterio traps Spider-Man in illusion
after illusion makes for a really cool cinematic experience, which ultimately becomes hollow when Mysterio never uses the illusions to that extent again. He could have used this technique later to deal with Spider-Man, but instead he projects his Godzilla creature and makes Parker believe he's dead for about three seconds.Other issues:
As much as I like Maria Hill, she has no place in this movie. She wasn't even included as a deus ex machina or anything; she's just there. Even Cobie Smulders seems to know how extraneous her character was, as the few lines she does have are uttered lackadaisically.Nick Fury, while not as irrelevant as Hill, really doesn't need to be in every single Marvel movie. Happy could have likely filled much of the role of mentor/boss for Parker, or better yet, Hill could have done the job and actually have mattered.MJ was an interesting character in Homecoming because she defied the giggly schoolgirl trope from the previous Spider-Man franchises. In Far From Home, her character reverts back to that archetype, because god forbid Peter fall for someone who is more distant and sarcastic.Overall, a huge disappointment, but I suppose I shouldn't be surprised with a Spider-Man sequel being bad.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1448,aishwaryarao-97231,MCU at its best,8,16 July 2019,"Spiderman has been the friendly neighbourhood hero on screens for nearly a decade and improving on such a fan favourite character would seem unlikely. This movie succeeds at doing just that. Marvel has managed to modernise my personal favourite superhero making him possibly the best version of Spiderman. Tom Holland has done a fantastic job at portraying a school boy with typical insecurities who is a still novice super hero. Given that he is still a teen the movie has perfectly adapted to that setting and doesn't overdo the romantic aspect. At the same time his loss for his mentor is perfectly captured with mentions of Tony Stark pulling the right emotional strings.The story line is very predictable, probably the only ""flaw"" with this otherwise perfect movie. However, I would not condemn or blame the pellucid story, I believe the movie succeeded at its aim, getting the audience to sympathise with the protagonist and enjoy his journey.The supporting cast have done a great job and enhanced the entire ""childhood"" experience.I loved the concept of the movie and its attempts to remind us not to trust what we read/hear daily. It raised some questions about the legitimacy of the news, the internet and wrapped this moral into a super-villain who is very deceptive. Unlike regular villains Mysterio doesn't posses any extraordinary powers, he merely bends our belief using technology which is a reminder of what social media has the capacity to do.All in all this movie is a brilliant stand alone, and in my personal (although controversial) opinion, better than its predecessor and End game.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1468,henrikoellrich,Almost as good as Sam Raimi's first two Spidey movies,8,10 July 2019,"Far from Home tells both an interesting MCU story and typical, fun Spider-Man adventure. It goes deeper into Peter Parker's character and gives him a great arc. The movie focuses a lot on Tony Stark's legacy, which nicely puts Phase 3 to an end. The humor is pretty fun, even better than Homecoming's. Overall, it is far superior to its last 3/4 predecessor Spidey movies and only time will tell if it is able to reach the greatness of Spider-Man 1 and 2.
But Far from Home also has 2 bigger flaws: it overuses CGI and the scene where the bad guy explains his evil plan to his henchmen for no reason is kinda lazy exposition writing.
Still the movie has some great memorable scenes, especially the grand finale was greatly executed!",Spider-Man - Far from Home

He is willing to risk his life to save his friends and crush and he starts being more responsible and be something bigger and better as his character and personality grows by becoming an Avenger.
I also have to admit that the movie got me real good. I was laughing all time, it entertained me from the beginning to the end. The actors did an outstanding job. There are also a lot of nice plot twists throughout the movie.

1474,reddevil-94693,"Not Perfect, But Very Good",8,7 July 2019,"Closing out the third phase of the MCU is Spider-Man: Far From Home, and it does a good job setting up the status quo going forward, even if it is a little clumsy at it.After the events of Endgame (I'm honestly trying to fill the space of the preview so I don't spoil everything for the two people who haven't seen it), the world is trying to get back to normal. The ""Blip"", as the Snap is now called, has thrust everyone into a world that had already been forced to move on, leading to a few humorous clips such as a basketball game being interrupted by the sudden return of a five year old team. Beyond this and Aunt May's attempts to help those displaced by the Blip (F.E.A.S.T. shelter, perhaps?), though, we don't see too much of the impact, and the film focuses more on the impact Tony Stark left behind when he died.Iron Man is all over this movie, and that's not a complaint. He was *the* Avenger, and the world is still reeling from his death, including Peter, who is now asked to fill the shoes Stark left behind. Seeing Peter's struggles to accept that he's no longer simply a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man is one of the highlights of the film, as is how it ties to the villain Mysterio. Yes, despite the trailers trying to trick you Mysterio is indeed the villain. However, the way it's revealed, and the actual details of his plot and... well, everything else about him, is very clever, and very true to his character. I won't go into too much detail on that because it's honestly worth the price of admission by itself. Jake Gyllenhaal is awesome in the role, and brings a charisma you expect from MCU villains, though his motive isn't as Thanos-y, thank God.As for the school trip part, that's actually one of my criticisms. The biggest issue to me is that the film feels a little too fast paced, even for it's two hour runtime. I'm not saying two and a half hours would've been better, but I do believe more could have been done to keep the pacing from spiraling out of control. Once the Mysterio reveal happens, things begin to click better, but that's still the first half (maybe a bit more) that feels a bit too breakneck. There's also a scene that they either forgot to put in the final movie, or they just wanted some trailer fodder. Either way, I feel the movie is worse for it.Overall, Far From Home is very good. It's not as good as Homecoming, and it won't be hanging out with the top ten of the MCU, but it's an enjoyable experience that advances Peter's story, as well as the status of the MCU moving forward. Hopefully, Sony and Marvel Studios can continue their deal, because this is one series k can honestly say I'm not ready to end yet. Partly because I think Sony would just reboot the character again.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1477,adith-39480,The new ironman😀,8,2 July 2019,Spiderman: Far From Home' is a clever entry in the sprawling Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story packs unpredictable twists with crisp writing. Excellent performance as expected of Tom Holland as Spiderman. The performance of the supporting cast is suprisingly good especially Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio whose charming and sinister turn ranks on par with Josh Brolin's Thanos and Tom Hiddleston's Loki as one of the most well written and memorable superhero villains of recent times. The teen romance drama is not bad either. My only complaint is the lack of gravitas in the first half of the otherwise high stakes plot.,Spider-Man - Far from Home

1481,MaxKurkk,A great spider-man movie and a better Marvel movie,10,1 July 2019,"Didn't expect to have so much fun watching the movie the first time with my kid, so had another watch on my own. Still loved it.I liked Homecoming, but this one is different. It's smarter, for some part more thrilling and weirdly more realistic. The concept is interesting, something about the current time we're living in. The movie starts fun but is not afraid of provoking thoughts. Oh by the way, my girl wants to go to Europe right after watching the movie - it is a great commercial for European tourism!The performance is great as the previous one. Tom Holland is so good, both as Peter Parker and Spider-man. Sometimes he's with mask and you can only see his eyes, but those eyes can tell you his emotion so well. I don't know what about him, but his performance is subtle yet convincing, and most importantly can get to you. Jake Gyllenhaal is fantastic, which reminds me of one of his previous fine work. I can tell he enjoys it so much. Zendaya is surprisingly good at this role, and her chemistry with Tom Holland is relatable and adorable. The other students and teachers are also very good, delivering fun conversations or physical humour throughout the movie.But it is the combination of plot and visual effects got me hooked. After watching so many superhero movies, it is easy to get used to CGI and huge fighting scenes - this one is not over the top but manages to deliver something different and extraodinary. The plot is interesting, especially the ending (you have to watch the two credit scenes).In the end it is a movie about self discovery of a teenager. But it doesn't take itself too seriously.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1482,egalv,How to treat Spiderman like a joke,6,12 April 2020,"Should this movie even be called a sequel. It does absolutely nothing different and nothing original from the first movie. Homecoming was good but not great, but considering that this movie was supposed to serve as an epilogue of Avengers Endgame, I was hoping it would at least it little more serious than the last movie, and show us how Peter Parker tries to deal with his grief of Tony's death, whilst also trying to save the world. But unfortunately the director of the movie decided that he wasn't going to put almost any effort in this movie. It turned out to be just another high school field trip movie. But didn't we already get that in the last movie? The beginning of the movie was actually pretty good, but of course, Marvel had a way of ruining the movie afterwards. The only good scenes were the scene in the bar with Mysterious, the final battle was decent. And the mid-credits scene was amazing. I was honestly willing to forgive this movie after giving us J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. It was pure fan service for those who grew up with the Tobey Maguire movies such as myself, and that's why I loved it. However, the post-credits scene just ruined the movie for me all over again. As it turns out, Nick Fury and Maria Hill were just skrulls this whole time, and Nick Fury was just on vacation the whole time. Fury literally did nothing in Infinity War and Endgame, so what the hell does he need a break for? This movie was a waste of hype, and I don't even know if I should give Spiderman 3 a chance anymore. I would tell you to not watch this if you haven't already, but you'll most likely see it anyway. But If you do end up seeing this movie, I won't blame you if you consider it a waste of time. This movie holds no place in the Infinity Saga, and honestly I don't care what Kevin Fiege says. Endgame stands as the true ending to the Infinity Saga.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1485,MartinHfromG,"Entertaining and Smart Movie, learned from Mistakes",8,12 July 2019,"I didn't like Spider-Man Homecoming (Too much Iron Spidey, too much High School, Spidey afraid of Heights, annoying Humour, inappropriate Twist, Spidey was incapable and so on) but Far From Home is really much better and it seems Jon Watts took the Critics serious.
First I was irritated by the Bashing of Tobey Maguire and the Hype around Tom Holland, claiming Tom was more Comic accurate in Homecoming. That Statement is arguable if You read the first 40 years of Spider-Man Comics. You can't compare them, and You shouldn't. Tobey was surprisingly good at that time, and now Tom shows he is also good in this movie.The Movie is entertaining from the Beginning to the End. And it nearly seems Watts read my Points of criticism and worked on them. Less Stark Hightech in Peters Suit, nearly no High School, Spidey jumping from high heights and swinging from high Buildings, great Humour, great Twists.
The Nostalgia was well dosed and the Explanation of some Questions after Endgame was good. The Chemistry between Peter and Ned works pretty good and Peters Attempts to get closer to MJ were entertaining.The Special Effects and the Action were great and perfectly on Point and increased in the Right Speed to the End.
The Atmosphere in Europe was also great and the Setting provided whole new Ideas to the Story. And as I said the Twists were good (even if You know one of them if You read the Comics), and the last Twist was surprisingly good.On the negative Side the Chemistry between MJ and Peter is more like between Siblings. And some Actors are still wrong casted but that is the Problem since Homecoming.What I wish and expect for the next Movie: More Swinging through New York. Peter going to College (what will probably not happen since the End implies that the movie will happen right after this one). Even More dangerous Enemies (Carnage would be Crazy).

1487,ojoon,"A Marvel movie that does justice to Spider-Man, Peter Parker and teenagers",10,26 July 2019,"I'm gonna say something controversial, I don't like Spider-Man : Homecoming, it's borderline painful to watch, not even gonna lie, Spider-Man playing a layman's version of himself, with the rest of the movie saddled with tiring battle scenes and teenage incense that isn't really all that charming, yeah, the predecessor improves like a dent on a tin can, like it isn't even visible anymore.
Spider-Man : Far From Home could potentially be one of the best movies of the year, I mean, it already is the best movie of 2019 so far, in my humble opinion, of course.
There's literally nothing to contravene here, it's the perfect superhero flick, with adrenaline pumping battle scenes, twists that doesn't sell themselves too much, three dimensional characters, all juxtaposed against a youthful glow that shines throughout the movie.
In this sequel, we see a Peter Parker that's more competent, more grounded and less heavy handed with his missions.
Ever since that tragic passing of Tony Stark aka Iron Man in Avengers : Endgame, you can tell that there's real pressure being ingressed in Peter's vernal cranium, he can't take all the responsibilities being pressed against him, and that despite all his powers and the stakes he's gone through as a superhero whom millions of kids look up to as their afflatus, he's still no less coequal to all of them, only with superpowers.
Throughout the movie, we get to see him struggle with his moonlighting as Spider-Man and putting that on the same equilibrium with his life as a regular 16 year old teenage kid who only wants to propose to the girl of his dreams and hang out with his friends.
And, I won't lie, that made me felt that, like, I relate to that.
It's not nice living in two worlds and also living up to everybody's expectations, and the movie executes that turmoil arduously and adroitly.
The rest of the characters, such as Mysterio, who is devilishly tricky with a working twist to his character, is responsible for some of the best special effects in the movie, just as long as you are not faint-hearted to see poor Spider-Man being tossed around in his illusions in one scene, MJ straddles the line between being charming and arrogant and her burgeoning romance with Peter Parker, who couldn't muster the courage to wear his heart on his sleeves, ends up with a cute result when they kiss in the end, the same can be said for the rest of the romance here, the bubbly relationship between Peter's friend, Ned and his girl is as frivolous and tounge-in-cheek as it is meaningful, where the meaning is that, when you drift apart with someone you love, those memories that you share together, will stay in each of you, and, I'm not mincing words here, the romance factor in the movie is highly welcomed and appreciated, it's cute, it's funny, it's relatable, it's making me giddy.
Flash also gets to shine, it's always nice to see a bully being bullied, and that's why he is such a delight to watch, the two bumbling teachers that's present on the children's road trip also supplies enough inane humor, and of course, Nick Fury, who's laid back and weary as ever.
The sense of humor shouldn't be overlooked as well as the unexpected quips, one-liners and awkward exchange in conversations just keeps on coming out like a spider's web.
From the weird romance between Ned and his girl, to Happy confessing his love for Aunt May in a tense situation, a reference to Power Rangers and Voltron Force when describing Mysterio's DIY apparitions, all the way to the Spidey sense being ""upgraded"" to the Peter tinkle, the movie hardly ever gets boring and it entertains regardless of what's going on in the movie.
As a whole, Spider-Man : Far From Home is a ridiculously fun popcorn fodder with tense action scenes, clever twists, amazing display of charisma from all the characters, along with romance that's actually cute, relatable and harmless, instead of the amorous vibes we get from The Amazing Spider-Man movies, yeah, Spider-Man : Far From Home is one of the best superhero movies in a long time, and without a doubt, I'm calling it, the best Spider-Man movie, hands down.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1496,zachanders,A Worthy Sequel,7,5 September 2019,"Spider-Man Far From Home was a phenomenal film, representing the character of Spidey almost perfectly. The cast is easily one of the best and most memorable out of the MCU, with great young actors. Tom Holland once again does good as both Peter and Spider-Man, and Jake Ghylenall is a great addition to Mysterio, who feels like he was put on screen with all the right aspects of personality and ego.I prefer this film to Homecoming (2017), solely because I think the director really improves in story and makes flowing action sequences that are much more appealing and exhilarating. The special effects and CGI are notably exceptional, a huge improvement from Homecoming's somewhat spotty CGI.Some of my small complaints with this movie is that much of the comedy falls flat and feels unnecessary. Quite a bit of the jokes could be cut in order to benefit the dramatic scenes. Also, the 1st act of the film up until Peter suits up with the night suit, is a bit slow, and could've been paced a whole lot better.SPOILERS
The scene in which Peter Parker sends the missile to his classmate in the bus could be cut, for it's a little too outlandish and weird. It was probably the most unnecessary scene in the entire run-time.What I did love was Mysterio's illusions against Peter, such as how he saw Tony Stark's grave, how he landed in a snow globe of NYC, and how Peter was hit by a train in the end - it was all very exhilarating, and the CG effects were absolutely jaw-dropping.
Finally, I can't forget mentioning the SPECTACULAR mid credit scene in which J Jonah Jamenson shows up. I never expected such a thing to happen. I was so happy and it is now one of my favorite mid-credit scenes of all time.In conclusion, this movie is as amazing as it is for the simple fact that the 2nd and 3rd acts dominate the run-time and tower over the 1st.
Since I have now seen FFH twice, I give it a score of 8/10.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1497,gabbiebenjamin,Mind-blowing action film,8,5 September 2019,"Spider-Man: Far From Home is an instant classic. With its simultaneous tones of humor and intensity, the film provides its own unique spin on a very well-known superhero. While on a class trip to Europe, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) meets his match when Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) hinders his romantic summer plans. Far From Home was an exciting, thrilling adventure where Peter becomes entangled in a mentally exhausting battle with the all-powerful master of illusions. Holland and Gyllenhaal maintain perfect chemistry from beginning to end-- a young kid who simply wants to enjoy a break from constant heroism and a vengeful wizard who desperately seeks fame and attention. Even if you don't usually enjoy Marvel movies, this one is sure to keep you at the edge of your seat and fill you with both tears of laughter and joy.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1506,sacr-79839,How do I put this...,3,5 October 2020,"I hate this movie. The fact that I gave it a four has to do more with the fact that I feel an obligation to recognize the work done by those who are not in charge of the creative process, because the truth of the matter is that under no circumstance this is a terribly made movie. It is just fundamentally flawed from the get go. I think it's necessary for me to disclouse the fact that I love Spider-Man Homecoming. It's probably the best live-action Spider-Man movie. And I loved it because it had balls. It had the balls to throw a building on Peter Parker and make him cry out for help, only for him to realize that no one is coming for him and he has to save himself. It had the balls to negate Peter have his cake and eat it too, given that to defeat Vulture he sacrificed the possibility of being with his crush Liz. And it had balls because they didn't make the more comercially healthy decision of turning the Spider-Man franchise into a default Avengers movie because Sony wanted to make more money. They made it clear that Spider-Man is his own hero and he looks out for the little guy, the kind of person Vulture declared himself to be. But the truth is that all the ballsy things Homecoming did where thrown into a dumpster fire. I don't know if I have to blame Sony, Marvel or the creative team for the disastrous decisions they made with the character of Peter Parker and the direction it had to take. But I digress. Let's be more concrete.For starters, I cannot comprehend for the life of me, why this film was made out to be the ending of Phase Three of the MCU. It doesn't make sense at all. I get the impression that they wanted to tie up some loose ends (that in my opinion were not loose ends at all), but in reality, that kind of statement takes away from the impact that Endgame had as an emotional, satisfying ending to the Infinity Saga. This may seem to be unimportant, but the outlook that this movie has on the events of that movie - and the effects it has over its protagonist - is a very relevant cornerstone to constitute the failure that this movie is. Establishing this movie as the epilogue of phase three goes to show a certain carelessness for the emotional impact of the film that precede it. And this isn't only to the effects of Endgame. It happens with Homecoming as well.So if I have to give some sort of credit to the tonal and story consistency of this film is the fact that it does FEEL like a sequel to Homecoming. But that itself raises an issue. By keeping a tonal consistency with a movie that happened before the cataclysmic events that happened in both Infinity War and Endgame (both films having the pressence of Spider-Man in their narrative) is just illogical. It makes absolutely no sense to make a Spider-Man movie as if the events shown in the two previous films are irrelevant to Peter Parker's character. I mean, he died and came back to life. He is not gonna suffer any kind of trauma given the nature of such an event? I guess he is not, because now we are of to a dumb teen comedy. And this has an effect over the plot and character consistency within its structure. For instance, there's no logical reason for the story to take Spider-Man to Europe. It's just a cashgrab. Remember that I praised this movie for being tonally consistant with Homecoming? Now that is out the window, cause the ending of that film had the implication that Spider-Man would stay as a protector of the little guy and given the nature of the events shown in this movie, he is not protecting the little guy at all, he's fighting for the safety of the world (supposedly, I guess). Another thing that bothers me is this crush that Peter develops on ""MJ"". And I think that it has to do with the fact that Zendaya is playing her. Because I get that her and Tom Holland may have good chemistry, but the thing is that the character is completely different from Zendaya, that being one of the reasons why she worked well in Homecoming. Them having chemistry doesn't mean that they are immediatly compatible. The characters at least. You need to develop the relationship. You can't just make it appear out of thin air. As an audience member I have to buy the idea of the characters being attracted to each other and in reality I donnot think that. And the worst about this is that they try to make something as efective as what was done in Homecoming with Liz, when Peter dumps her at the dance, by establishing this ""plan"" that Peter has to gift MJ a necklace at the Eiffel Tower and never even going to Paris. But the thing is that you're not really thinking about that after the first fight in Venice. And this may come to be irrelevant if you take into account the Iron Man element of it all. I cannot believe that even when dead, Iron Man is still the most relevant character of this franchise, considering that this is the movie about the most interesting character in the Marvel catalogue (in my opinion, of course). Yet, we're still stuck with ""Dad Tony"" being the soul motivation for Peter and his enemies. At least in Homecoming it made sense for Vulture to be pissed off at Stark. Peter was supposed to walk away from what Stark meant as a mentor and become a more complete hero. Be his own person. And yet, everything still revoltes around his figure. This is probably what bothers me the most: the fact that a movie makes a character progres for the next one to throw it away for its own convinience. For being lazy at what they do.I heard a lot of people say that Spider-Man wasn't Spider-Man in Homecoming, an idea that I thorougly agree with, but not in the way you would think. I agree because it is the point. Peter has to become Spider-Man ON HIS OWN. That's the lesson that Homecoming delivers. His motivation is separate from Tony Stark. He is just, sort of an obstacle in his path forward into becoming the amazing, spectacular, ultimate, whatever one of those Spider-Man. That's why I love Homecoming. But this movie does everything wrong in that department. It takes exactly what it didn't have to take from Homecoming and expanded on it while throwing away all the things that made the movie great. And at the same time, it took everything from Infinity War and Endgame, it rehashed it, and yelled ""TONY IS ALL THERE IS!"" as loud as it could.I would go on, but I have a class to attend in 10 minutes. The truth is that this is deffinitely the most dissapointing movie of 2019. I see certain redeemable qualities (I like Jake Gyllenhaal's performance and I think that, conceptually, Mysterio was an interesting villain), but the thing is that this is supposed to be a Spider-Man movie. And I think that's not really the case. It's just pretending to be one. I don't want to hate over some people's tastes, but I do think this lazy filmmaking. Just throw things at the wall in the hopes that a large audience consumes it, which prooved to be a successful strategy (at least in this case and some others this very year). I hope they proove me wrong in the third part, considering that they have a golden opportunity of taking the character into a more interesting direction given the mid-credit scene of this movie. But as this review shows, I don't think that I can trust this creative team with that. And with last week's news (that Jamie Foxx is returning to play Electro, with a supposed Spider-Verse in the way) appearing to be true, I believe this franchise has taken a one way ticket to self-destruction. I frankly hope to be mistaken. But Sony has prooved to don't care about what they're doing if it makes them money. I will see the sequel to this movie, for my undying love for the character but my expectations are non existant, considering what this movie did to an almost perfect beginning for a new interpretation of the character. But it seems that these movies are not about character, but about Fanservice. And that's my greatest fear for the cinematographic industry to come.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1507,bommenashobharani,So many twists.,10,18 November 2020,There were so many twists in the movie discovering with Nick fury any Mysterio and it was so funny,Spider-Man - Far from Home
1508,maxmonteza,A great way to end the Infinity Saga and Third Phase of the MCU,9,7 December 2020,"Spiderman Far from Home is a really great film. Watching this movie, I enjoyed how suspenseful, action-packed and interesting it was. The special effects were fantastic especially during certain scenes. Some scenes that display this can be found when Peter uses EDITH, when Mysterio uses Illusions against Peter and the major battle against the drones and of course when Spiderman uses his awesome abilities. Some other scenes where this evident include the time when Spiderman creates a new suit from Stark's technology. It also gives a nice sequel to End Game. Plot twists and unusual surprising occurrences also play a big role in the movie as well. For example, when it is revealed that Mysterio is not who he says he is and the audience sees he is actually a bad guy working to exact vengeance. Instead of helping the world, he wants to destroy it and then get the credit for being a fake hero.
Watching this movie, I totally thought Mysterio was similar to Ironman and I was actually very surprised to find that he was not a hero, but a fake pretending to be a hero and look like an Avenger when he really is not. I definitely did not expect him to have a reason to exact vengeance on Tony Stark. I kind of feel bad for the fact that all Mysterio wanted was recognition and no body listened to him. The actions him and his team caused were brilliant but also so wrong on so many levels. His actions are not justified but I understand why he is angry.One scene with great special effects is when Peter uses EDITH as this shows advanced technology and gives a resounding answer to the question of Tony Stark's legacy. Tony Stark has passed down his legacy to Spiderman giving Peter access to Tony's satellite strike drones. He also has access to Tony Stark's suit design technology. It was really cool to see Peter designing his suit similar to the way Tony Stark designed his Iron man suit. Him and Tony share some similarities like the fact that they are both intelligent and good at math and science are able to apply this logic to their suits. Peter also shows his knowledge of certain topics that most sixteen-year-old young men do not really know yet. For example, Peter knows a lot about making a suit which is not a common skill.
Another scene which has phenomenal special effects is when Peter is on the inside of the huge illusion in London. He has penetrated the illusion and is watching how the drones are able to create this massive image. The really interesting part of the movie at the end, is that there is a possibility that Mysterio also known as Peter's worst enemy at the moment, can still be alive. At the end of the movie, Mysterio supposedly said his final words to Peter and died. When Peter asked EDITH if it was real, EDITH could have responded that the illusions from Stark's drones were down. That did not mean team Mysterio's original drones were not functioning at that exact moment. Before Peter hands over EDITH, Team Mysterio is still creating damage with their own drones and using projected illusions. For example, the battles of the fake water, earth, and fire elementals. These active drones could be using an illusion so Peter believes Mysterio is dead. For confirmation, at the end of the movie, Team Mysterio gets a download and it is revealed there are still active drones. Mysterio may still be alive. This could play out for future Spiderman movies with Peter Parker.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Come on men , Spider Man 2 is one of the best superhero movies ever. Also, Why is MJ so weird, it's cringe how she talks about all that weird stuff, SHE IS A WEIRDO.

1511,hbasaran,Augmented reality and augmented Spidey meets augmented ratings...,4,18 September 2019,"I don't know when this nonsense will come to an end but it really piss the ""real"" (not augmented?) people off... Spider-Man: Far from Home seems to be a greedy attempt to sell more tickets by using European geographic and it's just a mediocre movie. Spammy 10/10 ratings (with usually one sentence reviews) from the fake IMDb accounts are laughable. I hope IMDb will find a solution to obstruct them in the next century. ^_^In the movie, everything is ""so-called"" like Spider-Man. Everything is over-exaggerated like augmented reality. The fact is, expected reality basis is absent even though we're watching a fiction movie. The movie is not convincing in its own habitat in any way and it's really hard to watch especially for an adult who has been grown up with reading Marvel comics. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 is still the best even though Tom Holland is the best Spidey actor ever. I wish we can see him in better Spider-Man movies in the future.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1512,scarletdavies-11972,Good for everyone,8,19 July 2021,"Spiderman FFH was a great Marvel movie that was entertaining and (most importantly) portrayed the teenage characters realistically. Instead of depicting them like fully-grown adults, the humour is quite immature at times and the romance between Peter and MJ becomes quite awkward and childlike. The storyline juxtaposes this with Spiderman's adventures, which are (of course) beyond fantastical and makes sure the reader never becomes bored. All the characters are likeable and the film never drags or becomes dull.The only thing I didn't like about the film was the lack of suspense about the villain, since Mysterio is revealed to have other intentions about halfway through the film and I felt that it tainted the rest of the film. But overall, the film was great to watch and suits all age-ranges.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

This rating is a disgrace and spitting in the face to all greatest movies in the past that became cult and reference. This movie is 'far from quality' and far from any respect to the viewer.
It is funny that some 'Paid to review' reviewers falsifyingly state that 'this is the best Marvel' movie. This industry became lowest of lowest and reviews can be true but in the same time can be gross raising (if you engage enough ghostwriters to pretend to be real viewers and reviewrs). With cartoonish CGI, amateurish acting and kindergarten level plot this movie doesn't deserve to be a warm up screener to some action movies in last two decades.

1520,stefff3000,It's a lot of fun!,9,3 July 2019,"One sense the scenarists had to integrate the event in Avengers Infinity War and Endgame, it's the worst part of the movie since it feels forced and unbelievable that the characters in the first spiderman were all affected by the event at the end of Infinity War and what followed.
That said, this movie is a lot of fun, and a feast for the eyes. Sure, if you knew the characters from the comics, you will not be surprised by the twist in the tale, and even if you didn't know them from the comics, you'll feel the twist coming from a mile away. But, since it doesn't ruin the plot and because the movie is served by flawless direction, flawless visual effects and a lot of laughs, there's not much to complain about.
I will not spoil the story for those who haven't seen the movie yet, suffice to say it's a hell of a ride with great actors, great action and good humour, all you want from a summer super-hero blockbuster.

HOWEVER, with Sony in charge of the marketing and advertising, of course they screwed it up and took two stars off of my review. The trailers contained bits and pieces of almost EVERY scene in the movie, INCLUDING A POST CREDITS SCENE. How do you screw that up? Sony needs to sell the license to Marvel so this doesn't happen again. I should not feel like this during a movie of my favorite hero. How did they screw this up after Into the Spider-Verse blew my mind without showing me almost the whole movie in trailers? Back on topic, if you enjoy Spider-Man (especially if you grew up with the Raimi trilogy and developed a near obsession with it like me) you'll have a good time (great cameo at the end btw).",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1526,by_all,"Smart, kind, good and witty, that's my Spidy",9,25 September 2019,"Spidy has always been my favorite hero, I grew up watching the cartoons in the 90s. What I loved about him that he was a troubled student, always trying his best, was never perfect and was always good. Smart, kind, witty and good. He did always solve his problems and defeat villains with the most developed muscle of his body: his brain. That's what's been missing from ALL Spiderman movies. Tobey Maguire's trilogy was good, we loved seeing the Spiderman swinging from the buildings in the big screen for the first time, it was such a rush. But I always thought he was too good looking to be Spiderman. And his version of Spiderman was way more socially awkward than it's supposed to be. I'm gonna call it: The character was written as stupid, barely showed any sign of mediocre intelligence. Third movie just made it unbearable with the terrible haircut and acting.
Tom's Spiderman is a win from these perspectives: He's smart, he's not strikingly good-looking (you need to pay attention to see his beauty) and he's not a desperate loser in his social life.
In the final fight against Mysterio (what a terrific performance from Jake Gyllenhaal), when Spidy ran out of webs, he quickly made a plan with what's available, made a small experiment, then created his own bomb to take down the drones, yes that was my favorite part of the movie. Spidy going sciency...
Marvel cinematic universe has stayed true to the core of Spidy's character while updating his social life with friends from diverse backgrounds (and gave aunt May a face lift). Yes Iron Man played a much bigger role in the movies than it's supposed to be, but we can give the multi billion dollar franchise a pass for trying to keep the universe plausible and integrated.
I also liked the new approach on MJ, an intelligent, grunge girl who is acquainted with the unbearable lightness of being... Loved her t-shirts!
Now he's been called-out by his worst enemy, JJ Jonah, I can't wait to see a slightly mature and confident Spidy, hated by the press, taking down bad guys with his never ending fight chatter :)) I hope despite the big reveal, they can somehow manage to keep his identity secret though... Him trying to do his best, but failing to be there for the people he loves because he's saving the city, was such an integral part of Spidy's story and was the essential source of conflict in his social life... I guess Marvel Spidy will never have to deliver pizzas... How do you feel about that Sony?",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1527,sahinsenol,WOW RealLifeComicBook on the big screen,10,3 July 2019,"Let's keep this clear, I really love Toby Maguire as Spiderman and i was blown away by the performance of Andrew Garfield as the Amazing Spider-man and also I was really salty after the open end of AS2 and the information about a reboot...
A reboot called Spider-Man Homecoming...
And after my first sighting in the cinema I was really disappointed... it doesn't felt like Spider-Man.
But with my second and third time watching the movie, i regret my first decision and with all the entry's in other Marvel movies I startet to really like the New Spider-Man.
And now we are here :Spider-Man far from HomeAnd wow what can i say!?!?
This is by far the best marvel movie of the MCU!
All the time I had this feeling like i'm 12 years old again and reading a super exiting comic book with my all time favorite hero...
All the Charakters worked out very well:Tom Holland a very good performance as our friendly Spider from the neighborhood, good job man!Jake Gyllenhaal has the easy game here, He'a like Mr. charming and its really easy to find sympathy for him.Samuel L Jackson Nick Fu*king Fury, anything else to say ;)My all time favorite Jon Favereau as Happy Hogan ! You have to love this guy...And Last but not least Jacob Batalon as Peters friend Ned.
He will bring you to laugh more than you think...All the actors have done a great job, and I hope to get more of that in the future movies...
The effects are jaw breaking intense !!!!
I want to keep it short :Veridict:Spider-Man far from home is the best Marvel movie that was ever made, they really captured the essence of a comic book, with all the greatness and action stuffed scenes and definitely with a nice touch of humor...

1528,glenndavidson1019,Great acting but predictable and lazy writing.,5,16 August 2019,"As a huge Spider-man fan I was very excited to see this film, especially after the terrific job Tom Holland has done across his other MCU appearances. However, this entire movie relies on the weight of it's actors to carry it.Let me start with the positives:
Every single actor in this film delivered a terrific performance.The action scenes are stunning and very fun to watch.There are several laugh out loud moments that land perfectly.Now the negatives:
The plot is very predictable, and if you have any knowledge of the characters then you're simply waiting on the twist to reveal itself, which isn't satisfying in the least.There is no sense of danger for the Web-head as he seems completely impervious to any form of damage.The antagonist's method of fighting Spidey is a very tough pill to swallow, even when you grant suspension of disbelief.Overall it was okay, but the bar was set so high that the entire film felt more like fan-service than it did a well-rounded super-hero movie. But hey, at least it's better than Spiderman 3.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1531,jwilce,"This is not the spidey movie we need right now, but it is the one we deserve",6,27 July 2019,"As a serious movie (but not comic book) fan, I came in wanting to love this film. Homecoming was a relatively low stakes but engaging and fun high school spiderman adventure. This film certainly ramped up the stakes and the high school plotline but fell completely flat (for me at least) in terms of the action, suspense and villain.Jake Gyllenhall provides a characteristically flawless performance, but with the character he is given, it simply isn't enough. At a really dumb level, superhero movies need things for the superhero to fight - 'minions' if you will. Without them, there's no opportunity for small wins, showboating and well, cool stuff! There are no minions in this film and there are no New York minor crime preventions which are the bread and butter of Spiderman.Ultimately my favourite part of the film is just the plain old webslinging at the end, and that has nothing to do with the main plot and ins clearly put in to abate fans of the Sam Raimi films. There were strong laughs, interesting-ish themes, a lot of showing off locations but after the immeasurable success of Marvel to date, I'm not surprised we were left with an uninspired rip off of the Incredibles.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Far from Home has a great mix of everything, and I loved that they really expanded on MJ's character which really helped the chemistry between her and Peter grow.

Tom Holland still great as Spider-Man, Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent as always and the action sequences as well as the visuals are a big improvement over ""Homecoming"".The comedy still delivers some really good jokes throughout 80% of the time, the runtime of 2 hours feels right and it's entertaining throughout the entire time. My only issues are how much exposition the movie uses in it's dialogue, some of the jokes are lame, the 3D doesn't add a thing to the experience and while I do really like Mysterio I still think Vulture is a better villain compared to him. But overall this a really solid addition to the MCU and an improvement over the last Spider-Man entry, and if you're already invested in the MCU (which is something odd to not be after all this time) than definitely go see it.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

But, these new movies have at most 1 swinging scene and I feel that the Spider-man movie is incomplete without those swinging scenes and catching the bad guys.

1576,maquetalx,"Weak, dull, dissapointing",6,6 July 2019,"I came to this movie with high hopes and as a Spidey fan ""Far From Home"" really had every reason to be good, with great actors such as Tom Holland, Samuel Jackson or Jake Gyllenhaal.And indeed, they did perform well, I mean they did their best to say useless, unnececessary, bold one-liners. Zendaya really just annoyed me. The chemistry between MJ, her character and Peter Parker made me really think they were 8 year-olds, made me cringe. The directors tried to make her look extremely intelligent and they really forced it, and you could feel it, she was more of a ""know-it-all"". Mysterio was an interesting character in the comics but the reason of his rage didn't seem to be natural or genuine in this movie which made him very less credible. Even Ned whom I loved in Homecoming seemed more superfcial and less funny. I really liked Nick Fury though in this film.Nevertheless, I have to say the action sequences were simply amazing, the special effects incredibly satisfying. The fight scenes are cool but this does not hide the seemingly short time spent on the script.In conclusion, if you want a big Marvel summer popcorn blockbuster with money spent only in the effects department, go and watch it, it's still somehow entertaining according to the reviews, can't understand why it's so high. It simply brings nothing new to the franchise.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Spider-Man, played by Tom Holland, is overwhelmed by the fact that he has to step up in Tony Stark's shoes, although what he really wants is just a vacation away from all the superhero stuff, where he plans to confess his feelings towards MJ, portraied by Zendaya.
Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio was perfect, I just wish his story arc was presented more in-depth, I wish they would've offered us more info about his backstory, what actually was given to us being a brief presentation of his origins. The twist consisting of him actually being the villain was predictable, considering that the trailer showed Spidey teaming up with him. Some particular scenes make absolutely no sense, this aspect being masked with comedy,hoping you will forget the weak-ish plot.
I liked the fact that the movie was pretty well balanced, Peter always being caught up in some fights, which would interrupt the few chances he had to tell MJ how he feels about her. The action scenes were a lot more intense than the ones in Homecoming, they seemed more confident this time. My favourite part was when Spidey had to fight Mysterio's illusions. That scene looked amazing. Another satisfying aspect was seeing Peter act just like Tony while designing his new suit.
Leaving behind the heavily predictable storyline, the post credit scene was pretty great, I'm really looking forward to see what they will do in the next movie, leaving us with a cliffhanger, while the end credits scene was absolutely unnecessary. I must say that I would've liked to see how they handle the fact that MJ knows Spider-Man's true identity a bit more, the post credit scene revealing his secret seeming maybe a tiny bit rushed.

Tom Holland does a great job at portraying the many aspects of Peter's high school and superhero journey. The two post credit scenes left me with my mouth on the floor and very excited to see the next phase of the MCU. Mysterio was the perfect pick for this movie as he's the master of illusions which has really helped Peter learn to master his spider senses though I did hope that he would've been in future films I can't see why Marvel decided to do what they did.

And whilst everyone likes Jake Gyllenhaal, his character simply isn't a good villain. It's difficult to make a normal man into a good superhero villain and for me it didn't work. As soon as I saw the main villain was simply a man I was disappointed. I wanted to see Spidey up against a worthy foe, instead of a man with metal wings, or in this case a man with a suped up VR set.
It's still entertaining but after leaving Thanos behind this didn't feel like a worthy follow up.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

At their destination, the villain conveniently pops up out of no where and of course Peter is conflicted with assuming the Spider Man persona.I can't say I've liked a single Spider-Man movie, each one has the exact same story line:
Introduction (repetitive rubber stamp genesis story)Love Interest (Mary Jane - holy rubber stamp story Batman)Villain introductionLove InterestVillain Fight (usually including the heroine)Love InterestEndMovie creation people ""WE ALL KNOW WHO SPIDER MAN IS AND HOW HE GOT HIS POWERS"" so please, cut the filler and show a super hero doing super hero feats instead of this low self esteem teenager, groveling and desperate for acceptance.I grew up watching and loving Spider Man cartoons, comics and overall characterization, so I once was a big fan of the character, huge fan of Marvel, even like Avengers.. but they consistently screw up Spider Man movies like they consistently massacre Super Man movies.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

But this movie evolved the MCU Spider-Man. He's both a good Peter, and a good Spider-Man.
For anyone who follows the MCU, this is a must see.
If you just follow Spider-Man.... well I suggest you watch the previous movies just because it will make more sense. It's a long long binge, but at least watch from Civil War forward.

Tom Holland as Spider-Man does a great job as usual, but Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio truly impresses big time. I can call it one of the best action films of the year so far.The film was so fast paced that when an hour passed away and the cinemas placed a random intermission, my first reaction was, ""What? Why so early?"" It was when I looked at the time I realized that an hour had gone already, and the film was so gripping that I didn't even feel the need to leave my seat. The second half went on to intensify with a couple of very serious moments, but also present were the heroic elevations that made the viewer not just cheer for Spidey but also feel that yes! he should fight and save the day!And of course, what's a great Spider-Man film without action? This film's biggest highlight are its white-knuckle action sequences. The stunt directors really went creative with the fights and other action scenes, and I couldn't help but feel exhilarated. Visual effects were done very well, and the cinematography, especially during the final fight, was outstanding.But what has really left me surprised is the mid-credits scene that has also made me restless to know what would happen next.Spider-Man: Far From Home is a top-notch action flick that has got something for everyone.10/10.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

The movie picks up shortly after Avengers: Endgame and does a good job at continuing the Marvel Cinematic Universe into it's next phase, paying homage to lost Avengers and moving forward with it's remaining characters. The movie is lighthearted and funny. Tom Holland (Peter Parker / Spider-Man) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Quentin Beck / Mysterio) carry the film with exceptional acting. Special effects were awesome, especially for Mysterio's bit. And you'll want to stay after the movie for two after-credit scenes. One is half way after the credits (having huge circumstances), and the other at the very end. Overall, I quite enjoyed the movie. Spider-Man Homecoming was a bit better in my opinion, only because Michael Keaton did such a great job as The Vulture.

1614,kuman-23155,Unexpectedly amazing.,9,6 July 2019,"When I was booking tickets for this movie, I didn't think much of it. Obviously I expected it to be good, being an MCU movie. But not much more than that. I even had second thoughts regarding watching it in the theaters. I'm glad I watched it. This movie was surprisingly good for a spider-Man movie. I even regard it as one of the best phase 3 movie, right up there with GOTG vol.2.Apart from the stunning visuals, the way this movie connected with some of the older MCU movies was also a welcome surprise. Jake Gyllenhaal nailed the role of mysterio. And the director also did justice to this spider-Man's top foes. They had us all reeled in till the end.This movie also, in some way, evolved our friendly neighbourhood spider-Man in such a way that he relied upon his gifted skills and mind rather than the gifted tech.It was fun to watch Spider-Man charge into the eye of the Hurricane through the raging storms, dodging and deflecting all that his opponent threw at him, just like in the comics and the animated series. But despite all the action and the breathtaking scenes, the movie also had some of the best MCU's comedic scenes, cleverly placed and executed at the right time.The lack of any post credit or an end credit scene in Avengers endgame was a bit disappointing, but I guess the Russos wanted to emphasize on the fact that endgame conveyed the end of an era. But Far from home made up for it by having 2 end credit scenes, both of them containing plot twists and forshadowing the phase 4, and maybe even beyond. So I'd stick around for that.All in all, if you're thinking of watching it, just go and watch it. This movie was really a good way to end phase 3. And after watching it, I'm excited for the future!",Spider-Man - Far from Home

This film was a wild ride from start to finish, it's definitely one of my personal favorite MCU movies. With that out of the way, let me address some of the issues I have with this film.The pacing in the first 20 minutes was a little bit too fast, everything kind of just breezes by. Especially the opening sequence, which just happens so quickly and doesn't let you take in what just happened. But after this stretch of the film, the pacing becomes much better. It's kinda like Captain Marvel, except you can actually understand what's happening. My second issue was the overly long exposition scene where Mysterio's revealed as a villain, it goes on for way too long and is just a pretty lazy way to explain Mysterio's originsOther than that, the rest of the movie is great. Tom Holland as usual, has a great performance as Peter Parker. Jake Gyllenhaal was also a really good Mysterio. He is definitely a standout MCU villain. Peter and MJ have really good chemistry and it makes it even more satisfying when they finally get together.The action sequences were way better and more creative than the ones in Homecoming. The first two action scenes were pretty fun and are better than most of the fights in Homecoming, the final battle was also very fun and engaging and definitely had some fun visuals. But they're nothing compared to the illusion sequence. That sequence is one of my favorite sequences in the MCU, it is so bizarre and creative, that I could talk about all day.This review isn't complete without the post credits scenes, they are some of the best in the MCU. J.K. Simmons' cameo in this film was fantastic and it's a very surprising scene that sets up the next film. The second post credits scene was also great, the reveal of the Fury and Hill being Skrulls justifies them being tricked by Mysterio and also makes for a fun scene.Overall, this is definitely a pretty great movie.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

I was a fan of the Tobey Maguire movies, and this one reminded me of those - lots of action, great humor and a (slight) love story.

Tom Holland is wholesome, potentially one of the best younger actors to ever play such a big role. His goofy and good-natured charisma which suits the friendly neighbourhood Spiderman perfectly makes you ask how could anyone else possibly play this role.Mysterio might not be the most interesting villain especially after the Blip, and I suppose after Endgame any superhero plot will feel quite lacking in substance, but Far from Home manages to be a good film to conclude the phase with.

Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio is easily the best part of this film. Despite me knowing mysterio was already a villain, I wasn't sure how they'd switch him from good to bad without it being cliché, and was pleasantly surprised. One problem I have is how close the camera is, since this movie is advertised for it's locations but we don't see much. I will say that even though Mysterio was entertaining, he wasn't as well written as the previous Spider-Man Vulture. The visuals are also great, and the music has an excellent score. What confuses me is with Spider-Man's first encounter with Mysterio and the first elemental, no one apparently recognizes him when he's just wearing some party mask. There's minor plotholes like that are thrown all around the film but overall I'd say give it a watch.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

The movie is an absolute roller coaster of thrill, comedy, fun, and amazing chemistry between characters from beginning to end.
I cannot commend Tom Holland enough for his amazing performance as Peter Parker. He plays the character most similar to the dorky, lovable, heroic, charismatic Peter we see in spider-man comics and as a spider-man fanboy since childhood i cannot love him more.

Mid credit scene was brilliant, it did what a mid credit scene should do, making you excited for the sequel.

1652,eriknferguson,what the what happened here?,2,13 October 2019,"I'm impeccably disappointed.I'm someone who doesn't care in the least about superhero movies in general, but I fell in love with the Tom Holland iteration of Spiderman because his appearances in recent MCU movies were characterized by such wit, humor, energetic pacing, and real pathos.All of the above disappears here, despite the facts that the acting elevates the script, and that this movie was evidently directed by the same guy who did _Homecoming_, which I generally adore._Far From Home_ seems to have been intended in large part as a kind of springboard for the future potential of the character, but everything falls flat. Is the problem simply that such elevation of the story was too much for Jon Watts to handle? I'm inclined to think that that's the case, but I'm nonetheless befuddled, because _Homecoming_ had so many flourishes of witty and sympathetic insight.... I fully expected that Mr. Watts's talents there would have shined through here, but this one feels like it was directed by an entirely different and boring creature with no handle whatsoever on what makes Spiderman, like... fun.I'm grateful that the cash-loving Sony/MCU/Illuminati(?) executives finally recently found a way to contractually allow Hollandspiderman to continue to be a part of the established MCU narrative, because changing the current combination of actor/character/filmuniverse would suck 80% of the fun out of said universe. Therefore, I say this to the executives, etc., who may have driven _Far From Home_ into the ground: If you did anything to derail Watts's instincts during the making of this movie, *please* back off and let him do his thing in the upcoming Spiderman installments.On the other hand, if it was simply too much for Mr. Watts to balance character development against general enjoyability this time around, please turn the direction of future SM movies over to Taika Waititi. After all, he was the guy who made me care about frikkin' Thor.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

I liked this film for what it was, an entertaining blockbuster, and yet I cannot escape the fact that while the MCU is better for the presence of Spider-Man, Spider-Man is way better outside the MCU.First the good. I loved Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio, Tom Holland is the definitive Peter Parker now and he has great chemistry with his classmates, the take on MJ is interesting and Zendaya is brilliant, some of the action scenes are among the best in Marvel movies.Its the constant need to tie everything back to the MCU in that acts as a yoke around the films neck. Even in death Iron Man is the driving force of the film. He's shoehorned in as Mysterio's motivation and worse, in this universe, Spider-Man clearly lives in Iron Man's shadow. The movie spends too much time grappling with whether Peter Parker is ready to take Iron Man's mantle. In doing so, it completely loses what makes Spider-Man unique. Spider-Man is not Iron man and yet the MCU basically needs him to be - it is only by drawing on Iron Mans technology and his people (especially Happy) that he can defeat Mysterio.What happens, is that this film is clearly an MCU film first, a Peter Parker film second and a Spider-Man film a distant third. Spider-Man just doesn't fit in the MCU.This film is fun, it sits as a perfectly serviceable film in the Marvel canon.But.... if you want a film that gets the essence of Spider-Man watch Into the Spider-Verse, the first two Tobey Macquire movies or even Homecoming.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

There are moments that for those who pay attention are borderline laughable. Lets start with the villain, played by Jake G. a choice i would call briliant for most movies, seems like a quick cash grab on his part, this is again a villain that is more connected to Iron Man than to Spider-man, something we already saw in Homecoming.Michael Keaton's character was using alien tech and had major beef with Stark, same thing happens here, minus the alient tech.Spider-man seems neither a hero ,more concerned with his girlfriend, something you will not find in the source material, but the opposite. Everyone that loves Spidey knows he will risk everything to save people and fight the bad guy, even if that means missing a date and having to deal with the ramifications of those constant personal evwent he cant be a part of.At this point in time MCU movies get free passes from movie critics, so its irrelevant to even bother and reading 90 % of them.

Far from Home answers these doubts, showcasing that this ongoing fascination with superheroes is far from over (no pun intended). I, myself was overtly critical, being that I did have some doubts as to how they would manage to show the aftermath of the snap, but I was satisfied enough, with what they did show and illustrate, and it did lead to some great comedic moments.Far from Home also tackles the aftermath of Tony Stark's death, and how Peter Parker continues to deal with Tony's daunting legacy, his high school livelihood and being a Superhero, leads to some personal and heartwarming moments that continued to reinforce my love with the Superhero, and with what Marvel has done with him currently.Overall, Far from Home is Far (pun intended) from perfect. But it exists to serve as a bridging gap between Endgame and between the next arc of films Marvel has up his sleeve. And for that, this film did a marvelous job.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

But I must admit I was overwhelmed by the fun of this movie. Especially if you're from Europe (like me) you are going the love the scenery of a few beautiful European countries. I also thought Jake Gyllenhaal did a great job with Mysterio. Seeing him in a villain role was something new for me and he didn't disappoint. Also Tom Holland is in my opinion the best Spider-Man whe've ever witnessed on screen. He did a great job and comes across as genuinely funny. It isn't perse the beste Marvel movie or film that you are going to see in general, but the movie is a 2 hour long fun ride going on an adventure with Spider-Man through Europe.

Although, I was actually bored in the first half but right after Mysterio gets EDITH, man, the movie really took off. The whole building illusions and the last whole battle was awesome. The movie has a lot of problems plot-wise, like the mother of all expositions scene after Mysterio gets EDITH and Peter giving away EDITH to Mysterio, yeah, I don't buy that. Mysterio's whole plan to get EDITH lay on a teenager's lack of confidence? And the Avengers and S.H.I.E.L.D know Spiderman's identity so that means everyone who is associated with them know it too? Even an intern at Stark Industries? So, basically, almost everyone except Peter's school knows who Spiderman is. So, why was Peter so shocked when his identity is revealed in the mid-credits scene?

1710,Pablo_Contreras,Fun... but still somewhat forgettable,5,29 August 2019,"Review RundownSpider-Man: Far from Home while providing your traditional dose of Marvel fun along with some visually stunning sequences, solid performances and the most memorable end credits scenes in recent memory; fails to stand out in a crowded universe making it a somewhat forgettable experience. A tight story along with fast-paced action, some good character moments and fascinating chemistry between Tom Holland and Zendaya make Far From Home far from an unpleasant theater experience. However, its forgettable nature can mostly be attributed to a weak villain and a by-the-numbers story that becomes very predictable from the start. Director Jon Watts improves on some of the weak points Homecoming suffered from and feels as if his comfort level with the material is at an all-time high. At the same time, Far From Home still feels underwhelming and while a fun theater experience, it is one audiences will likely forget about in little time.Full ReviewAfter a mostly failed attempt to reboot the Spider-Man character in 2012 and 2014's Amazing Spider-Man series, successfully doing so a third time seemed unlikely. However, in 2017 the new incarnation of the character Spider-Man Homecoming was very warmly received by both fans and critics alike. Understandably so, Homecoming served as a necessary return to form bringing some familiar elements while managing to have its own unique voice. Large part of Homecoming's success stemmed from a compelling take on the character and an excellent performance by Tom Holland. However this time around, another solid performance by Tom Holland along with your traditional Marvel fun, doesn't prevent Spider-Man Far From Home from being a somewhat forgettable experience.Shortly after the events of Avengers Endgame, Peter Parker finds himself being called upon to fight evil from another dimension while on a school field trip around Europe. He is joined by his best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon), his love interest MJ (Zendaya), and meets another superpowered individual Quentin Beck (Jake Gyllenhaal) along the way.Director Jon Watts (also directed Homecoming) comes off as much more comfortable with the material this time around. Action flows better and feels grander when it needs to. Watts' newfound comfort can be better exemplified in some really well-executed ""dream"" sequences involving Jake Gyllenhall's character and Tom Holland's Spiderman. These prove to be a visual treat along with a compelling and unconventional way to dive into our main character's psyche.Gyllenhall, while turning in a solid performance, is held back by writing, which prevents his character from escaping the realm of predictability. The film's take on what a modern Spiderman, in a technology/social media controlled world would look like is really welcome and grounds the story in a familiar context for its audience. At the same time, Far from Home succeeds where Homecoming didn't, further developing Peter Parker's continuous struggle to balance his clashing lifestyles. . Peter's constant desire to live a normal life clashing with his duty as a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. While Happy (Jon Favreau) along with his aunt May (Marisa Tomei) encourage Peter to pick up the mantle of hero, the average teenager lifestyle starts to become more appealing as Peter intends to move his relationship with MJ forward.Far from Home's strengths lie in Peter Parker and Mary Jane's dynamic. The film's comedic sensibilities are also a highlight that at times feel overused. A joke involving the character of Ned and a new relationship he develops while funny at first is overplayed to the point of parody losing its comedic value. Some of the more compelling scenes in the film involve Peter Parker and MJ interacting in awkward ways not only bringing some more comedic elements into the film but also adding humanity and levity. Far From Home while slightly dragging at first, packs a tighter story that somewhat unlike its predecessor, keeps the audience engaged throughout most of its runtime. Its tight storytelling comes to a head in some of the most enjoyable end credits scenes yet that feel like a critical extension to the film and the exact opposite of a cheap gag.The continuous impact of Tony Stark's death is further explored as well as its impact on the bigger picture of the Marvel universe. Peter's reluctance to fully step into the void Tony's death created in the global landscape is entirely understandable and brings an exciting new dimension to the character. However at the same time it once again highlights Spider-Man's strong dependency on the Tony Stark character impeding Peter Parker from fully coming into his own.The writings' weak spots are further highlighted in a lazy, uninspired scene at the beginning of the film involving the film's antagonist. In a scene lacking any subtle or clever elements, exposition is spewed to the point of absurdity at the audience left and right from the protagonist who himself is a weak point in the film. Were as one of Homecoming's most substantial aspects was Michael Keaton's Vulture and his storyline, Far From Home's antagonist proves to be very predictable and frankly forgettable.The description that would best fit Far From Home as a movie-going experience would be empty, forgettable fun. Harsh? Probably. Marvel's impressive track record now makes even solid entries such as Far From Home pale in comparison to the comedic mastery of a Thor Ragnarok or the large scale epic of Avengers Endgame subsequently making them forgettable. It's enjoyable elements are plenty and make for a fun movie-going experience. However, the highly anticipated sequel to Spider-Man Homecoming proves to fall rather short of the Spider-Man 2's of the world and even its predecessor as it fails to escape forgetability in an already very crowded Marvel Cinematic Universe.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1728,Katabasis,Fish Bowl Man,5,4 July 2019,"Spoderman's conflicts are unfortunately no different than the first film, so this is all familiar territory. Throw in a villain ripped off from The Incredibles (2004) and layer on a bunch of cg drones and monsters and crap and I'd say we have a very middle-of-the-road affair.The first movie worked because the Vulture villain was given some thought; he was fleshed-out: a contractor that was discarded when he was no longer necessary, dives into the criminal underground to pay for his retirement and his tinkering hobby. His proximity to Parker added suspense to the entire relationship arc between Spoder and Liz. If you're familiar with Mysterio, you've figured out at his first moment on screen that it's a farce. After the 2-minute on-screen explanation of the ruse (yea, thx, the audience figured that out once the bar scene disintegrated), Mysterio changes from an incredibly-generic ""hero good guy"" into Syndrome's character from The Incredibles. It's been done. There are at least some good character moments here and there and good dialogue.Spider-man: Far From Home is like a 6-inch Subway sandwich with banana peppers, oil, vinegar, and olives, but without turkey, and when you get to the cash register lady, she asks ""What kind of sandwich?"", and there's that awkward moment where you almost say turkey, but then have to quickly explain that you're a dork that likes sandwiches without meat while the register lady is giving you the stink eye.

And he trust's a complete stranger superhero from another dimension when in previous movies he don't fully trust captain america? Tony gave his security and defense system and protocols to a kid instead of his loving wife who fought beside him in endgame?

The way it's shot just makes it quite hard to get a scope for where everything is, and so during the first big action piece I found myself getting a bit confused as to where all the characters are in relation to one another.

1742,Arsenal77,"Beautiful visuals, interesting story, leaves you excited for more!",9,12 July 2019,"So this film takes place eight months after Avengers: Endgame leaving Peter Parker with shoes to fill now that Iron Man, Captain America, Black Widow, and Vision are gone. Except Quentin Beck/Mysterio wants to fill the role with himself, making him THE superhero of superheroes.Amazing Spiderman fight scenes and web slinging scenes as always, puts the older Spiderman films to shame. Jake Gyllenhaal crushes the role as Mysterio, and the visual effects used for his character were top notch in every scene from the Elemental fights to the illusions against Peter. They share an interesting take on background characters from previous Marvel films and reintroduce them to help Mysterio try and win everyone over with him. The pacing is great the comedy lands each time, the perfect tone for a Spiderman movie.Obviously there are a few flaws to the movie but none too big to take away from it. Basically the entire field trip seems under attack the entire movie and no one has the sense to speak up and say ""Hey we should probably go home and away from the monsters"". I also personally found the Peter/MJ pairing for this movie to be a bit rushed, seeing how he was into Liz Toomes all of Homecoming, went missing for five years from the snap, and suddenly returned to fall for MJ even after eight months.As always, the after credits leave you wanting more from the Spiderman side of things. Nick Fury is in space and now the world knows that Peter Parker is Spiderman, leaving the stakes for the eventual third movie as high as ever. All in all, this was the perfect Spiderman sequel and the perfect movie to start with post Endgame.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Jake Gyllenhaal's Mysterio was SPOT ON! From creating fake villains for himself to defeat, to the use of illusion to psychologically torture Spiderman to the point where he can't tell what's real and what's not, it's just quintessential, textbook Mysterio. I love it!
I'm usually not a fan of writers changing a character's origin story, but making Mysterio the leader of a failed Stark project in order to tie him into the overarching MCU story was a stroke of genius.

The best Spider-Man film still belongs to Spider-Man 2, Far From Home is a disgrace to the Spider-Man franchise & it doesn't understand what the character is created for, just a bunch of cash grab from Disney!This film is very mediocre at best, very overrated at this point, how disappointing.

It's so fun and relatable to me because I am currently still in high school and I can relate to Peter so much throughout the film. Jake Gyllenhaal did a magnificent job playing Mysterio. The plot throughout the movie was amazing. I can say that I knew that Mysterio had to be evil but I didn't know that he was gonna trick Peter into giving him the glasses by using projectors to fake fight the Elementals. Also the way that Peter can overcome Mysterio's illusions at the end is so good. The end credit scenes leave me wanting more!!! I would definitely recommend this film. This film has something for everyone. It's heartwarming, funny, and action packed. I can't wait to see what marvel has in store for the next Spiderman movie.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1766,redfroman,So bad. These reviews are obviously paid for.,2,3 October 2019,So boring. Not even typical. Didn't care at all about it.,Spider-Man - Far from Home
1767,jameswannan,A great conclusion to phase 3 of the MCU,10,6 August 2019,"Spider-man: Far From Home included everything I have always wanted in a comic book movie. It provided an great storyline set after the events of End Game which also included how everyone was handling being snapped out of existance, then being brought back 5 years later (I mean, how do you think that would effect you if that actually happened?)
We also see a more mature Spider-man in this film, where he doesn't care as much to be an avenger or the next Iron Man as many suspect him to be. I feel emotionally connected with Tom Holland's Spider-man because he clearly is still grieving throughout a majority of the film (although he doesn't show it right away) over Tony Stark's death and he very much feels the pressure of living up to what he has accomplished.At first, I was sceptical about this movie as I heard Mysterio would be playing more of a protaganist in this film with Spider-man as he ""claimed"" to be from an alternate Earth which would introduce us to the multiverse in the MCU. But the reason I was sceptical was because I'd much rather Spider-man go up against Mysterio as a main villain, which, if you've seen the movie, turned out to be very much true that he was the big bad which made me very happy to see that twist.I was also very much intrigued by how long Mysterio had been planning this and that he managed to put together every person that Tony had screwed over which dated back all the way to the first Iron man (lots of callbacks in this film).I loved the first Spider-man and Mysterio fight scene, the effects were absolutely perfect and everything I wanted Mysterio to be able to do on the big screen. Everything Mysterio had done in that moment made me question what was real and what wasn't, which was portrayed absolutely brilliantly!After their first confrontation, a beaten Peter calls Happy for a ride since after the fight he lost conciousness and woke up in the Netherlands. Peter's reaction at first to seeing Happy was shaky since he clearly couldn't trust anyone after what he went through.He finally lets out how he really feels which was probably the most emotional part of the film and as mentioned I could really connect with him.Something that really made me feel nostalgic in this film was when Spider-man picks himself up and makes his suit with some Led Zeplin music similar to Tony Stark in the Iron Man movies (AWESOME callback).I also loved how Peter finally beat Mysterio by ignoring all of his other senses and solely relied on his ""Peter Tingle"" since that would alert him of the real dangers and ignore the illusions, which again was portrayed brilliantly.Tom Holland overall did an amazing performance as Peter Parker/Spider-man, completely comic book accurate.The two post credit scenes leave much room for a potential Spider-man sequel as well as a good stepping stone into the future of the MCU. The first post credit scene shows our beloved J.K. Simmons (From the Toby Maguire Spider-man) to reprise his role as J. Jonah Jameson doing what he does and bad mouths the webslinger but this time, a final clip that Mysterio recorded as a fail-safe was shown to all of New York where basically he pretends to still be the hero that the people still think he is and blames Spider-man for all the crazy events to happen on his trip. If that wasn't bad enough, Mysterios has done what none of the villains in any previous Spider-man film has done before and he exposed PETER PARKER as Spider-man! A definite cliffhanger if I ever saw one, and I hope that there will be a sequel to this so we might be able to see how Peter might deal with this fall out and come on, you can't just show us that and not give us a sequel!The final post credit scene shows us what Nick Fury was really up to throughout the whole movie. He was on vacation in outerspace with the Kree and the Nick Fury and Maria Hill we saw throughout the film were the same Kree we saw in Captain Marvel which I never would have expected that twist. The question now is what could this scene potentially mean for the future of the MCU?Overall, this movie was amazing and I highly recommend anyone who hasn't seen it and loves comic book movies with loads of comedy and action to go and see it! A great conclusion of an era of the MCU.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1771,borismicov,100% Honest review the bad and the good side,6,10 July 2019,So its nice to see Tom Holand again as spidey but honestly the movie could be a lot better i am a spiderman fan and i am not satisfied with the film. It wasn't entertaining. Mysterio wasnt such a intresting and complex villain. And he was mad at stark the same way vulture was mad the same stuff i dont want to see similarities like this. The action sceens were amazing amd the costumes too. I didnt like that Mj found out this way that peter is spidey and that they show that in the trailer. In Sami Rami's spiderman the relearionship between perer and MJ was much more intresting and fun to watch. A way to make the movie better is that they could make mysterio with real powers not an drone projector. Imaggine if perer won over mysterio and live his life but then he realise that this is all an illusion and he didnt won over misterio at all he kisses MJ and stuff and all that reality is gone puff. Soo ... waste of potential villain like mysterio. Honestly i think that this is the worst spiderman movie of all.,Spider-Man - Far from Home

There is literally no part in the movie which felt exciting. Heck what even the CGI is rubbish, it felt like video game graphics. The only people who could have rated this good are kids who only just started watching Spider-Man. For us who watched Spider-Man of 2000's, it's an utter disappointment.

1777,jedicraftmaster,Same old Marvel bull crap,5,21 October 2019,"Really if youve seen any of the more recent Marvel movies tou know what youre getting. Wow another quirky movie hero who has a perfect concious and totally isnt a ploy to manipulate young teens by acting ""relatable"". The movie doesnt have the most substance, the score is very marvel esque with the loud maybe a little overdone sounds. Now the story is alright albeit having wanky pacing at times. The story starts off with spiderman on vacation trying to connect a little more with the girl of his dreams when, what do you know some monsters appear, oh my god, totally not cliche! Now he must try and balance his superhero life with his social life. Now the story takes a large dip in quality (not that there was much to begin with) when a twist villain is revealed, one of which I will not mention because I dont want to spoil. Now spiderman has even more trouble.....The story is finely balanced with what it works with though it feels a little to fast at times and seems to drag at others.Now I dont want any of my reviews to be completely negative and this film isnt really either. The humor actually felt like it worked about half the time. The other half just felt like it was trying a little to hars to be relatable. Some of the more dramatic scenes are well done and do seem to carry emotion behind them.
In my eyes this movie is purely average maybe lower and I think marvel enthusiasts and a large ammount of teens will enjoy this but hey movie going is subjective and that may be the best part about it.

1800,rikedueffert,Not as good as I thought,3,28 July 2019,"I'm sorry, I really tried to like this movie. I love Spiderman and I love Tom Holland as Spiderman, but the plot is nonsense.Why did they went to Europe anyway? The movie could've taken place in the US and nothing would've changed.
Ned, Hill and Fury were just there. In Homecoming, Ned was part of the story. He helped Peter and he played an important role in the end fight. In this movie, Ned had nothing to do which was really sad. He's a great character and tugging him out of the way like this, idk.
The Blip overall made no sense. At this point, Marvel has no other choice than to play the whole thing for laughs, but still.
The jokes in general weren't funny for anyone above the age of 13. I know that the Spiderman movies are aimed at a younger audience, but Homecoming still managed to be funny, why couldn't this movie? The only thing that made me laugh was Peter trying to kill the ""water monster"" with his spider webs. What was he thinking? I detest how the movie tries to paint Peter as stupid and overly naive. Sure, he is young and sure he is naive. But not at this level.
Quentin Beck's motivation made no sense to me. In my opinion Quentin just wasn't a good antagonist. He wasn't scary or intimidating. So much lost potential.
The scene at the end where Quentin reveals who Spiderman is... when did Beck record this footage? It's a small thing but it's still bothering me. How did he purplish the video anyway? Didn't he die? Did one of his allies find and publish it? Did Beck came back from the dead? Wtf.The lovestory with MJ seemed forced, the movie felt like a two hour long fanfiction at most times.

1803,malthereippuert-62970,Far from disappointing,9,9 July 2019,"After the events of endgame, this movie handled them really well without making it too complicated. Everyone must have thought about how you continue the MCU after endgame, especially after all the build-up to Spider-man taking up the mantle as the new Iron Man. But it does handle them in a good and actually satisfying way.
The movie has some very good and funny moments with all the characters, and especially Mysterio. I was a little worried about he was going to be portrayed in the movie and perhaps as one of the good guys. But he does really live up to him being a mystery, almost a perfect adoptation from the comics - we see multiple times where he lives up to his full potiential as a great villain",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Everything in this movie is perfect, the storyline, Mysterio's character, the Peter and Mj romance and obviously the work with the cgi. There's a lot of references of the previous movies espacially Iron man 1 and I really liked it. This movie made be both laugh and cry and also shocked me.

Tom Holland delivered an emotional performance as Spider-Man, effectively capturing how the events of Endgame affect Peter Parker. I also enjoyed Mysterio as a villain. He was evil in all of the right ways, and I liked that he had a clear motive that he didn't give up on. Even the romance between Peter and MJ was done well. While it could come across as a bit cheesy, I found it to be an accurate portrayal of a teen relationship. The post credit scenes were surprising, and they definitely added a twist to the story.

As you know this movie stars Tom Holland who I believe gives the best betrayal of Spider Man a heroic and friendly main character. One of the best parts of the entire movie is Mysterio portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal. Gyllenhaal gives a great flare to the master of deceit as I believe there is no doubt that Gyllenhaal was the perfect choice. So do I recommend the movie, of course look at what I rated it.

1826,slxpictures,The best Spider-Man movie yet,10,4 July 2019,"Homecoming, I loved. It was perhaps on par with Raimi's Spider-Man 2, with the fact that we had a real Spider-Man giving it the slight edge.Far From Home? Completely surpasses Spider-Man 2. If you don't see this as the best movie of the bunch, perhaps you'll agree it's the best live Spidey action you've ever seen on screen! Every part of this has the Lee/ Ditko DNA lovingly sewn in despite it's modernity, they know what makes these stories and characters tick like no one else ever has and show it by delivering emotional characterisations brought straight from the comics, keeping the settings and action new and fresh as they do.Buckle up for the third, because we are about to get a lot more of what we are familiar with and thanks to the MCU build up, it's going to resonate and matter a hell of a lot more.Stay for those post credit scenes; especially mid-credit, that one is the best Marvel have ever done!",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1828,Juan-Tejada,"Review of ""Spiedr-Man: Far From Home"" (2019)",8,3 October 2019,"Spider-Man: Far from Home is an entertaining addition to the marvel cinematic universe. It has some great moments and surprises as well as some overall great and profound character writing. The film is hilarious; you're certainly going to enjoy it from start to finish; the acting is excellent as well, Jake Gyllenhaal performance comes to mind immediately; he gives depth to his character ""Mysterio"" which would otherwise be quite bland and forgettable. I particularly enjoyed how the film treated the events depicted in ""Avengers: Endgame""; opening with an homage to the cherished heroes that will surely bring many people to tears, and going deep into the legacy left by the beloved Tony Stark.However, the film is far from the best spidey flick for several reasons; primordially for its lack of directive vision and overall tonal dissonance, and secondarily for its sometimes annoying misuse of comedy. Those two things stood out to me immediately as I watched the movie. Ironically, those exact two properties, are areas in which the original Spider-Man 2 (2004) shines in. Sam Raimi (director); understood the true nature of the character, while balancing the overall narrative with his distinctive style and vision. That's what Spider-Man: Far from home lacks, a real sense of direction and vision; not just visually, but also tonally.The misuse of comedy is apparent during some scenes; even extending into the ""Bathos"" (a cheap joke placed in an otherwise dramatic moment) territory once in a while, but, I have to admit that sometimes the humor is well played and made the audience laugh out loud. You probably remember the moment in which Peter Parker leaves the opera. In that scene, we emotionally feel what he feels when he watches M.J waiting for him as he flies into the mayhem of what's about to happen. I believe that the movie needed more of that drama that submerges us into Peter's feelings. That's what Spider-Man 2 excelled in, and it's something Far From Home aimed at, but, I'm afraid to say, that as close as it was, it missed the mark.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1830,jkovitz,Spoilers,8,3 July 2019,"First off I just need to say how well marvel studios has handled this version of peter Parker/Spider-Man. One of the most interesting things it has done, is introduce the father figure/mentor relationship between peter and tony stark. With the death of stark this leaves a whole for the leader of the Avengers. This is one of the main driving forces of this film but it also does a good job of not taking over the whole plot of the film. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Mysterio is fantastic and it's a shame there's a good chance we won't be seeing him again. This movie has plenty of action and is also funny, but not too much comedy so that it takes away believability, something that has been a problem in the more recent entries of the MCU. Overall I consider this movie an improvement over homecoming, and shows that Tom Holland is not only a great Peter Parker, but a great Spider-Man.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1831,Nathan_Ortiz,This movie is boring and white the same marvel formula,6,6 July 2019,"The only thing that rescues from this movie is his villain, Jake Gyllenhaal as Mystery is incredible, the scenes of illusions and manipulation to spiderman demonstrate the excellent performance of him as a villain.

But there certain things that I didn't like in this movie.",7,13 September 2019,I watch teen movies since I was in high school. But I am not a big fan of teen movies although I watch a lot of teen movies. I found that Spider-Man: Far from Home is a kind of teen movie and it is entertaining. First half of the movie gives me headache but second half was awesome. I really enjoyed and often cheered in second half of this movie. In the first half as usual a teen movie these show us high school journey. But shouldn't be a ordinary journey. It set after Avenger Endgame. So there lot to explore what happened after Endgame. But these movie parody it and I didn't like it. Instead of exploring us with people after Endgame its simply exploring Peter Parker high school journey then it start adventure which was a total headache. There lot of character in the high school get more screen time. They are the side character and unfortunately MJ was one of them. There most of job was only react. It was bad for me. Then the movie start with full speed when Mysterio revealed himself. Beginning of the second half is heart of this movie. Mysterio was great in this movie. But there are marvel effect on Mysterio. There lot of teen stuff also there . Then plot twist. Then movie end with happy ending. I must say that second half of this movie was mustwatch. So I review it 7/10. The thing I don't like about this movie was about first half and bunch of side character and there reaction.,Spider-Man - Far from Home
1834,StanisHalushka,Classic Spider-Man movie,8,18 July 2019,I was really into of classic Spider-Man movies but tbh I'm not a big fan of first movie starring Tom Holland. Things changed with Far from Home. Tom Holland did great job as Peter Parker and this time Marvel shown me decent villian by outstanding Jake Gyllenhaal.

He is just an 16year old kid who wants to enjoy his vacation trip and spend time with this crush (MJ). The whole point of the movie is that Spiderman is not yet the hero he wants to be , he is not yet the ""amazing"" spiderman who is ready to fight big villains and that makes him different from the previous ones (Maguire , Garfield).
As most Marvel movies lately they dont give up much of the plot and what happens in this movie but after a kinda slow start and character development that could probably take less time, we get the Spiderman movie we deserve.

I understand that they want to leave an opening to a new movie, but did you have to make it so obvious? Why did they have to do that, I liked the ending of Spiderman: Homecoming, but not this one. I did not like the whole Mysterio thing and how he turned into the villain AND how he wanted to kill Peter and his friends! I also wish there were kind of more tributes to Iron Man, I know it's ""Spiderman: Far from Home"" not ""Spiderman: Coping with the loss of Tony"", but maybe show some respect for a character that has been in these movies for over TEN years. One of the scenes I actually liked about this movie is when Peter was building the suit in the plane and I automatically thought back to the movie that started it all (""Iron Man""). The Iron Man references in this movie is what made me consider my review to be a 6/10. Tom Holland was amazing in the movie, I'll give you that, and so was Zendaya, Jacob, and Samuel L. Jackson. It's the plot that hurt me. Thank you for your time reading this. *Also, I am sad now that there is no longer the father and son relationship between Peter and Tony. I miss that :(

1843,cptfmarvell,OMG!!!!!,10,2 July 2019,"Okay, let's just cut to the chase...
This movie is most probably one of the best films of the year, from the storyline to the acting and the pleasing visuals - this is a movie you can't afford to miss!Tom Holland's acting is nothing short of spectacular, and you can really feel his emotions as he's a young teenage boy who's going through the loss of a father-figure. One scene which stood out is when Fury asked if Tony was wrong when choosing him and you can just see pain reflected in his eyes, which literally nearly brought me to tears.Not only is this movie funny with just the right amount of humour but it's realistic. In terms of MJ's and Peter's awkwardness - it was the perfect balance between being shy yet wanting to open up. Their relationship doesn't sky rocket from one scene to another, but Marvel builds it up from start to finish. This I absolutely love because it makes you want to keep watching and anticipating for that special moment.Zendaya was the perfect cast for MJ. Her character has many depths too it, which I think we have (hopefully) yet to see in upcoming films. I say this because when given the glasses by Tony Stark, Peter can see text messages sent through his screen and one of MJ's message was to do with the absence of her father (I believe....) MJ has many layers and Zendaya peels each one away with such talent that at the end it's as if she's finally come out of her shell.Jacob - WHAT A LEGEND! Who doesn't want a friend like Ned? Constantly kept me laughing and each line was delivered with the right amount of humour yet it came off so subtly that it made you laugh even more. I feel like Jacob adds a new substance to these films because he's a good friend and wants the best for Peter, to the point where he will go through a web of lies to help him. (No pun intended....maybe lol).Jake absolutely blew me away. His innocent demeanour at the beginning, especially the bar scene caught me off guard that I didn't expect the twist at the end. He plays mr nice guy with such ease that I didn't even expect the twist. His acting literally makes you feel every single emotion of rage, jealousy and hatred towards the end and makes you want to almost sympathise with him at some points. That's the power of his incredible acting.You cannot miss this movie, with the triple kiss , the absolutely amazing plotline - effects that make you second guess whether you're actually seeing magic happen instead - Far From Home is not one to miss out!!!!",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1844,yokait,Awesome movie (review will have spoilers),10,3 July 2019,I went to go see this a few hours ago and I loved this film. This had a good transition to endgame and the twist was shocking. Spoilers: The post credits was good it was when mysterio made a video telling the world who was Spider-Man. I left the theater speechless it was a good movie it almost made it my number 1 favorite movies all time. I give this 10/10,Spider-Man - Far from Home
1845,phoenixlunapl,The movie that decieves,9,3 July 2019,"When the movie starts out the spectator gets all there emotions back from the ending of Avengers: Endgame. The movie follows Peter Parker and his science class on their field trip around the world. The film does a great job of showing how a teenager in high school develops a crush and how nervous they are about being around that said person. When things start going well, a villain appears and Peter Parker must work with a new hero that people name ""Mysterio."" The movie does a great job of keeping the watcher sucked into the screen with constant, well timed humor and heart-tugging moments. Once you feel like the movie should be coming to an end, you look at your watch and realize you're only an hour in. That is when the movie has a brilliant plot twist and everything you thought you knew about the movie was just an illusion. (For those of you who have seen the movie enjoy that awful pun.) As characters get reestablished in their roles, the spectator has more thrills, suspense, and bliss as the story actually begins to unfold. If you compare this movie to the previous Endgame or Infinity War, you might be disappointed with the lack of other Marvel characters. If you watch the movie as another Spider-Man movie, you will be very impressed and grateful you took time out of your day to watch this film. Everything in the movie is never what it seems and will keep you wanting to know what happens next.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

I love when movies do this.There is a huge killer plot-twist too, it makes things way more awesome and make the movie not only ""heros stopping villainy and everybody live happy ever after"" cliché.The comedy is way more stable than the previous Spiderman Homecoming, although they do not make us chuckle like the previous (homecoming) but that first scene after the intro is funny.To recap, this movie have a great combination of comedy and fantasy, that ""fake"" scene kinda remind me of Doctor Strange though.

1865,petespagnola,No Teenage Hrero,1,7 July 2019,"I was very dissappointed in this Spiderman movie and the last one. I realize the majority of reviewers seem to think it is a great movie. Please explain why? Do not just say it was great. Give me details.
The reasons I did not like this movie follows. In this incarnation Spiderman is portrayed as an awkward teenager that lacks confidence. Who wants a hero that lacks confidence and is awkward?Not me. I want a superhero that portrays himself as confident and able to believ he can handle any emergency or supervillian he may have to face. Save your awkward teenage heroes for the Disney channel.. There was not much action displaying Spiderman fighting his superhero skills. There was a scene where he fought the giant made of water. . His webbing doesn't work against it. All he does is try to use a portion of a buliding to block some of the flooding caused by the giant. The only time he looks like a hero is the last 10 minutes of the movie when he uses his spider sense to defeat Mysterio. Hardly enough action for a 2 hour movie.. Maybe the younger crowd, teenager and early twenties, like this version of Spiderman. Maybe they can relate to him better as the average man. I don't want my superhero portrayed as the average man. I want him portrayed as a confident powerful hero. I will not spend time or money to see another Spiderman movie unless theyreboot the format. This was in my opinion a horrible movie.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1866,bartuduman,Great Superhero Movie,8,7 July 2019,"Jake Gyllenhaal really transferred the Mysterio in the comic book to the MCU perfectly. Whatever Jake Gyllenhaal awakens the feelings which Alfred Molina made us feel as him being a bad guy. However, Tom Holland is slowly identifying with the character, but he still has shortcomings. If we were to talk about the movie , I need to tell you that Spiderman is on the right track as of the 2nd film. I think that Mj and Peter look good. Zendeya did a good job in this film. But I can't warm up to Flash and May in this series. There are a few surprises you don't expect in the movie and they will make you very happy:)",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1867,nagolucky510,So Good I Saw it Twice!,9,8 July 2019,"This movie brilliantly closes the door to the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Phase 3 and begins the transition to Phase 4. It exceeded my expectations in many regards with a plot that is both teeming with action and emotionally engaging.Balancing action with emotion is a difficult task for any collection of writers. I applaud the writers of this film and extend that applause to the actors themselves. Tom Holland delivers an emotional performance as a young and distraught Peter Parker, who over the course of this movie discovers what it truly means to be a hero. Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent as Quentin Beck/Mysterio, capturing a character with complex motives. Also worthy of mention is Zendaya's performance as MJ, as she gives youthful spirit to the movie and reminds the audience that Peter and his pals are high schoolers.For fans of action this movie has plenty of it, and I would definitely recommend seeing it in 3D. The rendering of the elementals is incredible as is the rendering of Mysterio.There are two post-credits scenes. PLEASE do yourself a favor and stay for both of them, as they are both surprising and important to the future of the MCU.All in all this is a high flying effort from Marvel that delivers on all fronts and is definitely worth viewing.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1874,montesdeocasofi,Far From a Good Movie,4,10 July 2019,"When I first walked into the cinema, I had high expectations for this movie. I mean, having seen all the trailers and TV spots a billion times, who couldn´t? Spiderman Far From Home was set to kick start a new era in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but instead, it just made me wish I could go back in time and un-see it.
The first trailers gave us an insight in what could possibly lead into a multiverse. Not only was this fake, but it also crushed any possibility for Sony to have a viable excuse to integrate Miles Morales and the Osborn duo to the MCU. But these are not all the disappointments.
The movie relies heavily on comedy, trying to make the fans laugh to distract from the fact that Ned, a kid who was able to hack into Stark Level technology, is put off as a lovesick sidekick who does nothing to help Peter with his troubles until the last ten minutes of the movie. Furthermore, his troubles commence with Parker´s idea to tell MJ that he likes her. Since when? In Homecoming, Zendaya´s character appears five times at most, often making fun of Peter in a teasing manner. So, with no extra footage of how they got talking or how on Earth both him and Ned know her favorite flower and why, we´re expected to believe that he´s into her? Talking about out of the blue romances, where did Happy and May come from if both only met shortly after the events of Endgame.
Moving on, the whole plot of the movie is based around Peter falling into Tony´s legacy, ignoring the fact that Peter is his own person. Along these lines, every mention of Tony´s late mentor gave a chance to explore Spiderman´s PTSD and Anxiety over the events of his last 3 movies, from a warehouse falling on him to the death of hist most recent father figure.
To be honest, the only thing that really salvage is Happy´s relationship with Peter. Hogan respects the kid and helps him figure himself out while nudging towards the kind, thoughtful and strong person he is destined to become. The first post-credit scene, while entertaining, also left a sense of unfulfillment from the movie. Yeah, who didn´t want a J. Jonah Jameson in the movie? But that didn´t mean we wanted Peter´s identity exposed. So, what, is he going to run around mask less now? The final scene, on the other hand, is actually funny, while not leaving any loose ropes.
To conclude, the movie shows (while not even putting the quote in) that with great power comes great responsibility. And apparently, Kevin Feige and John Watts weren´t able to handle it.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1884,lukaskirschbauer,"Visually stunning, but lacks a believable counterpart",7,12 July 2019,"Tom Holland may arguably be the best Spider-Man ever, as he showed in his previous entries in the MCU and not only acting wise, that is. He proved his ability to deliver a chaotic, but very likable Spider-Man over five movies. And Far from Home is defiantly no exception. It contains not only strong performances from Holland, but Gyllanhall doesn't disappoint either. What else to expect from a Hollywood giant though. The visuals are breathtakingly realistic and the supporting cast does its job quite well. They play a major part in moving the film forward, but the only question is, where to? The poorly answerd attempt of solving that problem might be the movies only issue. The story and story telling. Mainly due to Gyllenhalls villain, whose own character arc is just not convincing, but feels strongly constructed as well. And since a hero is only as good as their counterpart, which's backstory just doesn't work in this case, this movie has a hard job at making us believe it's the more-than-average Marvel movie...quite frankly, it doesn't succeed. However this movie stays in mind positively thanks to humor, heart and devotion....and all that cool cgi stuff for sure.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1886,melodycclo,Why him?,10,13 July 2019,"Spider-Man Far From Home, the end and the beginning. Marvel put their best of the best in this movie, which is totally fantastic. It's really quite a something that can change ones life. The whole movie clearly shows the struggle of Peter for choosing normal life or become the next Ironman, an unreplaceable hero. But after the blip, after all the original Avengers death, people are too desperately to search for the hero to rely on, and it brought a 16y boy into an hard situation. One step back, choose to be Peter seems to be selfish. But one step forward, being Spider-Man isn't what he truly wants for all. After Tony's death, everything just seems to be carried on to him. Can he easily take over everything to his very own hand? That is the question.I think the whole movie really brought me to a higher level. And there are also some emotional moments, the one I personally loved is the moment when Peter made his own suit on Happy's plane. It was just a lot of memories coming up. For MJ, I always thought she's the best. Zendaya totally catches my eyes. The black humor and the extraordinary feeling...... She really do play the character very well. She Is The BEST!!! I think the wall of being cool crashes when she tell Peter how she feels. It was such a wonderful moment. And MJ seems to be cute deep down inside. And for the funny part? Ned is still the best of it. Whenever he goes, there will be laugh. Betty and him is just a sweet, hilarious couple. Aunt May and Happy too. (P.S. Flash is still a totally ****)The ending? I just kind of not want to talk about it. Even though I already know that his name will be revealed. But, when I see that part, the madness inside me still burns me up. Mysterio is just so much like Loki, but a worse and not cute one. He was the master of lying. The yelled of Wtf from Peter Parker? Still is in my head.Final question, did Mysterio and his team really appear in those original movies?

But I also realized that's not everything we need. We need explanation, what happened in that five years during the snap? Spiderman Far from Home tries to explain it but they do such a horrible job with it. The first scene is just like ""yeah the people came back and everything is normal except my little brother is now older than me.""

Also MJ acting was perfect as a high school girl who look kinda mature but still only a child when come to love. The way she nervous blowing my mind like the actor and MJ were both one. Mysterio has doubted me and i was wondering if he trully have illusion or he is bad before i watch the movie. But turn out the trailer was totally unpredictable. And the way Mysterio tricked not just only spider-man but me as well. I did not even know which impact was real and which was fake.

1900,aaronhayesminecraft,The Best Spiderman Movie Yet,9,29 July 2019,"I speak no hyperbole when I say that this is the best Spiderman movie I've ever seen. I'll defend the first Sam Ramie film as long as I live but this excellent action spectacle will be difficult to top.Tom Holland does an excellent job portraying a nerdy, superpowered teen, grieving the loss of his hero, Iron Man (Avengers:Endgame). All Peter wants is to take a break in Europe, but the threat of the elementals puts a huge roadblock on his plans. Sure, fans of the comics would be well aware of Mysterio's villain status, but for casual audience members, the twist is quite a shock. Our villain comes across as much more competent than in the ps2 Spiderman game, showcasing incredible and paranoia inducing illusion tech that leaves both Peter and the audience wondering what is real, with much speculation.Now, at the end of homecoming, I was rather, irrationally annoyed at the fact that Mary-Jane wasn't redheaded. To be honest, I'm still a little peeved, but I gotta say, I much prefer her characterisation here than in previous films. Here, she has a dark sense of humour and a sort of ""coolness"" to her in stark contrast to the helpless damsel in distress that she is most known for. There are times when she is in danger sure, but it never felt like she was Princess Peach.Like many MCU films, this film has both serious and light-hearted moments. And like in many of those films, it works and never feels jarring or out of place. Peter felt like a real teen in this movie, his crush on MJ never came across as creepy and instead seemed like genuine affection.Overall, this is the best Spiderman film so far, even if I enjoyed the first two Tobey Maguire films.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

The actors were just as amazing as the last movie but some of the character development just didn't work for me. For instance, MJ's character in the las movie was controversial because of how much she differs from the comics, personally, I didn't really care. But in this movie she just seemed annoying. They seem to be self aware that MJ is a really strange character and that she doesn't do well in social situations, but it makes it to where I'm not rooting for Peter and MJ's relationship. But the best thing about this movie by far is the villain, Mysterio, who is arguably the 2nd best villain in the MCU.

I found it to be easy to follow, greatly entertaining and very easy to get pulled into the Marvel Cinematic Universe which they almost always flawlessly create.The visuals were brilliantly stunning and were near to completely seamless, they could have put in a giant unicorn and I probably would have still accepted it as part of that world. Everything was visually pleasing and made perfect sense to me.I have immense respect for the teams behind all of it, the sounds were perfect, the visual effects were so convincing that I am VERY jealous of their skill and work, the costuming and makeup were done to perfection and of course the actors all played their parts perfectly.
I have got very few complaints regarding this film:
The illusion scenes were difficult to follow but I believe this was intentional (if so then great job!), the cuts between two characters during a chat can be a tiny bit off with the placement/facial expressoins which makes it a tiny bit confusing but still enjoyable.Finally I have the one thing which has been bugging me a LOT with this film, one extremely large plot-hole (which is also a major spoiler!).If Mysterio/Quentin Beck worked for Tony Stark at Stark Industries then that means he's got a past and a history such as things like: records of degrees, certificates, education, criminal records, employment history, birth certificates, doctor's records.
All stuff that Nick Fury would EASILY be able to dig up and therefore all this information would immediately pull down Mysterio's fake story of being a warrior from another earth and would then immediately earn him a bullet to the head from Nick Fury for wasting his time (I like to believe that would be his reaction, but it probably wouldn't be) and this plot-hole has been bugging me ever since I watched it.I would still recommend this film to any of my friends and family who are into Marvel or superhero films as it is thoroughly enjoyable.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

The writers sure read the best seller ""how to destroy a franchise in one swift cringy blow""If you are looking for a original spiderman experience, back away now before it's too late.Attention spiderman is now for adolescent teens who have no grasp for real acting or storylines. First of all Spiderman could not come across as more of an sputtering, unconfident dweeb. But I guess that's what the millennials adore. Spiderman is no longer a nerd turned into a confident superhero, he is a character with no Brains or direction. At every point not thinking for himself and at every turn looking to chicken out. RIP spiderman.The casting crew in this movie should be run out of Hollywood for the terrible attempt at matching actors to these simpleton characters. Gyllenhaal must have roles few and far between to agree to this nonsensical garbage. He would be the last pick for this bady. Dont get me wrong hes a good actor just a horrific match to this character.The leading ""lady"" is not Hollywood material, shes straight from a homemade c grade movie. Ain't got the look, not the acting skill. Everytime she appears is a pointless and waste of film time.This movie has more plot holes than cheese, and plenty of extra cheese to add to your already stuffed stomach.Regardless of slowly dying whilst watching this movie I gave it a chance to the end saying to myself that somehow this would get miraculously better, alas I was wrong...it got worse.

I was left completely disappointed and gobsmacked after this movie and heartbroken that I will never get that 1 hour and 56 minutes of my life back.Watch it if you dare, but dont whinge about it after reading this review as my words ""i told you so"" will be echoing in your sore and brooding mind.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

The people I went with all enjoyed it immensely. The actors were great, especially Tom Holland who almost had me believing he was sixteen. So what was wrong? First of all, too many holes left unexplained. Some too big to skip over, I found myself puzzling about stuff that happened on screen 10 minutes beforehand. The film was funny, spectacular, clever, entertaining. So why did I leave thinking what was all that about? The plot was even less believable than usual for a MCU film and I could not get the point of some of it at all. I must be getting too old.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1917,graystripe-20999,A very fun Spider-Man Movie,8,9 October 2019,"I was super excited to see Spider-Man: Far From Home, and my excitement definitely paid off. Jake Gyllenhaal is an amazing Mysterio, almost making me want him to actually be a hero, and Peter's science teacher was probably my favorite character of the entire movie. The action is some of Marvel's best, both epic and grounded, and I found that it improved quite a few parts to Homecoming. It was a little dumb for Sony and Marvel to pretend Mysterio was actually a hero, and I'm still a bit frustrated on that, but in the end, it's not Marvel's best movie, but still great. I'm definitely looking forward for Spider-Man 3 in 2021!",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Ant-Man 2 started a bit of a low turn for MCU already, which Endgame continued, and now Spider-man 2 follows that path.They did the same mistake with this one that was done with Iron Man 3, they set up a scenario and a ""villain"", only to later show it all to be fake and replace the scenario with a generic run of the mill villain. Not that the original scenario was that good either(most likely on purpose), but promising people escapism and then replacing it with real world things in a comic movie just takes all the pow away.Sam Jackson seemed already a bit too old for the movie, and his comic timing just wasn't there, maybe it was a director issue, maybe not.There were really no stakes raised throughout the movie, and there wasn't a feeling to root for the hero, most likely due to the boring villain.Side characters were mostly used for comedy lines here and there, there was no real sense of a full cast like in the first one.There were a few good jokes here and there, enough to induce proper laughter, so there was at least something that still worked.All in all, the MCU doesn't seem to be anymore a guarantee for an entertaining movie these days.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

1929,joakimswedberg,Spiderman lost his soul,3,19 March 2020,Spiderman is indeed far from home. The whole idea of spiderman is his deep feeling of moral and care for other people while also having superpowers that can cause problems for people while trying to do the right thing. This interpretation of spiderman did not capture that complexity of character. It's basically a cheap American teen drama comedy movie using the spiderman trademark to sell. Even the special effects are so terrible that you can't watch it for that reason. After 25 minutes of this nonsense I could not take the torture anymore and turned the movie off.,Spider-Man - Far from Home

1933,dapenarandae,The vulture > Mysterio,4,14 September 2020,"The characters are dull, the plot is dumb, the villain is a clown that has no true relationship with the hero, the supporting characters don't really support and are unfunny, the love interest of Peter and him have no chemistry, the May-Happy relationship is just there to be a joke, the humour is childish, they made Nick Fury more of a moron that they already did in Captain Marvel, the villain motivation seems to me pretty stupid... I can go on naming all the things that Disney got wrong about spiderman but by far the worst thing of this film is the lack of coherence between the hero sense of responsibility here compared to its prequel. Here is non existent.They completely forgot that spiderman's greatest quality is that he understood that with great power comes great responsibility. In homecoming that was mildly present, so I expected this film to portray a character development in that sense, not only in the spider sense. Stupid scene btw. I really expected to make a transition of his responsibility from 'the friendly neighborhood' to the next level. The suits aren't as good looking as the iron spider or any other suit from spiderman.
The only redeeming quality I can see in this rom com is a few well made action scenes (way too CGI plagued though).",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1934,Synertic,A Critique About the Rating Algorithm and the Movie,6,18 April 2020,"First, I'm going to write something about the reviews section itself. I can't believe that the review section is full of 10s !!! for the movies. I'm not sure but either these 10's are coming from the same source under the different usernames or they are all at their fifteens. I can't think any other options than these two frankly. I'm seriously starting to think that IMDB should do something about their rating algorithm to make it meet the new requirements/vulnerabilities because it's now starting to missing to represent a good picture of what people ""really"" thinks about the movies. Especially the rating system should be devided into age ranges that can represent the thaughts of different age groups besides the general rating of the movie. I can honestly say that the rating algorithm got so rusty and vulnerable that it's no longer has the capability of being a good measure of common view. I've kept watching movies rated say 7.5 presently but it wouldn't have gotten even 6.0 if it was ten years ago. So, something is out of date in terms of rating algorithm or possibly statistically taken advantage of by some groups or even bots as the years goes on.As for the movie; I'm going to keep it short since I used too much for the reviews and the rating system. The movie was disappointing and I felt like it was just aimed at teenagers and didn't care anyone beyond these range. My honest review for the movie is that you possibly don't like it if you are falling in my age group (30+) but I believe the less your age is the more possible you like it. I prefer to see a solid Spidy and villains like Green Goblin and Dr.Octopus. Can you imagine Jake Gyllenhaal as a villain in any fiction? It's totally unimaginable and must be a joke! Even Auntie May is not proper and disappointing regarding original comics. I rated it 6/10 just for the sake of the Spider Man title. I don't think I'll watch this Spider Man series unless some ""serious"" revison is made !",Spider-Man - Far from Home
1935,ma-24455,"Spider-Man wanted to reveal his feelings to a girl, but things got worse",10,18 September 2020,It was really interesting and still interesting i loved it so much,Spider-Man - Far from Home
1936,kobrah-59297,lazy and soulless sprinkled with events to give off the illusion that it's important,4,26 September 2020,"I should start off by saying that I wasn't a fan of Homecoming. I thought it was fine as a film but I didn't like it as a Spider-Man film. I didn't like the direction of Spider-Man himself. This time round, I don't like Far From Home as a film. The film is enjoyable but not very well made in my opinion.The film starts with the ""in memoriam"" scene which is basically a comedic recap of the events of Endgame. If you were a big fan of Endgame you would probably find this scene distasteful, but I think that Far From Home is it's own film and it's showing that it wants to be a comedic sequel to Endgame, that's fine. Then we get a scene with Peter being asked if he's going to be the next Iron Man and then mourning his death, that's also fine, that's amazing in fact, a film about that would be great. Then we get a comedy scene, then a scene about the field trip, then a scene about Peter not wanting to be Spider-Man, then a scene about Peter talking about wanting to seduce MJ (for some reason) and then... this film doesn't know what it wants to be. Maybe the secret genius of this film is making you feel like Spider-Man by giving you whiplash from the bad pacing and amount of tone shifts.Speaking of Spider-Man, he's pretty much a shell of what he was. I can't tell if this is supposed to be a new character or if I'm supposed to use my knowledge of previous versions of the character from the prequel or comics to understand his motivation. It seems like sometimes the film is telling me ""you're supposed to treat him like a new character, it doesn't matter if the Spider-Man you know wouldn't do this"" and at other times ""this is the Spider-Man you already know, you're supposed to connect the dots to understand where he's coming from"". It's just bad writing in my opinion. They reduced his character in Homecoming to a caricature. He's not the only one to get this treatment though.Just about every character in Homecoming feels like they've been reduced to caricatures in this film. Although I'm not a fan of Homecoming, the film did well at planting seeds for it's characters. For example, why did MJ like Peter yet was so distant towards him? why was Flash so desperate for validation and jealous of Peter? why was May so worried about Peter sneaking out and what would happen if she found out he was Spider-Man? well, we didn't find out and probably never will, we didn't find out and probably never will and we didn't find out and probably never will. Not only did the film not take advantage of those seeds Homecoming planted, it poured salt on them. They're all 1 dimensional in the film. Even Nick Fury is weirdly written and they try to excuse it with year 3 creative writing techniques by saying he was an alien the whole time, which means nothing, it doesn't change anything. This film uses excuses and illusions to make you think their lazy writing is better than it is, and their villain is a good example of this.Mysterio isn't a good villain in my opinion. I don't understand why he blows up cities and bridges. I don't understand how his motivation links into that. I don't understand how Tony Stark calling his invention BARF is even a motivation. The only thing I can think of to connect those dots is him being unstable, which is just bad and lazy writing in my opinion. Unstable villains can be great, I mean look at The Joker, Doc Ock and Killmonger. They all have clear end goals and a good motivation that pushes them to wanting to achieve that end goal but their broken world views and moral compasses cause them to go about it in morally incorrect ways. Mysterio just wants to blow stuff up because Tony Stark called his invention BARF a couple of years ago. Also apparently people actually found the campy reveal and exposition scene shocking. I don't want to insult anyone but if you've watched any Disney film, you would've known the overly nice guy is the villain. If you watched/read/researched any other Spider-Man media with Mysterio, you would've known he was the villain. If you noticed that the film has no villain yet and the only new character introduced is the guy who came out of nowhere, you would've known he was the villain.This film feels like it was directed by Mysterio at times. Not just because 90% of it looks fake, but also because the film is sprinkled with events to give off the illusion that it's important and worthwhile. For example: it has answers about some questions from Endgame just thrown in there, MJ and Peter get together without it feeling earned, the two post credit scenes are seemingly important for future films, etc. We could've been shown those scenes on their own and it would've had the same impact. The only thing this film has to offer ,other than those events, are the cool illusion scenes and forced MCU humour. The story is plot hole ridden and weak, the characters are weak and the hero doesn't evolve, grow or learn anything new.In conclusion: I think it's hard to enjoy this film as a Homecoming fan, Endgame fan or as a Spider-Man fan. It's still enjoyable but my god it's soulless and lazy. I imagine this went through production hell. There's a couple things I didn't mention like turning Spider-Man into Iron Man and the amount of plot holes and coincidences but I think this'll do.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

I wanted to see one of my favorite Spider-Man villains being played by one of my favourite actors. I wanted to see the aftermath of Avengers: Endgame and the snap. But most importantly, I wanted to see a Spider-Man movie. What I saw barely counts as that. This concept had the potential to be an emotionally potent story about Peter running from his responsibilities and the fact that he needs to step up without Iron Man around. Instead, we got a barely funny, lazily written, sometimes boring trip to Europe with no plot for a solid half the film, a predictable twist, and some bland action and CGI.

The world without Iron man and how peter should have do many question was occur and explain already but there have something still complicated like ""Why Nick Fury don't know that Quentin Beck (Mysterio) is have something conceal.""
The Technical of this movie: The CG, Sound or theme is masterpiece for Spider-man. Most of scene in this movie have use Green scene to help CG easier and everything look so real. Spiderman use many web for many different situation like web grenade also the motion is also best one of this movie.The character: For Peter parker(Spiderman) who starring as Tom Holland that in this movie he have to carry many responsibility so he have to play side of funny boy and dramatic scene at the same time and he still good casting as he is, and this time he have to carry of Tony stark expectation who like adoptive father also still amazing casting to be an superheroes and high school student.Overall: This movie is the best one of Marvel movie, Marvel still save their standard as good belong with good production. Moreover director and actor, they are fully for this movie so much. And the last part of Marvel is also highlight we well-known as ""End Credit"" this time make me feel excited and can't wait for next MCU phase.

1945,aunkarntida,Spider-Man Far From Home,10,11 May 2021,"Spider-Man Far From HomeThis movie is the movie I went to see in the I MAX cinema.It's a very good movie that spawned the Marvel universe. For me, it is a novelty. The storyline's character has fooled me since the trailer. Even though he went to look at it and still deceived and deceived Fool-by-scene, including the most peculiar End Credit scene ever seen. Accept the hearts of people who actually run or create the Marvel universe. After the end, Avenger doesn't think this will be any interesting. So I came to see that I was wrong because Spider Man Far from home was really good and it was really great. When watching in the cinema system I MAX scenes and pictures are really beautiful.When going to see the movie theater, I agree that the picture is very beautiful, I do not regret going to see it. (Some movies, the image will not have much dimension) all scenes are beautiful. It's so beautiful that I want to tell everyone to come and see. In this I max system, the travel scene is so beautiful as if we were in that event The fight scene is very spectacular in this system. However, I would like everyone to see in this system. Because this story is really made for viewing in IMAX.The best part of this movie is Text and story With a hero movie We will only find the same story over and over but this story is different Is fooling us since watching the movie trailer When I came to see the movie, I still deceived and deceived until End Credit was never encountering a hero movie that made us surprise this much. After watching it, I felt very satisfied. It's really good. From the first part that felt very normal But this sector is really too good
And with the film having a lovely and bright tone, but every scene has always been stressful. Makes everyone look fun, not too tight And the actor that I really like is Zendaya, who plays MJ, plays very well, really cool, is really suitable for our male protagonist. Chemistry
The villain in this sector uses Mysterio, which in the movie is a character with a lot of dimensions. Admit that he is a very cool looking villain and has plans all the time. Like the one taken from the beginning, it looks modern, excited.In conclusion, I watched it 2 times, I was still excited about CG.

Samuel L Jackson always does an amazing job whenever he appears as Nick Fury, and him teaming up with Spider-Man was awesome (with lots of funny moments). John Favreau made Happy Hogan become one of my favorite side characters after the movie ended. Also, Jake Gyllenhaal simply KILLED IT as Mysterio. His performance was phenomenal; add all the CGI to it and my mind was blown out the roof! I give Spider-Man Far From Home a 10/10. Can the next Spider-Man movie come out already???",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Spider-Man was already perfect, if you change that much it's not the good Spider-Man we already know. This ''interpretation'' of Spider-Man is just Tony Stark's trash cleaner, nothing more. It doesn't have it's own villian. Everything is just involves around Tony Stark. Nobody see's Spider-Man as villian, he is just a bump in the road. And he is soooo child. Spider-Man is not child, Peter is. When the mask is on, he becames MAN. And i'm getting sick of Tony Stark's suits, wtf? Peter is alone, poor exc. He makes EVERYTHING by HIMSELF.

1975,P-c-pugh,Tom Holland holds his own!,8,13 July 2019,"First thing to say is Tom Holland IS Spider-Man! I loved Toby Maguire back in the day, I even thought Andrew Garfield brought a refreshing slant to the character, after Toby's bad 3rd film. But Tom embodies Spider-Man, you really believe he's Him.
And his supporting cast, Aunt May, Happy and classmates are well up for the job, May and Happy's dynamic worked well and added something Marvel has been missing lately in the, all encompassing, run up to Endgame. Jake is very good, as always, but you feel like he is let down by how is character is written. His character is not really allowed to truly let rip in the way you seem to get the impression he would, I wonder if just one film for this character isn't really enough for us to have got the full benefit out of it.
This is very much a stand alone film in many ways, managing to bridge the huge gap left after Endgame in a way that feels right for characters like Ironman, and fair to people that got Blipped back. The worlds changed unimaginably in someways, but nice to know a boy still fancies a girl; and when your a teenager that takes over your world whatever is happening.
You almost want to think that a stand alone ""small"" story wasn't enough after the huge run up to Infinity War and Endgame, but it actually manages to do it so well it really does feel like the end of ""Phase 4"", with the two end credits scenes giving a glimpse into the future of the MCU and how Spider-Man is going to possibly fit in that new world.
After the death of Ironman you wonder who could fill his shoes, the set up is clear they currently want it to be Spider-Man and with this film we see that Tom's Spider-Man could possibly do it.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

Not like most of the other marvel movies. It heartfelt and ""real"". The emotions of Spider-Man can be understood by all because he is so identifiable.

There were many attempts at humour that left the audience in the theatre silent, not even a chuckle to be heard. Anyone hoping for anything resembling the Spider-Man of the comic book glory years will leave very dissatisfied. The Disney influence is being felt more and more with each new release. At this rate the era of the super hero movie may be coming to an end.

Spider-Man was great, the amount of Spider-Man used in the film especially the second half was great. Mysterio was great, perfect casting for the role. The only negative about this film is the pacing of the film. The Raimi films had much better pacing and things weren't happening all over the place and that's something I would've loved for this movie. The movie felt a bit short and things were happening very fast, like the beginning of the movie everything just happens so quick and you just have to accept it. The soundtrack was great, but sometimes not too great with action sequences. Where is the soundtrack for the intro though??

Both actors combined to make some of the greatest scenes in a Spider-Man film to date. I'm ready for Tom Holland to be the next lead of the MCU. My only complaint was that I knew the plot twist when I was old enough to read comics. The entire first hour expected the audience to buy into the lie that Mysterio was a good guy when in fact the villain was introduced 55 years ago in TASM #13. The first act felt like a waste of my time, and I found myself not really caring for the characters. What this movie failed to do was realize that we don't need a plot twist; Peter Parker does. The original Spider-Man with Tobey Maguire did a great job with the Green Goblin in this case. Of course we knew he was a villain, but that doesn't mean Peter doesn't have to! With this being said, I throughly enjoyed the last half of the movie once they stopped beating around the bush.

2027,jacknaven,"The definition of the word ""fine"".",5,15 May 2020,"Not much more to say really. It was fine.Mysterio. Dull villain overall. I don't get why the MCU seem insistent on not using major Spiderman villains. Mysterio's the kind of villain Spiderman should defeat in the first 10 minutes of the movie or so before moving onto the MAIN antagonist.Jake G is one of the best actors going, yet he was uninspiring in this film, so I think that says a lot about the material he was given.The whole reusing of Syndrome's villainous plot from The Incredibles was just... not great either. Didn't help that most of us already know Mysterio is a Spiderman villain, so the twist really wasn't much of a twist because we were totally way ahead of the film in expecting that turn.There was no real stakes throughout it for me. Everything in the film all felt so throwaway and goofy, I never felt really invested in anything. Apart from Peter's relationship with MJ of course. They're cute.Also, the special effects for Mysterio just didn't look very good to me. Now maybe that's tied into the plot to be fair, but it still was off putting.I liked Homecoming, didn't love it, but the thing I liked the least about it was how tied in everything in that movie was to Iron Man and The Avengers, instead of being it's own story set in that world, and this film sadly really doubled down on tying into Iron Man and all that. The result being that it doesn't end up feeling like a Spiderman film, but instead like Avengers lite. And not in a good way like Civil War did.You could have still had Peter dealing with losing Tony, but then have his own separate adventure that didn't directly relate to Tony Stark, or in this case, have the entire movie be still entirely about him. Spiderman is one of the all time great superheroes, give him his own stories and adventures please!And finally, THAT EXPOSITION SCENE, was just terrible. Everyone in the room already knew all that, why was Mysterio just telling them all? The characters already knew all that.

One of the thing I hated most about Tobey is his shyness/awkwardness and making Peter a total wuss. Tom does make Peter awkward, obviously, but in a funny and an interactive with other characters way.
The movie is filled with funny moments, AMAZING CGI, great acting and touching moments that give you goosebumps.For all of those who compare the MCU Spiderman to Tobey's, just stop. You only like the old movies only because they're nostalgic, not because they are in any way better, not in acting, character arcs, VFX, and storyline.The MCU does Peter a great, fresh and fitting to today's culture rework since the old movies and it's the best thing we could've asked for.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
2032,bilboleslie,What was that?,2,14 October 2019,"What a bloody awful mess. Strong do not recommend. Chaos, confusing plot, and confusing subplots. Zendaya is interesting, Spidey does ok, but the script failed them.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
2033,nate-184-207252,The worst spider man movie ever made,2,8 July 2020,"I am truly astonished by all the high ratings/reviews I am reading here. I never saw the movie in theaters because it looked lame from the trailers. So I waited for blu-ray and finally watched it last night.Correction: I watched the first 40 minutes and then got so bored, almost fell asleep, and turned it off. My wife was bored silly with it also.The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that the acting was actually pretty good.This movie should have been titled ""A Boring High School Field Trip"".Here is the short list of what is wrong with this film:
Ridiculous, boring plotPoor dialogToo far-fetched (a satellite built by Tony Stark and now at the command of Spidey, that can send in drone strikes??)Gimmicky (the scene where peter is told to take off his clothes, and a fellow student walks in and sees him with a woman - this gimmick is so overused and has been done numerous times in other movies - it's what I would expect maybe from a first-time writer who hasn't yet figure out how to be original)The big visual CGI scenes seemed forced and simply plunked in between boring plot segments.How can Marvel make such a lame movie? And why do so many people love it?Just as a benchmark so you know where I'm coming from, I loved both the Amazing Spider Man movies, and I loved the Toby Maguire spideys 1 and 3. The first Tom Holland spiderman movie was meh-ok, not great. But this one was truly awful.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

2040,joshuabonardo,Just don't compare it with others,10,12 July 2019,"I think it's a great movie with great plot and great actors. This movie is succeed in showing Peter's struggle as a teenager who wants to enjoy his highschool moments and being a regular-street hero, while everybody gives him pressures by telling him the next Tony Stark and he being asked to finish the ""Avengers Level-Threat"", which he doesn't suppose to handle. Besides the story, Tom Holland is still potraying Peter Parker in a good way alongside the supporting role of the movie, especially Jon Favreau, Jacob Batalon, and Jack Gyllenhaal. I think Jon Favreau has better potrayal as Happy in this movie as he gave a better look as assistant/father figure who support Peter wherever and whenever he needs. Jacob Batalon always serve us with fun and laugh in almost every scene he played as Ned. And Jack Gyllenhaal is the best supporting role in this movie. Twisted and Maniac. That is all I can say for his potrayal as Quentin Beck a.k.a Mysterio.The problem is the fact that everybody still compare this movie to the likes of another MCU movies, Raimi's Spider-Man, The Amazing Spider-Man, and many more. Please guys, this is a very different Spider-Man movie. I can say that this movie is even has a different perspective than Homecoming. Not only that, others even compared this movie with the comic, saying that they already figured out the twist or disappointed with Mysterio. Dude, there are so many fans that enjoys the movie without read or know the comic's first. Besides, I think anybody couldn't suggest that Mysterio is related to some ""legend"" even though they knew he is the main villain.I think that's all I can say. In brief, this is an amazing movie, just don't compare it with others.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

2043,JohnJosephRigas,Where is Spider-Man?,5,17 July 2019,"Okay I get it Spider-Man is in the entire movie but it is not the Spider-Man character. This character feels like Tony Stark's prototype child that has to do everything Tony would have wanted to do. Tony is dead! Maybe mention you miss him once then move on let Spider-Man be his own character. The character is basically what Nick Fury would have done if he had the powers as he controls everything. I think Tom Holland is a great Peter Parker and Spider-Man but it's the script that let him down. We have no Uncle Ben the most classic character for Spider-Man, Everyone and I mean everyone knows who's Spider-Man is. I'm not saying this movie is terrible but I'm not saying it's the best Spider-Man of all time. No movie has to be great and no movie has to be terrible.

We love the actual spider-man cause he's the real teenager hero we know from the first apperance. But this follow up movie was kind of childish. A boy doing things wrong you know at the moment you saw them and he's doing it all over again and again and again...If it wasn't for the actors and special effects, this would be a mess.

2054,shubhaankar,Definitely the Second Best,9,9 July 2019,"The MCU definitely had huge shoes to fill in after Avengers Endgame, needless to say Far From Home delivers to the expectations completely. Picking right from the aftermath of Endgame, Tom Holland gives us the spider man we have been waiting for - talkative funny and also on edge due to the events of Endgame. Jake Glyenhall as always delivers an enigmatic and yet relatable Mysterio - as someone who is recovering from professional setbacks and an increasingly changing world with a thirst to prove himself. Jackson's Nick Fury is back in full form backed by Agent Hill. To add to the classic feel, we also have our first look at Mary Jane, who forms a major part of the entire narrative. To add to the already stunning VFX and loads of high end technology which the movie propagates, we have the 'Elementals' , entities from a different dimension, with of course a great inclination to destroy Earth. Overall, the film is an experience as it makes Tom Holland transition from the enthusiastic and playful 'kid' from Civil War and Infinity War into a identity of his own. Sit through the entire credits as it lays down foundations for upcoming Phase 4 of the MCU.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

It ties well into the MCU while simultaneously making for a great stand alone film, though fans unfamiliar with Iron Man will miss out on some of the more emotional points. My favorite aspect is the high school drama/MJ romance. Peter has to make hard decisions and work through his priorities as he's being pulled in 2 directions. He's funny, awkward, quirky, passionate, and kicks butt as Spider-Man. Also, don't leave before the end credit scenes, the first of which might as well have been part of the movie, and the second sets up phase 4 in a very clever way.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

2071,kabirz,Far from being a great spidey sequel!,4,16 September 2019,"The MCU Spidey's second installment is just another spidey movie for MCU Fans. The only thing best about this movie is the antagonist i.e. Jake Gyllenhaal's ""Mysterio"" and if anyone doesn't know his character that means they are living under a rock, i.e. which already gives away the suspense this movie holds in the middle of the second act. Overall the film can said to be really a ""step up"" far from the first one in the means of action, otherwise the storytelling, the plot, the subplot and the development is very very poor for a ""Spider-man"" oriented movie. The only good scenes are the two scenes, one which we see in the second act and one which comes after the mid credits. The unexpected cliffhanger is just so annoying as the one which we saw in the end of the first movie.

I can't relate to this spider man because he lacks everything that make spider man, Spider man: the responsibility sense is none, the guilt isn't there, the emotional growth is none and the spirit in none.

2091,Livingdale21587,An unfavorable start of the post-Endgame era.,5,17 November 2019,"After watching this movie, I writhed and writhed in bed, unable to go to sleep, my mind filled with all the non-sensical happenings that I had just witnessed. Let me discuss a few instances here.
Having defeated the fire monster in Prague, Beck and Peter decide to have a drink in the local bar, the latter with his mask off. My question is, what if someone in the bar recognizes the glowing guy and the kid in the black suit, who just saved the town? What if they take a photo of them and post it online, revealing Peter as The Night Monkey to pretty much the entire world? Is Peter that comfortable with showing his face in the public?
Another major gripe I have about the story is the fact that Peter, fully cognizant of its capabilities,decides to give EDITH to a guy he barely knows-- what the living hell? Remember Project Insight in Captain America: The Winter Soldier? Well, it doesn't even hold a candle to EDITH. In my opinion, a tech as powerful and dangerous as EDITH shouldn't be owned by anyone. It's infuriating how careless and stupid his decision is.
After Peter realizes that Beck is a liar and gets tricked into telling him with whom he's shared this information, I can't believe he doesn't even try to alert Ned and MJ about the danger they are in. And since he now knows Beck can deceive people with ease, why doesn't he take any precautions? For example, he can tell Happy to hire a bus to take his classmates for protection. It shouldn't be difficult, considering that Happy has a plane at his disposal (indicating adequate wealth), not to mention how gullible and easy to manipulate Mr. Harrington is. Speaking of Mr. Harrington, I'm flabbergasted that, when the water monster shows up in London, he keeps bickering with Mr. Dell instead of leading the kids immediately off the bus and away from the bridge, which could be flooded or even torn down any minute. Life-and-death responsibility is elided in favor of so-called ""humor.""
Oh, right, one more thing: Where are the police in Europe? I don't recall seeing even one police car when the monsters are wrecking havoc, not in Venice, not in Prague, and certainly not in London. Maybe the police in the MCU have a special protocol of not responding to situations like this, in order to clear the stage for the superheroes who can then provide the audiences with flashy action sequences and make them say: ""Wow, the VFX are so cool! Ticket money well spent! Who cares how the real world works?"" In reality, I'm pretty sure there would be police cars, police choppers, news choppers and fire engines everywhere when such a catastophe is going down.
I can see that Tom Holland tried his best to play this role. However, his earnestness as well as Jake Gyllenhall's brilliance are wasted in this movie, because the story fails to make much sense. The Dark Knight is great for a number of things and one of them is the excellently-written screenplay. It's realistic, well thought-out, and has stood the test of time. It pains me to trash on this movie and a lot of people will probably hate me for doing so, but I simply cannot turn a blind eye to all its problems and say: ""Yeah, this is solid entertainment. Give me more movies like this please.""",Spider-Man - Far from Home

2096,Liam_Clark_06,"Far from home, not far off the mark",7,17 July 2019,"As a huge marvel and 'MCU' fan I was extremely excited for this highly anticipated sequel to the charming and thoroughly entertaining, Spiderman Homecoming. And by no stretch was I disappointed by the movie that Jon Watts delivered as all the way through I was hooked and captivated by what I was watching. however there were certain moments where I felt like lazy story writing had taken place and some plot points ,to me, did not feel like they had a place/fit in with the rest of the film.Positives: To start with I would like to highlight the positives of this movie as there are many to discuss. Right from the beginning of the film, it does an amazing job at bridging the gap between the end of Avengers Endgame and how the 'MCU' has been affected because of it. The use of 'The Blip' and how it was introduced to us through a school news report was a very appropriate and fitting was to explain the consequences of the previous film in a condensed fashion that did not take up too much valuable screen time. The explanation that the movie supplied made sense and really shed some light on what was for me, and I'm sure many others, a very head scratching concept of people simply returning to their normal lives 5 years later. It also offered some funny moments as we saw students in the school returning 5 years later after Thanos' snap. It also cannot go unmentioned the performances inside the film are phenomenal, particularly from our 2 leads, Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal, who both respectively play their characters to an amazing standard. Holland continues to show why he is the best casting of the wall-crawler on the silver screen to date as he provides another incredibly charming, hilarious and emotional performance. In my opinion, I much more preferred his portrayal of Peter Parker than I did his portrayal of Spiderman, which in a way I believe is what the movie was aiming to do as the premise of the film is centred around Peter and his friends on a school trip to Europe which inevitably, does not go to plan. I believe his portrayal of Parker exceeded that of the web-slinger as he manages to deliver the emotional and hard hitting lines when needed but even more impressive, can deliver the awkward moments down to a tee whether that be through his interactions with MJ/Zendaya, Nick Fury/Samuel L Jackson etc. which truly encapsulate the essence of Spiderman and the character as a whole. However, not to be outshined, Jake Gyllenhaal once again proves why he is one of the finest actors of our generation as he delivers a Nightcrawler esque performance as he begins as the captivating leading man who acts a role model to Peter Parker in the first act of the film but also delivers a truly maniacal performance as the betrayed, ex-employee of Tony Stark. I also would like to give credit to Jon Favreau who consistently throughout the film plays his comedic role perfectly and even gets his chance to become the hero in the final act, although I wouldn't quite call him super. Finally I would like to discuss the fantastic special effects that this movie displays particularly at the midpoint in the film where we see the full power of Mysterio and what he is capable of with an action sequence that arguably tops those of Doctor strange. with illusions that will have your mind warped this film does an exceptional job of captivating you and truly drawing you into the action sequence you are witnessing.Negatives: Now no matter how much I wanted to love this film, there were some moments that left me confused and frankly disappointed. where most of this films weaknesses lie for me are with the plot itself. I really like the first act of the film and the friendly banter between peter parker and Quentin Beck and whilst I was expecting the inevitable twist I as surprised when it happened . shortly after this however is where I find one of my immediate disappointments with the film and that is the way that Mysterio's plot and plan was revealed, in that of a toast!!! this to me felt like an incredibly lazy way to explain such a complex and large scale plan. while it did the job I feel that there were many other ways that this could have been explained and did leave a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. My second flaw with this movie, was that of the Tony Stark glasses plot line. I was not a fan of this I could not buy that the smartest and most intelligent person in the entire 'MCU' would have left what is essentially a weapon of mass destruction in the hands of a teenager. I suppose his thought process made sense as he does believe that peter can be his replacement and be the next iron man so to speak but the fact that he would have left such a dangerous piece of technology in the hands of high schooler just did not make sense to me. some smaller things that I think they got away with would be Ned in this film and the summer romance plot line that they gave him was good for cheap laughs throughout the film but at times was over used and frankly cringy. But without a doubt the worst thing about this film is the scene on the bus where Peter nearly ills another student with the Tony's glasses. this scene was just so pointless and added nothing to the film except that it made in a way dislike Peter Parker as it mad me think that he is so irresponsible that I even less believed that Stark would have left these glasses to Peter.Overall I did find this film thoroughly enjoyed this film despite its plot holes and errors the performances by the cast make this film very rewatchable and one that I would recommend to any superhero movie fan.I am not going to touch on the post credit scenes, and if you want to watch them you will have to go and watch the film for yourself.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

More web swinging fun, more fight sequences (the 3rd act sent shivers down my spine btw). The film also explores Peter's main characteristics from the comics, a smart, kind hearted teen that we all know and love that is surrounded by yep -- RESPONSIBILITIES.

2102,randomname-40844,"Yes, the movie. But someone has to talk about that thing in the mid-credits scene.",8,4 July 2019,"Certainly enjoyable, and very ambitious. It progresses naturally from the events of Endgame, and it shines best during its character moments, when you see Peter struggle with the loss of Tony and his internal struggle of wanting to just be a normal kid and to run away from the weight of the expectations left behind by the loss of Iron Man.Mysterio's motivations are alright but not as convincing as the Vulture's in Homecoming, and the CG fight in the end was kinda wonky and bland at times, but they aren't deal-breakers.With all that said, my absolute favorite part of this movie is: J.K. Simmons getting re-cast as JJJ. We asked for it, we dreamt about it, and they ACTUALLY DID IT. Bumped up my rating by another star just because of this.

The fight scenes are better made in some youtube fan made movies, the jokes are forced, story is lame, finally horrible horrible acting. From the first moment itself I was not able to connect at all to this trash. Had high hopes after avengers from mcu to come up with something new and refreshing. Mcu completely failed a beloved hero. You Buggers did not allow the character of the spidy to develop. You can hire big names like j g but don't allow him to show what he can do. Instead you hire all crooks and boat to write good review for you!!! Even there is no genuine emotions there too if some under 16 want to see some teen love. I blame director, producer, and mcu for giving us this trash and if they think they can get some good money for their old work- not going to work.

2123,birdfamily-49179,Very interesting Spider-Man movie!!!,9,6 July 2019,"In my opinion the movie had some good laughs, action, drama, funny romance and it was very emotional in a few parts, which hit and pulled on a few heart strings. This was a very enjoyable movie and that hit most of the right notes.Samuel L Jackson is very funny and I really enjoyed watching him, he's also really good at doing serious scenes as well, like always. their was also a plot twist at the end of the movie that involved him init that I didn't see coming.Spidey and his love interest have very good chemistry (MJ), so does Spidey and his best friend, (Ned), also so does Spidey and Happy Hogan, he's like a new father to him like stark was, before uncle Ben in Peter's earlier years got shot. Their was a big shocking twist between them 3/4 through movie that I'll mention but won't spoil, that involves Spidey and MJ.When Spidey had the Edith classes on in the bus scene, that was very funny cause he accidentally uses them in some way that threatens a kids life on the bus, poor Spidey can't take a break lol.Mysterio is very mysterious, sorry for the pun! He can also be very dark in some parts, epically after you watch his plot twist, for the people who have watched it you know I'm talking about and at the end after the credits role stick around cause theirs another big twist that will have you in shock.The teachers were very funny as well, also Happy Hogan is like a new father too Spidey cause you know why.Ant May does what most mother's do yet again and cares for her son Peter.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

2125,CactusCult,Peter Parker - The Avenger / The Kid,10,4 July 2019,Marvel has proven that they can maintain smaller stories that more than hold up to epics like infinity war/endgame.

The character of Mysterio was created so convincingly that for the first part of the movie I thought he was really a superhero.The fight sequences between Spider Man and Mysterio were visually spectacular.

2148,tylerbrowne-23945,Lots of fun but lazy,7,14 July 2019,"Spiderman far from home is very funny and enjoyable film it has all of marvel trademarks. I think Tom Hollands performance is excellent,his chemistry with Zendaya in there love story is great and natural but what happened to Peters former love she is not mentioned once and we don't know what has happened to her. Samuel L Jackson offers some of the best one liners in the film however the twist that he wasn't there and the scrolls were doing his job was weird and i guess was ment to be funny but it did not work for me.Jake Gyllenhaal performance is great and the illusion scene is my favourite scene in the film. The scenes with myistero giving Peter advice on life before he turns bad got me emotional invested it the film. The fact however that we got another villain that is out to get Tony and not Peter felt lazy and less impactful compared to homecoming since Tony is dead and not in the movie. The final battle was ok but lacked any stakes since Peter was just destroying drones. THE BIG TWIST in the post credits while shocking and accomplishing its goal felt like lazy writing to me, Peter in the is very different to any other hero in the MCU because he is the only one who has to keep his identity safe to continue his every day life and now that has been Taken away from him he is one step closer to being a poor mans iron man however this twist does make me want to see spiderman 3 and does open a interesting road of stories for the next film and phase 4 in general. Overall i really enjoyed the film and recommend it if you enjoy superhero films the acting is great especially Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal, the film is very funny and light hearted has some good action even though it lacks any stakes most of the time. I think were the movie falls down is its lazy writing mystero being another upset employee of Tony stark is just lazy and repetitive and the twist at the well.. i have already made my point on that.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

The script is poor as in the jokes don't land and the spilling of emotion doesn't seem to work

2156,alannahgrace-88421,Enjoyable but disappointing,5,17 July 2019,"I was highly anticipating this movie,and to be honest ,I am disappointed.I feel like Marvel are trying too hard to be funny,and it's as if they thought it was a quirky rom-com instead of a blockbuster superhero franchise.They also focused too heavily on the love story of MJ and Peter.I don't completely hate the movie.The highlight for me was Jake Gyllenhaals performance as Quentin Beck(aka Mysterio).The special effects were also breathtaking.Overall,I enjoyed this movie but I also expected more.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
2157,romansjeffrey,A must watch after Endgame,9,3 July 2019,"Spider-Man Far from Home is a lot of fun, full of heart. If your MCU fun, it is a must watch!",Spider-Man - Far from Home
2158,mbekkerphoto,"Great film, just a bit disjointed.",8,9 July 2019,"Knowing what SM is capable of is a completely mixed bag. One scene he's strong the next not so much. Then he's smart then he can't figure out the simplest things. Great film, but just no balance. Is it serious, is funny, is a massive vfx blockbuster, is it a romance, it all just seems like they couldn't decide on what to go with so they went with everything.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
2159,filipdecuk,Spider-Man: Far From the best Spider-Man movie,6,19 July 2019,"Honestly, the movie was okay. I didn't hate it, I didn't love it, it was fun to watch, but that's it. It didn't beat the original Spider-Man, its sequel, Into the Spider-Verse, not even Homecoming. Taking Spider-Man out of his usual New York setting was a mistake, but I guess the point of this film was to make it as unrelated to Spider-Man as possible.The whole movie feels like it's still focused on Iron Man. I know that the MCU is his legacy and thia movie is still in the third phase, but the villain had absolutely NO connection to Peter. The previous films felt way more personal because Peter and the villains had connection. That's why the ""big reveal"" (that I think will have no impact on thw future because MCU Peter, or someone else, will find a way to discredit Mysterio, I mean, they have Skrulls on their side) felt far less triumphant. Peter faced no consequences fo his actions, taking away the core characteristics of Spider-Man. Sure, in the previous film, they estabilished Spider-Man as this fun character and kid who is trying to balance his life, but now that Tony is gone, it's time for Spider-Man to step up. It still feels that Peter learnt no lessons from his previous actions and is irresponsible. I mean, he tried to use the Stark tech on his classmate just to erase that pic so M.J. does not see it? That's not like Spider-Man at all, not to mention he almost got Brad killed.Peter said that Aunt May would freak out if she found out that he is Spidey. Guess what she does? She doesn't freak out, that makes the whole reveal and tension from the end of Homecoming pointless. Hell, even the idea of Aunt May dealing with her nephew's secret identitt isn't explored at all. She appears in like 5 minutes of the entire movie and all she does is supporting Peter in his dual life (talk about irresponsibility). His classmates aren't developed at all, aside from that wierd Betty-Ned relationship that was pretty much pointless and served the sole purpose - easter egg on their comic relationship.Now to the villains. Or rather the one villains. Mysterio. Jake did, as usually, great job, but he was given far too little. His speech in the bar about his origin seemed to me as it was taken straight out of 80's comic book where villain is explaining his motives, plans, and origins, which really shows they had no space in any other part of the movie for that to properly explain him. Other than that, he was a great and a clever villain. I really like the changes they did, but they should've made him more connected with Peter and overall give him more space.The chemistry between characters is good, too. I mean, between M.J. and Peter, really. Both actors really enjoyed it, it was fun, awkward, basically teenage crap like that. Although, I'd still rather see Spidey with one of his comic girlfriend (I mean, he had sooo many), I'm glad how it turned out.As a hardcore Spider-Man fan, one thing that bothered me so much throughout Spidey's entire time in MCU is how they don't acknowledge the one reason why Peter's Spider-Man - Uncle Ben. The only reference to him was the suitcase Peter uses and his little speech in Civil War (which didn't even directly tie to Ben). Uncle Ben's entire role is taken by Stark. I know they wanted to find Peter a place in this bigger world, this is his first time on big screen that he shares a universe with other heroes and has to fit in to not be too disconnected, but really? You couldn't at least mention his name? Peter was Spidey before he met Stark, so why are they acting like Iron Man was the one who shaped him up?Now, to the best part of the movie - my boi, J.K. Simmons. This really did put a smile on my face, I felt so excited when the reporter said ""Daily Bugle"", I knew it was coming. Great little tribute to the one and only J. Jonah Jameson.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
2160,proimran-37224,Watch of the month,7,4 July 2019,It's that movie that you would definitely spend your month's savings for. You'll be highly disappointed if you're going to get on that seat expecting Endgame. The mid-credits and post-credits scenes will leave your jaw loose.,Spider-Man - Far from Home

2162,jordyk-44417,IF YOUR LOOKING FOR COMIC BOOK STORY COPY DON'T WATCH,9,2 July 2019,"I can't understand why people are giving 1 and 2 stars for this film based on comics?
This is a completely different story for spiderman and fun all the way to the end!
Tom Holland plays a unique spiderman different to the comics because its a original story in its own right, I mean in comics how many different incarnations of spiderman have we seen? This is not a bad one but people looking for likeness to the comics will enjoy the first 3 spiderman films but its time to move on, they are from back then and this is now so enjoy this film for what it is and if not go home and cry to your Toby maguir collection.",Spider-Man - Far from Home

2164,jamesgunn-52143,THE WORST MCU FILM I'VE SEEN,1,2 July 2019,"It was more like watching a romantic film rather than an mcu film. Straight from the start it disrespected the lost on endgame, including a photo of Tony Stark from before he stopped his weapons division. I found this as an insult as he had just saved the universe.
Furthermore throughout the film it was boring, repetitive and heavily cgi based. You may say this about any marvel film such as Captain Marvel but the Cgi in FFH was preposterous. The film had a few good ideas but it felt as if they couldn't pick one so the shoved them all in without explaining them all that well. Once again SONY has put their input to a Spiderman film and it has turned back into just another Spiderman film with another actor fulling Spider-Man's suit (No offence to Tom Holland). The only part good about the film was in the mid season credits when the cameo of J.Jamerson had appeared. And for the end credit scene it was absurd and gave no clue to what marvel has planned for phase 4",Spider-Man - Far from Home

2168,kidbuddydude,Very good movie!,8,31 July 2019,"I didn't start watching the movie with high expectations,because Homecoming was pretty weak and it's hard to live up to the original spider-man and TheAmazing Spider-Man trilogies. It began pretty light-hearted, which was a plus for me, as I enjoy comedy films. Then it started picking up on the action and I wasn't disappointed at all. The performances by the actors were great, the jokes were funny and the plot was not too exagerate. I don't like the avengers series, so a downside for me would be the constant reference to Tony Stark. Overall, it is a very enjoyable movie, and you might like it even more than me, based on your opinion of Marvel movies.",Spider-Man - Far from Home
