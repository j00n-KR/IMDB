0,Leofwine_draca,Merely so so,5,26 October 2021,"The latest DC Comics superhero movie and once again it's rather generic and forgettable in tone. The action in this one is okay but the comedy is very poor and Harley Quinn herself is best in small doses, so making her the lead character is a bizarre choice. The deliberately adult tone just means constant swearing shoehorned into the script while Ewan McGregor's bad guy is as bland as they come. It's better than GUNPOWDER MILKSHAKE thanks to a couple of halfway decent action scenes and creatively quirky moments, but the rest is merely so-so.",Birds of Prey
1,SnoopyStyle,mostly fine,6,3 April 2020,"Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) has daddy issues and relationship problems. She gets dumped by the Joker. In a reckless explosive gesture, she reveals her split to the world. Without Joker's protection, all of her enemies including psychopath kingpin Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor) come out for her head. She is also hounded by police detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez). The situation gets even more chaotic when the Bertinelli diamond gets stolen by pickpocket Cassandra Cain. It's the key to the Bertinelli crime family fortune. Helena Bertinelli (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is the last surviving member and she kills with a crossbow. Dinah Lance (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) is a nightclub singer and secretly the Black Canary.Mostly, I like this. I don't give a damn about Birds of Prey. This is a Harley Quinn movie and should be straight up about her. The title should be about her. The movie can introduce Birds of Prey at the end but it should be all Harley all the time. I'm fully into it up to the color splatter gunfight at the police station. For some reason, the movie decides to go back a week. I don't think it's necessary. Those bits should be simply incorporated into the introductory section. It's a speed bump in the story and this movie has a couple of those. On top of it all, the cinematic style needs some Edgar Wright. It already has the bright colors and manic ideas. Margot is doing some crazy accent. With some Wright stylistic touches, this would really work. This is a fine Harley Quinn movie but it's not much for the others.",Birds of Prey
2,Prismark10,Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn,5,4 December 2020,"After a badass and scintillating turn as the naughty kaleidoscopic vixen Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad.Margot Robbie gets her own spin off squad. The Birds of Prey but this feels like more of a chaotic Harley Quinn standalone movie with some new members bolted on.Harley Quinn has been dumped by the Joker and she makes a statement about the split. She blows up the chemical factory that cemented their love.Without the Joker's protection it is now open season on Harley Quinn. First in line is club owner and ambitious crime boss Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor.) Detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez) is also hot on her heels.Roman has lost a Bertinelli diamond which was stolen by pickpocket Cassandra Cain. It gives Harley Quinn a chance to escape from Roman by finding Cassandra Cain and the diamond.However nightclub singer and the new driver for Roman, Dinah Lance also keeps a watchful eye on Cassandra Cain. Then there is the mysterious Huntress who wants to wreak vengeance.Directed by Cathy Yan who only has few credits to her name. Her inexperience shows. This is an incoherent noisy and empty spectacle.It has a zippy beginning but the unreliable narration grates and the film becomes a hot mess as it busily looks for a plot.The rest of the Birds of Prey are thinly sketched with only Dinah Lance standing out.",Birds of Prey
3,claudio_carvalho,Silly and Entertaining,6,27 April 2020,"In Gotham City, the Joker breaks up with Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) and without his protection, several criminals that have a beef with her hunt her down. When the teenager Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco) pickpockets a diamond that has the account numbers of a fortune from the gangster Victor Zsasz (Chris Messina), who is the right-hand of the powerful criminal Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor), he put a contract on her. Harley Quinn, Police Detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez), Helena ""The Huntress"" Bertinelli (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and Dinah ""Black Canary"" Lance (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) team up to protect Cassandra.""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"" is a silly and entertaining adventure of the anarchic psychiatrist Harley Quinn. The plot is a mess with many silly scenes trying to be funny, but the conclusion is full of action and entertains.

4,nogodnomasters,You killed my sandwich,7,17 February 2020,"Harley (Margot Robbie) breaks up with the Joker and is wanted dead by half the city including Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor). A valuable diamond gets swallowed by a pick-pocket which fuels a plot littered with flashbacks and read characters.The film had its moments but Harley's dialogue seems to have gone downhill. The supporting birds did very well even though not fully developed. Perhaps this film is meant to simply introduce the characters. Good soundtrack. Ewan McGregor sucked again as he did in ""Dr. Sleep"". How is he still employed?Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity",Birds of Prey
5,kosmasp,Sticking it to the man,6,4 April 2020,"Margot Robbie is the joker ... not the Joker, but like a joker. As in I love her so much, it is almost impossible for me to see a movie with her and not like it. Ok jokes aside, her character has finally some development here, in stark contrast to the Suicide Squad movie she was a part of.Concentrating on women is generally a good thing. The problem some may have is not that, but the cliches that will become quite apparent throughout the movie. Not to mention the sheer luck (or coincidence?) the main characters seem to have. If you don't mind this and are all for female (em)power(ment) and don't mind the one brush of character our bad guy has (Ewan McGregor is still quite amazing, even with so little to play with, no pun intended) ... you will have fun. Not everything has to be excellent ... still a long way to come back on top though",Birds of Prey
6,Sleepin_Dragon,It made me sleepy.,3,13 February 2020,"I'm glad I had my phone, the first half of the film was so boring, the second part was less boring, but still not great. Margot Robbie is good in the role, and she has some great fight scenes, the trouble is that the remainder of the film is so tedious. Good visuals, the trouble is the core of the film simply isn't there to make anything meaningful.Ewan McGregor was wasted, isn't there a better role for him out there somewhere??? Surely???? He was a dreadful antagonist, not his capabilities, but the character, did they intentionally make him lifeless?I can't help but compare it to The Joker, it doesn't compare favourably. It looked good in the trailers, but they literally showed all of the action scenes.I was expecting to be entertained, but in truth I was bored, and judging by others sat next to me yawning, so were others. 3/10",Birds of Prey
7,classicsoncall,"""Nothing gets a guy's attention like violence.""",6,8 August 2020,"This seemed like a story DC Comics did for the sake of getting it out of the way. I didn't care much for it, not being able to warm up to any of the characters. I haven't read any comics in a couple of decades, but any so called super-heroes who don't make the A-list I generally have no patience for. I wouldn't even call these 'Birds of Prey' super-heroes in the traditional sense. Black Canary's (Jurnee Smollett) ability to scream her way out of a jam is about the lamest thing I think I've seen in the genre. The best thing to witness in this picture are the well choreographed fight sequences which are impeccably timed and quite creatively accomplished. Most disappointing was the camera's non-flattering treatment of Rosie Perez as Detective Renee Montoya; it seemed like a casting error in contrast to the other members of the group. Given the 'f' word strewn dialog and callous behavior of all these 'birds', I'd suggest you look for your role models elsewhere. Not to mention locking your kids up in the basement when this comes on.",Birds of Prey
8,jboothmillard,Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),7,13 February 2020,"Suicide Squad was the big screen debut for the love interest and sidekick of the Joker, first introduced in Batman: The Animated Series, it had mixed reactions. But there no were complaints to be made about the actress and the character, so there came this follow-up, the eighth film in the DC Extended Universe. Basically, set some time after defeat of the Enchantress, the Joker breaks up with Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie, also producing), throwing her out on the streets of Gotham City. She is taken in by elderly Chinese restaurant owner Doc (Dana Lee). Recovering from her abusive relationship, Harley cuts her hair, adopts a spotted hyena, and blows up the Ace Chemicals plant where she pledged herself to the Joker. After this, Harley spends the evening in a nightclub owned by gangster Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor), she cripples Roman's driver (Daniel Bernhardt) and meets burlesque singer Dinah Lance aka Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell, Jussie Smollett's sister). Harley gets highly intoxicated; Dinah rescues her an attempted abduction. Impressed by Dinah's skills, Roman appoints her as his new driver. Meanwhile, GCPD Detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez) (another character first seen in Batman: The Animated Series) is investigating a series of mob killings carried out by a crossbow-wielding vigilante. Montoya realises that the Ace Chemicals explosion, and finding Harley's necklace, is an indication that Harley has broken up with the Joker. Montoya thinks Harley is danger without the Joker's protection, and approaches Dinah about being an informant on Roman for the police, but Dinah rejects the offer. Roman is seeking a diamond embedded with the account numbers to the Bertinelli crime family fortune, who were massacred years ago. Roman sends Dinah and his sadistic right-hand-man Victor Zsasz (Chris Messina) to retrieve the diamond. It is subsequently stolen from Zsasz by young pickpocket Cassandra ""Cass"" Cain (Ella Jay Basco), but she is forced to swallow the diamond after being arrested. Harley, fleeing from Montoya and several other people she has wronged, is captured by Roman's men. Zsasz informs Roman that Cass has the diamond, and Dinah warns Montoya. Harley makes a deal with Roman, to spare her life if she will recover the diamond for him, but he also places a bounty on Cass. Harley breaks into the GCPD with a variety of non-lethal weapons, frees Cass and the pair escape to the evidence warehouse. They are surrounded by goons seeking the bounty on Cass, but Harley kills them, after unintentionally inhaling impounded cocaine. She and Cass bond while hiding out at Harley's apartment. Doc is approached for information by the ""crossbow killer"", revealed to be Helena Bertinelli aka The Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who survived the family massacre years ago. Having survived the massacre, Helena trained as an assassin to seek revenge, she has been targeting the gangsters responsible for the murders of her family. Harley's apartment is bombed by criminals looking for Cass; Doc admits they he sold them out, as he needed the money. Harley calls Roman and arranges a meeting at an abandoned amusement park to turn Cass over in exchange for his protection. Dinah notifies Montoya of the rendezvous, while Zsasz notices Dinah's treachery and informs Roman. Devastated by Dinah's betrayal, Roman dons his ritualistic mask to become his villainous alter ego, Black Mask. At the park, Montoya confronts Harley but is knocked out of a window. Zsasz arrives, tranquilizes Harley and holds Dinah at gunpoint. He is killed by Helena, who reveals Zsasz was the last of her family's killers. Montoya returns and a stand-off ensues, until they realise Roman and his army of masked criminals, known collectively as the False Face Society, have surrounded them. Using Quinn's old gear, the makeshift team successfully fight against the attackers. During the battle, Cass is captured by Roman, while Montoya is shot, but survives with Harley's bulletproof garment. Dinah reveals her metahuman ability of supersonic-level screaming, defeating a few the mobsters. Harley chases Roman's car on roller skates, with assistance from Helena and her motorcycle. At a nearby pier, the final confrontation occurs. Roman holds Cass hostage and prepares to kill her. However, Cass pulls the ring from a grenade she took from Harley's weapons chest, slipping the grenade in Roman's jacket. Harley pushes Roman over the side just before the grenade detonates and kills Roman. After ending Roman's criminal empire, Montoya quits the GCPD, and she, Dinah and Helena establish a team of vigilantes, the Birds of Prey. Harley and Cass sell the diamond to a pawnshop and start their own business. Also starring David Ury as Sleazy Breeder, François Chau as Mr. Keo and Ella Mika as Young Helena. Robbie looks like she is having a blast as the terrifically anarchic female anti-hero, there is great support from fellow female stars Winstead, Perez, Smollett-Bell and Basco, and McGregor does well as the short-tempered mob boss. The editing style is similar to Suicide Squad, but more controlled, the screenplay is a little up and down at times, but the fast-paced chases and fights, explosive moments and lead character are more than enough to keep you entertained, definitely an improvement, a fun superhero fantasy action. Very good!",Birds of Prey
9,paul_haakonsen,This was actually quite entertaining...,6,8 March 2020,"Granted, I must admit that my expectations for ""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"" were quite low, especially after the result that was ""Suicide Squad"". But still, I was given the chance to get to sit down and watch this movie, so of course I did.And I must say that I found it to be in a league of its own, when compared to ""Suicide Squad"". ""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"" was enjoyable on a whole different level.The story told in the movie was good, and writer Christina Hodson had really managed to create something entertaining and quite enjoyable here. And with director Cathy Yan at the wheel, the movie was brought safely into harbor.There is a good amount of action, comedy and violence in the movie to make it fun and enjoyable, and it was actually something of a rollercoaster to sit through. I was especially impressed with the storytelling in the movie, how they jumped back and forth and managed to tie the movie so nicely together.And the movie has a great character gallery as well. I love Margot Robbie in the lead as Harley Quinn. And she was joined alongside such talents as Rosie Perez
(playing Renee Montoya) and Ewan McGregor (playing Roman Sionis) - to mention the most memorable in the movie. I was thrilled to see Ali Wong (playing Ellen Yee) making an appearance, just a shame her role wasn't bigger.As I mentioned above, there is a good amount of violence in the movie. Actually, I was surprised with the level of violence and action, especially because it was quite graphic and very nicely executed on the screen. That was quite something for a movie such as this.Visually, then there was nothing to point a finger at when watching ""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"".I am rating it a six out of ten stars. Color me blue, red and impressed. If you haven't seen ""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"" already, you should do so, even if you weren't a fan of ""Suicide Squad"".",Birds of Prey
10,BandSAboutMovies,A welcome surprise,7,8 February 2020,"A follow-up to and spin-off of Suicide Squad - and the eighth film in the troubled DC Cinematic Universe - I was completely ready to write off Birds of Prey as a complete waste of time. But you know what? I loved it. I was throughly entertained by every moment of the film, as it took what worked in Suicide Squad - the wacky intros and pretty much everything with Harley Quinn - and amped it up while throwing away the boring stuff that didn't.It was written by Christina Hodson (Bumblebee) and directed by Cathy Yan, whose direction is solid and assured.Harley Queen says that she's escaped her old life after breaking up with the Joker, but she's still enjoying the safety that being seen as his woman affords her. Yet after a night of drunken debauchery, she blows up the Ace Chemical plant where she gave herself over to her abusive ex-lover and declares herself a free agent. That, of course, brings down the wrath of every person she's wronged over the past few years.It also brings her into the orbit of Detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez), Dinah ""Black Canary"" Lance (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), child thief Cassandra Cain and Helena ""Huntress"" Bertinelli (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who become kind of sort of friends with her as they battle Roman ""Black Mask"" Sionis (Ewan McGregor) who is trying to take over Gotham City from his nightclub.There are also some great smaller roles for Chris Messina (who was awesome on Sharp Objects) as Mr. Zsasz and Ali Wong as Montoya's ex, district attorney Ellen Yee.There's a MacGuffin of the diamond that contains all the money information for the wiped out Bertinelli family, but it really doesn't matter. What you're watching for are the kinetic fights, interplay between the girls and an over the top performance by McGregor. Everyone seems to be having the time of their lives here. It's one of those movies that you walk away and think, ""That must have been fun to make.""For her part, Robie pushed for this movie and helped develop it for more than two years. It takes the Harley Quinn character well beyond where she started and lands her closer to where she fits into the DCU comics today. Speaking of comics, a younger me may have been upset that continuity isn't strictly followed and that origins are slightly tweaked. Older me has much more pressing issues than being one of the Monitors of the multiverse and just enjoys watching fistfights and hijinks.Watching this film reminds you how dreary and boring the rest of the DCU has been, while being thankful that Deadpool allowed executives to realize that comic book films don't have to be PG-rated efforts.There's nothing like being pleasantly surprised by a movie. And I'm pleased to report that even after sleeping on this review overnight, I still find myself remembering plenty to love in this one.",Birds of Prey
11,CinemaSerf,Excruciatingly dull...,4,18 February 2020,"Sorry, but this is a really poor attempt at an action film. Margot Robbie is Ok as the feisty heroine from the title, but the rest of the cast are instantly forgettable. I am guessing that Ewan McGregor - the dastardly villain of the piece - was only available for a few filming days as his appearances are pretty shallow from a characterisation perspective and add little to the plot. The interminable fight scenes reminded me of ""Bugsy Malone"" (1976) only without the custard pies.",Birds of Prey
12,zardoz-13,Polished But Low-Stakes DC Comics Crime Saga,7,18 February 2020,"""Birds of Prey"" may not be the DC Comics ""Suicide Squad"" spin-off you want because they tangle with ordinary mortals rather than supernatural villains. As the eighth entry in the D.C. Universe, ""Birds of Prey"" follows in the footsteps of ""Joker"" (2019), with an R-rating for ""strong violence and language throughout, and some sexual and drug material."" Nevertheless, ""Birds of Prey"" shares about as much in common with the realism of ""Joker"" as it does with its sci-fi predecessor where they scrimmaged with supernatural villains. Now, Harley Quinn is the only character who reprises her ""Suicide Squad"" role in ""Birds of Prey."" She is recovering from the traumatic break-up that her inamorato, the Joker, aka the Clown Prince of Crime, inflicted on her. No, the Joker does not make a surprise appearance in this movie. Nevertheless, despite its flaws, director Cathy Yan's ""Bird of Prey"" qualifies as a polished, purposefully-paced, larger-than-life, estrogen-driven actioneer with good performances.""Harley Quinn"" unfolds with a cartoonish account of HQ's zany life. These colorful antics should bring everybody up to speed on our anti-heroine. After all, ""Suicide Squad"" came out back in 2016, and four long years have since elapsed. We learn about Harley's negligent father who dumped her at St. Bernadette's Catholic Church where the Sisters struggled with her rebellious attitude. We learn about her earning a Ph.D. in psychology and then landing a job as a Psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum in Gotham City. Ultimately, we learn the Joker seduced and abandoned Harley. Truth is, she makes the best of her bad predicament.As the film opens, Harley attracts everybody's attention by smashing the legs of an abusive thug in a nightclub. Later, the accelerated clubbing scene where she pukes in a purse is hilarious! Later, she hijacks a tanker truck. Jumping from it as it highballs through the front gates of the Ace Chemicals, she watches the Armageddon-like explosions blossom and destroy a part of her heritage with the Joker. Gotham City Detective Captain Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez of ""Fearless"") was probing the violent deaths of four thugs when the explosion erupted. A cop finds a severed J from a necklace and Montoya hits the streets searching for Harley. Harley behaves like a demented version of Lucy from ""I Love Lucy"" in white face, with a Kabuki coiffure! The scene about her egg sandwich is an example of her charismatic insanity.The chief difference here is our dames aren't hysterical damsels-in-distress. Indeed, the ""Birds of Prey"" are gutsy gals who have suffered similar fates from various villains and want payback. Gotham City Detective Captain Renee Montoya, slinky nightclub warbler Dinah Lance, grown-up mafia princess Helena Bertinelli, homeless teen pickpocket Cassandra Cain, and Harley Quinn comprise the members of the titular team. Since the Joker has exited her life, everybody who feared him feels an urge to kill Harley. Happily, Harley discovers she can live without Mister J. Meantime, Helena has returned from exile in Sicily to Gotham City, and she has vengeance on her mind. Finally, slippery fingered pickpocket Cassandra Cain lives with a foster family that hates her. Our heroic five must contend with murderous nightclub owner Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor of ""Trainspotting""), who loves to watch his henchman carve the flesh off of the faces of his adversaries.The chief flaw in ""Birds of Prey"" is its villain, Roman Sionis, whose only claim to fame in the black mask he dons when he flies into a pistol-packing rage. As villains go, Sionis is far from memorable. He seems lily-livered, and he makes his second-in-command, Victor Zsasz (Chris Messina of ""Live by Night""), perform all his evil acts. Sionis brings little name recognition, though he is featured in Batman # 386, Nevertheless, compared to either the Penguin or the Riddler as the primary adversary, he is strictly small potatoes, and he adds little spark to the drama.Chinese American director Cathy Yan knows how to blend humor with violence. ""Birds of Prey"" never turns so dark it looks like Nighthawks from Hell. The breezy but anarchic chaos that engulfs Gotham City is vaguely reminiscent of the venerable, live-action, ABC-TV show ""Batman"" (1966-1968) with its mischievous spirit. Incidentally, Yan's close-quarters, hard-knuckled, fight choreography is impeccable, and the shootouts are orchestrated with flair to spare. The gunplay between Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead of ""Gemini Man"") and four gunmen bristles with explosive spontaneity. ""Bumblebee"" scenarist Christina Hodson has penned a predictable but low-stakes 'origins epic.' She unveils all the heroes and villains neatly during the first hour, and then she complicates their relationship with the theft of a valuable diamond.Indeed, Sionis becomes a raving lunatic when he learns somebody has stolen a 30-carat diamond from him with underworld empire secrets encrypted into the gem's chemical makeup! Dinah knows pickpocket Cassandra Cain (newcomer Ella Jay Basco) filched it from Sionis' sleazy, second-in-command when he was distracted. The guileful Cassandra swallows the gem for safekeeping. Sionis orders Harley Quinn to find Cassandra and then issues a half-million-dollar bounty for the first mercenary who captures Cain.Literally, Margot Robbie's Harley dominates this $85-million melodrama. Of course, when you've got Harley Quinn around, you can always count on her to supply added comic relief. She proves she is no shrinking violet when things get tough. In her best action scene, she wields a grenade launcher loaded with a variety of non-lethal rounds and storms the Gotham City Police Department to rescue Ms. Pickpocket. Despite the staggering number of cops and inmates surrounding her in the cell block, Harley flattens this menacing manpower with all the right punches and kicks. The closest any of the four come to matching Harley's presence is Dinah Lance (Jurnee Smollett-Bell of ""Eve's Bayou""), aka Black Canary, whose abundant lung power comes in handy during the finale. She epitomizes pugnacity when she kicks the daylights out of her enemies. The obvious message of ""Birds of Prey"" is some women can manage their own issues without male intercession.",Birds of Prey
13,grantss,Entertaining,6,3 October 2020,"Harley Quinn and the Joker have split up. This leaves Harley Quinn isolated as the Joker will no longer protect her. In this vulnerable state she inadvertently stumbles into a plot by crime lord Roman Sionis to become the most powerful person in Gotham City.I guess this puts me in the minority but I enjoyed the Suicide Squad. Maybe it's because I generally don't like superhero movies and it seemed different to the standard formulaic stuff trundled out: more comedic, less serious, less super-powers mumbo jumbo. Harley Quinn, played by Margot Robbie, was a stand-out character in Suicide Squad so it is no surprise that she now has her own movie.This film continues in the same vein as Suicide Squad: more comedic, no super-powers. Plot is reasonably interesting and there is a reasonable amount of character engagement. It does become a rather formulaic action movie towards the end, taking some of the lustre off proceedings.Margot Robbie is, once again, great as Harley Quinn: wonderfully over-the-top, dynamic and funny. Ewan McGregor is excellent and almost steals the show as the villain, Roman Stoinis: great intensity. Good support by Rosie Perez as Renee Montoya and Jurnee Smollett as Black Canary.The disappointment is Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress. She is a fine actress but here seems miscast, as her character just seems so lifeless and unengaging. It might not entirely be her fault though: Huntress's character isn't developed and is easily the least-formed of all the main characters. Her dialogue is quite badly written too.Overall, not brilliant but entertaining enough.",Birds of Prey
14,oscaralbert,It's not every day that a major movie studio gets people to pay . . .,8,13 February 2020,". . . for the ""privilege"" of watching a 109-minute political endorsement. But anyone who has a passing familiarity with Current Events, circa 2020, will immediately note that BIRDS OF PREY heroine ""Harley Quinn"" could be a twin sister to U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, D-MN. Not only that, but Harley (nee ""HARLEEN QUINZEL"") has a dynamite, fun-sounding name for Good Luck. Ditto Sen. K. ""Amy"" is an anagram for both ""may"" and ""yam,"" as in ""This April I may plant a yam."" The Real Life Band of Sisters out to take down America's Burnt Orange Clown through the past five months of impeachment also is well represented in BIRDS OF PREY. ""Huntress"" certainly embodies Sen. Warren: a bit long-in-the-tooth, but still game. ""Det. Montoya"" personifies Rep. Octavio-Cortez, continually underestimated by the guys around her, and the sassy ""Black Canary"" swiftly brings to mind the rapier-tongued Rep. Tlaib. As a would-be child-killer, ""Roman"" takes on the role of Mr. T. himself, but is at best a pale imitation of the Real Life Horror. Anyone who has seen Jimmy Kimmel's State of the Union Doom and Gloom collage which highlights the actual hellish buzzwords of Mr. T., as well as those who still remember the USA's first-ever inaugural speech focusing on ""American carnage,"" knows that the always eponymous prognosticators of Warner Bros. never have to ""stretch"" to encompass the self-fulfilling portents of disaster looming just around the corner for our once serene Homeland. BIRDS OF PREY simply signifies that the buzzards already are circling above our heads.",Birds of Prey
15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Takes flight and stays on course,8,7 February 2020,"The Joker(Leto, not Phoenix) kicks out Harley(Robbie, showing more sides and dimension), in just the most recent of many cases of her trying to please guys who clearly aren't good for her. As such she no longer has his protection, and as it turns out a lot of people have grievances with her. They are frequently introduced in freeze-frame gags that are one of the numerous ways in which this is Suicide Squad if that movie was actually great, and not a mess, editing and tone wise. Other examples include the extensive use of music, which here is allowed to land and be effective, instead of almost immediately ending. As well as the story structure not being quite chronological in showing the events, now properly setting up who the different people are, and giving them depth. Black Canary(Smollett-Bell, an incredible performer, you seriously have to hear her cover of ""This Is A Man's World"" for yourself) sings in the club of Roman Sionis(McGregor, deliciously unpredictable as a cruel narcissist), but if pressed, she might be willing to admit that he does awful things. Renee Montoya(Perez) is an excellent cop who struggles to because of rotten coworkers. She believes that Huntress(Elizabeth Winstead, cool while also a hilarious Batman parody) is working for him, just like Victor Zsasz(Messina, sadistic, understands his master and knows how to deal with his outbursts) his right-hand man. Teenager Cassandra Cain just robbed him, not realising it would put a bullseye on her back. So the four women(who feel like they're each in their own film... and it's so good. Just. The very best) have to try to protect her, as every criminal in Gotham City tries to score by catching her.This movie deeply resonates with a lot of people. The feeling of being rejected and not giving up. Of standing up for what's right, even if you feel like you don't have a personal stake in the matter. It is easy to relate to the young pickpocket, and want to see her safe. Second unit director Chad Stahelski, known for helming the three John Wick chapters, lends the action scenes the same fluidity here, again highlighting the significant fighting prowess of the combatants, and, here, also the teamwork on display. Despite similarities, this doesn't feel like it's just Deadpool starring Quinn. It has its own distinct identity. In some ways it's equal or superior to those two pictures. This choice makes a ton of sense for this.There is a lot(not an excessive amount) of gore, violence and strong language in this. I wholeheartedly recommend this to everyone that the promotional material appeals to. 8/10",Birds of Prey
16,neil-476,Not as bad as all the 1/10s make out,6,6 March 2020,"Following her breakup with the Joker, Harley Quinn gets involved with assorted dubious individuals, the worst of whom is crime boss Roman Sionis. The plot concerns the pursuit of a maguffin which has been purloined by lightfingered oriental teen Cassandra Cain.There is little plot in this second outing for Margot Robbie as Harleen Quinzel. What plot there is provides a vehicle for quite a lot of fight sequences, some of which are well done. The other Birds don't have very much in the way of story arcs, just bare bones origin material. The storytelling is muddled by unnecessary flashbacks. Ewan McGregor chews the scenery, but his villain comes across as rather lightweight.There has been criticism that the film ignores its source material. This is justified as well as Cassandra Cain is concerned. Black Canary is black rather than Caucasian, but otherwise workable. The Huntress looks right, has the right origin, but comes across as rather hysterical. Montoya works, and Harley (and hyena and beaver) are exactly in line with her comics equivalent since the Conner/Palmiotti run started. Overall, this was not a dealbreaker for me, neither was the suggestion that this was feminist: it wasn't. It has strong female characters, that doesn't make it feminist.I can understand the accusation that it apes deadpool - humour, some 4th wall breaking, and loads of profanity - and maybe there's some justification to it. I could have done without the profanity, none of which adds anything to the film.IMDB has lots of people giving this 1 out of 10. This isn't entirely fair. It's not fair to call it a misfire. It's more like a shotgun where some pellets hit but a fair number don't. I enjoyed it, but it's far from a classic.",Birds of Prey

I agree that it's not the best DC-Comics movie ever made but it's certainly entertaining enough to have a good movie night. Margot Robbie is perfect to play Harley Quinn. It's a character that fits her really well. The plot is probably not perfect but it's never boring.

If you would try to gender-swap it, you would get Batman and Robin without the one-liners. It makes little sense, though. From the beginning to start it is one action fest of ass kicking, but no characters that one can care about, no strategy, almost no story. Ewan McGregor's villain is weak and the classic cardboard psycho, so the tension is not really there. His henchman gets more screen time and is more interesting. The main character is Harley Quinn, with the ""birds of prey"" as secondary characters that only show their worth at the very end and frankly have little bearing on the story until then. But I would argue that what made the film more fun was Ella Jay Basco's unapologetic little pocket thief character.Bottom line: when the laws of physics are broken, men fall from a kick from a girl and girls get up and fight after being hit by a car and thrown into another. The film is guilty pleasure fun, but makes little sense overall.",Birds of Prey

Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie) has just split from her boyfriend ""The Joker"" so she has to spread her wings free and become a free girl! All of this is helped along by a cast of side characters like detective Renee Montoya, Huntress, and the sexy and beautiful black bra wearing Black Canary! However all are tied and wrapped up in a wild card subplot that involves defeating a crazy and sadistic crime lord in Roman Sionis(AKA ""Black Mask"") and underneath all of this lies the search for a diamond and teenager named Cass(Ella Jay Basco). Aside from all of this the film entertains with violence, action, bombs, and flashbacks that tell character story. Look at this as a bad ass female group as each fight crime and for their own way of life in a gleeful way The costumes are also an eye catch and the dialogue moves the film along well, so if a comic book fan open up to this picture as it's full of antiheroine glory.",Birds of Prey

22,cherold,Terrifically fun supervillain flick,8,13 May 2020,"Birds of Prey represents an entry in a rather new genre, the female criminal empowerment movie (another example would be Hustlers). For years crime flicks have been men bonding while women flitter around the edges, and I find these new approach interesting.Margot Robbie is terrific as Harley Quinn, Joker's no-ex girlfriend who discovers that without her beau's protection her psychopathic disregard for others has left her hated and hunted. The movie focuses on her frenetic attempts to survive while mixing with a variety of enemies and a couple of people who, if not allies, are at least neutral.The other main women Harley interacts with are a determined cop (Rosie Perez), a club singer with some fighting moves (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), and a mysterious character we don't meet until the movie is well underway (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Winstead is wonderful as an insecure badass, and Perez is great as a tough, overlooked cop, but Smollett-Bell's character feels more sketchy; it's unclear why she's chosen this life and whether her occasional moments of concern for women in peril are ongoing or a recent evolution caused by who knows what.But ultimately this is Robbie's movie, and her funny, crazy performance as well as a bunch of fun action make for a terrific movie.It's also a movie that seems to have angered a lot of people into giving it 1-star reviews. This is not a 1-star movie, and it's telling that the user review voted most helpful is a diatribe about its ""feminism."" Clearly there's a strong amount of the typical comic-book-boy anger at a woman-centric film, although to be fair some people are saying it's not true to the source familiar (those are the people who knew what Birds of Prey referred to *before* it's explained in the films last 15 minutes) and I can't speak to that.But still, it's not a 1-star movie. Even Joker, which was pretentious and tedious, isn't a 1-star movie (I gave it a generous 5 out of 10). So all the 1-star reviews are just angry boys out to sink the film; ignore them.Definitely recommended. Unless you're an angry, woman-hating boy, in which case skip it and watch The Joker instead.",Birds of Prey

24,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Birds of Prey: and the Terrible Title that Bombed Harley Quinn.,5,16 February 2020,"'Birds Of Prey: And The Fantabulous Emancipation Of One Harley Quinn (2020)' hasn't really learnt any of the lessons apparent in 'Suicide Squad (2016)', retaining almost every element that made that picture such a slog to sit through. However, each piece - however misguided its inclusion may be - is simply done to a higher standard. This results in a film that's basically just fine. It isn't terrible but it isn't particularly good, either. Most of the time, it's plain mediocre. Yet, it leaves a surprisingly sweet taste, somehow feeling better than it actually is in retrospection. Its main issue comes from the fact that it seems to have no regard for the age-old adage 'show, don't tell'; as such, the majority of the narrative is narrated to us. Typically, the piece favours meta time-hopping and MTV-esque montages to fill in its blanks, trying desperately to seem like something spun straight from the off-kilter brain of its protagonist. At the same time, the flick wants to be an origin story for its other eponymous characters, without dedicating the necessary time or attention to these elements. The result is a messy movie that doesn't seem to know what it wants to be, one determined to try and make its psychotic killer as likeable as possible despite her very real flaws. Like I said before, it isn't bad. It's just not all that engaging or, even, exciting. Probably its best element is its surprisingly competent action, which features some great, character-specific choreography and is generally well-conceived. It does use far too much slow motion for any of these moments to be impactful, but this doesn't really take away from the enjoyment of these scenes. Its cast are all good, especially its lead, and they make for a likeable team. It's a shame that some of the now unrestrained writing is rather clunky, especially when it comes to 'team banter'. Nevertheless, the all female crime-fighters/ criminals are typically good fun when they're together. The thing's underlying messages of 'female power' and 'sisterhood' are important, timely and relatively resonant. I wish the affair was better than it is, and that it would actually make some money, because the recent trend of generally decent but ultimately low-performing all-women action flicks is disconcerting to say the least. In the end, the movie is alright. It's not great, but it's not terrible. It's actually one of the DCEU's better entries. Make of that what you will. 5/10",Birds of Prey
25,ThomasDrufke,There's a Good Film in There Somewhere..........,6,20 February 2020,"It's been 2 weeks and I'm still not fully sure how I feel about this film. On one hand, the film has incredible stunt and fight choreography, with most of the action being in-camera. However, aside from Harley Quinn, I never found myself on board with any of the characters and in some instances, was annoyed by them. I think there's a good film somewhere in here, but everything starts with a good script. And Birds of Prey definitely didn't have that.6.7/10",Birds of Prey

28,Cineanalyst,Harley Quinn Dumps Joker for Deadpool's Fourth Wall,6,12 February 2020,"Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn was easily the best thing, if not the only good thing, to come out of the atrocious ""Suicide Squad"" (2016), so ""Birds of Prey"" is bound to be better merely by subtraction of everything else from that movie, including her breakup with the unseen Joker. Although both pictures spend considerable time on establishing new characters, ""Birds of Prey"" does a better job of it than the ridiculous, video-game-like expository freeze frames of ""Suicide Squad."" Robbie is a blast in the role again, and the action scenes are fun. Nevertheless, it does rehash a familiar formula from another superhero series, that of ""Deadpool,"" and hardly diverges from the usual superhero fare despite the promise of ""emancipation,"" let alone the fine-to-pop-art inspired drawings for the poster and credits, and the novelty of an all-female team of warriors. Any feminist message seems flippant, given that the plot revolves around the women chasing after a diamond--and even that is reminiscent of another all-female team, with the jewelry heist of ""Ocean's Eight"" (2018). But, hey, they usually don't release supposedly-serious superhero flicks in February; as long as you're not expecting anything more than an amusement-park ride or junk food--both of which literally occupy conspicuous space within the movie, with Quinn's quest to eat a breakfast sandwich and the climactic battle in a funhouse--""Birds of Prey"" is readily consumed and amusing.Albeit, It's tiresome how much the same these comic-book moving pictures are, but it's to be expected given the amounts of money poured into the genre and the great number of them being produced. Another female-led iteration, ""Captain Marvel"" (2019) cobbled together pieces from the origin stories of Iron Man and Captain America, for instance, along with the retro humor of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014). ""Wonder Woman"" (2017) was something different--until its generic third act. And, it's the same with the men, too. ""Shazam!"" (2019) remains DC's most mimetic movie to date of the MCU formula. Few films are truly original, though, so I appreciate when, at least, filmmakers copy from good movies. In ""Birds of Prey,"" we get the fourth-wall-breaking winking at the camera and direct address to the audience from ""Deadpool"" (2016), along with that narrator (in this case, Quinn) rearranging the plot while she's telling the story. Less original still, we get another character with a generic gangster revenge quest and a hardboiled detective that's so hackneyed that other characters point out how hackneyed it is within the movie. Ewan McGregor hangs around in a nightclub again with a performer who sings better than him, à la ""Moulin Rouge!"" (2001). Robbie even fights and skates to the same song, ""Barracuda,"" she also did both to in a montage from ""I, Tonya"" (2017). As well, there's a more direct reference made regarding the diamond plot to ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" (1953), as Quinn imagines herself in Marilyn Monroe's part after being knocked around at one point.That Robbie's Quinn doesn't take things seriously and just enjoys herself helps--encouraging the spectator to do likewise. The fight choreography and editing isn't bad, either, although I believe I heard the sound-effects department getting too carried away with some noises merely for kicks and twirls regardless of whether they hit anything. An R rating allows for more carefree and violent fun, as well as a cocaine-enhanced fight sequence involving Quinn--although, it could've and arguably should've gone ever further. Plus, this is a gal who spends more screentime consuming alcohol than she does eating, and when she does have food, it tends to be junk such as sugary cereal and that elusive fatty sandwich. Placing the climax in an amusement park, too, besides being congruent with Quinn and Joker's clownish backstories, is an apt metaphor for the picture at large. ""Birds of Prey"" reflexively knows what it is and gives fans what they expect.",Birds of Prey

31,westsideschl,For Comic Book Lovers,2,13 May 2020,"I was captured to watch this in part from the DVD cover, and in part from the potential in the story. It started out as an introductory flat 2-D cheap Saturday morning cartoon intro to our main character. That was pretty snoozy but I kept waiting and waiting and ... until I noticed my brain alertness level was somewhere between watching grass grow & deep sleep.
Summation:
1. Movie is suppose to be a superhero team spoof, but so shallow flat I actually ended up not caring - just waiting for it to end.
2. 50% of screen time is like a fashion show catwalk of Robbie & her sometimes being cute by staring at the camera; just dumb & boring. Another 25% was showcasing how non-conforming her character could be which did not come across as real - actually it was comic book real.
3. Action scenes were 90% very poorly executed flying kicks & arm takedowns that a 10 year old could perform better.
4. Both dialogue & music lyrics were heavy on the obscenities; a cheap way to fake toughness.
5. Only positive, about 30 seconds worth, was Jurnee Smollett-Bell's singing a classic song.",Birds of Prey
32,The-Sarkologist,Cashing in on Harley Quinn,3,17 February 2020,"I thought that this was going to be Suicide Squad II but it turns out that it happens to be completely different. The main reason I thought that was because it was clear that Harley Quinn was the main character. Well, that is certainly true, but I also thought that she was also a member of the Birds of Prey, which happens to be another group of super heroes. Well, that turns out not to be the case either, which certainly shows you how much I know about the superhero worlds beyond what I see in the films.Well, this is an origin story, and the name sort of should indicate who the origin story refers to, though as I mentioned Harley Quinn also plays a major role. That is because in this story she and the Joker have split up, and because she is no longer the Joker's girlfriend, all of the people whom she has upset have decided to enact revenge.In a way the plot doesn't seem to be all that coherent, namely because it is jumping all over the place, though this does have a lot to do with Quinn actually telling the story. There also seems to be this thing about a diamond that has been stolen, as well as some woman, the Huntress, AKA the crossbow killer, seeking revenge against the people who killed her family. Obviously they all end up together to fight against the major bad guy.I can sort of see why some people didn't like it because there is a claim that this is basically an anti-male film - in the same way that they responded against Captain Marvel. However, the issues that the film explores are actually quite relevent, namely that there are situations where somebody will take the credit for the work others have done. It just happens that the characters that this happens to in this film all happen to be female, but that shouldn't surprise us when we are dealing with a film in which all the main characters happen to be female.The thing is that if we have situations where the protagonists and antagonists are all male, then there isn't a peep, however because we have a situation where the protagonists are female, and the antagonists are male, then of course there is a reaction against it, yet if we consider a lot of these films we will notice that there is a rection against it. Of course, being the Joker's girlfriend, one sort of wanders why Harley Quinn isn't the antagonist, but is rather an anti-hero.Still, I did find that this film was rather bland, and unexciting. It certainly was no where near as good as some of the other films that have been released in this universe, and honestly, even with the previews I really wasn't captured.",Birds of Prey

34,slightlymad22,I Want More Robbie As Harley Quinn,7,7 February 2020,"I just got out of a surprisingly packed screening of Birds Of Prey.Disclosure, I'm not familiar with the comics, so I don't know if the character portrayal are accurate or not. BL k Madk for example, I do not know if this is his comic story arc or notI knew going in it would be a girl power movie, as it's Birds Of Prey, but every man in this is a horrible, vile, misogynistic d*ck. Literally every male character is a would be rapist, sexist woman hater. You can have a girl power movie without making it a man hating one. And it's not really a Birds Of Prey movie either, It's a Harley Quinn movie. That out of the way...What I liked about this movie is I love Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, what ever you hated about Suicide Squad, everyone pretty much agreed she was the best thing in it. Mary Elizabeth Winstead (so bad in Gemini Man) is good as Huntress, but she had the least screentime, I could watch an entire movie around the backstory shown briefly here she has the best arc. Her and Black Canary (Jurnee Sonnet-Bell) were the best characters after Harley Quinn.It is well directed, the action is well shot, you can actually see what is going on, and it's choreographed well in long shots instead of lots of cut aways and no shaky cam. There are a lot of appendage breaks (the most I have seen since I did the Steven Seagal movie marathon) considering what happens to people in the movie, there is not a great deal of blood, although it's littered with F Bombs!!There were some decent laughs, one in particular got a huge reaction in my screening, but I think it could have used a few more laughs.Ewan McGregor is fine, he is having fun, but a little too over the top. Rosie Perez is bland and dull as the cop, her and Casandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco) for me were a waste of screentime. I'd have rather there screen time went to Black Canary and Huntress. Although Cain is integral to the plot, she is just a waste of screentime. She is also the worst movie pickpocket of all time.There is no characterisation outside of Harley Quinn (she is the only one you actually care about) and Huntress, the main plot (retrieving a diamond) is nothing we have not seen before. I had some issues with the police raid, which was awesome, even if it does not make sense.Some scenes from the trailers are not in the movie!! For example the scene where she says ""Boom"" and appears to headbutt someone is not there.I think it will split the fans, you will either like it or hate it!! I'm pretty sure it's depiction of men will rub a lot of people up the wrong way. I can't say I disliked it, as I was entertained through out, because it was a fun movie, so I'm kind of on the fence, but I do think it will have decent rewatchability.",Birds of Prey

Birds of Prey is like the DCs version of Deadpool. It is fun, it breaks the ground barrier of fourth wall narration from Harley's storytelling, and the action is bloody fun. I did not have any expectations with this movie cause of its poor marketing with the trailers. Making the movie seem boring and annoying with Harley Quinn personality. After watching, I was surprised and I loved it.The plot does jump around a lot in the movie. It may not make sense in the first half hour of the movie. The film is narrated by Harley Quinn as she explains certain backstories like Huntress or Renee Montoya. And certain events which all leads up to them meeting up. It is a lot of fun with its narrative structure. Harley (Margot Robbie) is torn up about the break up from Joker. But now many bad guys are after her cause Joker is no longer protecting her. Meanwhile, Cassandra (Ella Jay Basco) pickpockets one of Roman/Black Mask (Ewan McGregor) henchman and stole a diamond that is worth a lot to him. Roman decides to put a bounty on Cassandra which Harley tries to protect her from. Which Renee (Rosie Perez), Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and Dinah/ Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) try to help her as well.The film is a lot of fun. The direction has its own visual and exciting style that never slows down. All thanks to director Cathy Yan. Which she handled scenes very well and did great with the action sequences. The action and fight sequences are entertaining and exciting. There are some gory scenes with Black Mask henchman skinning a guys face off. Got to remember it is an R rated film. Every fight scene is thrilling and worth watching. The climax taking place in a closed down theme park. Really felt like one awesome carnival ride with watching Harley, Dinah, Renee, and Huntress team up. Which kind of sucks cause they only team up in the climax of the movie. And you kind of want more.The cast ensemble did good with their characters. Margot Robbie is great as Harley. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is great as Huntress and a cross bow assassin with mood swings. Jurnee Smollett-Bell is great as Dinah but she only uses her black canary scream power only once in the movie. Chris Messina playing Roman's bodyguard is creepy. Ella Jay Basco is good playing Cassandra. Ewan McGregor is great as Black Mask. A psychotic and narcissistic villain with a metro personality.The movie is packed with a lot of action, a fun direction, and the soundtrack was also great with the movie as well.Overall, Birds of Prey is an awesome film. They story does jump around with its narrative but if you sit back and enjoy the ride of action and humor. It is worth seeing.",Birds of Prey
39,eddie_baggins,Birds of Prey is fast and frantic but never takes full-flight,4,6 February 2020,"There's no denying its sense of energy and enthusiasm, something that was amiss in the previous Harley Quinn starring Suicide Squad but for all its colour, flair and style, Birds of Prey can't overcome a so-so plot (a major trouble for a lot of DC films), a sense of repetitiveness and a feeling that everything is a slightly too try-hard for this ""girls on a mission"" to ever get into full flight.Undoubtedly a labour of love for its leading lady and producer Margot Robbie, who was the ringmaster behind this whole affair getting off the ground, Prey gives its leading lady a large portion of the spotlight and for anyone that thought Robbie stole the show in the mostly forgettable Suicide Squad, they're in for a real treat as Robbie chews scenery, feeds hyenas, cracks skulls (and multiple legs/ankles) and eats delicious looking egg and bacon sandwiches on her quest to recover from her breakup with Mr. J and fight for her survival after local crime boss Roman Sionis decides Quinn's time on this earth is up.A lot of advance press and marketing has focussed around how Prey is all about the team up of Quinn and new additions to this side of the DC movie universe, Rosie Perez's novelty t-shirt wearing detective Renee Montoya, Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Huntress, Jurnee Smollett-Bell Black Canary and Ella Jay Basco's Cassandra Cain but for anyone expecting a true ensemble flick, you'll be left disappointed as the films more three quarters Quinn show and one quarter squad-up as director Cathy Yan struggles to get her story moving before the half-way mark.There's a lot going on in Prey, in many ways it feels conflicted as to what it wants to be.Is it a dark comedy? A crime film? An expose on finding oneself in this mad crazy world? Whatever it's true intentions are it's hard for us to care or focus on any one particular thing as we fly between scenes, some with comical but also wince inducing violence, scenes with Ewan McGregor's big bad getting to swear and chew scenery but not do too much at all (bar one particularly awkward sequence involving a customer of his nightclub) or other supposedly feel good moments between Quinn and her teenage pickpocket off-sider Cassandra.None of the stories components ever feel as though they combine into one cohesive and gripping whole and while they all share the same sense of bombastic and loud delivery that is at all times accompanied by either a terribly hand-picked soundtrack or Daniel Pemberton's incessantly over the top score, Prey never feels like a film that is heading towards any genuinely interesting destination or end goal as it seems content to allow its self-aware winking at camera or audience directed voice-overs to do the work for it.It is a shame for not just the film but for the future of this type of solo/team-up Quinn adventure as Robbie remains the perfect fit for Harley's loopy delivery and some of the films action beats and stylistic capturing by D.O.P Matthew Libatique are fantastic but it all takes place around a rocky road of bad plots, half-cooked ideas and a feeling that for all its hype, this team up movie never even feels like we get the payoff of seeing a bunch of intriguing characters shining together in their quest to show the world these baddies can match it with the big boys.Final Say -Barely pausing for breath, Birds of Prey is a frenetic and colourful comic book adaptation but despite the best efforts of its leading lady, this newest addition to the DC universe is both forgettable and disappointing, failing to establish its posse of death bringers in a way that makes us want more.2 snot bubbles out of 5",Birds of Prey

I really didn't enjoy this film. The ridiculous action scenes and silly jokes really got on my nerves and Margot Robbie went a bit overboard as the crazy Harley Quinn. Ewan McGregor (Roman Sionis) was also a terrible baddie, and the soundtrack made the whole film seem like a bit of a joke. On the plus side, the Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) was brilliant and the chemistry between the girls, when they joined forces, was half decent but it's hard to find anything else positive about the film. As the DC franchise is in a right mess at the moment, this film really doesn't help matters, which is a shame because it sounded promising on paper. If they do agree to make another movie, they really need to tone down Harley Quinn, who seemed more mentally disturbed than anything. The whole back and forth in time thing was also annoying and the way that the girls took out big grown men with ease, made me cringe. As I haven't read the comics, I don't know how close this Harley Quinn is to the written one, but from an entertainment point of view, I really found it hard to watch. As far as I am concerned, if your going to have an action-packed movie with wit, the least that they could do is make it funny. Anyway, I won't be watching this movie again in a hurry, and it has to go down as one of the biggest let-downs of this year. Disappointing!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Cathy Yan, who also brought you a movie called Dead Pigs, which I haven't seen or heard of. Now I know that these big studios are supporting these new up and coming directors, by giving them big-budget movies to work on as there first projects, but with DC in so many problems at the moment, they really needed someone in Christopher Nolan's league to save the franchise. I know that they wanted to make this an ""all-women"" affair, in terms of starring and working on this film, but I personally think that the final product was awful. The whole thing just seemed silly and unfunny, but it still made a decent profit at the box office, even though we are in the middle of a pandemic. With the critics and a majority of audiences around the world, completing slating the movie, I wonder if the big wigs behind the DC universe will finally listen to us because it's obvious that they are wasting time and money on these movies, which are definitely not working.Budget: $84.5million

42,Tweetienator,Business As Usual,5,13 February 2020,"Margot Robbie again is giving a fine performance, and without her I would rate Birds of Prey only 3 or 4, anyway, the animation show is more bloody, gory, funny and suits adults better than the movie. Good, I guess, for girls in their teens and some emo boys (grrrl powr rulez) and DC fanboys and such an audience. All in all Birds of Prey is okay (some nice settings) but e.g. the first Ant-Man or Deadpool movies just play in another league. Especially the story (generic) is rather boring and redundant, the Black Mask and all the other characters are just your typical bystanders/cannon fodder/stereotypes you won't connect at all or that much. Without the excellent character(ization) of Harley Quinn by Magot Robbie this one would taste like a extremely stale beer.",Birds of Prey
43,pmtelefon,Solidly entertaining,8,17 February 2020,"""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"" was not the kind of movie I was expecting. It tells its story in a way that is different from most of the movies I usually watch. That's not a bad thing. Director Cathy Yan and company have a lot of fun with the material. Harley Quinn is a great character and Margot Robbie was born to play her. The rest of the cast also does a nice job. The soundtrack was also very good. ""Birds of Prey"" has a good story and it tells it with very little, if any, downtime. I enjoyed watching this movie tonight. I also have the feeling that I will like it even more the next time I see it. Honorable mention: Rosie Perez. (I saw this movie at the Regal Cinemas, Westbury, NY)",Birds of Prey
44,damianphelps,I'm not the target audience and I loved it!,7,25 August 2020,"This movie can hold its head up high as a rare winner within the DC universe.Super stylish presentation that is as visually loud as Harley herself.Margot Robbie is amazing in this and the support cast also work really well.It actually may have been even better 15 to 20 mins longer to add some more depth to the key characters, but excellent nevertheless.Highly recommend :)",Birds of Prey
45,digitalbeachbum,What a complete pile of crap,1,11 February 2020,"Harley Quinn is a side kick. She was an intern psychologist with Arkham and took it upon her self to work with Joker. She becomes infatuated by his charms and later helps him escape.She first appears in 1992 in the Batman Animated Series. She is an abused side kick who keeps coming back for more, thinking that Joker really loves her. She is a bit wacko in the head but she compliments the Joker.All other versions of Harley Quinn are crap. This feminist movement to make women more powerful is only showing how terrible women can be as writers and directors.Birds of Prey is a perfect example. It is another Mary Sue character just like in the newer Star Wars movie where Rey is infallible. In Birds of Prey, Harley Quinn is infallible. You know she is going to win the battles and there is no one who can stop her. So why watch the movie?It would have been better to have Harley Quinn return to her roots, but the writers and director of this movie do not collect comics. They do not know the character or the history. They picked up a CliffNotes: Harley Quinn and decided that they could make a movie about her.OK. So Margot Robbie is a fine actor (or is it actress? You can't please everyone all the time), but she overplays the role. The character needs to be weaker in the start of the movie and have some personal problem to overcome. She is getting over the relationship with Joker, so she should be acting as such. She needed to not be played as a strong character at first, and have her built up over the movie.",Birds of Prey

48,southdavid,Will Osprey ?,6,5 March 2020,"DC's vaguely linked extended universe continues with ""Birds Of Prey"", a Harley Quinn centric movie that spins off from the events of ""Suicide Squad"" but includes few other links to the wider world.Having definitively split from her puddin', Harley (Margot Robbie) finds herself fair game for every villain and scumbag who was previously too scared of retribution to get their revenge on her. Captured by Black Mask (Ewan McGregor), Harley bids for her freedom by promising to find Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco), a pickpocket who has stolen a diamond that he desires. She both opposes and befriends more of Gotham's disenfranchised female heroes, until they unite against a mutual foe.I wish I'd written my review before I heard Marc Bernardin give his impression about the film, he's so capable of extolling a full argument I forget what's actually my opinion and what's his. I remember that I liked film once it got going. I don't think that the time jumping during the opening half improved matters. I felt it kept pulling me away from what I wanted to see at just the point it was getting interesting. Subsequently though, the second half of the film, when the gang are together is much better. Pacing issues aside, the fight scenes in the film are wonderful - particularly Harley's jailbreak and the fight involving all the cast towards the end of the film. Tonally it's great, not wildly dissimilar to ""Deadpool"" with its animated sequences and fantasy moments but it's very R-Rated, with swearing and violence to suit that. The music is fabulous too.What the movie doesn't do enough is get us to care about the characters beyond Harley. We get enough to understand their motivations but actual investment, not so much, and I suppose that's true for the film in general. It's fine but lacking in genuine consequence. A stepping stone to introduce a few characters we might, or might not, see again and a vehicle for Harley, who we definitely will.Better than ""Suicide Squad"", ""BvS"" or ""Justice League"" but barely matching even the worst MCU effort.",Birds of Prey

BUT the characters and the action are nothing more than a gimmick, with fight after fight, only being used to fill up a void that cant be filled.This looks like a computer action game, but it never really becomes a movie. Too bad...",Birds of Prey
50,Vartiainen,"Okay, but only when compared to Suicide Squad",3,2 November 2020,"Birds of Prey: Hah Hah That's Clever is a continuation of Margot Robbie's performance as Harley Quinn in the DC film universe. She was first seen in the infamous Suicide Squad film, where she was pretty much the only thing they got right in the whole car crash.Unfortunately, while this is not as bad as Suicide Squad, I cannot in good conscience call it a good film. Especially because Harley Quinn is no longer as funny as she was in the first film. The writers seem to think that her whole character can be summed up to her being extra hyper and always up to eleven. With some psycho babble thrown in because in the comics she used to be a psychiatrist. And while that is an important part of her whole character, it's nowhere the only one, and I don't think Robbie quite gets it. I can see her playing a perfect Harley Quinn but for that she'd need a lot better script.As for other problems, the villain is really pathetic. Total waste of getting Ewan McGregor to play him. Not even once did I find him intimidating or any kind of threat at all.Furthermore, the eponymous Birds of Prey are one of the most well-known female superhero teams. So, why doesn't this film include any of their more well-known members. Like, you know, Batgirl, Bat Woman, Oracle, Power Girl, Poison Ivy. Sure, we have Black Canary, one of the two founding members of the team. Except that she doesn't function as a founding member here and her power is barely used in the film.Also, you know who has never been a member in the comics? Harley Quinn. So, yeah...Not that I'm opposed to changes being made to source material, but it seems like such a missed opportunity to not use these characters. Especially Poison Ivy, who has a one of the best and most nuanced relationships with Harley to be found in the comics. I don't know, perhaps they don't own the rights to the character at the moment, or something.It's not an awful film. The fights are fun and shot well enough. It's colourful. Sometimes it tells a good joke. But it's just such a mess.",Birds of Prey

53,jtindahouse,Harley Quinn is far better in small doses,6,2 April 2020,"I really disliked 'Suicide Squad' when it came out back in 2016. Almost everything about it was done poorly except for one thing: Harley Quinn. She was the one shining light in an otherwise very poor movie, and that is what gave me slight hope for 'Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn'. The problem I quickly found however while watching this movie was that Quinn is better in small doses. When she's constantly coming at you for the entire runtime of a movie she can become very annoying, very fast. Luckily, in the second half of the movie they obviously caught onto this and toned her down a bit. But during the first half of the movie she was almost unbearable.One thing I give major props to this movie (and 'Suicide Squad') for is having an R rating. The levels of violence in this movie actually caught me a little off-guard. A villain who likes to skin people's faces, multiple very gruesome injury scenes (often involving people's legs) and frequent threats to cut a child open. They didn't hold anything back on that front and you have to at least give them credit for that. The only thing that could have made this completely unwatchable, with already annoying characters, was to have it be painfully bland as well.I like that none of the characters in this movie have superpowers (barring the exception of one completely unnecessary and stupid scene late in the movie). That was one of the dumbest parts of 'Suicide Squad' and I was very thankful that it wasn't present here. Also it has to be said that even though she got far too much screen time here, Margot Robbie is very good at playing this character.Considering this movie could have been a complete disaster, I guess we need to just take it as a positive that it wasn't. The movie looks good - in fact the set design of the big finale was quite brilliant. Also just like 'Suicide Squad' the soundtrack is excellent and blends perfectly into the film. The only things really holding it back are an over-abundance of annoying characters, an uninteresting story and some really bland action/fight sequences. I couldn't recommend this film, but I wouldn't advise necessarily staying away from it either.",Birds of Prey

Margot Robbie really steals it has Harley Quinn, but the other actors are also good, Ewan McGregor chews up the scenes has the crime boss, giving a funny and intense performance. Rosie Perez and Mary Elisabeth Winstead are also entertaining. The film never tries to be anything more than what it is. Not a masterpiece but just an entertaining comic book film for adults.

55,jamesrupert2014,"All wrapping, no present",5,15 February 2021,"Having broken up with The Joker and therefore losing her immunity from vengeful low-lifes, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) finds herself targeted by grudge-holders and ends up in a search for a diamond that holds the key to a mob fortune. Despite being promoted as a 'team' movie (perhaps in the wistful hope of kick-starting a B-lister movie or TV franchise), the film focusses almost exclusively on the Joker's loopy ex, who gets most of the best material. The simplistic plot serves only to launch action sequences and the script comes off like a series of punchlines with insufficient setup. Nothing in the film is clever or original - for better or worse, fans of the genre will have seen it all before (the climatic fight at the decrepit funhouse has all the garish stupidity of Joel Schumacher's abysmal 'Batman and Robin' (1997)). As main villain Roman Sionis, Ewan McGregor (who deserves better material) trots out yet another 'over-the-top jolly psycho' who, despite a number of grim scenes, fails to be menacing in the least (especially after donning his silly looking skull mask). I appreciate that these films need play in part to the fans of the comic books, so many of the details and subtexts may have been lost on me, but I found the film repetitive, boring, and derivative. On the plus side, the CGI effects are outstanding (most notably the hyena). If only the stories and scripts could catch up to the visuals, we might see some D.C./Marvel adventures that are worthy of all the hype.",Birds of Prey

This is an all female group of crime fighters in Gotham City that take up the slack when Batman is nowhere to be found. Margot/Harley Quinn has broken up with the Joker and found some new best friends in Rosie/Renee Montoya, a Gotham police detective, Mary/The Huntress, a crime boss's daughter turned vigilante and Jurnee/Black Canary, a singer in Ewan's night club that can hit some pretty high notes when she wants to. Ewan/Black Mask is the local crime boss that wants a special diamond that has fallen into the hands of a local 12 year old female pick pocket named Cassandra Cain-in the comics, she is an excellent fighter on the level of Batman himself, but here, she is just a pick pocket-and Ewan has a whole army out looking for her. Now I must mention that I am a big comics fan-I still collect them-and some people will gripe about certain things that are not exactly like they are in the comics but that's the way things go sometimes when they make adaptations. As long as the story keeps you entertained-and this one does-that should be all that matters. Ewan is great as an egotistical madman and the females all get their place in the spotlight. I have heard-depending on the box office it makes, of course-that this might be part of a 3 movie deal. There is a lot of kick-ass action and humor and although there is no scene after the end credits, there is a funny voice over from Margot so don't leave too early.

57,kevin_robbins,I wish DC didnt ruin this title and these characters,3,26 June 2021,"Birds of Prey (2020) is a movie we saw in theatres shortly after it came out. The storyline focuses on Harley Quinn post Suicide Squad after she breaks up with the Joker, recovers from her depression from the breakup, and starts a new life of crime with a new crew of thieves known as Birds of Prey. A lunatic is not a fan of her work and sets out to hunt her and her crew down and bring them to their demise. This movie is directed by Cathy Yan (Dead Pigs) and stars Margot Robbie (Suicide Squad), Rosie Perez (White Men Can't Jump), Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting) and Jurnee Smollett (Lovecraft Country). The storyline for this is a huge step down from Suicide Squad and maybe the worst DC movie to date. The film tried to be cool and creative but everything from the title, storyline and premise was delivered poorly, which is too bad because the cast had potential, the writing and execution failed the potential though. Birds of Prey is a great DC storyline...but that team was created and led by Barbara Gordon, so why use that premise, remove Barbara and insert Harley Quinn, and think you'll be fine? Easy, to capitalize on the money from Suicide Squad. Unfortunately, it didnt work.

60,alindsay-al,An above average fun film,6,7 February 2020,"After many months of anticipation Birds Of Prey is finally with us and I have seen it and this is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Harley Quinn break up with The Joker which alerts a criminal head honcho who aims to take advantage of her and a group of other women in Gotham City.
Main Character
Even though this film is called Birds Of Prey it should really just be called a Harley Quinn film and Margot Robbie is fantastic in this film. It is clear that they are trying to make her the DC version of Deadpool and she is very charismatic in the role and has some really good lines in the film, I feel like she has a real good grip on this character and it feels like she really enjoys playing the role of Harley Quinn.
Supporting Characters
Ewan McGregor plays Roman Sionis AKA The Black Mask in this film and it is clear that he is having a blast in this role, his character is very charismatic and a bit off the wall but that works because of the film that he is in and he is definitley an entertaining villain in this film. Now we get to the rest of the Birds Of Prey - Rosie Perez as Renee Montoya, Mary Elizabeth Winestead as The Huntress & Jurnee Smollet-Bell, they all do their best in their roles especially in the action scenes but they just aren't given enough to do in the film. I didn't really care about their characters and I think this was because there backstories are choppily presented and not given as much screen time as Harley Quinn is clearly presented as the most important character in the film.
Story
This film has an interesting story when it comes to Harley's story, it deals with how she is dealing with her situation with The Joker and dealing with being a bit of a better person and I thought that was handled pretty well. But as mentioned before all the other characters stories and motivations aren't really explored enough to make you care and give them a real reason for being a part of this group.
Script
This film has some funny lines and dialogue in the film especially when the film is doing its best to break the fourth wall and be a bit more interesting then many comic book films. Some of the drama is okay but it doesn't really hit the levels that I think it was going for and as mentioned previously it doesn't elevate any of the supporting characters above being okay characters.
Style
This film has a really unique style. the action scenes are fantastic, really fun and unique. The film does a great job of showcasing the characters different fighting styles to create some meorable and really fun action sequences. However, the pacing of the film is a bit messy, the film jumps all over the place which I get was a stylistic choice but it becomes a bit jarring as you are interested to new characters often and the film isn't in order so it can make it a bit hard to follow.
Overall
Overall this film reminds me quite a bit of Suicide Squad which is why it gets the same rating, an above average film that could have done with focusing up a bit more and showed the group together more and interacting. But this is a fun time at the movies and if you don't take this film too seriously then it can be an enjoyable watch for sure.",Birds of Prey

The four stars for this film are strictly from Robbie's efforts, which were Herculean. Unfortunately, she was stuck in a dreary, boringly violent, and mundane film. The production values were excellent, as were some of the action sequences (a bit reminiscent of The Road Warrior), but it was not enough to save the movie. Robbie has a great future as the living granddaughter of Cyndi Laupner (which is who she reminds me of), and I am sure she will go on to many successes. Hopefully, she will develop romantic screen skills (as there were none in this film), rather than just repetitious violence, which becomes cartoonish when done to excess. (as in WHAM!, SOCK! Holy Batman!). She can do much better with a grown-up script. Unfortunately, the film appears to have been successful enough to encourage the inevitable sequel, which will lock Robbie into the Harley Quinn persona (like Sean Connery as Bond, and was never able to break out of that role until The Untouchables). She will probably make a lot of money if she continues in this role, but my advice would be to break out of this role as quickly as possible if she wants to be considered a serious actress (and she has the talent to be one).",Birds of Prey

66,Pairic,Harley's character develops.,7,18 February 2020,"Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn): Another DC film, very much in the adult mode of Joker but not quite meeting those standards. Still a good, watchable film though. BoP opens with an animated backstory for Harley Quinn, detailing even how shre smashed nuns with a bat. Harley (Margot Robbie) brings us up to date on how life has been without the Joker, a split which leaves her with conflicted feelings. It has also complicated her life as now many crooks are out to take revenge on her as she is no longer under the Joker's protection. She realises that she must become a force in her own right and along the way she narrates a tale which cuts backwards and forwards in time, relating how Birds of Prey came together and the story of a diamond and a teenage pickpocket (Ella Jay Basco).The origin story of Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is intriguing, from her childhood days to her emergence as an assassin who will shoot or stab you but prefers to use a crossbow. Black Canary (Jumee Smollett) finds her voice after saving Harley from being kidnapped and working as a driver for Black Mask (Ewan McGregor) a crazed villain even by DC standards, he likes to have his enemies kinned alive by his evil henchman Zsasz (Chris Messina). At this point I should insert a warning that there are some extremely disturbing scenes in this film, certainly not one for the squeamish.Some great individual fight scenes and mass brawls along the way to a finale at an amusement park which looks positively post-apocalyptic. Harley develops as an character in this film (I loved her pet hyena, Bruce) which (imho)l has been under-rated by some film critics who have little understanding of comic book narratives or how they are translated on to the big screen.

I appreciate there are a lot of creepy men out there in the world, with it seems to me, a disproportionate number in the entertainment industry but that does not mean we are all bad. It does not mean there are not plenty of ""no good women"" either but that's hardly a statement on women in general, nor should it be.As far as being entertainment this could have been quite watchable if the PC rant was left on the cutting room floor, where I believe it belongs. The action flows well and it has a decent cast.Would be nice if we could return to a time when entertainment was an end in itself. A disillusioned 4/10 from me.",Birds of Prey
72,questl-18592,How Harley Got Her Groove Back,6,8 February 2020,"What started off poorly with Suicide Squad and evolved over the course of Aquaman and Shazam seems to have finally blossomed into the DCEU's new style of acid trip levels of color, fun action but a still lacking experience that somehow still feels like they're actively chasing Marvel.Birds of Prey is basically the female DC version of Deadpool. Lots of narration, comedy violence and murder and a healthy dash of fourth wall breaking. It's slick, stylized and has some really cool action scenes here and there along with some legit laughs.Robbie, Winstead and McGregor all seem to be having a blast too and I think that really shows at points. That's not to say the rest of the cast is bad, they're not, they just don't shine like those three.Unfortunately, it doesn't feel like there was much attention paid to... Things making sense. It jumps around in time, personalities switch on a dime, we go from slapstick to brutality in an instant and there's a number of just random things that pop up, not even all McGuffins, that feel like someone just hitting a randomizer. Now, Harley narrates the whole thing and maybe this erratic style is meant to reflect her own personal brand of crazy but it does feel off at times.There's also a supper not subtle message in here about female empowerment, which is great, that's an important topic, but could there be a single male in this world that isn't a terrible person? Not asking for a saint or savior here, just one dude that's not awful. I mean even Black Panther has Martin Freeman!All in all, it's a fun watch. I wasn't checking the time in my seat, it wasn't as salacious as I thought it could be (that's a pro and further proof that women shoot women different than men). It's fun. It's trying to be more than that though and I don't think it gets there. Deadpool worked because it knew what it was and stuck with that, Birds of Prey wants to be more and I think it overreaches and that leaves it feeling a little hollow.",Birds of Prey
73,aidanratesmovies,"A fun, although slightly unoriginal, blast",10,7 February 2020,"With some great, all out performances, and a sheer sense of fun energy; Birds of Prey makes for an entertaining comic book film that may not be totally original, but is certainly different from the rest. The film's script can be a bit average at times, containing plot points you have certainly seen before, however, where Birds of Prey shines most is its unique sense of storytelling and the ridiculously entertaining things it does with it. Margot Robbie give a 'fabulous' performance as Harley Quinn, removing all my doubts of her playing the famous character after Suicide Squad. The other women in the film also give some great performances, with the greatest stand out being Mary Elizabeth Winstead who steals every ounce of her screen time, bringing her A-game as always. Ewan McGregor also gives a fun filled performance as the film's titular villain Black Mask. The film is filled with absolutely awesome action sequences that are bound to at least put a grin on your face, and if that doesn't, then the large dose of well-timed humor will certainly do the trick. In the end, Birds of Prey isn't the best DC has had to offer, but it is certainly a blast, and certainly an experience unlike any other.

It's still somewhat amusing, but it's certainly nothing special.""Birds of Prey"" started off rambling incoherently, just like the majority of DCU movies. The first forty-five minutes are essentially the film boasting about how crazy it is without ever really showing us that craziness. Continuing my metaphor: it's like a drunken cheerleader telling us she's going to do a triple backflip, but she never lines up to do it. Then, finally, after forty-five minutes of boasting about its (her) skills, the film (our drunken cheerleader) actually takes a few steps forward, lining up to do its (her) trick, and though it (she) stumbles in the first few steps and looks awkward when it (she) finally leaps into the air, the film (she) does that triple backflip, and lands, just barely, standing.While what you would have witnessed wouldn't have been pretty, I'd bet you'd still be surprised that inebriated person was left standing at the end of the trick, and that's exactly how I felt at the end of this movie.

I didn't like her costumes at all until the last few scenes. I really love the idea that in recent years production houses have been prepared to screen all the wild imaginations of the superhero universes, what a pure delight, but, alas, Birds of Prey is not quite as good as Gotham the tv series.

77,guisreis,"Harley Quinn shines, Black MaskGregor does not",7,5 February 2021,"Birds of Prey is a nice superhero film, and could be better if it kept the same level throughout it. Margot Robbie does once more (and now with more time) a great job giving life to cartoon character Harley Quinn. Her partners are not so shining but are OK. Art direction and colorful palette work most of the time (not very well in the middle of the motion picture, asI will mention below). The opening animated scene is very good. The jokes are mostly funny and above average in recent superhero movies (DC or Marvel, no difference at all). The end and the gore scenes were also good. A major problem are the too long, repetitive and visually amateur fight against the False Face Society in the amusement park (there was a glimpse of 60's Batman onomatopoeian fights, but much less charming) and most of action scenes in the third and fourth quintiles of the film. Villains Roman Sionis and Victor Zsasz were also uncharismatic, generic and undevelopped. Off course it is partially a drawback caused in the script, but I cannot avoid but say that Ewan McGregor's performance here was uninspired and disappointing. Anyway, although irregular and not fanatstic, Birds of Prey is still one of the good ones aming the numerous supehero flicks that have been made.",Birds of Prey
78,davidmvining,Intentionally poorly told is still poorly told,2,9 November 2020,"This movie has a single objective: to hate men. There's literally no other reason this movie exists. No male character is remotely good in the end, they're all backstabbing rapists and psychopaths while even the criminal women are all sympathetic to the extreme. So, fine. That's its ultimate theme, but what about how the movie tells its story? Well, let's judge it purely on that, never mind its rampant misandry. It's, um, it's terrible.So, the movie is sort of told from Harley Quinn's perspective. We regularly see things that she never sees or could know about, commenting on it like she is seeing it. I suppose it's supposed to be like a Deadpool fourth wall breaking central character running commentary, but Deadpool was, you know, funny. Quinn really isn't, but that's not the biggest problem with how the movie is built. The biggest problem is that the first half or so is intentionally poorly built. Quinn is telling the story like she's drunk and can't remember things in the right order. It reminds me of the Treehouse of Horror from The Simpsons where Homer was telling a ghost story out of order, undercutting every scare he was trying to pull off. There's a reason structure is important in storytelling, and it's not because it's the rules. It's because structure provides the base on which audiences stand and understand the characters, plot, and theme of the film. Screwing with structure like this, where Harley constantly backtracks to cover information we should already have, preventing the story from flowing forward, ends up creating a frustrating, at best, experience.So, digging through the back and forth that prevents any solid grounding, Harley Quinn has broken up with the Joker, and she's struggling. She goes to Black Mask's club and wreaks havoc, letting them all think she's still Joker's girl. When she decides, in a drunken moment, to blow up Ace Chemical, where both she and the Joker got their palish hue, everyone in the world instantly recognizes it as Joker having dumped Harley, because of course? I mean, the second the police character, Renee Montoya, shows up at the scene, she instantly says that this obviously means that they broke up based on the necklace with a J on it found near the scene. Okay, whatever.This action gets all of Gotham to go after Harley, having made so many enemies over the years, and here's where the movie's problems with structure are most acute. You see, we've seen some of what Harley has done to anger the underbelly of Gotham against her, mostly her jumping on Black Mask's driver's legs and breaking them, but the driver wasn't terribly distinctive and then none of the other people who show up have ever been seen before. The way they appear feel like they're supposed to be comedic appearances, ""OH! That guy!"" sort of responses, but the movie has to completely stop to explain who the person is and why they're angry. The kind of introduction the movie does for all of them with a freeze frame and quick text with some quick flashback (which they did in Suicide Squad to terrible effect, by the way) is what you do when you start piling up the grievances as a joke, not how you introduce them all from the beginning. The kicker is that the guy we do know, the driver, is not even the first introduced or even that recognizable.So, alongside this is the actual plot which is that Black Mask is looking for a diamond with bank information laser etched into it that had belonged to a Mafia don who had died a dozen years ago in a hit. How this diamond is eventually found is unclear, but Black Mask sends his new driver, Black Canary the former lounge singer at his club that he elevated to his driver for not terribly good reasons (she beat up some customers that were trying to steal Harley Quinn which would make her a good driver because...?) and Victor Zsasz to recover it from an importer. As Zsasz waits for Canary to return with the car, a young pickpocket, Cassandra, easily takes it from him and gets immediately arrested for having stolen other stuff (with a squad car instantly in support because...?). Black Mask needs that diamond that Cassandra swallows. At the same time, Black Mask's men pick up Harley Quinn, and Black Mask is gonna relieve some stress by cutting of her face. However, she...manages to talk him into letting her find the diamond because...she has no actual skills in finding things other than some weird story about a picture of naked Eleanor Roosevelt that had belonged to the Joker? And then he immediately just puts out a $500,000 bounty on Cassandra for anyone to collect anyway? What? This is dumb. This is really dumb.So, Harley gets to the police station and gets through with a powerful confetti gun in an action scene that exemplifies everything wrong with this movie's action scenes. They make literally no sense. There's having thin women defeat waves of larger men that make sense, like with the enhanced River Tam in Firefly and Serenity, but Birds of Prey makes no such kind of effort. She's attacking a police station with a weapon, and the only time anyone pulls a ranged weapon on her is when they're within striking distance of her own arms. This extends for about fifteen minutes as the action scene evolves to include prisoners and then the, ugh, other mercenaries. No one tries to fire a ranged weapon unless she can reach them with her arms. Also, no one will approach this woman more than one at a time. Now, it's really hard to make convincing action scenes of one against many, but Birds of Prey simply highlights the fact that no one will approach Harley more than one at a time. Especially in the row of prison cells, with the sprinklers on to try and create a distinctive visual motif, the burly prisoners who...immediately attack the person who just released them from their cells (ugh) all go after her one at a time so that she can do gymnastics to defeat them.They get away, hide away, and get betrayed by a man who gives their location away to...people. It's unclear who. Anyway, while all of this is going on, the Crossbow Killer is going around killing people, supposedly bad people but it's never quite clear. Now, the movie does have a handful of laughs, and the biggest one is probably about how the Crossbow Killer wants to be called the Huntress. Her exasperation at no one knowing what she wants to call herself is genuinely funny. It's also short lived as the movie just goes back to being a confusing mess of nonsense.So, everyone ends up coming together for a couple of action scenes in an abandoned circus attraction on the wharf that looks completely dilapidated on the outside but works perfectly on the inside (the Joker, I guess). The action scenes are...weak, designed to look cool but feel loose and poorly executed. It doesn't help that Harley's large hammer is supposed to be hard and we see it hit people pretty softly with regularity. The five women end up defeating hundreds of guys with nary a scratch, Black Mask blows up with a grenade, and the girls end up at a taco place where Cassandra finally poops out the diamond. Yay, I guess.This movie has no center. It's supposedly Harley Quinn herself, but she's telling the story incredibly poorly, is incredibly unsympathetic, and would work far better as a supporting character. She was barely tolerable in Suicide Squad as a supporting player, and pushed to the fore here she's grating. The movie has a handful of entertaining moments, but they're really far and few between. This movie was poorly written, poorly shot, and poorly edited. It has the ambition of an aggrieved Tumblr account.",Birds of Prey

80,jadepietro,Bird-Brained,4,23 August 2020,"GRADE: C-THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A disappointing superhero movie that is big, loud, and garish but no fun, despite Margot Robbie's valiant efforts.JIM'S REVIEW: Most superhero movies either take themselves too seriously or are so tongue-firmly-in-cheek that they lose sight of the plot as they distract with the violent action. Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn), a long title for an even longer film, falls into the latter category. The film is a spin-off to the successful Suicide Squad (2016), only this time it focuses on its most enduring character, that crazed kewpie doll killer babe, Harley Quinn, who has been ceremoniously dumped by her beau, Joker. That she is again played by the talented Margot Robbie is the movie's greatest asset.It sure isn't its disjointed screenplay by Christina Hodson. While the film is directed with assurance by Cathy Yan, the story is a mess, as it volleys back and forth with enough confusing flashbacks, flash-forwards, and freeze frames that one becomes quite giddy from all of the weak storytelling and fancy editing. The narrative structure is comprised of an overabundance of voiceovers and non-stop exposition and so little character development. Their backstories literally stop much of the action and pop up unexpectedly to fill in some bio details, but those personal dramas come off as big chunks of information that upend the logical flow of the plot and interfere with the many random combat sequences. (At times, I began to think that some scenes in the film were missing as Harley is captured one moment and totally free to do mayhem in the very next scene.) A film does not need to be this chaotic to show its own chaos, but Birds of Prey is at least true to itself.The plot involves a battle over a rare diamond as the MacGuffin, but it is more of a showcase for women empowerment as the female class continually beats the crap outta the male gender. The movie is loaded with highly choreographed fights that are so cartoonish that the movie become unintentionally laughable. One expects Wily E. Coyote to join in the fun. Of course, that never happens...although we do get to see Bruce the Hyena. In all this ruckus, one never feels any semblance of real danger. It's all manufactured violence and exaggerated dance moves. The director seems obsessed with slo-mo techniques and moments of enhanced speed which only serve to show the foolishness of this whole venture. Dare I say the pacing is indeed off.The actors do persevere. Ms. Robbie is again fine in her signature role, although she has no moments to show any vulnerability as she did in the original source. Here, it's all fists of blood and slapstick comedy. She is joined by her all-girls club which includes the Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), Detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez), and Ella Jay Basco as Cassandra Cain, a teenage pickpocket whose fast slight of hand causes an unfortunate chain of events. The primary villains, Ewan McGregor as Gotham City's latest megalomaniac Roman Sionis aka Black Mask and an unrecognizable Chris Messina as his henchman, Victor Zsasz, try to whip up some evil, but they are undone by the contrived and silly script.Still the movie has a nice look to it. Ms. Yan does know how to create a dysfunctional world, even if the inhabitants are one dimensional figures lost in this DC universe. Kudos go out to Matthew Libatique' atmospheric photography and K.K. Barrett's set design. (I particularly like the funhouse fight sequence.)Birds of Prey is a failed attempt to mix action or comedy. Just as the mixed-up movie haphazardly stitches together its fragmented set pieces into a frenzied patchwork of ineptitude, it only seems befitting that I conclude this review in the same manner with my final words: may wanna Girls fun have. ain't it (freeze) This.",Birds of Prey

This reviewer thinks that the film is the middle of the pack, beating my expectations on many things, but still looking for some tightening up to help get the same levels that Wonder Woman and Shazam held for me. It's got the edge, the attitude, the fun and the use of characters and character development was a major selling point for me. I found this to be a fun comic book movie though, with a new aged flare and promise for some more fun films starring Ms. Robbie. However, I'd like the politics to be toned back a bit, put some more though into the villains like they did the protagonists, and make the action have the dynamic energy that I know they can do and not rely so much on the slow-motion versions that DC loves.

82,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Birds of Prey,7,8 February 2020,"It was the summer of 2016. I was sitting in a theater viewing the DC Comics pic, Suicide Squad. Sadly, it was out of sorts, disjointed, and feverishly edited. I didn't quite dig it like I dug its trailer. Cut to four years later and ""Squad's"" follow-up (Birds of Prey) is a well-tuned improvement. Its title character named Harley Quinn, becomes ""the mighty Quinn"" (Ha).Anyway, Birds of Prey has to do with Harley (Margot Robbie), Harley's recovery from her Joker breakup, her love of fried egg sandwiches, and her dodging from thugs led by a criminal mind known as Black Mask (Ewan McGregor). Robbie and McGregor are the acting standouts here. They are a nasty hoot playing respectively, the antihero protagonist and the snobbishly villain bully.Reflecting on Birds of Prey, I was reminded of the female version of Suicide Squad. Joining forces with Harley Quinn are the ""crossbow killer"" (Huntress), a Gotham City Police Detective (Renee Montoya), a vigilante (Black Canary), and a pickpocket (Cassandra Cain). They are all girly girl badasses and they put on a superior action showcase in ""Prey's"" last fifteen minutes.Prey's Director (Cathy Yan) shoots hyperkinetic fighting scenes and car chases spiked with a deranged, carnival feel. Her look of the film is cinematic cotton candy, rainbow snow cones, and sweet, dirty perfume. Yan also likes to occasionally freeze a frame and use a telestrator to outline a character's face. Finally, she tells ""Prey's"" story to a somewhat Rashomon effect. That means there are flashbacks and various interpretations of ""Prey's"" slightly messy plot mechanics.Like most DC flicks, Birds of Prey isn't epic or crucial but boy is it a lot of fun (yup, there might be a sequel). ""Prey"" is demented, fantasyland stuff and with every violent bone crack and every dry humored quip, you get a mucky wink wink from everyone involved. Rating: 3 stars.",Birds of Prey
83,Kamurai25,"""Deadpool Dumped the Joker""",6,1 September 2020,"Average watch at best, might watch again, and can't recommend.There are several ways to look at this movie:
1) From a sequel stand point.
2) From a comics stand point.
3) From a stand alone movie stand point.
1) Sequel stand point
THERE IS AN ENTIRE MOVIE MISSING! This is the 3rd part of the ""Harley Quinn Trilogy"". We're missing an entire transformation of a character from one thing to another for this movie to even be able to happen. And if you're picking at that thread, then there is probably 2 or 3 movies before ""Suicide Squad"".2) From a comics standpoint
OMG, they pooed all over almost every concept they borrowed from the comics.
-Harley leaving the Joker- This was a huge Gotham event, not from a Gotham standpoint, but in the revolution and rebirth of a character that literally is left out of the story here.
-Birds of Prey- Never mentioned in the movie, they come together our of necessity, like the Avengers, when the original concept was orchestrated by Oracle who hand picked women in the vigilante field to help her, but at least they included the originals, Huntress and Black Canary
-Huntress- I've never loved Mary Elizabeth Winstead more, but they turned the ""Crossbow Killer"" vs Huntress thing into a really poor joke, making her seem sad instead of powerful, when should be saying, ""I am the Huntress"" to install the fear of the name into criminals as she was a killing vigilante, the only reason Batman wouldn't work with her, and a main contention with Oracle.
-Black Canary- I understand that there are WAY too many white characters, but the solution is not to ""wash"" characters, just create new characters that help balance out the whole pool. Jurnee Smollett is awesome, and she does a great job, but she's not the same Black Canary that I know, that was an international spy / mercenary (basically an American Black Widow). The gritty reboot is good, I'd just rather it be her own character and have it stand on her own awesome footing.
-Cassandra Cain- What a creative way to ruin a future Batgirl movie. And that has to be what it is. They some contention with someone else wanting the rights (or they're elapsing) and we're seeing what happened to Spiderman and Venom, they're using the name so someone else can't. She was supposed to be the assassin turned vigilante, the daughter of Deathstroke, raised in the League of Shadows, but sure 2 bit pickpocket works.
-Harley Quinn- They are all over the place with her, from helpless girl to badass to bad fighter to lucky only to clueless to amazing intellect, to violent psychopath to emotional friend. Pick a lane. And the ""word on face"" thing didn't go over well with Joker, not sure why the kept such a distraction when her face is already the symbol with which she garners the desired attention.3) Stand alone movie
I hate the stupid way they jump around with the story: I didn't like in in ""Pulp Fiction"" where it had purpose, I doubt I'll ever like it anywhere else.That aside, this is actually pretty great, they spent a lot of money to get the production value where it needs to be, the cast is awesome, the story (when understandable) is pretty good, and the characters are entertaining as hell, even if Harley Quinn now seems to be a lot more Deadpool than I want.Most of its problems are just that it is trying to be a Gotham Knights, DC movie when it absolutely doesn't have to be. Using names that people don't recognize and giving them a different experience only turns your great movie into a good movie.I miss the days when people just made a thing they thought was good and saw if they were right. All this spreadsheet analysis of world wide information is definitely skewing movies, and we haven't even been doing it long enough to see if it's really effective measurement.Long-short: it's a good enough movie to be potentially great if you just pretend you know nothing about anything else.",Birds of Prey

Lots of violence and gore, although, I thought the fight choreography is spectacular, especially in the final sequences (I realize this is a minority opinion). All in all the movie was loud and chaotic, the writing and dialogue left a lot to be desired, but the characters were interesting.

Made by, and marketed for destructive Air Heads - this could only please the foulest of feeble minds - those that fester by feeding from the dung heaps of this sorry world.With 'entertainment' like this infecting the industries mainstream, its goodbye world, hello emptiness. Mike LaSalle seems to be the only mainstream critic that remains able to tell it like it is - while others have sold their soul to fit into that empty hole - containing the lowest common denominators.

While it isn't perfect, with a weak story and some noticeably big clichés, the film still entertains with fun action, a good amount of charm, and a somewhat likable characters. The performances are amazing, Margot Robbie is Harley Quinn, she's totally having fun with her character but I find the her voice-over narration to be annoying. Ewan McGregor owns the role of Black Mask, he's very menacing as the villian. Mary Elizabeth is absolutely memorable in her performance as Huntress. Jurnee Smollett performance's as Black Canary is also noteworthy. The set designs are a bit more digestible to the eyes and the VFX are good. There are hardcore action scenes as well as many comic and light hearted scenes. The movie shifts well from the violent action scenes to the light hearted scenes which is a good thing. The set pieces are spectacular and dynamic but the one in the funhouse is too silly to be good. The soundtrack is amazing as it intensifies and adds energy to the scenes.

But whether the character was strong enough to warrant a movie of her own was another debate altogether. And here we are, with Birds of Prey, featuring all-women leads, written and directed by two women. Their effort is commendable and Harley is the closest you can get to a Deadpool in the DCEU but it still lacks the tongue-in-cheek oomph that a movie such as this, desperately needs.The screenplay by Chistina Hodson is very patchy. Every time a set-piece is about to commence or a new (or random) character appears on the screen, the viewers are quickly spoonfed a backstory as to how to why it's happening - it's a trope that the likes of Tarantino and Guy Ritchie have successfully attempted and pulled off. That too, featuring umpteen instances of black humour. Birds of Prey mistakes glitter guns, fancy hairstyles and girly catchphrases for coolth.We do get some extra insight into the animated psyche of Harley Quinn - how she deals with life post her breakup with the Joker (who is nowhere to be seen; neither is Batman - this is Gotham City after all!). There's a delicious (literally!) stretch about Harley craving an eggs & bacon sandwich that was fairly amusing, and I wish they had retained the same zing for the rest of the movie. While The Huntress' (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead) story was the most bearable (and fleshed out) of the lot, the characterizations of Dinah Lance, Renee Montoya, Cassandra Cain, and especially, Roman Sionis a.k.a Black Mask felt off.Mcgregor, who plays Black Mask, seems to have had some R-rated fun but his character doesn't intimidate. Same goes for Victor Zsasz (a knife-wielding serial killer and one of the rogues on Batman's take-down list), played by a bleached-looking Chris Messina. To make matters worse, the film always plays to Quinn's vicious glee and untimely comedic lines (""This is just like a sleepover! We should order pizza"") and never puts her character in jeopardy.. even when she's held captive by Roman. All her break-up trauma is explained in bar scenes where she's getting drunk, beating men up, or being saved by the Black Canary. Basically, it's all just an excuse to go all-out weirder and noisier (and to ignore Jared Leto!).The set-pieces are well shot; the one in the climax particularly stood out. It even temporarily makes you believe that a familiar Gotham character cameo is about to appear (but nope). No mid/post-credits either. None of Harley's female sidekicks (except for The Huntress) leave lasting impressions. Unless the stakes are upped big time and the comedy is written in a much more engaging manner, I'm not sure if I'd be excited for a sequel.",Birds of Prey

92,MR_Heraclius,Birds of Prey,7,22 March 2020,"Continues a wining-ish streak for DC with a pretty solid film that is at the very least WAY better than Suicide Squad. It's messy as hell, at times crassly mean-spirited, and mostly not that funny, but for the most part it's still a great deal of fun. Harley is still a fun character, and this version of her that is more than just an oversexualized girlfriend of the Joker is a much more interesting character to follow. Her girl gang and resentful breakup is also just a very human story. Yeah it was done better in the animated series currently on DC Universe, but still, this one is fun. The other Birds are pretty good, especially Huntress, but this really is Harley's show, and she's good. I do have to give love to Ewan McGregor as Black Mask. Yeah he's done villains before, but good god, this is one helluva villain. I love the character Black Mask, and he absolutely nails the character. Charming, funny, completely psychotic, I was a happy geek watching him on screen. Not to mention McGregor is clearly having a ball in the roll, and that energy does pass on to you. Overall though Birds of Prey is a mess. It's plot is basically Snatch but not as good, and it's attitude is aggressive, but god damn does it ever have an attitude. It has an identity, a style, and a look I can't deny, and I will admit it was pretty fun. It's got some solid performances, characters I wanted to see, and a solid style. It's a wild swing, and while it doesn't totally nail it, I admire it's ambition.",Birds of Prey
93,rivertam26,Incredibly awesome,9,19 February 2020,"So it's been a few weeks since I've seen this originally and a second time and I have to say the movie was such a blast. Director Cathy Yan in her first big studio feature really captures the essence of the title character and hits it out of the park. Picking up after the joker breaks up with Harley. She finds herself declaring her independence and being targeted by all of her old enemies that were help back because of her ex beau. Along the way a young pick pocket swallows a diamond that everyone wants and she must team up with a few misfits to try and keep her safe. I've really boiled it down to the basics here and I dont want you to think Quinn isn't a baddie because she still is. She kills quite a few dudes from bashing their heads in to feeding them to her pet hyena. The movie is surprisingly gory and the story and execution are colorful and wild. The performances are solid all around from an amazing Ewan McGregor as a wacky villain, a fierce Mary Elizabeth Winstead as the huntress and an amazingly kick ass Rosie Perez as Renee Montoya. Jurnee Smollet Bell is also charasmatic as the Black Canary. But the real star is of course Harley Quinn played by a remarkable Margot Robbie. She is electric in this role. She's insane and over the top but she also sells the smaller moments giving the character an impressive amount of depth. You can literally feel her heartbreak. As awesome as it is it's not flawless. There are some pacing issues and the story feels a bit all over the place at times. That being said the manic pacing and chaotic screenplay coupled with incredible action sequences, amazing fight choreography and stunning cinematography benefit the film. Making a unique wild ride and a cinematic experience that's wholly original and overly entertaining.",Birds of Prey

95,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,It's an okay action flick that's got some real energy to it.,6,22 March 2020,"Birds of Prey is an enjoyable film even if it's somewhat lacking in its plot. Harley Quinn truly makes her own in this film more so than she did in Suicide Squad, but the script makes things seem too convenient for the lead characters and their fight against classic Batman-baddie Roman Sionis aka 'Black Mask'. These girls, Harley, Huntress, Black Canary, Renee Montoya and Cassandra Cain all have real chemistry that's more enjoyable than the film's screenplay itself, and I want to see more seamless chemistry like this in future DC movies, and have a plot that doesn't rely too heavily on fanboy-isms like having reverence to the Joker when we never see him: just focus on what IS in the movie and that's more than enough material to work with.The problem DC has with its live-action shared universe is one that MARVEL's already solved: make the 'character-crossing' seamless and less forced for 'sequel's sake', and just treat it as two interesting characters interacting with, and changing, one another as opposed to becoming obligatory franchise insurance. It'a a form of respectable power play. The DC Animated Universe realised this problem and the DCEU (extended universe) can salvage its worth just yet and fix where it went wrong in that regard.",Birds of Prey
96,Pumpkin_Man,A Fun Thrilling Ride With Harley Quinn as Your Tour Guide!!!,10,15 May 2020,"I absolutely love Margot Robbie's portrayal as Harley Quinn. She's funny, cute, adorable, quirky, psycho and kicks ass! She definitely makes the movie better. The movie itself is similar to the style of 'Deadpool' because Harley breaks the 4th wall and talks to the audience directly and purposely tells the story out of order, from her perspective. This is the kind of comic book movie I like; fun, quirky characters and lots of action. I don't really care much for dark dreary DC movies that are overly long and drag on (I'm looking at you, Christopher Nolan) This movie is the 8th installment of the DC Extended Universe. This review might contain some spoilers!The movie takes place a little bit after Suicide Squad. Harley Quinn is a sad depressed mess because The Joker breaks up with her, for good. (Jared Leto does not return, but we just hear about him throughout) Harley goes through all the stages of a break-up like cutting her hair, eating junk food, buying a hyena as a pet and watching sappy love movies and soap operas.Now that Harley and Joker are over, criminals and mafia kingpins have declared war on her. The main villain is Roman Sionis, a psycho brutal crime lord who owns a bar and is looking for his missing diamond that was taken by a teen-aged girl named Cassandra. Harley makes a deal with Roman and tries to get him the diamond in hopes that every thug in Gotham will leave her alone.Over the course of the movie, we meet The Huntress, Black Canary, and Detective Montoya who all have a score to settle with Roman. Harley must team up with the 'Birds of Prey' and take down Roman and his goons if they want to save the girl and make it out alive. If you love action, comic book movies, and Harley Quinn, I highly recommend BIRDS OF PREY AND THE FANTABULOUS EMANCIPATION OF ONE HARLEY QUINN!!!",Birds of Prey
97,Sergiodave,Not the worst DC movie!,6,23 March 2020,"My expectations for Birds of Prey were not that high, which is just as well.
The Positives.
Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, can't think of anyone better, good actress, fun and good use of the forth wall.
Cinematography, settings, etc really good.
The Birds of Prey cast was pretty good.The Negatives
Took a long time to get going.
Black Mask played by Ewan McGregor was terrible, though that was possibly the script. Indeed all the baddies were.
The fight scenes were ridiculous, I know this is fantasy, but please!Overall, not as bad as some of the childish ratings, but could have been a lot better. I have no problem with feminine empowerment in movies, just don't be lazy.",Birds of Prey
98,Prashast_Singh,"The best female action movie I've seen, in my opinion!",10,8 February 2020,"Birds of Prey is a highly entertaining action film that is clearly not for kids. For the first time, you get to see Harley Quinn's real bat and hammer action with blood. Margot Robbie is such a fine actress, that I believe she was born to play this role. Her performance as a witty action (anti)heroine is nothing but flawless. I really can't wait to see her in this role again, and for now, this film has left me satisfied.Birds of Prey can be compared more with John Wick or The Equalizer instead of Superman or Batman. This is the best female action movie I've seen till date, and I'm not kidding. You get loads of action, a good amount of humor and a ton of memorable characters. I thought Mary Elizabeth Winstead was excellent as the Huntress, and clearly my second favorite after Harley Quinn in this film. Every action film about a team tends to have at least one tough and serious character and Huntress is that. Harley, however, is a mix of both tough and sweet: presented in a way that you just can't hate her. All actors and actresses were truly awesome throughout the film, including Ewan McGregor.The action is the biggest highlight of this film, and is possibly the best action in a DC movie till date. It uses slow-motion and camera angles brilliantly, and its raw nature is the real icing on the cake. If you like action movies based on comic book characters and are an adult, check it out with a tub of popcorn. There's something really charming about the film's visuals, and it actually feels like a comic book has come alive.Birds of Prey, in simple words, is an exhilarating action film that is a must watch for anyone who's into action movies and DC comics. Just make sure kids don't see it, because it really has mature content that isn't meant for them.",Birds of Prey
99,Jeremy_Urquhart,"It's very messy, but a good deal of it works",7,29 September 2021,"I'm not sure it ever quite nails its tone, the humour was about 50/50 hit and miss for me, and Harley herself doesn't feel 100% like a good choice for a lead... at least at first.The film takes a while to pick up but once it does there's a large chunk of it that's great. I really liked the fractured, non-linear storytelling paired with Harley Quinn's narration. It was genuinely really clever and unique.Things sag a bit at the start of the third act, when the nonlinear storytelling is replaced with a more traditional style, but things pick up again in the climax, which was pretty great.Overall, the action is consistently excellent, with great use of slow motion, and fantastic stunt work and fight choreography. There were a few hand to hand fight scenes here that reminded me of The Raid 1 and 2, and that's one of the highest praises you can give an action movie, in all honesty.There's also a lot of action, which kept things fast paced, and it's never really boring to watch. Most of the cast do solid work, and the characters themselves are simple but largely effective, with enough character development to care about them to some extent.Also appreciated the bold colours and the eclectic soundtrack.There's a lot to appreciate- this movie is unapologetically its own thing, and I can't help but compare it to the solid but derivative Black Widow, which is the most recent comic book film I watched before this. Birds of Prey is definitely better.Even though this didn't always work for me, I liked that it wasn't afraid to have its own voice and do its own thing, and when things click and this movie really works, it's really, really good.The inconsistent humour, mood whiplashes that aren't pulled off perfectly, and some occasionally exhausting and relentless manic energy keeps me from loving this as a whole, but there's more than enough good here to recommend it anyone else burnt out by comic book movies that lack flair and personality of their own.",Birds of Prey

I just take it as mindless piece of action entertainment and it really doesn't fail there; I even had a few good laughs throughout. As a trained fighter I almost never find fight scenes well done in movies and even though they're far from perfect here, I was actually impressed how well choreographed they were; maybe not convincing,but the style fits the overall movie.

It's as smart and carefree in execution.So much to live in this: the hallucinatory homage to Marilyn Monroe's ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend""; the club scene played in fast forward, in which Harley skitters across the dancefloor and throws up in another woman's purse.

She was obviously born to play the role (not that it's the only one she can,, she's good in everything she does). Now,, on to the rest,,,,
The bad,,, this movie is very much about how men are bad, women are great,, and such. Now don't get me wrong,, I luv women (well,, most). Men and Women are completely equal,,,, just different. Yes,, I said it,,, sue me.
The feminist movement is strong with this one,,, ugh. McGregor as Black Mask was,,
not bad but not really memorable either. Granted, this is a villan I don't know much about,, but still, I expected more villany and less night club owner.
Now,, on to the good. Like I said before,, Robbie as Harley Quinn. Smollett-Bell shines as Black Canary in this one. Winstead is good as huntress (would've liked to have seen a lot more of her,,, although we saw more of her than we did of Leto as the Joker). Perez rounds out the female cast as the smart cop who has to go outside the law to save the innocent kid (well,, maybe not innocent,,, but she doesn't deserve what's coming her way).
The soundtrack is perfect,, like with Suicide Squad (which I really liked,,, don't know what everyone's problem was with that).

106,Fernando-Rodrigues,Sounded better on paper,6,9 September 2020,"This movie could've been so much deeper if it explored Harleen's psyche, but instead of that the picture gives quick solutions and a teenager movie on steroids. The cast and the movie message are great, but the script doesn't help developing it. Accepting that the Huntress dodged so many bullets it's a pill hard to swallow. Besides that there are some continuity errors like the scene where somebody throws bombs at Harleen's house and the cops claim to be at her door, then, after the explosion these caracters vanish -i mean, they were just poking her or what? that was a big lack on that scene-",Birds of Prey
107,one9eighty,"Colourful and generally fun, but also slightly all over the place",6,10 July 2020,"Party a follow up to ""Suicide Squad""; Harley Quinn has ended her relationship with The Joker and is attempting to build a life of her own - but it seems that everyone is after her for one thing or another. She has a 'sort-of' plan to make a name for herself, but that plan isn't the most thought out plan - but this is Harley Quinn; she'll just deal with what's in front of her and do the best she can.Margot Robbie once again dons on the neon attire and pale face of Harley Quinn. She's joined in the film by characters from the DC Universe that comic fans will certainly be aware of, some make up the 'Birds of Prey', others are more criminally minded such as Roman Sionis and Victor Zsasz.How do I start this review then? Well... err... the film is a bit of a mess. It actually feels like an intentional mess to align with the Harley Quinn character and mindset. It is difficult to follow a linear plot as there are so many potential plots floating around that it's difficult to know which one will unfurl - normally that challenge would be a good thing, not here I'm afraid. I do not think the script was that strong, it felt very throwaway without much development or depth for the characters. The cast seem to do a decent enough job with what they are given, but not to the point where the audience feels that engaged. While Robbie was the central character, I found more interested in the Huntress character brought to scree by Mary Elizabeth Winstead - until she teamed up with Harley Quinn that is.I enjoyed it, but it felt like it was trying to be something it wasn't. The most successful R rated anti-hero film thusfar (IMO) is ""Deadpool"" and this film felt like it was trying to follow a style like that. Colourful and chaotic, randomly breaking the 4th wall, lots of violence and tongue in cheek humour. The DC Universe has learned and improved on ""Suicide Squad"", but this felt like it wouldn't be out of place next to pre-Nolan Batman films - I could easily have believed it if George Clooney turned up as a nippled Batman, chasing Arnold Schwarzenegger while avoiding freeze-ray blasts. It was nice to see a generally female centred film, but I think this was an opportunity missed rather than a mark made to change the way superhero/anti-hero films are handled.6 out of 10 from me here.",Birds of Prey

109,aciessi,Never Takes Off.,5,9 February 2020,"Let's get something straight for the record. Birds of Prey, though it serves as a spin-off of the celluloid abortion known as Suicide Squad, is not even close to being as bad as it's predecessor. It's watchable, at least for it's majority. It even has some sort of awareness of how unwanted Suicide Squad is, as it blows off Jared Leto's cringe-inducing Joker rendition by portraying him as an albatross around Harley's neck, and barely a blip on the radar of her own special insanity. As a result, BOP assuredly, though awkwardly, steps out from the rubble as something of its own. Unfortunately for everyone involved, no matter how much they tried to scrub it off, the Suicide Squad stink lingers on. To make matters worse, this film couldn't have premiered at a more inconvenient time. The DC cinematic universe has changed forever with Joker, proving that superhero movies can stir and spellbind the filmgoing public without being flashy and action packed. Joker isn't just good, it's 11 Oscar nominations good. Birds of Prey now just feels irrelevant. Almost as if it was shelved for three years. Hey, it wouldn't have been the first film release of 2020 to feel older (see The New Mutants).As for the substance, Birds of Prey has something to prove. It wants to be a female Deadpool. It's wants to be cartoonish and whip-smart, but woke. It's struggles to be either. Without a doubt, Margot Robbie is the star of the show. She's a lightening rod, and a badass. She was born to play Harley Quinn. Everyone else is just along for the ride, and it shows. The other female fatales are tragically forgettable. I can't even remember all of their names. Girl power is a group effort, and if you can't do that, than just keep Harley as the sole focus of your movie. Not to mention, every character here, besides Harley, is one-dimensional. Most especially, our villain, Black Mask. He's a misogynistic prick. That's it. No depth, no backstory, none of that. He's a cartoon bad guy. Maybe that was the point. But again, for a film so ""progressive"", it's so stuck in the past. Even as a comedy, it's lopsided. The jokes land, especially when they have to, only to disappear and then reappear unexpectedly. Deadpool worked, because it kept firing jokes at a rapid pace. That's what BOP needed to do. All in all, it's just ok. It really didn't have to be, though. Too bad, puddin!",Birds of Prey
110,rockman182,Birds of Prey (2020),7,9 February 2020,"Lets face it, the DC Extended Universe has been a mess for the most part. Apart from Wonder Woman, most of the rest has been a misfire. None a big offender than Suicide Squad. That film was awful all around and was just a disaster that no one wants to talk about. I wasn't a fan of Robbie's Harley Quinn in that film so much but she's grown on me over the years as a performer ever since I, Tonya. Birds of Prey is certainly an improvement over Suicide Squad and a better entry for DCEU although its not as good as can be.
The film follows the life of one Harley Quinn. She has broken up with the Joker and seeks a new thrill. She somehow gets involved in trying to recover an expensive diamond for an erratic night club owner Roman Sionis. Along the win Harley butts heads with other woman who all are out to seek justice and break chains that keep them restrained. The film stars Margot Robbie, Ewan McGregor, Rosie Perez, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead.
The film is visually an improvement over Suicide Squad. Its brighter and fun, not as dark and gloomy as Suicide Squad. The action sequences are actually quite good, primarily the last fight in the funhouse. Robbie embodies the character better in this film and doesn't have many cringe induced dialogue like in the previous film. I liked Winstead's character Huntress and the humor attached with her name. The film has narative flaws with it being narrated by Quinn and going back and forth I found this to be a weak and overdone way to do things.
There are passages in the film which are pretty boring, basically as it sets up for the final get together. McGregor chews scenery the whole time he is on screen. Overall, DCEU is still a disappointment for the most part but there are moments here and there worth talking about. This film is very on the nose about its women characters and how they are badass working together. While Birds of Prey isn't anything amazing or remarkable its easily one of the better entries in this universe. If this film makes banks, I'm sure the studio will plan a sequel.

111,jon.h.ochiai,"The Lovable Sociopath in ""Birds of Prey""",8,23 February 2020,"I really loved ""Birds of Prey: And the Fabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"" in the twisted hysterical escapist way. Props too, for the extended title. Calmly strong Huntress, played by beautiful introverted Mary Elizabeth Winestead, confesses to superhero Dinah Lance aka Black Canary regarding her martial arts skills, ""You can kick high in tight pants."" You don't often hear that in a superhero action movie. Just saying.That being said, Director Cathy Yan's ""Birds of Prey"" is pleasantly not your typical superhero action movie. For one thing, not everyone is the conventional hero, like Harley Quinn, played by Margot Robbie in total swag with razor-like irony. Along with Christina Hodson's screenplay, Cathy creates the unique: The lovable sociopath in Harley Quin, the standout character from ""Suicide Squad"". Margot in blonde pigtails, haunting complexion, and cutoff shorts mesmerizes in bizarre charm.In Cathy's animated prologue, Harley was the brilliant resilient little girl, who endured her abandonment abuse plagued childhood, becoming a prominent psychiatrist. She fell in love with Gotham City's villainous murder Joker, arch nemesis of Batman. In her spiraling demise, Harley fell into a toxic chemical vat; thus, altering her appearance also bestowing her great physical strength and speed. She's also the martial arts expert: No one kicks ass wielding a baseball bat like Harley.Yet, her love story was not happily ever after: The Joker left Harley heartbroken. Still, she hides the break up, because being Joker's girlfriend granted the certain street cred. Although, Harley can dispatch any hulking thug with or without her beloved bat.Margot's Harley Quinn is the beguiling paradox, ultimately making the visually stunning yet narratively messy ""Bird of Prey"" soar. Margot embodies distinct humanity even in Harley, who is so far removed from reality. Her dominant cynicism surrenders to touching maternal instincts protecting Cassandra, played by spirited Ella Jay Basco. Rogue pick-pocket Cassandra steals the diamond sought by Harley's night club boss, crime leader Roman, played by virtually one-note evil Ewan McGregor. Granted Ewan reveals in his incarnation.In the strangely sweet scene, Harley and Cassandra eat their breakfast cereal while watching TV cartoons. Former clinician Harley tells her squad, ""Psychologically speaking, vengeance rarely brings the catharsis we hope for."" Amen. Yet, coming from Harley: WTF?Yeah, the martial arts fighting is so cool, with orchestrated leg sweeps, knee kicks, and judo throws. Director Cathy displays a distinctive visual style for her characters and Gotham City. Cinematographer Matthew Libatique dazzles with his neon color pallet. What dazzles more so is the inherent narrative incongruity of ""Birds of Prey"": Harley and her squad are paradoxes, in a good way.The cast is awesome. Rosie Perez is the comically intrepid Detective Montoya, who traces Harley through the series of grizzly gang murders. Although, Mary Elizabeth's Helena (Huntress) vehemently denies ""rage issues"", she's the trained assassin since childhood, seeking justice for murder of her family. Hysterically, Helena is the shy hero, who practices saying, ""I'm Huntress"" in menacing voice. Jurnee Smoullet-Bell is the reluctant badass as club singer Dinah. Jurnee's vulnerable awareness heightens her prowess reveal. Ella's genuine 10 year-old bravado as Cassndra hides the fear of the little girl, who just wants to be loved.Amidst, the amazing martial arts sequences, the loud car chases, and hilarious wise cracks, what landed for me was: Harley's tears. Harley let down Cassandra, who was counting on her. Despite, her sociopath sensibilities, she actually cared for another human being. Despite all, Harley is the Hero. Really, that makes ""Birds of Prey"" worth watching. Just saying.",Birds of Prey
112,Benjamin-M-Weilert,Another good Margot Robbie performance filled with flat and uninteresting side characters.,4,6 November 2020,"I will admit: Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as Harley Quinn. The fact that she even got her own movie after her debut in Suicide Squad (2016) is a testament to this. That being said, she's a bit of a shallow character past being ""Joker's girlfriend."" Look no further than Birds of Prey (2020) to see what I mean. If it were truly a Harley Quinn standalone film, it wouldn't have needed the sub-plots of a handful of other characters to make the running time long enough.As it stands, Birds of Prey is meant as a sort of ""origin story"" for this titular team of female heroes. The fact that it needed Harley Quinn to make it marketable is a bit of a disappointment in the ability of the writers to create a story that would give these women agency without resorting to a tedious series of events that center around Harley surviving her vast list of enemies and people out for revenge. Unfortunately, none of the other characters stand out enough to make this movie as entertaining as it could have been.Perhaps the overabundance of tropes and stereotype characters is what made this movie not work for me. None of the motivations of the characters are really that interesting or unique to them. It's almost like these characters were purposely chosen never to come close to taking the spotlight away from Harley Quinn, which hurts the overall film in the end. I'm certainly glad that I used a free Redbox rental for this movie, as I wouldn't want to spend any money on it.Another good Margot Robbie performance filled with flat and uninteresting side characters, I give Birds of Prey 2.0 stars out of 5.",Birds of Prey

It's design and action still makes it entertaining,6,15 February 2020,"When you consider movies like The Avengers, Justice League, and Guardians of the Galaxy, it shows that audiences love their group hero movies. They love watching their favorite characters interacting and trying to work with each other to take down whatever their facing. It's something that we've seen in comics for a while, but only now is it being embraced. Some of it was copyrights, but the real reason is because these movie are more popular now then ever. It doesn't even have to be superheroes; villains can have as much popularity. Especially when you consider how much controversy Joker got, but it still was a hit with audiences and critics.Another villain who's had a lot of success is Harley Quinn. She's a fairly recent character, who made her first appearance in Batman: The Animated Series and not the comics first. But she's been so well liked that she's become a vital part of the DC comics. She also happened to be a highlight of 2016's Suicide Squad. While the reception was mixed (and I agree), most people agreed that Margot Robbie captured the psychotic nature of the clown woman whose love-struck with the Joker (and we're talking about Jarred Leto's Joker). Let's see if she can carry things on her own with Birds of Prey.Sometime after Suicide Squad, the Joker has officially dumped Harley Quinn (played by Margot Robbie) and cast her out. She makes it official for Gotham (and it's underbelly crime families) by blowing up Ace Chemicals. Without her ""Puddin"", she tries to move forward including taking up roller derby and spending her nights partying at clubs. But she also finds herself a constant target of people she wronged. Some are simple injuries, and others are crime lords who take advantage of that Joker is no longer protecting her.At the same time, a young girl Cassandra (played by Ella Jay Basco) ends up pickpocketing a diamond that has a large bank account number imprinted. She too becomes a target from a lot of people, not no one more then local crime lord Roman Sionis/Black Mas (played by Ewan McGregor). He succeeds in capturing Harley Quinn, but she makes a deal for him to spar her if she can find Cassandra. When she does locate Cassandra, she has already swallowed the diamond. Harley not only takes the position to protect her, but she also gets help from other women, Huntress (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Black Canary (played by Jurnee Smollett-Bell), and detective. Renee Montoya (played by Rosie Perez).For a movie called Birds of Prey, it sure does focus a lot on Harley Quinn. To be fair, Margot Robbie is still pulling in all the right punches to play this character. The movie does go into her background as a former psychologist and uses it to her advantage when dealing with Cassandra or Black Mask. That might explain why most of the marketing has been on her and not on the other women.Because of this, the movie takes a while to get going as some of the other Birds of Prey don't come in for at least twenty-five minutes. They don't even get together as a team until towards the final act. But because the movie puts most of the focus on Harley Quinn, you don't much of a chance to know a lot of the other heroes. I would have loved to know more about Huntress or Black Canary. They're played by phenomenal actresses and could have potential. One of the bigger highlights is Ewan McGregor who is having a blast as this gangster who seems more like an evil fashion critic.I have to give Birds of Prey credit for at least having a nice looking production. Director Cathy Yan knows how to set up a world that's just as colorful as Harley Quinn's attitude. The sets from Black Mask's lair to the funhouse where a major fight happens, does leave a bigger impression then I expected. I'd say the film is still entertaining if your willing to except it's more of a Harley Quinn movie then a Birds of Prey movie. I think most audiences will be more forgiving of that then anything.I'll give this six Harley Quinns out of ten. If the movie did make a mistake, was that it went for the R rating, despite Suicide Squad being a PG-13. I can't say there's a lot to justify the R rating other then more language, the movie is worth a rental or stream. I just can't go crazy enough to recommend it for a theatrical release.",Birds of Prey
114,Holt344,"Birds of Prey a Harley Quinn film makes use of its R-Rating perfectly, it's entertaining and well cast - My Ultimate Review",8,29 May 2021,"Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) is directed by Cathy Yan and written by Christina Hodson. The film follows Harley Quinn who after breaking up with the Joker is threatened by Gotham City crime lord Roman Sionis aka Black Mask. She joins forces with Helena Bertinelli, Dinah Lance and Renee Montoya (who go on to form the Birds of Prey) to save Cassandra Cain. I wouldn't call this film to be based on Birds of Prey as it is a Harley Quinn film, one of the founding members (Oracle/Batgirl) isn't even in the film and Cassandra Cain is an entirely different version than the Cassandra Cain from the comics and other media. I'll admit that I'm not the biggest fan of the screenplay, mostly because how they wrote some of the characters but the parts of the screenplay that I liked was simply great. Christina Hodson is a good writer but I think the characters doesn't fit into Harley Quinn, but in another way they work because how everyone is in the same situation, maybe it's because I'm a fan of the source material but it would have been better for a Harley Quinn film to be about Gotham City Sirens and make Birds of Prey a standalone film as these characters are great and well cast. The cast for every single hero/villain is perfect. Christina also nailed the comedic part of the screenplay. The critics criticized the screenplay but I feel like they criticized it too much. Let's talk about the pacing, in my opinion it's fitting for the character and that means perfect. I would have wanted it to be longer though so the Birds of Prey characters would get more screen time. Birds of Prey has some of my favorite superheroes so when I watched this film at the cinema I had huge expectations, whilst they were met, I wanted more out of it but we can still hope for a sequel (true Birds of Prey film) Huntress is far my favorite character in the film, if we are talking outside Harley Quinn and I wanted her to have more screen time, same with Black Canary.Cathy Yan's direction is impressive, stylish and simply amazing. She works well with the crew and seem like she loves the characters and the DC property, I can't find anything bad with her work on this film. Visually speaking, she got down into the psych of Harleen and that's something the comics often do. I'm grateful she got the visual storytelling down. The action and fight sequences are stylish, entertaining and well choreographed. I don't know how much of the stunts Margot Robbie did herself but it feels like a lot. It's one of the highlights of the movie as each are unique and the R-Rating makes it more entertaining, Harley Quinn and violence fits better than her and Joker. The choice of music blends in so well with the choreography.Margot Robbie shows again that she was born to play Harley Quinn, she was one of the highlights of Suicide Squad and her performance in this film is even better and more comic accurate. It's the right direction the character should go. Ewan McGregor plays the villain Roman Sionis / Black Mask who's a brutal and self-obsessed crime lord, he's the head of the Sionis Crime Family. His performance was the one after Margot Robbie's that I simply loved, I like the actor but he nailed the portrayal and succeeded in making it original and entertaining. Let me quote Harley Quinn ""You are so cool"" Mary Elizabeth Winstead's performance as Helena Bertinelli / The Huntress is cool and amazing. As I wrote before in my review, the casting is right for every single actor and Mary was rightfully cast, she does the character justice. Jurnee Smollett-Bell's performance as Dinah Lance / Black Canary is perfect, she successfully made Dinah her own whilst keeping the character familiar to fans, I liked how she took inspiration out of Injustice 2 as the fight style and her Canary Cry is a big part of the character. Rosie Perez is great as Renee Montoya. Chris Messina's performance as Victor Zsasz is a fresh take on the serial killer but the original take on the character works well with the story and universe that they got going on.Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) is entertaining from start to finish that makes use of the R-Rating in a great way. If you're fan of Harley Quinn then you will absolutely love this film, also for fans of Birds of Prey but don't expect it to be about those characters as the story is Harley Quinn's. Having watched this twice and probably more to come, I can say that I still find it very stylish and entertaining, you see the love the creators out into it. I want to praise Margot Robbie for two things, first her enthusiasm for the character and second is her performance. I'm sure we will get a Gotham City Sirens movie sometime in the future as we need Poison Ivy and their relationship.",Birds of Prey

After breaking up with the Joker, Harley teams up with Helena Bertinelli/The Huntress(Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Dinah Lance/Black Canary(Jurnee Smollett-Bell) & Renee Montoya(Rosie Perez), to protect a young girl named Cassandra Cain(Ella Jay Basco), from malevolent crime kingpin Roman Sionis(Ewan McGregor) & sinister assassin Victor Zsasz(Chris Messina).Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn is a fantastic film. Director Cathy Yan has finally given us an anti-hero movie we deserve, after the slightly disappointing Suicide Squad(2016). Harley Quinn who is undoubtedly the best part of the 2016 super villain team-up film, is front & center this time around. The R-rating definitely helps. Now, there are no compromises made to the action set pieces. The action set pieces are jaw-dropping. The comedic scenes will leave you guffawing. The visual effects are flawless. The prologue is unique & hilarious. Margot Robbie is the star of the show, as Harley Quinn. Robbie portrays various emotions with ease & grace & definitely deserves to be one of the key players of the DC Extended Universe, going forward. Rosie Perez is great as Renee Montoya. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is brilliant as Helena Bertinelli/The Huntress. Jurnee Smollett-Bell is outstanding as Dinah Lance/Black Canary. Ewan McGregor is having the time of his life, as the deplorable yet deliciously evil, Roman Sionis. Ella Jay Basco is amazing as Cassandra Cain. Chris Messina is superb as Victor Zsasz.

118,bankofmarquis,Better than SUICIDE SQUAD,7,12 February 2020,"Did you catch the 2016 DCEU disappointment SUICIDE SQUAD with Will Smith as Deadshot and Jared Leto as the Joker? Many people (myself included) thought that that film was ""just fine, nothing special"" but were impressed with the way Margot Robbie handled the Harley Quinn character and wished for a standalone film that featured the Harley Quinn character.Be careful what you wish for.BIRDS OF PREY (AND THE FANTABULOUS EMANCIPATION OF ONE HARLEY QUINN) is the answer to that wish and while it is slightly better than SUICIDE SQUAD, it still isn't all that....well...Fantabulous... of a film.BIRDS OF PREY (which I hear is now being relabeled HARLEY QUINN: BIRDS OF PREY) is produced by Margot Robbie's production company and features an all female lead cast (the villain is a male) and a female Writer and a female Director. Consequently, this is a ""female empowerment"" film where the self-described ""tough chicks"" band together to defeat the male villain.I applaud the effort and the idea behind the movie, but as a film, this one didn't quite work for me.I start with the main focus of this film - Harley Quinn. This is just not a character, I discovered, that I want to spend an entire film with. She is, at it turns out, a very good SUPPORTING character, but not one that is interesting enough (at least for me) to carry a whole movie. I will give Margot Robbie credit...her interpretation of the character is interesting and that performance kept me focused throughout.The other Birds of Prey are just as interesting. For the first time in I can't tell you, Rosie Perez did not annoy me in her role. She played earnest, frustrated Police Officer Renee Montoya and I found myself rooting for her when she was on the screen. Same goes for Jurnee Smollett-Bell's interpretation of Black Canary a character I knew very little about and was intrigued (though her ""Super Power"" was suddenly sprung on the audience with very little foreshadowing - foreshadowing that could have helped). And, finally, Mary Elizabeth Winstead almost steals the film as the revenge-seeking Huntress, a character I really enjoyed and hope I see again (though, I'm learning my lesson - let it be as a supporting character in another film and not her own, standalone film).So, this film has 4 interesting characters at the top, but the issue is that they don't come together as a team until VERY late in the film (in a finale showdown that was the highlight of the film for me), so I really couldn't tell if there was any chemistry between these characters/actresses. I think there MIGHT have been, but no real sample size to tell.Fairing less well as a character was Ewan McGregor's one-note take on super-narcissistic Roman Sionis/Black Mask. The character was pretty much in front of you at the start of the film and was still the same one-note character at the end. Also not ""doing it for me"" was Ella Jay Basco as Cassandra Cain, the street kid that becomes the focal point of the bad guys in the film (and the character the Birds of Prey must band together to save). I didn't much care for this character - or the performance - so I had no real emotional investment in whether or not the Birds of Prey could save her.The Direction by Cathy Yan is professional and competent and the final showdown does show signs of originality and brilliance. I'll give her credit, she caught my attention with the last 1/2 hour of this film - much more so than she did with the first 79 minutes.A better effort at this type of anti-hero comic book adventure (certainly better than SUICIDE SQUAD) but the DCEU still has not stuck the landing on this.I encourage them to keep trying.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Birds of Prey

Would the Joke even allow such a thing?Complete mess of a story and I honestly can't see why Margot Robbie even signed up for this and then is reluctant to reprise the role in the remake of Suicide Squad.Not funny, actually I tell a lie because in places it is but because of the fact one second she's wearing trainers (sneakers) and the next in high heels boots.Seriously for all of the hype and money thrown to advertise this clanger don't waste yours.Is that why they made the full title of the film 'Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn' so people have an idea of just how appalling this film is.Sorry but it certainly doesn't rattle my bird cage.Rating 5 out of 10",Birds of Prey
122,abisio,Forget the seriousness and enjoy two hours of fun,9,7 February 2020,"Comic lovers are usually fanatics. They try their imagination to be in the movie and it is not always possible for many reasons.
I read lots of comic. Some of them become complete different movies. Both were acceptable aside for the differences.
Margo Robbie comes back as Harley Quinn, Jokers girlfriend; but spite the familiarity and relation of these characters do not expect social / psychological drama like JOKER. This is a dark comedy!!!. Yes there are some embedded messages about ""machismo"" and all men are betrayers (in fact every men in the movie betrays somebody and the main bad guy is gay. Women on the other side, help each other unconditionally.
The story is a back and forth mess mixed with cartoons, inserted graphics and Harley talking to the audience; everything looking for a comic effect that mostly succeed.
At the end is basically a satire about comic and superheroes (or supervillains) loaded with almost non stop burst of absurd and/or strong violence, mostly bloodless and absolutely sexless (violence good sex bad, Hollywood culture).
The movie is kinetic enough to keep your attention.
Robbie and Ewan McGregor (as the apparently gay villain) deliver performances switching from scary to comedy or drama with incredible ease. Perhaps are no Oscar worthy but are quite solid.
Jurnee Smollett-Bell does a very good physical character. I believe is somebody to follow.
Rosie Perez looks lost and no happy. I do not understand why. Mary Elizabeth Winstead has a few comic moments but her character is very underwritten. Rest of the characters are mostly stunt doubles.It is important to mention that there is a substantial stunt work making even the most absurd scenes believable. It is fresh air over Disney mostly digitally animated Marvel sagas.In brief; not Oscar worthy but plenty of fun",Birds of Prey
123,bob-the-movie-man,A lot of squawking birds,6,15 February 2020,"Although not saying much, Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn was one of the best thing in the lacklustre D.C. outing ""Suicide Squad"" of 2016. Now, she returns in her own vehicle. Jared Leto's Joker is a thing of the past (clearly he wasn't keen on dredging up the past for even a cameo in this one).Harley had spent years building up a catalog of enemies in Gotham, with no-one daring to lift a finger for fear of ""the big J's"" retribution. With that now a thing of the past, the streets are no longer safe for Harley. Whereas most characters have a reason to want to kill Harley, mid-level gangster Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor) has a list as long as his arm (a blurred list that will probably make freeze-framing of the blu-ray entertaining!). Roman, who has a penchant for having his right-hand man Victor (Chris Messina) de-glove his victim's faces, has his heart set on obtaining a missing diamond that (McGuffin-alert) is engraved with account details to $billions.Through a convoluted and messy plot, Harley meets various 'birds of prey' who are either friend or foe: notably young pickpocket Cassandra (Ella Jay Basco); cop Renée Montoya (Rosie Perez); the ""Crossbow Killer"" (Mary Elizabeth Winstead); and the ""Black Canary"" (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), who you don't want to let near your best glasses.As you might expect from your knowledge of Harley Quinn's character, the movie is crazy, with periodic breaking of the 4th wall; much acrobatic kick-boxing; and some random dream sequences..... Robbie as Marilyn is particularly entertaining, although at times (the 'egg sandwich' sequence in particular) the gurning made me muse to myself about just what a good film ""I, Tonya"" was.It all comes across as something of a ""Deadpool"" sequel. Actually, I'd more describe it as ""Deadpool-lite"" since it's not powered here by the charisma of Ryan Reynolds. However, I did find myself quite enjoying the first reel of the movie.Unfortunately, it didn't last.It all just becomes incredibly tiresome. Although Margot Robbie is very good in the role, Harley's incessant squawking just gets annoying.Also in this battle of men vs women, the women always win and are (mostly) completely unscathed. In one particular scene there are 5 or 6 burly men taking on Harley: clearly she whips their sorry asses in improbable fashion. What? Only one at a time guys?If you were confused by the timeline of ""Little Women"", this will blow your mind! It makes Greta Gerwig's masterpiece look as linear as ""News at Ten""! It's really difficult to follow at times as the timeline flashes forwards and backwards and sideways at random!Also confusing (for me anyway... did I have a nap?) was the finale. There's something to do with a ring which made NO SENSE to me at all? Am I alone in that?Ewan MacGregor has fun with his role as the gay (I assume?) gangster, but it all turns cartoonish at times. But perhaps, that's the point? However while the violence in ""Deadpool"" was cartoonishly funny (as in Tom and Jerry) the violence here is decidedly of the vicious and unpleasant variety, with a vindictive edge. It makes you not particularly like any of the movie's characters.The movie is written by Christina Hodson, who is slated to write too more upcoming superhero films: ""The Flash"" and ""Batgirl"". The director is Chinese director Cathy Yan in only her second directorial feature.Summary: It's loud and brash and at 109 minutes it overstays its welcome by about 20 minutes. Less would have been more. It's somewhat better than ""Suicide Squad"" (which I unfathomably seem to have given 2.5 stars to), but it's still a movie that I will struggle to remember in a month's time.",Birds of Prey
124,kjproulx,A Blast with Many Missed Opportunities,7,7 February 2020,"To say films based on DC Comics have been all over the place over the last few years would be an understatement. Yes, they seem to have found their footing with films like Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Shazam!, and they even have a new series of Batman films on the way, but were these just a fluke? No, Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn (a title that I'll only write in full once during this review) absolutely continues their streak of quality content for this genre, even though there were quite a few missed opportunities. Here's why this film is a blast to watch, even with its faults.Picking up after the events of Suicide Squad, but also kind of throwing away everything that happened in it, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) finds herself broken off from the Joker and on her own for the first time in a while. Becoming involved with a young girl who gets her hands on a diamond that evil villain Roman Sionis will do anything to retrieve, she finds herself a new friend. The first two acts of this film, however, are really just a set-up for a new crew for her to join. The third act of this movie is fantastic, which brings me to my biggest complaint.This film is called Birds of Prey, but the actual team that the title is referring to doesn't form until the film's third act, which was a real bummer. The majority of this movie is all about Harley Quinn, which is fine because Margot Robbie is terrific as this character, but this movie felt like too much of a good thing at times. She was easily the best part about Suicide Squad, but I now believe she works best in an ensemble. Her performance here is great, but she needed more people to play off of. This is the reason the end of this film is so great, which also made the rest of the movie slightly hollow for me.Switching back over to the positive side, which this movie has much more of than negatives, I would be remiss if I didn't mention Ewan McGregor as Roman Sionis. This performance made the movie for me. Yes, Jurnee Smollett-Bell and Mary Elizabeth Winstead are great supporting actresses and I really hope they further their stories in future films, but McGregor is probably the most memorable part to me. His hammy performance had me laughing on multiple occasions. If this was the second film in the Birds of Prey series and he was the only villain, playing off this group of women, it probably would've been one of the best comic book movies to date, but these elements weren't utilized together enough for me.In the end, Birds of Prey is undeniably a lot of fun. Margot Robbie is wonderful once again, Smollet-Bell and Winstead steal the show in a few instances (which I wanted more of), and Cathy Yan does a terrific job helming as director. Being her first big film, I'm very impressed with her work here and I hope she gets to do a sequel to this because I will gladly spend another two hours with these characters. While not everything in this movie worked for me, quite a bit of it did, especially the third act, which has the perfect location to take place in. I really enjoyed watching Birds of Prey, even though I didn't think it was perfect.",Birds of Prey
125,kuarinofu,The best film about women kicking men in years (JK),7,22 March 2020,"This movie is 30% confusion and 70% women kicking evil men.It's like a bad 90ties early attempt on a superhero film, but with well-shot (yet slowly becoming tedious) action plus some nice production quality.It's also overwhelmingly violent and vulgar, and I'm not sure why.Robbie's great in this and she's having fun, everyone else is just chewing the scenery. I mean, I'm not sure how I would've acted when asked to deliver lines this stupid. Ewan McGregor's talents are wasted in this one, but it looks like he didn't care in the first place.The script is both needlessly convoluted and incredibly shallow. They also try artistic editing to give the film the Deadpool look but it didn't feel necessary at all.The film lost me around the third act, while the action was good and was shot well, I just had no reason to care for the characters. Action is pointless when you're not invested in the story.This film is great for women who just left their abusive relationship and want to see some men get beaten to relieve some stress (hammer to the groin included!)Loved Robbie, the action and some good original tracks.I didn't like anything else. Not a horrible film, but very flawed. I still appreciate the good things in this, even with all the man-hating stuff.P.S.

There's a lot to like here, and the DC world now has a lot of female heroes on the mix. It was nice to see Black Mask, but that mask was bad. McGregor was much more villainous without the mask.

My Rating 9/10
DC Comic hero or heroine movies even if MA15+ are not my usual movie preference but I'd go and see any movie that Margot Robbie is starring in.
I'd read a bit of negative gossip about that this film and that it had been poorly marketed so I left it for a few weeks but what a wonderful surprise.
I loved the Comic/Carnival atmosphere of this movie it reminded me a little of Baz Luhrman's approach of Colour and Action I don't know if Director Cathy Yan was inspired by Moulin Rouge but Bird's of Prey especially in the Roman Sionis Nightclub scenes reminded me of Baz Luhrman.
Yes it does have some violent moments but most are tongue in cheek like Harley 's shoot out scene at Police Headquarters not the conventional high powered assault guns but a pop gun with bullets that explode with confetti.
There are so many reasons I liked Birds of Prey primarily Margo Robbie who I commented recently has that rare quality of having a love affair with the camera lens . As Harley Quinn she glistens and shines her Screen presence is magnetic like Marilyn Monroe who gets a Margo Robbie tribute in this movie .Margo Robbie who is also a Producer of this film gives this once ""significant other "" now The Joker's ex girlfriend a villainous vengeful but absolutely loveable personality . Harley Quinn guides us through her rise to infamy with funny narration and comic book captions which add to the fun . Harley wears fabulous costumes and makeup that reminded me of Cyndy Laupers video for ""Girls Just Wanna have Fun "" maybe an accident but very appropriate for this fun film.
I knew nothing of Harley Quinn or the other many characters of this comic strip but the script by Cristina Hobson which is basically a jewel heist chase tells the audience everything we need to know without previous knowledge plus it's humorous quirky and intelligent .
The ""choreography "" to use an old fashioned term or action scenes are amazing and as an ensemble cast I liked everyone in this film.
The only 2 significant male cast members Ewan McGregor as Roman Sionis the narcissistic ruthless villain and Chris Messina as his sadistic right hand man or BFF as Harley describes him Victor Zsasz are a great partnership.
However it's the women in this film that reign supreme give me Harley's Angels any day over Charlie's Angels they're much more fun and entertaining.
I particularly liked Jurnee Smollett- Bell as Dinah Lanse the Black Canary and Yep, That's Really Jurnee Smollett-Bell Doing Black Canary's Singing in Birds Of Prey. ... Dinah sings a smooth, slow rendition of the famous James Brown song ""It's a Man's Man's Man's World,""
Rosie Perez is also great as Renee Montoya the defective detective who's only mission is to restore law and order to Gotham but is never taken seriously by her superiors. Ellen Joy Basco as pickpocket Cassandra Cain and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as the sole Bertinelli family survivor and now The Huntress are both impressive in Birds of Prey.
I'm pleased to read although initially Box office takings on this film was not as impressive as expected Birds of Prey which was estimated to cost USD 84,500,000 had already nearly doubled its cost World wide at USD 145,618,302 hopefully that will mean the team of Harley's Angels may return for another Crazy romp.
If you expect the Drama and darkness of the recent wonderful DC Joker with Joaquin Phoenix ( although I'd love to see Joaquin and Margo together in a film ) you won't find it in Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn but if like me you enjoy an entertaining ,movie with fantastic sets and visuals and most importantly great ensemble cast and plot you just might enjoy this film.",Birds of Prey

131,msbreviews,Birds of Prey continues DCEU's streak of fun and entertaining (generic) flicks.,6,7 February 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Since Wonder Woman that the DCEU has not missed a beat. Even though the latter is still my favorite of the universe, I have mostly a positive opinion about Justice League, Aquaman, and Shazam! Yes, these are not the greatest comic-book movies of all-time, but I would be lying if I denied that I was entertained. Birds of Prey follows the same path: it's fun, action-heavy, and it boasts a phenomenal cast. It has some issues regarding the actual plot and a few characters, but I'll get there.First of all, let me get the mandatory compliments to Margot Robbie's performance out of the way. If there's a DC character better than Harley Quinn for Robbie to portray, please let me know, because I think she's absolutely perfect as a lunatic, over-the-top psychiatrist-turned-psychopath. Suicide Squad might be a total mess, but I doubt anyone denies how Robbie fits seamlessly into the Harley persona. From her looks to the way she speaks and from her physical movement to her facial expressions, there's just no better casting.She embodies the whole film's chaotic vibe and even contributes to the (very) colorful set design. However, she's not the only one who delivers a spectacular performance. Jurnee Smollett-Bell offers a surprisingly captivating display as Dinah Lance / Black Canary. Even though Harley Quinn is the main character, I found myself caring a lot about Dinah. Her way of living suits the character's personality like a glove, and she's undoubtedly the best-written secondary character of the movie. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the others, and this is one of my biggest issues.It's a film packed with cliches and attempts of making the characters aware of those cliches, which is also, well, something pretty overused. What's more generic? Having the bad guy telling the hero their masterplan or having the hero stating how the bad guy is incredibly dumb by thinking of doing that? At first, I laughed, and I thought it was funny the way Christina Hodson was avoiding to write straight-up cliche characters by making everyone else aware of the way these talk or move.But the whole ""I know you're cliche, so you can get away with saying or doing cliche things"" only works for a couple of scenes, not an entire movie. This is why I wasn't able to connect with Renee Montoya or care about her narrative at all. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is one of my favorite actresses, but she has the least screentime of the entire cast. I never criticize a film for not giving an actor/actress I like a more important role (unlike other people, I believe it would be unfair to do so). Still, I do complain if I think a particular character should have been given more screentime, which is the case of Huntress.I find her backstory way more exciting and emotionally investing than Rosie Perez's character, but sadly Huntress' personal story serves only as a not-that-surprising third act twist. There are several past-present transitions in the storytelling, most work, but some feel extremely abrupt. Nevertheless, Winstead is outstanding every single time she's on camera! Ewan Mcgregor offers a good performance as the villain, but he leads me to my other major issue: the central plot. Trivia time: a MacGuffin is an object, device, or event necessary to the narrative and the motivation of the characters, but insignificant, unimportant, or irrelevant in itself.The thread that connects every single character is based on one of the most overused MacGuffins ever. Now, don't get me wrong: a MacGuffin is NOT a synonym of bad writing or of a bad plot! It's merely something that leads to nothing. Having in mind that Birds of Prey is a character-driven movie, a plot centered around a MacGuffin is not unusual. As long as every character works, the primary story can simply be a passenger (Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood applies this method). However, in Birds of Prey, not every character has an interesting story...Basically, Christina Hodson's screenplay isn't exactly bad, but it isn't great too. Just like the film, it has its ups and downs, and I saved some of the ups for last because I do want to end this review on a positive note. Finally, a DCEU movie where the action isn't overwhelmed with CGI, but with detailed choreography and long takes instead! Thank you, Cathy Yan, for bringing some of the best action sequences in this universe. Even if the third act gets a little sloppy due to the amount of characters, it's still a very satisfying ending. The score beautifully accompanies the action, and the visuals are truly gorgeous to look at. The comedy bits are on-point, I laughed quite often, but my final remark goes to a topic I rarely address...Birds of Prey is a filmmaking lesson on how to produce an incredibly diverse movie without it feeling forced or unnatural. Only AFTER leaving the theater, I acknowledged the fact that the cast and characters are from various races, cultures, and have different sexual preferences. Why? Because this film doesn't waste its runtime by having its characters mention how black, white, Latinas, Chinese, gay, or whatever they are. They simply are what they are, and we all have eyes to see them. Congrats to Yan, Hodson, and everyone else who decided to treat the characters as if they're humans like every one of us.In the end, Birds of Prey (and the ridiculously long subtitle) continues DCEU's streak of (at least) good movies since Wonder Woman came out. With a phenomenal cast led by an outstanding Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Cathy Yan delivers some of the best action of the entire universe in a genuinely entertaining superhero flick. A colorful, chaotic, and fun vibe is present throughout the whole runtime, as well as a pretty neat score. However, Christina Hodson's screenplay lacks creativity. The main plot revolves around the most overused MacGuffin ever, and some characters are straight-up taken from the book of cliches. It's a generic comic-book film with a formulaic narrative, but one that possesses enough fun and entertainment to overlook the typical story.Rating: B-",Birds of Prey

135,SoumikBanerjee25,No One Can Play Harley Better Than Margot Robbie! No One.,8,9 July 2020,"'Birds of Prey' is a perfect example of how one should make an Action-Comedy. It packs enough humour alongside some pretty great action and a bunch load of scenes with Harley Quinn just being herself; frankly can't ask for more.Cathy Yan, the director did a phenomenal job balancing the tonality of the film. She created a perfect blend where the Action or the Comedy never cuts each other much and one can definitely enjoy both the aspects equally well.Cinematography and the Sound score both played major parts and certainly improved the overall execution on the plate. And I must mention how well structured the screenplay is and how much the quirky editing helped in regards of the prefixed vibe. The movie moves with Harley Quinn's Narration. As we all know her character is a nutjob so the technicalities were similarly chosen keeping that perspective in mind. Great job on that!Now moving on to the performances.
Man oh Man! Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn Is unbeatable. She is just perfect for the role. I couldn't even imagine anyone but her playing such psychotic yet complexed character. Her eyes, posture, way of delivering dialogues; she got herself so deep into this particular role that is discernible via her hardwork and dedication both on and off the screen. The others characters were decent but a lack of attentiveness towards them and their individual backstories resulted in just an okayish representation of the same. Ewan McGregor as Black Mask has done real good and I really wanted to see him getting his due back by each of the protagonists by the end! That could have been the perfect climax. Alas! That wasn't too be. It ended rather quickly!Is it Insane? Yeah. Is it Quirky and over the top perhaps? Yeah Definitely; but that's how a movie based upon 'Harleen Quinzel aka Harley Quinn' should be. One of the best coming from DC for sure!Highly recommended.",Birds of Prey
136,0w0,Why give a completely unknown director a 100million budget movie?,4,23 March 2020,"Never heard of this director ""Cathy Yan"" before so I checked out her filmography and to my shock, she's only ever made 1 movie (and it was a bad one)... so WHY would you give a director like this 100million dollars? It just doesn't make any sense... 'DC Films' HAD to know that they were making a very stupid decision... Hell, if DC Films gave ME 100million dollars, I can garuantee you that I could have made a better film for them, than this unknown director did.Example: You know who were the 3 most appealing characters in the Suicide Squad movie? #1. Killer Croc. #2. Joker. #3. Enchantress. And the most hilarious thing is that this movie doesn't feature ANY of those characters... yet despite that fact, the word 'Joker' is probably said over 50 times in this movie... If you're going to mention a character 50 times, but not include them in the movie, then you know you've made a mistake.This movie is also hilariously unrealistic: In one scene, Harley and a little girl are standing about 2meters away from 3 guys each shooting with submachine guns, and yet somehow Harley and the girl don't get hit by a single bullet... how could that ever be considered realistic?And in another scene Harley knocks somebody unconscious by throwing a mobile phone against their head... how's it possible? A phone weighs like 200grams, and it's impossible to knock somebody out with just 200grams.In summary: The movie is scatter brained and the characters are unmemorable, and no matter how Margot tries, the weight of carrying this entire movie on her own is simply too much, and her back gives out from the strain way before the half-way point in this movie...",Birds of Prey
137,mfellipecampos,Good,7,10 February 2020,"As for the female cast, Rosie Perez surprises as Renée Montoya and brings a character whose reality practically does not change from beginning to end: she starts the film trying to overcome the machismo of the police and ends up failing, but what changes is her look at these problems and that's what matters, after all. In fact, the whole team goes through this change of look: Canário goes against the abusive environment that his boss, Roman ""Black Mask"" (interpreted in a very caricatural way by Ewan McGregor), provides; Huntress guarantees her means of achieving what she most longs for and then sees that her final plan was just the beginning of something much bigger; and Cassandra Cain finds strength in a place she never expected - but she is, by far, the least worked character among the five women. The Hunter of Mary Elizabeth Winstead definitely deserved more space for having the motivation more linked to Victor Zsasz (Chris Messina) and Roman, but any and every scene in which she appears (whether current or flashback) makes every second count.A month ago, the Brazilian voice actress she gave life to the character and DC fans always asked for her in the works ... now I'm going to talk about the new voice actress from the Brazilian Harlequin Evie Saide she has a very similar voice from Iara and it was her first job and I found her voice acting not I would say neither bad nor good anymore I liked it and I hope she finds a perfect voice for the character!",Birds of Prey
138,MrDHWong,"A fast-paced, violent, and sometimes disjointed follow-up with varying degrees of entertainment value",7,6 February 2020,"Birds Of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) is a superhero film based on the DC Comics team of the same name and a sequel/spin-off to 2016's Suicide Squad. Starring Margot Robbie in the lead role as Harley Quinn, it is a fast-paced, violent, and sometimes disjointed follow-up with varying degrees of entertainment value.Sometime after the events of Suicide Squad, the Joker and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) have since ended their relationship, resulting in the latter being forced to fend for herself out on the streets of Gotham City. After spending a night at a fancy club, Harley attracts the attention of its owner Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor), a sadistic crime lord who holds a high position of power over the entire city. In exchange for her life, Roman tasks Harley with tracking down a young girl named Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco), who has pickpocketed an important diamond containing crucial information that will further his influence. Upon finding Cassandra, Harley decides that the two of them should team up with fellow heroes Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez), and Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) to defeat Roman and finally bring an end to his reign of terror.With a noticeably more grounded approach to its source material, Birds of Prey is an exhausting but fun improvement over its predecessor in more ways than less, despite displaying some of the same issues. Unlike the preceding film, this one feels free from the confines of a PG-13 rating and ups the ante with its frequent use of strong violence and swearing. I can't help but feel that Suicide Squad would have been a better film had it taken this approach instead of playing it safe. By making Harley Quinn the sole main character, the film at least has one person to guide the audience through the story as opposed to multiple people each dealing with their own individual problems. With that said, the film attempts to implement Harley's anarchic mindset into its storytelling throughout the first and second acts, which proves problematic when trying to establish what her motivations are and why we should care at all. I do understand that Harley is supposed to be a mentally broken person with an unpredictable streak, but I felt that this did not gel well in the film's favour, as it only ends up making it seem more unsure of itself, overwhelming the viewer in the process. In spite of this, it is still nonetheless interesting to see inside the head of such an iconic character and watching how she deals with a breakup in her own unique ways.Director Cathy Yan continues Suicide Squad's style of brightly-coloured set pieces and a matching frenetic soundtrack to show off a more wild side to Gotham City we don't often get to see. This approach gives the film an almost music-video type feeling, especially with its song choices. For example, one scene features ""Black Betty"" as covered by the Australian hard rock band Spiderbait as Harley fights her way through multiple hired goons in a police station. It is highly likely that Margot Robbie, being an Aussie herself, chose this rendition of the song as it suits the scene better than the original. Moments like this show how Yan and Robbie must have gotten on so well during filming, especially since the latter is also credited as an executive producer.Even though Suicide Squad was poorly received by many, myself included, most will agree that Margot Robbie's performance as Harley Quinn was a major highlight (even earning praise from the character's co-creator Paul Dini) and the same can be said about this outing. There is plenty to enjoy in seeing Harley wreak havoc upon members of Gotham's crime syndicate with little care for the enemies she is making in the process. Robbie brings that much needed spark of madness to her character, constantly reminding the audience that she is still technically a villain in spite of her attempts at a good deed. In addition to this, Ewan McGregor is quite jarring to watch as the film's main antagonist, considering this is one of the rare times he has played a bad guy. Unfortunately, I feel that the remaining members of the titular Birds of Prey were somewhat underused, not leaving much of an impression until the final act. If a sequel is ever greenlit, hopefully they will be given more screen-time.In conclusion, while the film doesn't break too much new ground for the DC Extended Universe, fans of Harley Quinn and Robbie's performance should be greatly entertained. However, anyone who hated Suicide Squad will likely feel the same way about this film, as apart from the addition of graphic violence and profanity, there is not much else new worth recommending that would change their minds. While not quite a post-credits scene, there is a small amusing Easter egg that those who chose to stay back may smile at.I rate it 6.5/10",Birds of Prey
139,Alexander_Blanchett,Better than the trailer made it look like,7,24 May 2020,"Better than I expected but there is still lots of room for improvement for DC Films if you compare them to Marvel. Still ist a step Forward. The film is entertaining becuase it doesnt take itself too seriously, and especially the anti hero character of Harley Quinn is built up well. But just like with the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" Franchise with Jack Sparrow for example, the filmmakers can be happy to have that charater there because the other ones would make a bland film. Mostly thanks to the Fresh Performance by Margot Robbie, the film really has many memorable Moments. Ewan McGregor was okay as the villain (tho Arent most of them actually viallains? ) however exagerrated a Little bit at times. Of the other Girls Rosie Perez was the best one, while I wasnt a big fan of Mary Elizabeth Weinstein who had a cool character but played it in a very boring and unintersting way.

Margot Robbie lends her considerable star power to this but does herself no favor here. It's directed by Cathy Yan who's only directed one other film, ""Dead Pigs"" which was only released in China with a $4k box office take - an abject failure, so how do expect this Harley Quinn film to be any good at all? You can't, it was doomed the moment Cathy was selected to direct. Harley's hard NY/Brooklyn accent is just grating, annoying and her referencing ""The Joker"" as ""Mr J"" constantly is also annoying. The fight scenes bordered on comical, and it wouldn't have surprised me to have seen graphics with ""Pow!"" and ""Zoink!"" thrown in. This could've and should've been so much better, but it's DC not Marvel, again, what can you expect?",Birds of Prey

The rest of the Birds of Prey are good for the most part, if lacking in character development. Some of the writing and dialogue is shoddy at times, but Harley's unique fragmented storytelling makes up for some of this.The balls-to-the-wall action is cartoonish to say the least, but it definitely fits the character and world.

143,CANpatbuck3664,"Completely Bizarre Yet Stylish and Well Acted , DC Goes All Out With Birds of Prey",9,7 February 2020,"Some movies decide to bring you along slowly, they setup the plot and bring you in by introducing you to the key players. Other movies kick the door open and grab you to take you along for the ride. Birds of Prey is decidedly one of the latter cases. We begin with an animated intro being narrated by Harley (Margot Robbie) where the audience is showered with cursing, violence and frenetic jokes. This was disarming for me and it helped me start laughing right off the bat. Its an odd choice to be sure but this isn't a movie that's ashamed or trying to hide what it is and I respected that choice. It also introduces the visual sensibility of the movie. It borrows from Suicide Squad but they do a good job cherry picking what worked from that movie and they leave behind the less desirable parts. The character cards are back with a couple of twists and the world is decidedly grimy and less glamorous which was a nice change of setting.My favourite aspect of the movie was the script, there's enough story to establish stakes and provide our characters with a common goal. Then the roller coaster picks up speed and we hit the ground running. The dialogue is quick and full of moments that left me chuckling or outright laughing, the emphasis is on a more realistic endgame instead of the end of the world (something that I've been beating a drum about whenever we get a superhero film) and the character intros have a nice mix of cool backstory but they take the time to show us what they're capable of and what they're about. It perfectly embodies Harley's nature (crazy, funny but you can't turn away) and screenwriter Christina Hodson deserves more kudos for her work.There are serious moments in Birds of Prey but there's more emphasis on the action and comedy. The action scenes here are memorable and they hold their own despite this not being a top dollar budget kind of blockbuster (the budget is still high at around 85 million but when you put that up against the Avengers movies, doesn't seem so big eh?). They aren't carbon copies, there's a dream sequence that's part action setpiece and musical number that felt like somebody slipped me something and the scene in the police station is so unconventional because they weave the narrative structure into how the scene plays out. They kept me engaged and it was also nice to be dealing with heroes that didn't have to rely on super powers and could really hold their own based on physical prowess.As much as this is pitched as an ensemble (it really isn't but I digress) Robbie is the star of the show and she proves that her fan favourite work in Suicide Squad wasn't a fluke. This isn't a dignified or glamorous role, much like her work as Tonya Harding, she gets into the uglier side of the character. Harley's really fun for a few seconds and then she'll do something disappointing or shocking and because of Robbie's work, she becomes a more well rounded character. She captures Harley's enigmatic nature and this is a triumph for her. If there's someone who really caught my attention other than our lead it was Jurnee Smollett-Bell as Black Canary. She not only looked the part but she had the tough attitude and the vulnerability all wrapped up into one. I had only seen her in Temptation (which I also liked her in but the movie sucked overall) but she was excellent here and I hope we get to see more of her again in this role soon. Rosie Perez and Mary Elizabeth Winstead were both solid, they were the supporting players in the crew but they each got their moments (more on Winstead later). I was so sure going in I was going to hate Cassandra Cain as a character but Ella Jay Basco hit the right notes and I thought she worked well with the rest of the cast. Kid characters get annoying fast when they're not done right and she was a good addition to this group. I want to credit Chris Messina as a pitch perfect Victor Zsasz but I also have to talk about our antagonist Roman Sionis played by Ewan McGregor. This is a weird performance by Ewan, he's so off-kilter and his tone changes from scene to scene. He's a great actor and he won me over but I had a hard time getting a handle on what he was trying to do. But I still think he did a good job overall.The strengths of Birds of Prey shine so brightly that it helped me look past a couple of things that bothered me. The movie does start to lose a little momentum at the 3/4 point, its pace had been very frenetic and breezy but when the emotional stakes come in, they hit the breaks a little too hard. I liked the character of Huntress and Winstead's performance but we could have used more time with her, she could almost have been cut out of the movie. I also didn't like the score, the musical choices were very obvious and while I like that style of music, the movie featuring so many classic rock/pop hits made the music feel more generic next to the rest of the movie.This movie isn't a perfect package and while I did walk away with notes and criticism but I was so happy leaving the theatre. Birds of Prey doesn't just break away from the rest of the DC Universe, it blazes a brand new trail. It has more in common with Doom Patrol and Deadpool than Batman v Superman or Aquaman and it was so refreshing and unafraid to switch things up. Robbie throws herself into Harley, the plot shifts constantly and keeps you guessing, the action holds up and our heroine's zany humour is not only plentiful but brilliantly successful. As much as Margot deserves credit, Prey's MVP is screenwriter Christina Hodson who delivers a bonkers script that throws curve after curve (along with some solid comedic dialogue) and when paired with Yan's direction, Birds of Prey is a home run. Purists may have issues with the representation of a couple of the characters but I don't have that background. I'm happy to give Birds of Prey an 8.5/10 rounding up to a 9/10. I would absolutely recommend checking this out in the theatre, this kind of entry in the genre is the best way to fight superhero blockbuster fatigue. My message to the executives is that if you want people to keep showing up to see the big comic book movies, we need different and daring films which Birds of Prey is unabashedly so.",Birds of Prey
144,elicopperman,Fantabulously Thrilling,7,24 August 2020,"Ever watched a superhero that felt more like a wacky cartoon? Not to be mean of course, because the DC movie Birds of Prey turned out to be like that. Conceived by Margot Robbie, who played Harley Quinn in DC's most polarizing film to date, Suicide Squad, this film came right the heck out of nowhere and turned out to impress critics, although it didn't seem to win audiences over as much as a certain blue hedgehog did. Now that it's been half a year since its original theatrical run, I have to say. Out of all the DC movies out there, this one might be the most entertaining one of them all...depending on your preference that is.The movie focuses on Harley Quinn as an unprotected vigilante after breaking up with the Joker. Among her enemies, like the narcissistic crime boss Roman Sionis and his right-hand man Victor Zsasz, Quinn becomes allies with three deadly women: Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya, in an effort to save a girl named Cassandra Cain from concealing a special diamond. Conceptually, one can expect the outcome from a mile away, as the story plays out like any other superhero revenge movie on a deadly mission. However, what makes the movie somewhat distinctive is its central theme of female empowerment, as each of the leads have their own reasons for wanting to take vengeance on bad guys. Aside from Harley being hunted by every thug around her, Montoya is a cynical cop who's barely respected for her accomplishments, Huntress has a hit list of all the evil men who ruined her childhood innocence, and Black Canary is practically a toy for Sionis, whom she works for. These motivations are what give the movie a biting edge that other superhero movies are yet to have, and they bite hard.In terms of the tone, that's where the movie is at its most playful, with plenty of wacky shenanigans, stylistic dreamy fantasies and slapstick to make for one hell of a thrill ride. Sure, you also have to suffer through boring villain exposition and the more serious moments can be a little jumbled, but those moments fail to overshadow the excitement this movie elicits. Heck, the movie opens up with a cold opening showing Harley Quinn's origins in animated form produced at WB Animation, which can help recap the events from Suicide Squad to newcomers and just give the viewers thrilling eye candy. In addition to that, most of the acting is delightful, especially with Margot Robbie stealing the show as the charmingly annoying Harley, especially with all the ad-libbing and self aware narration she gives. Ewan McGregor is menacingly over the top as Sionis, Rosie Perez captures Montoya's suspicious behavior well whenever she's in a fit of paranoia, Mary Elizabeth Winstead acts as a good straight-person in the movie's nonsense, and Jurnee Smollet-Bell's sarcasm makes Black Canary a delight to watch.Now with all of that said, if there is one thing that does hold this movie back from being perfect, it's that it plays for somewhat of a niche audience. This isn't to say the average Joe can't go in and watch the movie without having a good time, but considering how much it connects to the DCEU and for how bizarrely cartoony the movie is compared to some of the past installments, it could potentially throw people off who have moved past the days of upbeat wacky superheroes (as well as anger edgy Snyder-verse movies). Plus, if you're more familiar with the comics, then you may be thrown off that the Birds of Prey are overshadowed by Harley Quinn, who didn't even appear then, but again, that depends on your preference. Also, in terms of other complaints, some characters like Cassandra Cain, Ellen Yee and even Zsasz could have used a little more screen time to be at least a little more interesting, since the movie doesn't give them enough attention to be all that noteworthy, especially when one of them is pretty much reduced to a macguffin. Then again, there's always room for sequels, right?Not gonna lie, had it not been for Shazam or even Joker, this might have been the biggest surprise of a DC movie in recent years. While Birds of Prey might not be for everybody, it has enough fun action and comedy, tough characters, thrilling visuals and Margot Robbie to stand on its own. If you're brand new to the live-action DC movies or you're less into comics than you are films, then I recommend giving this flick a watch. Not only is it bad to the bone, but it's probably the most fun I've seen in terms of powerful women movies in quite some time. Who's to say the boys get to have all the fun?",Birds of Prey

146,Azanspy,Dope.,8,22 March 2020,"I really liked Birds of Prey. I don't know why most of the people didn't like it because it's pure entertainment. Margot Robbie just rocked as Harley Quinn again and she proved that she's born to play this one of the best comic book character. Where the movie really wins is that she's not the only one who shined. All other characters like Black Mask, Black Canary, Huntress, Renee Montoya, Cassandra Cain and Victor Zsasz also stole the show and got enough space to shine. Yes, the story lacks some depth but it was not horrible as many people say. It's funny, gory and super entertaining. This is one of the best DCEU movie and DC films are on a good streak. I'm disappointed that this movie didn't make a lot of money in the box office. Overall, BoP is an awesome comic book based movie and a real entertainer. This movie also proves that DCEU is so much different from MCU and they can never make movie like BoP. Waiting for more from like this from DC.",Birds of Prey
147,brett-76260,Kind of a hot mess,3,19 March 2020,It had its moments but overall kind of lame. The martial arts were a joke and the story kept jumping all over the place...too much back in time and actually a little confusing. Overall it's not the worst you can watch but certainly much better choices.,Birds of Prey
148,statuskuo,Too Much Cotton Candy Will Make You Sick,5,8 February 2020,"Dear director Cathy Yan, exactly what was the marching orders when it came to this movie? To out-Schumacher Joel Schumacher?
This movie is as schizophrenic as the lead character Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) straight after a breakup with the non-existent Mr. J. Or Joker if you're nasty.
Immediately antennas should perk up as to how a jilted love burned woman should react. Naturally it's to draw attention to herself.
The often adorably huggable Harley is the result. Now the story jumps back and forth, rewinds and is told through so many different timelines and perspectives that what ends up being is that you realize their gimmick is to hide an incredibly thin plot of a pickpocket kid who heists a very important diamond that a vicious crime boss wants. That in the form of Black Mask (Ewan MacGregor).
Now it's a simple line made to be more complicated then it should.
I admit I did laugh once in this entire...well, messy tale. Which I figured it would be a laugh out loud dark comedy. It's not. It's very self aware and mean. And the entire time you are thinking...where is Batman? Where is Commissioner Gordon, and are we REALLY in Gotham? Awful thoughts to have.
Also a middle aged Rosie Perez will not be able to take care of herself. The other ""human"" person is that of Dinah Lance (Jumee Smollett-Bell) who I desperately wanted to like. She isn't funny and delivers lines like she's passing gas. Not fun at all. The brightest spot is emo'd out Helena Bertinelli played with a great deal of subdued frazzled trauma adult Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Doing what, I presume, Audrey Plaza probably could knock out of the park. I love M.E.W. but...she is given so very little.
The rest turns into an oddball circus that amounts to nothing but a lot of loud grrl rock over them kicking men's butts. There seems to be another movie buried under this one.
I became a huge fan of Christina Hodson after ""Bumblebee"" Somehow she captured the sweet innocence of the 80's in that one. In this, it feels like she is shoehorning a tough gal action flick but not knowing what makes a revenge story so satisfying. We don't feel for Harley at all. Which I think is because they are handcuffed to horrible legacy of fandom. There is a moment when she gets betrayed by a side character, and I am lost as to how, in her sociopathic/psychopathic nature it effects her. Perhaps it's borderline personality that drives her. But we never see that. Unfortunately, they want us to like unlikeable person.
Ella Jay Basco, who plays the Diamond pickpocket'r, Cassandra Cain is awful. Sorry, kid your screen presence is as welcomed as poison ivy. She is ungrateful and bratty and...yeah, we get it, she's suppose to remind Harley of herself. But she's obnoxious and I'm not sure director Yan understands the difference.
As I went for fun, this offered an empty shallow painful all tell and no-show. A very simple diversion for a boring February. Not a disaster but a disappointment.",Birds of Prey
149,dilipbts,Birds of prey and the fantabulous emancipation of one Harley quinn,8,7 June 2020,"Admittedly speaking, remember there was a time when DC Universe was bashed because most of their movies were directed by Zack Snyder who decided that style-over-substance was more pivotal to making superhero films? Then, came David Ayer with a set of the best movie trailers ever created but the outcome for the anti-hero film, Suicide Squad was at best, a mediocre motion picture.Now after Shazam!, Aquaman & the masterpiece Joker, DC presents us with Birds of Prey, the fourth entry movie that proves that their tables have pretty much turned around by finding suitable directors for their movies and that they are catching up to compete with the Marvel Universe. No feud here please.Here's my thoughts on Birds of Prey:The movie features slick action scenes which complete with very acrobatic-like choreography that constantly pleases the eyes of everyone who are looking forward for femme fatales kicking ass. There are plenty of them to keep you amazed.Birds of Prey also delivers a vigorous energy throughout, it feels like you are high on drugs. The close-ups feel very intimate yet feel very caricature in a positive way. The quality of cameras & the colour palette capture a reality of life, giving a sense of how rough it actually is, very dark and gritty but... also sometimes sprinkles the dour tone with graciously boisterous and delicate tinted colours. The occasional slo-mo ampes up the already intense energy.Some of you might have asked regarding the feminist movement. Birds of Prey is a done right feminist film. A key successful factor to driving a feminist film is to create an innate story on women without being pushy on the political agenda. Birds of Prey does that. Another thing is this is not a guy-turn-girl remakes (Yes, I'm watching you Ghostbusters & Ocean's 8). And BOP does not or rarely knocks down the men genes as weak or indecisive. Kudos Birds of Prey!Now, let's talk about Margot Robbie & Mary Elizabeth Winstead. These two really go beyond the next level to dive into their character as uniquely as possible. Margot Robbie as always should be receiving a standing ovation as Harley Quinn again, after the meh Suicide Squad. She restrains from letting anyone steals her spotlight. If her and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker are caught together in a love story, it will be the best romance movie of the decade. The complexity and different types of deranged personalities they uphold. Wow! Winstead as Huntress is the runner up here, she gives out a hot breeze of aura that it is hard to back away from. Her charismatic sexual energy captures the attention like a bullseye 🎯. Bell as Black Canary is cool, but not as great as the other two. Bella as Cain shows to be mischievous but her character only pretty much follows where the major characters take her.It also offers decent humour overall. Harley Quinn is consciously great in this, her facial movements contribute a lot! Some are fresh from the oven, others are a bit obsolete but those humours though feel old keep us glued to the screen.Final battle, the best thing is the lack of unrealistic weaponry that they occupy which makes it all feels so real. It is entertaining and fun too as there are certain scenes that feature a low amount of quick cuts.Now, the most detectable problem with this movie is it spends so much time on character development of the all-girls group that it forgets that they can excite the audience with the combo pack. An hour later and they are still focusing on so many character devs!Because of this, the relationship between members of Birds of Prey is very shadowy and leaves an unsatisfied feeling by the end. Like somehow they have been forced exponentially to know and work with one another.So many developments but they forget Roman's character, the main antagonist which feels quite underdeveloped. When a scene of him pops up especially after 40% of the film, it really wants to tell something meaningful about him, but eventually moves on with it,",Birds of Prey
150,ridi-arahan,Action is boring without the right elements to enhance the setting,7,18 January 2021,"What worked:
It's a light hearted, fun entertaining movie with some light humor and action sequences. A smart viewers would not want to compare this movie with any other DC movie or any other action movies in general, it's a movie for fun, to enjoy and to just chill. The movie got some action sequences, funny scenes and decent climax. So, for that regard, the movie is engaging and enjoyable.
What did not work:
Of course, the movie lacks a good screenplay, direction and character development. The narrative is all over the place, even when accepting the fact that the movie follows non linear narrative. The story is predictable, a very simple concept.
Final verdict: watch when you have nothing else to do",Birds of Prey
151,sbweightman,A great comic-book action film let down by underwhelming villains and a plot that plays it too safe.,8,7 February 2020,"The set pieces are fantastically staged and Quinn brings plenty of craziness, glamour, humour and her unique perspective to the proceedings. Add this to the outlandish style, catchy music and well put together action scenes and it makes it an enjoyable and entertaining film to watch. However, the story itself is rather pedestrian and has a bitty start and a long explanation phase. The villains aren't really done justice and although the acting is good, the supporting cast don't really shine - maybe Robbie just steals the show too much.",Birds of Prey

155,sweidman-28016,An Overall Letdown,6,24 February 2020,"Birds of Prey (And The Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) Review:Birds of Prey follows Harley Quinn, after splitting with the Joker, joining superheroes Black Canary, Huntress and Renee Montoya to save a young girl from an evil crime lord, Roman Sionis. Going in I didn't know what to expect. When the first trailer dropped it looked like a movie that would either be really good or really bad. After the disaster of Suicide Squad it would be hard to recover with a sort of continuing story. I guess it's good that I didn't have much for expectations because this was a pretty average movie. The reviews for this are actually pretty high on Rotten Tomatoes. I think it's because you can either give a positive or negative score. Since it's not terrible and just fine, most are positive. First off I thought the acting was wonderful. Margot Robbie does an amazing job of becoming a whole new character in ever single film she's in. I think she's one of the best actresses of our time currently. She nails this role perfectly and nobody else could play Harley Quinn as good as her. Ella Jay Basco plays Cassandra Cain, a girl that Ewan McGregor's character is after. For only being 13 years old, she did a really fine job. Her character was funny and so free spirited that her scenes were just a joy to watch. I would love to see her in more roles. Now onto Roman, played by McGregor. It's a given that McGregor is a fantastic actor and seems to never do poorly. He delivers well in this, however I just thought he was such a weak villain. It's mainly due to the writing and poor character development to him, and basically ever character except for Robbie and Basco. The story centers around Basco stealing a diamond from Roman. Roman is a rich guy that essentially controls whoever and whatever he wants. Since his diamond is gone he wants to kill this girl. If that's not an overdone villain story, I don't know what is. The whole thing was just underwhelming and predictable. That was the most disappointing part of the movie. The second most disappointing aspect was the whole Birds of Prey part of it. This essentially a Harley Quinn movie, some theaters even renamed it to Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey due to underperformance at the box office. The Birds is Prey stuff doesn't even start till the last 20 minutes. We meet some of the characters throughout, mainly Renee Montoya, but they don't even team up till the end. Huntress, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, shows up two times before the team up and we don't even know who she is. I will admit the Birds of Prey part was really fun to watch and all of the other fighting scenes. It's just if you're going to name it Birds of Prey, have the story focus of the Birds of Prey. This is an entertaining movie to watch. It's colorful, crazy, and there's always something happening. The set design is really good in my opinion, especially the end in a clown house kind of place. One other thing I would maybe have changed was the editing which also goes back to storytelling. This is all told from Harley Quinn so everything is scrambled up mainly at the beginning and could sometimes be too random. Usually a movie had three acts but it was so hard to figure out when they started and ended where I only saw two while watching it. Birds of Prey isn't by all means a bad movie, it's just a disappointment because it could've been really good. To some, this will probably be a good movie, but in comparison to other action or superhero movies, it's a letdown.My Grade: C+",Birds of Prey
156,funtasticfour,I actually enjoyed Suicide Squad more!,7,18 February 2020,"Margot Robbie is great as HQ...but I really wanted to see more of the side characters. This movie has some very good fight scenes/stunts. I also like that the CG is at a minimum. Enjoyable enough, but the story wasn't much and I just hoped for more.",Birds of Prey
157,Offworld_Colony,Deadpool meets Scott Pilgrim in the most glorious way.,8,11 February 2020,"One thing you can guarantee about superhero movies is that they often convey in their style, the tone of their main characters. And in this case that's a whole lot!Firstly the entire film hinges on Margot Robbie and there are moments in this film where I am suddenly reminded: Oh yeah, this is the actress that played Tonya Harding in I, Tonya! I forget how incredible she is until Harley is suddenly draped in humanity and Robbie activates her acting glands. In this film you can see her pain and her humanity and her strife and I was truthfully moved by that because it's made tangible and relatable inbetween all the funsies. But she's also so lively and likeable and she infuses Harley (appropriately) with the spirit of a live-action cartoon.Little stings of humanity reinforce Harley as a lived-on character; too often we see comic characters as untouchable, unknowable statues, they seldom pick up groceries, or live in dumps, or get smashed and cause trouble because they're unhappy. The script normalises Harley in an interesting way.These props go to the script which manages to feel like a solid superhero movie and a sort of cop film while also linking all the characters together in a cat's cradle of interweaving. But the real star is Cathy Yan who is a really accomplished director here; the film is often beautiful and balanced between comic booky and grounded, but she just manages to capture these women so well, we look upon them with a kind of fresh look; they're powerful and sexy but not viewed through male gaze, they're fun and rich.And I was thinking during the (solidly satisfying action) that I've never seen such a creative use of roller skates in action before, and that stems mostly from male dominated action protagonists, and I was grateful for something so exciting and unique. The hair tie moment and many others were a simple breath of fresh air. I'm also sick of the macho samey nonsense in films and the sexism. Further to this I enjoyed the respect given to Harley Quinn's lore; Her Psychiatrist background is referenced plenty, but also her madness is explored by her talking to camera and also a voice-over that infers she's talking to herself. Also, that comment about what crazy actually was, was a cute, grounding commentary and a get out of jail free card to the film approaching the idea of her craziness.Black Mask was terrible and nonsensical and not at all the imposing monster he was in the comics, however, Roman Sionis as a character was very compelling; a rich, entitled, greedy, spoilt Trump-figure who saw Gotham and its inhabitants as his toys; roaming around showing off his masks and patronising and mansplaining his way around his spoils. As a generic mob boss (and his unexplained penchant for removing faces) failed, where his moments of unmasked, unbridled showings of sexual power and dominance was breathtakingly disgusting and effective and I was glad (for some reason) that a woman wrote it and a woman directed it. Zasz was also a welcome surprise, a good actor, fuelling Sionis, and with a rich arc for a henchman.The sets were bad and some of the locations suffered from too much dark blue and atmospheric fog, and the actual Birds of Prey were scant together; relegated largely just to a third act fight.I'm sure this film will be rated less once the novelty of it wears of, but the experience I had was fantastic watching it. And hand on heart, I could definitely stand to see another one, one with the gang all together, and I didn't miss Batman or the Joker one bit.",Birds of Prey
158,acedj,Oh DC......why do you keep missing the mark?,6,18 February 2020,"This is the story of Ms. Harley Quinn that takes place after the event of Suicide Squad (which was a far better movie). She and the Joker have split and she is trying to find her place in the world. Many people hope to kill her or arrest her for her action while under the protection of Joker. She cuts a deal with one of the most dangerous gangsters in Gotham to retrieve a young pickpocket that stole a large diamond with some very important account numbers etched onto it. She is joined by a rouge cop (shocker) and The Huntress and Black Canary.
The opening sequence and first ten minutes was great with a lot of laughs. The final twenty minutes was also great with a lot of action. Everything else in between was a disjointed, boring mess. Margot Robbie was definitely born for this role as she embraces it fully and brings Ms. Quinn to vivid life. I find it utterly frustrating that the writers for the DC movies cannot get their collective heads out of their butts. The shows on the CW are far superior to almost every offering to the DC universe in the form of movies. I was so excited when they announced this film. If you are considering watching this, I would wait for release to the home viewing option.",Birds of Prey

I am updating my review because I recently caught this on television and it translates into timeless entertainment.
If your reading this in 2030 you might be suprised to learn that as I write this updated review 8/20 the rating is a 6 . If you are wondering how this could have happened , I believe it's because of the expectations that movie Joker placed on the direction of the story telling. It may have been a a tough act to follow for anyone.
Sure, I wasn't expecting much but the opening credits nodded to what was to come and I appreciate so many aspects of how this was done. And there is Roller-skate fighting! This qualifies everything I have stated lol
I wasn't sure I was in for a zany Harley Quinn ride. I didn't even know what I wanted, Soon I was won over and for the price of a movie ticket I was thoroughly entertained !
Update I recently caught this on television, it translates beautifully! Maybe it was meant for the longevity of the small big screen.
No spoilers, I get that, I personally avoid previews to movies I plan to see.
Ps when will IMDB have some basic standards? I thought this was an extension of the file review books we relied on prior. How can one give a 1 to a movie of such high production ? This is what is most dislike about this site. Just a couple of basic guidelines would change .... aha now I get it, sigh
Keep going DC you can't please everyone but you can pleas those of us who buy your merch and pay for your app

160,ethanbresnett,See. With a little effort DC can make a good movie!,8,11 March 2020,"This is what a comic book film is all about. Suicide Squad and the rest of the DCEU take note. Yes it had its flaws - some of the characters were little weak and underdeveloped, the plot was somewhat thin and the script laboured in parts, however none of this ever detracted from my enjoyment of the film.Harley Quinn as a character is really quite interesting, and Margot Robbie portrays her exquisitely. What I enjoyed most about Quinn in this film was her distinctive fighting style. Suicide Squad was far too muddled for us to get an appreciation of this, but the Bird of Prey stunt team rectified this. They put together a trademark fighting style which really augmented the action scenes and added a further sense of identity to this interpretation of Harley.Speaking of the action, all of it was fun! It didn't have the DC tendency to resort to two CG blobs smashing through buildings. It felt like the action from an episode of Arrow but more violent and with a bigger budget. Much more real and gritty, but still maintaining a comic book style charm.Aesthetically I thought Birds of Prey was fantastic. We finally got to see a colourful DC film. The comic style freeze frames and cut scenes were great, and the soundtrack fit the film and its tone perfectly.The plot was spread a little thin, and the sudden team up of our heroes felt a bit contrived and unearned given the rest of the film, but that's not a major gripe. The film zipped along at a great pace, overall making the film a delightfully bite sized comic book romp.One of the major flaws was the lack of character development. This was not unexpected as it was always going to be a struggle fleshing out so many new characters in under two hours. That being said Robbie carried the show so well that I'm glad the focus was on her anyway and not the other characters.What more can I say about Birds of Prey other than it is a fun film to watch! Definitely the best DC film for a long time and a great comic book movie.",Birds of Prey

But they had nothing to work with in this bird plop of a film. I thought 'Suicide Squad' was bad, but man, this might be worse! Ewan McGregor might have given the absolute worst performance of anyone's career ever! I mean it! Nicholas Cage, Vin Diesel, and Keanu Reeves might have a foursome now! I was going to turn this off at the 45 minute mark, but I got distracted by a fly buzzing around my living room, and when I realized that the movie was still on, I washed a sink full of dishes, started a load of laundry, and then caught that fight scene at the old carnival lot, which wasn't half bad. So two stars for that.",Birds of Prey
162,nikola17,"I liked it but didn't love it or hate it, but I thought it was one of those films it's fun to watch but it's time waster.",7,18 February 2020,"When I saw trailer when it first come out, I saw it I said eh nothing special it didn't excite me just like with suicide squad, but with suicide squad I liked it better then this for some reason. Fun fact I loved how it's R RATED, so because Joker (2019) film got success with R RATED film that's why DC said eh screw this let's make this into R RATED I am totally fine with that I love things when it's R RATED I remember saying to myself why could of Suicide Squad (2016) could have been R RATED just likewith this film. This all film does continue story from ending of Suicide Squad, it doesn't show joker Jared Leto in film as well it's some else dressed like him but it's not Jared, so story follows Harley broke out prison like ending of suicide squad the joker got here out of there, in the another hand joker kicked her out because joker didn't want her anymore so now on she is alone she ends up getting drunk smashed, eating tons of junk food so she does nothing in film until she went to club met Black Mask/ Roman (Ewan McGregor) until she met few characters in film Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez)
She is cop, Helena Bertinelli / The Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) I thought I loved her character out of Harley Quinn all among others I thought she was more of interesting character her family got gunned down by gangsters she survived it then she become the Huntress with crossbow killing everyone like a vigilante I loved her character much more to be honest. Dinah Lance / Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) another girl who works for Black Mask she has superpowers as well I wished she could used it earlier ago, but she doesn't she uses it until at very end of film. I got feeling that this film is a wannabe this movie is trying to be a female Deadpool movie. Because in Deadpool 2
when Wade makes a team out of himself and has to save kid the boy just like in this film with little Chinese girl Cassandra (Ella Jay Basco) who lives in her foster parents she has a broken arm she prick pockets from people she gets in danger because she steals a Diamond from Roman Henchmen and Roman made a contract worth a lot of money to catch Cassandra because she has diamond that is totally worth about millions of dollars, Harley has to product her, just like in Deadpool 2 when Wade Wilson makes a new team and save and product kid. Also, their thing in movie like here's my story but then keeps going back and forth until we get back to scene like in first Deadpool which was annoying. In the comic's Black mask is a hardcore mobster who kills with a black mask I thought
Black Mask looked a lot scarier in comic books and in cartoons but in this movie in the movie Black Mask was turned gay an cartoony to fit the tone I thought it worked for what the film was a dumb silly cartoon, witch made him not enjoyable or like villain you will like but I think they should made him scarier, series, dark character he keeps having mask on the mask didn't even looked scarier he didn't wear mask until at very end of movie what the heck is this? That's my issue with film if he wears mask entire film it would been sick but no made him like a cartoon when it's a movie made him like gay cartoon tone villain that's what it is he is a wimp in this movie that's one thing it put me out of movie. Didn't make Black mask scarier, a lot evil, badass type but wear mask in entire film as mystery as in we don't know what he looks like just like with Dredd (2012) where it's Karl Urban but he doesn't take off helmet off entire film witch that should have happened, Black Mask doesn't take out mask entire him make mask more scarier make villain more scarier, evil, badass type of guy not wimp gay cartoonish. I thought this film was Entertaining at times, fun to watch wasn't boring at all the film doesn't slow down at all, EwanMcGregor's performances weren't as great as what they were with the nice compliments he looks like he is having fun with his role but in same time I reckon I seen him in better movies as in better performance, but in this his wimpy villain that's what I don't like. And another thing it's trying to be a gender female version of bent version of Deadpool 2 that's not a issue with me but the story is trying to be Deadpool 2, I hate people arguing about For being R-rated, the violence feels neutered well look at Deadpool films, Marvel Netflix shows, Joker (2019) film that got R RATED but got a very successfully Ratings well great but doesn't mean this movie flopped and people arguing R RATED doesn't mean that's biggest issue about movie. She restrains from letting anyone steals her spotlight. If her and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker are caught together in a love story, it will be the best romance movie of the decade. The complexity and different types of deranged personalities they uphold. Wow!Final battle, the best thing is the lack of unrealistic weaponry that they occupy which makes it all feels so real. It is entertaining and fun too as there are certain scenes that feature a low amount of quick cuts, I liked final Battle but I thought it could done a lot better I seen better in Zombieland (2009) at circus, but in this it's fun but it's too much quick cuts in action scenes, funny enough the Adds 'John Wick' Stunt and Fight Coordinators in this movie as well. I remember one tiny cameo Sionis' Chauffeur (Daniel Bernhardt) known for Bloodsport 2-4, Matrix Reloaded, John Wick, Atomic Blonde, Kill'em All, Logan, Escape Plan: The Extractors I remember him in a lot of cameo's I seen in movies with him in it he has a tiny cameo role in this movie. I thought this was good fun to watch but not brilliant oh me saying I loved it I thought it's one of those type of movies I would watch it again but not dozens of times oh me saying I loved me to death but it's pretty good enjoyable but give it around 6.10 I am trying to love it hardest as I can I am trying to but theirs few issues with film like with quickly cuts action scenes, I thought villain was meant to be in comicbooks Black Mask to be evil, dark, series, scary type of looking villain but it turns out to be wimpy, dope gay cartoon villain the script writers made huge mess on that one, I thought Asian girl Cassandra was boring as character nothing in here just block of wood even the Asian girl in film Safe (2012) was a lot better in this movie, it's a wannabe Deadpool 2 with females no issues with that but I wish this film could been itself make it like Deadpool 2 but itself don't make it same but writers did it is because they have nothing else better to write in their scripts look if you like Most people thought this was Suicide Squad 2, but it's not because Suicide Squad 2 is out next year is called The Suicide Squad title of film that's next chapter, I liked this birds of prey but not greatest, not brilliant but I thought it's fun to watch as time waster that's all it is in my opinion.",Birds of Prey
163,SkullScreamerReturns,"Hey, it's entertaining and colorful comic book movie",6,21 July 2021,"I found ""Suicide Squad"" to be wasted potential with a cool gallery of characters but who were not used to do much interesting. I expected this one to be even worse but I was actually surprised: it's better!Yes! They did it! They fixed what was the biggest issue in the previous one. The supernatural fantasy villains have been thrown to garbage and this time Harley has actual thugs to fight with her club. What bugged me a little bit was that she is a bit too invincible in regular fights. I get that she's supposed to be very fast and acrobatic but the way she just beats up a room full of guys is a maybe a bit too unrealistic, even for a comic book logic. Still...I iked this movie's action scenes more than Marvel's ""digital guys punching each other through digital walls"" style.The other characters, the so called ""Birds of Prey"" are a nice addition, though I think they don't deserve to be the main title of the film. They are clearly side characters. Still, I liked them. Black Canary and Huntress don't show up very often but they are acted pretty well and seem to have some personality.Then there's the quirky humor that is all over the place. I understand if someone can't stand it. It irritated me in the beginning but then I got into the mood and had many laughs. The comedy managed to be actually funny.What I also disliked at first is how the story is told in fragments, which seemed confusing at first. I don't know was that really necessary but...ok...in the end it worked I guess. Maybe it's suppoded to represent Harley Quinn's chaotic personality.One more thing: the movie is quite colorful. Unlike Christopher Nolan's ""let's make Batman look realistic (= boring)"" visual style, I think Birds of Prey is more like what a comic book movie should visually look like.I'd put this movie in the same pile as ""Batman & Robin"" and ""Turtles 2: The Secret of the Ooze"". I mean, I actually like those, I find them entertaining and like to watch from time to time.",Birds of Prey

165,stevenrotherforth,Better than 'Suicide Squad' but ultimately forgettable,6,7 April 2020,"Birds Of PreyBetter than 'Suicide Squad' for sure.
'Birds Of Prey' boasts some well choreographed fight scenes and another good performance by Margot Robbie as Harlequin. Robbie has made the role her own. Much like Hugh Jackman did with Wolverine. It would be difficult to see anyone else playing these characters now.Director Cathy Yan has a colourful visual style but sadly this movie spends too much time with exposition.
Margot Robbie is constantly required to deliver voice overs here and there so we the audience have the foggiest idea what is going on.
We're clumsily brought up to speed before the story can progress but nothing transpiring onscreen is of real interest.
This movie is colourful eye candy. Nothing more.
At least it tries to stay grounded in a believable world unlike 'Suicide Squad' which I felt did not work at all.
'Birds Of Prey' is mildly enjoyable but nothing to write home about.
All will be forgotten as soon as the credits roll.
It's a thin movie in terms of plot and character development. The villain played by Ewan McGregor is hardly fleshed out. The rest of the so called Birds of prey get little time devoted to them. All seems rushed but in fairness there's just not enough minutes in the films 1hr 49 runtime to do any of the characters any justice.
Ultimately this is what makes the film a forgettable experience.",Birds of Prey

The fan-boy I went with was not amused (gave it a 2/5) but I thought it was OK. Hard to make a superhero movie with no superheroes. Batman would have given it a few more stars. Also, canon was a mess -- Harley wasn't in the Birds of Prey. No Batgirl. Black Canary is no longer a blonde because she is African American. Black Mask is a mess. Huntress is no longer a super, just a pissed off orphan. The whole movie reeked of ""boys are bad, girls are good"" message. I enjoyed it but won't see it again or buy the DVD. Reading reviews it seems it is a bomb, ""less viewers than Green Lantern"" was one. Maybe the ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Charlie's Angels"" people will learn the world isn't ready for their twisted view.

173,SnobReviews,Entertaining but falls flat in most important areas.,6,25 February 2020,"""Birds Of Prey"" offers sheer popcorn entertainment for nearly two hours, but falls flat in the most important areas such as screenplay and storyline.
.
In this superhero action film, Harley Quinn joins forces with a troupe of crime fighting women to save a young girl from Gotham crime lord Black Mask.
.
There is no one more fit for the lead role than Margot Robbie; she portrays Harley Quinn so well that she becomes the character. I think the performances in ""Birds Of Prey"" are great, especially from Robbie but Ewan McGregor as Black Mask really stood out for me. A vicious and over the top role that only McGregor could play. Aside from its flaws, the film is action packed and solid but it needed a rewrite. Filled with loose dialogue and not enough backstory, it feels like ""Birds Of Prey"" was relying solely on explosons and blood for entertainment's sake.

178,jamiedarlow-37510,A work of anarchic beauty!,9,13 March 2020,"Violent, sweary and a hell of a lot of fun! Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) is trying to recover a traumatic breakup from The Joker. In a spectacular opening sequence, she rediscovers her independence with a bang! Meanwhile, one of Gotham City's most evil villains Roman Sionis AKA Black Mask (Ewan McGregor) teaming up with the sadistic Victor Zsasz (Chris Messina) have put a bounty on the head of a young girl named Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco) who is in possession of a diamond they desire. Harley along with cop Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez) singer Dinah Lance AKA Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) and the mysterious Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) are all somewhat entangled in this situation and fight to help Cassandra. I absolutely loved this one and it delivered so much on the awesome concept; DC excel at comic book villains and, although Suicide Squad was fun and all, it was mostly style over substance. Thankfully Birds Of Prey has a huge amount of emotion and dedication behind it to support the oozes of infectiously great style. Writer Christina Hodson (Bumblebee) and director Cathy Yan inject beautiful dark comedy in the mix which is key for a tale told by the sumptuously maniacal Quinn and I was sucked into the ride from the very beginning. Robbie clearly has a lot of passion for the character and has created another essential character study, taking a producers role here also. The Birds Of Prey are all brilliantly realised by the effortlessly cool four playing them and I can't wait to see a potential sequel with them starring! McGregor has had an insane run of great performances recently; from Christopher Robin and Doctor Sleep now to this in which he is seriously sinister and quite terrifying in certain scenes (that scene in which he loses it and forces one of his patrons to do something is really tense). However what makes our protagonists all the more fun and great to spend time with is their disgust and put downs of Roman, showing him to be the pathetic man he really is and requires people to fear him in order to feel alive. Harley and co. require no such thing; they genuinely love being rebellious, sticking it to the man and living life to the fullest (as chaotic as possible in Gotham, sorry Batman) but also are not avert to showing compassion in their own roundabout ways to anyone like Cassandra who ultimately brings them all together. Harley was iconically conditioned into having no remorse for any other human being other than herself and her Mister J, but through her breakthrough solo career is finding her own psychopathic joy which is a treasure to behold. Like Harley's beloved hyena Bruce, I laughed and giggled plenty. I was invested in the characters and I think it's another shining beacon in DC's future as well as a hugely entertaining and instantly rewatchable super villain flick",Birds of Prey

You know that feeling when you're eating a biryani and accidentally a piece of clove comes in your mouth which ruins the whole thing? That's exactly what this film is. Just when everything is going very well something will ruin it. The climax scene where Harley kills Roman was so badly ruined by that grenade part. The final fight where Harley opens the wardrobe and finds there are no weapons was so nice, but that roller skate fight ruined it. The part where Black Mask asks a girl to stand on the table and dance, the part where the restaurant owner betrays Harley, and most importantly the fact that Cassandra ATE the diamond (I literally rolled my eyes on that one. How did she not die immediately?) were all so cringy. The costumes were also so bad. To make them less sexualised, they ended up making it perfect for someone with an abdomen kink.

181,DeBBss,Could've Been Way Better with Good Screenwriters...,5,25 August 2020,"This is the best adaptation of Harley Quinn as a character in cinema, in my opinion. It's just unfortunate that this great character constantly gets stuck in lazy and poor writing. First with Suicide Squad, now with Birds of Prey. Margot Robbie is such a perfect casting with her skills too, just please get some good writers to support her role.The plot is very lazy and quite uninteresting. There's a dozen other things you could've done with the character Black Mask, but they instead made him quite irrelevant until the third act. The whole plot follows a wild goose chase, but then that ends pretty quickly because Harley Quinn already found Cassandra Cain (the girl who carries the diamond) in the second act. The chase was too quick, so they had to fill in the second act with a bunch of useless exposition. What I'm trying to get at is that this plot was a terrible choice, and it also had a terrible execution.The acting by Margot Robbie was so perfect that it actually made all the other performances look lazy. The supporting cast didn't do a bad job, but it certainly doesn't help if you're side by side by Margot Robbie playing her best role.When it comes to the characters, all of them were terrible except Harley Quinn. There were so many characters that were underdeveloped in this movie, especially Huntress. Huntress has to be by far the most useless character I have ever seen in cinema. Huntress' role in the film was only explained near the end of the film; and her character gets such little screen time. If you were to completely remove this character from the script, literally nothing would change. Black Mask is another character that was poorly executed. I don't know how, but they actually made Black Mask a boring character.Birds of Prey is a perfect example of poor writing ruining a movie. Almost all of the faults can be blamed on the screenwriters. So far, I'm just going to hope that the next couple of adaptations of Harley Quinn can actually get some good writers.",Birds of Prey
182,jayjaycee,Harley Quinn and attachments... Meh,5,21 February 2020,"""Birds Of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation Of One Harley Quinn"" is a 2020 comic book adaptation directed by Cathy Yan starring Margot Robbie and Rosie Perez. The DCEU hasn't had it easy in the past several years. Compared to successful rival company Marvel it didn't really manage to build up a cinematic universe that's on a coequal level and instead created mediocre to terrible films, with an exception being ""Wonder Woman"". In my personal opinion, the most enormous problem of DC is the simple strategy to build up a universe in instead of focusing on making good films in the first place. That's why they half-heartedly produced one disaster after another that are loosely connected to each other rather than independent but great flicks on their own. But to be honest, I had zero expectations towards this one. I was one hundred percent sure that it couldn't be more disastrous than ""Batman Vs Superman"" or ""Suicide Squad"" and in the end, I was right. I'm not saying that it was great in general, just that it was better and that doesn't automatically mean that it isn't a bad film. First of all, the story is another perfect example for decent premise terribly executed. It's far away from being original nor does it breathe new air into the sub-genre. It's a generic and less entertaining version of the main idea behind ""Deadpool 2"". Don't believe me? Here's why: Some kind of antihero with their own understanding of justice and injustice tries to protect a kid playing a significant role from being killed by the antagonist and on the way learns something about heroism and friendship. You know what I mean? At the same time, it even copies the fourth wall breaks and tries to develop the same kind of humour. Fact is, that it was not funny at all. Except from one or two chuckles in between, the audience, including me, remained silent throughout. That's probably thanks to another problem of this flick: It just can't seem to decide on a proper tone to hit. Try to be hilarious? Stay hilarious. Try to be serious? Stay serious. Try to be dramatic? Stay dramatic. Try to combine all? Find the happy medium. This film tries to combine all (what is not impossible to achieve though) and eventually ends up as a conglomerate of inconsistently executed tonal directions that tears up itself in the process. It's a mess of a generic story that doesn't know what it tries to be. But before we get deeper in to the other flaws, let's point out some positive aspects of this film: Margot Robbie is hands down the best that happened to this film. She's literally born for the role of Harley Quinn and once again showed how talented she is, even in this context. Also, Ewan McGregor was a decent decision to play Roman Sionis. At times overacting, he still did his best and it shows. Furthermore, the choreographies made the most fun to watch, even when they became repetitive in the end. Aside from this, there was nothing else worth mentionable. One of the hugest disappointments is how the other characters are woven into the story. The main focus of course lies on Harley, but for the fact that it's supposed to be a BOP film the others are criminally shallowly written. From Canary to Huntress, all of them are tremendously underdeveloped and get lost in the shadows as the spotlight constantly lies on the hammer swinging Harley. In the end, it suffers from the same problem SS had. The writers simply aren't able to conceptualise characters on a equal level to Quinn. Again it feels more like a ""Harley-and-attachments"" film and I think that's a terribly wasted opportunity, as Mary Elizabeth Winstead was the perfect choice for Huntress. The first half offered some interesting story development, but the second half is a snooze fest. Nothing really packing happend there. It would have been more irrelevant if it wasn't for the decently entertaining final act. The only thing that annoys me about it is the simple fact how it disrespectfully treats two of the most iconic and promising characters of the comic source. Victor Zsasz killed by an arrow? Black Mask blown up into thousand pieces by a grenade? I mean, come on! By killing them off in a such an unspectacular way they destroyed their opportunity to establish some decent villains in their universe. Oh, and don't get me started about some plot holes and dumb character decisions at times. All in all, this loud and colourful flick doesn't achieve to emancipate itself from mediocrity. It's boring and poorly conceived at times and relies to heavily on its leading lady (correct, singular!) and in the process fails to establish the other members of the titular ""Birds Of Prey"". It's a Deadpool copycat that can't find it's direction and even though it's supposed to be an origin story, doesn't offer anything particularly entertaining and hasn't made fun for me. It's definitely better than ""Suicide Squad"", but absolutely forgettable nevertheless. Even though I appreciate the idea of a female fronted superhero film, I'm totally underwhelmed and disappointed by the outcome. If you want to see some female power, go watch ""WW"" instead, because this mess won't do your expectations justice.",Birds of Prey
183,TheHoodOfSwords,Lifeless,5,28 April 2020,"I went into this with low expectations. I wanted to just have fun, I wanted a fun movie with some good action. So I was disappointed when the movie ended and I just felt like I saw a shameless cash grab. It's sad when a movie centred around Harley Quinn has a more interesting character. Huntress was my favourite character but she doesn't even get any real lines until the last 30 minutes of the movie. This film introduces so many characters and expects you to care about them but I just didn't. I see people talking about the police station scene. Yep, that's the best scene but even that didn't feel like a Kingsman church scene to me. It's all just choreographed poorly and I didn't get invested in it. There were actually shots in this film that I was about to say ""wow, this is going to be a cool long take"" and then it just cut. I really wanted to like this but it just feels like an empty dead cash grab. I think this movie needed a better plot and more set up for it's characters. The main villain just feels weak. Not to mention a character has superpowers and it's not even hinted at. Yes, I know it is probably explained in the comics but I don't care unless it's explained well enough in the movie.

Director: Cathy Yan
Starring: Margot Robbie, Ewan McGregor, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rosie Perez, Jurnee Smollett Bell, Ella Jay basco, Chris Massena etc
Overall rating 98/100
Birds of prey focuses on Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) who has broken up with the joker and wants to prove to everyone she is capable of doing things by herself. But when she gets in trouble with Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor) she must team up with Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett Bell) Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez) who have all wronged Roman in order to save Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Besco) from the wrath of Roman and to stop him from coming under the possession of a precious diamond. Wow what a fantastic movie, tied with joker as my favourite DC movie and one of the funnest film experiences I have ever had. Let's talk about this more in detail.First of all, I loved the unique tone of the film and its visuals and creative set pieces. This film just felt so different and unique to any other film I have ever seen especially for DC. I loved the playful voice narration throughout. The unique humour that's only funny with Harley Quinn. And the story was told in such a fun and unique way that was consistently entertaining throughout. Also, the films visuals were incredibly creative and attention to detail with its set pieces were great. The films visuals were fantastic. Whether it was unique bullets or exploding mustard and glitter instead of blood. They truly went for something different here and it worked so well. Even little things like having pink and blue mist that Harley walks through to match the colour of her hair was great. And the interesting set locations were great whether it was the funhouse to set up an incredibly entertaining final act and action sequences. Harleys flat was interesting and led to some very funny scenes. And even the entrance of the funhouse looking like the animated version of Harley Quinn it was the films attention to detail that I really appreciated.Next, I loved the backstories they gave to the characters and the fact that they still kept Harley as an anti-hero. I loved the amount of detail they went into Harley's background. Really making us understand the reasoning behind her going crazy and almost making us sympathising with her. But I also liked that they added some backstory for Black Canary and Huntress which cleverly linked with all the other characters. But I also loved that they kept Harley Quinn as an antihero. They managed to balance feeling sympathy for her character and liking her. To also knowing that she is still a criminal and that she still made some bad decisions, it just made you like her even more as she went through the inner conflict of being good or bad.Next the film was hilarious, and the action sequences were fantastic and really creative. Wow this made me laugh on multiple occasions. I wasn't expecting to laugh so much. But Margot Robbie playing Harley Quinn was just infectious. And some of the lines she comes out with are just so meant for her character you couldn't help but laugh at the cleverness of the script. The whole female cast also had great comedic chemistry as well, and another humorous part would have to be Harleys narration and the lines of text taking the mick out of all the characters was excellently executed and bought a breath of fresh air to the movie. And the action sequences were brilliantly creative and fun to watch. They had a very john wick/Deadpool vibe to them but yet still felt completely different to any other action scenes I have seen. Margot Robbie surprisingly held her own with some fantastic and unique action sequences. And the final act with the funhouse was one of the funnest times I have had with really unique action sequences involving hands, slanted walls and robotic tongues I know sounds weird and crazy, but it completely works within the film.Now for my one and only slight nit-pick and that is that there were no good male characters and that they were all bad and collectively the enemy. It would have been nice to have some positive male representation within the film as they were shown to be dislikeable and not good people. It wasn't to much of an issue for me because I loved the characters and the film itself, but it would have been nice for more equal gender representation as I fear this could limit its audience slightly.Next, I loved how the narrative was set out and the new characters were great. This film didn't tell the plot narratively in order which I loved. They played a scene and just when the next scene didn't make sense with a particular character, they rewinded the film and played the same scene from a different character's perspective. This was really cleverly done and made the film really enjoyable and it was just a clever and unique way to tell a story that's coherent with no plot holes. And all the new characters really held their own with the clear star of the movie Margot Robbie. There wasn't one weak link. Black Canary and Huntress had great backstories and really entertaining action sequences between them. Cassandra Cain was another great character who had great comedic and on-screen chemistry with Margot Robbie. Roman Sionis or black mask was fantastic. And Renee Montoya was very entertaining and had a good character arc within her workplace as well. But if I had to have key standouts for the new characters it would be Jurnee Smollett Bell as Black Canary and Ella Jay Besco as Cassandra Cain.Now time for my final two positives for the movie. The two stars of the movie and who had the best performances. Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor. Ewan McGregor was truly fantastic here. He played a completely different role to what I am used to him in but wow he was fantastic. He managed to balance a really campy and funny performance but also a really twisted and uncomfortable performance as well, he did well to hold his own in a female dominated movie so well done to him. But my biggest positive for me would be the star of the film Margot Robbie. Wow what a phenomenal performance. She had it all likeability, humour and holding up well within the action sequences she truly made Harley Quinn my favourite character in DC. I hope we see her reprise her role many times.Overall Birds of prey is tied with my favourite DC movie. With fantastic performances. Fantastic humour and action. Even fantastic script and storytelling and so much more. This shows that Harley Quinn is the role that Margot Robbie was born to play and that DC are finally improving the quality of their movies after years of struggling.",Birds of Prey
185,shanayneigh,Just as bad as Suicide Squad,2,17 April 2020,"It took me two attempts to get through this film. The first time I gave up about 20 minutes in when Harley was being chased by Rosie Perez. One thing which Suicide Squad is that it was so laughably bad that it was almost entertaining at times. Birds of Prey is simply dull.The story is nonsensical and the characters aren't really that interesting. Perhaps an ensemble movie was a poor choice to begin with. Making it R-rated was an even dumber choice. A few broken bones and swears here and there added nothing to this movie, but it sure was a good way to make sure that teen girls couldn't watch the movie. Hence the middling box office.One thing which is perfectly clear is that Harley Quinn works well as a supporting character - she was one of the best things about Suicide Squad after all. But it is also perfectly clear that she does not work at all as a main character.Her backup crew don't fare much better. Rosie Perez has played one character her whole career, and that's Rosie Perez. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is usually pretty good, but she's in this movie far too little to have any impact. Black Canary sure looks good but couldn't act her way out of a paper bag from what I can tell. And I know it's not right to be mean to kids, but I hope the Asian kid finds another day job. Ali Wong is a great stand up comic, but an actress she ain't. Chris Messina gets nothing to do and Ewan McGregor is the hammiest ham that has ever hammed.I don't know who should feel the most ashamed: the director, DP, editor, or stunt coordinator. For being a big studio franchise action movie, the fight scenes are laughably amateurish. The main characters look like they have never thrown a punch or a kick in their lives. Sure, they hit their marks going from position A to B then C etc, but there is clearly no power (or even the illusion thereof) behind their punch or kick. I dare you to look at the fun house fight and tell me it's not true. There are amazingly talented female stunt performers - Amy Johnston for example! - who could have given the fight sequences some of the oomph they needed. But this was truly a s**t show.There is a reason why this movie has a 78% score on Rotten Tomatoes. And that reason is identity politics, which is driving me, a socialist, crazy. Now I love political movies. Z (1969) or Missing (1982) are masterpieces. But not every bit of light entertainment has to be political. It's not even political in content, it's just surface level. And what is the easiest thing to do on the surface? Representation. Throw a couple of women and non-whites into the mix, and suddenly it's hailed by bloggers, journalists and social media figures alike as a political statement. On the surface. The content? Doesn't matter. That's too complicated and might endanger box office revenue. But can we get any retweets for a female Asian director?Female ensemble? Check.
Ethnically diverse crew? Check.
Female director? Check.
Non-white director? Check.""You're not the only one who makes money off of dumb, rich, white people"" says the Asian kid when she's caught pick pocketing by the black woman. Any reason why ""white"" had to be included in that statement? I guess that's... ...what... ...progressive? Any chance the sequel (bwahaha!) will have a white character making quips about dumb black people?There are countless articles about this movie and the ""male gaze"" (google it). Apparently it was a problem that Harley Quinn looked good and had sex appeal in Suicide Squad, and Margot Robbie must be protected from the ""male gaze"" (never mind that she got her big break in The Wolf of Wall Street where she had plenty of sex appeal and an infamous scene with Leo in their infant's bedroom). So in Birds of Prey she gets the clothes of a hobo hipster, the makeup of a bargain basement clown, and the haircut of a lesbian tween. This movie is not likely to inspire too many girls and women to dress up as Harley Quinn in Halloween, as opposed to her looks in Suicide Squad. But anything for the cause, I guess.The most important thing is that the movie passes all the identity political purity tests which makes it near impossible to not give it at least a passing score, lest you be judged as a misogynist racist.Let me be perfectly clear: I would dislike this movie just as much had it been made by a white man and starred an all male cast. It's just a bad movie, not a political statement. I loathe whiny man babies who automatically hate anything made by women. Just as I equally loathe whiny woman babies who automatically praise anything made by women. I'm an equal opportunity hater.",Birds of Prey
186,thebricks,"Better than Suicide Squad, which indicates how bad it really was",5,9 February 2020,"I didn't like this movie and I didn't hate it. I felt it was serviceable but that it could have been better with a more competent director and writer. They wanted a female to direct and write, but were these people really the best for the job? It doesn't help when your lead actress acts like she would rather be somewhere else. They have got to recast Margot Robbie. She is beyond awful as an actress. She's either not motivated or the director isn't pushing her enough.What happened to the people who did those amazing Suicide Squad movies? What happened to the person who made the trailer for the first Suicide Squad movie? They did a better job capturing Harley Quinn than two horrible directors ever could. It's pretty bad when some animated film that went straight-to-DVD beats the pants off the big-budget live-action movies I just got eighties and nineties vibes from this movie of an era prior to Marvel where Hollywood just bought the rights to a comic book superhero or videogame character just to make a quick buck. I haven't seen fight scenes this terrible since the nineties. I used to do Tae Kwon Do and it kind of hurt to see female characters using moves that would get them destroyed because of their light weight. Nothing was ever established too that these characters are enhanced in any way.For starters, Harley Quinn is and always will be a supporting character. She's not a ""strong, independent woman."" Harley even states this in the movie, defining what a harlequin is. You can't make her a leading lady. It doesn't help when the actress playing her is clearly not committed to pushing the envelope with the role. I also do not like the outfit, it's another callback to the terrible low-effort nineties adaptations.Mary Elizabeth-Winstead is just horrible. The Huntress character is just awful to begin with. What trained, efficient killer uses a crossbow? Seriously. Nothing was even done to give the impression this crossbow was special or that Huntress should be feared. She's even more apathetic in the role than Margot, giving the bare minimum of effort in terms of acting. I can see why her career never took off. There's a lot of potential there with her, but she doesn't want to be an actress. Why still take the jobs then?Jussie Smollett's sister, Rosie Perez, Ewan MacGregor and the actor who played Victor are pretty much the only actors who made any effort in this entire movie. This could have been a lot better, it's just a shame. There are some other elements I noticed that bugged me, but it's not PC so I don't want to be censored. It has to do with things the director pushed in because of her heritage, including many unlikable actors that rubbed me the wrong way and elements that would get any other director or writer called a racist.I would wait for DVD. I got my ticket free but want my time back, sorry. Might be time to reboot and recast, that's all.",Birds of Prey

189,januszlvii,Horrible,1,30 December 2020,"The best thing I can say about Birdbrains oops Birds of Prey is it was better then Joker and Paradise Hills. Paradise Hills is the worst movie I ever saw ( Joker is second). Paradise Hills and Birds of Prey have things in common. They both came out this year, and they are both male hating feminist crap. It took a long time for me to find a worse performance by a woman in a comic book movie then Alice Silverstone in Batman and Robin, but Margot Robbie ( Harley Quinn and ( especially) Rosie Perez ( Renee Montoya) were that bad. They made Silverstone's Batgirl seem like Christian Bale's Batman. A special hate is for the fight scenes, which made the Batman TV show which was not to be taken seriously, seem like the Dark Knight Trilogy.. I cannot believe all of the high grades this film is getting on IMDB. Those people must be well HIGH on something, because they have had a fantasy that this film was good. Now maybe, I am the wrong demographic for Birds of Prey: Male, straight, conservative and over the age of five, so it is to be expected, I would not find it the least bit entertaining, but I just do not get the love ( although not to the degree that Phoenix winning the Best Actor Oscar for Joker did). The Best thing about Birds of Prey? It did not get me angry like Paradise Hills and Joker did. Since IMDB does not allow her zero stars. I have to give it one star above. But in reality it is a horrible movie an easy zero stars.",Birds of Prey
190,Donatien3,Harley Quinn Delivers a Mature and Fun DCEU Film,9,28 March 2020,"After the trainwrecks of ""Suicide Squad"" and ""Justice League"", ""Birds of Prey"" is the mature film DCEU fans have been crying out for.The plot involves Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) going solo after splitting from the Joker (the negative reactions to Jared Leto's blink-and-you'll-miss-it role in ""Suicide Squad"" means there's no Joker in this movie). She befriends a troubled pick-pocketing teen, who's stolen a valuable diamond that the dangerous Victor Zsasz (Chris Messina) and Roman Sionis/Black Mask (an at times terrifying Ewan McGregor) wants. Quinn eventually teams up with fellow anti-heroes Dinah Lance/Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) and Helena Bertinelli/The Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).BOP should be commended for not going to the obvious Batman villains (especially with Robert Pattinson's new Batman film coming out soon), instead choosing slightly more obscure ones - though Zsasz was briefly seen in ""Batman Begins"".""Birds of Prey"" - and Margot Robbie's portrayal of Quinn - has a real Deadpool vibe: it's very violent (there more blood and guts in this film than all the other DCEU films combined); there's lots of swearing; it's funny; and Quinn - like Deadpool - smashes the fourth wall (along with many bad guys and girls), narrating her own film and at times directly speaking to the audience. Robbie had a big hand in this movie, and she carries this film, driven by her passion for Quinn. The Queenslander's come a long way from playing teenager Donna Freedman on the Australian soap opera ""Neighbours"".BOP sheds the gloominess of previous DCEU films, while still having a violent edge. It also serves as a proper origin movie for Quinn after her origin story was glossed over at the start of ""Suicide Squad"".",Birds of Prey

I watched it because I liked the Harley Quinn character, but I saw that there wasn't any character that could be Harley Quinn's movie alone without Joker. Maybe it would be nice if more solid characters were added to it but I don't like the cast, they are all very good actors but their compatibility with the roles was not effective.Margot Robbie fits the role of Harley Quinn but not enough for a movie to be beautiful, especially detective Renee Montoya was a very unnecessary character, just like Helena Bertinelli.
When they couldn't use the Joker in the movie, instead they created a villain with Ewan Mcgregor, but it seemed like a copy of a Joker to me.

His second recent effort, after _Doctor Sleep_ where I really loved his choice of movies. The other ladies and even McGregor's deputy have been given sufficient screen time to help you empathize with them or repelled by them.The story at its core is like the early Guy Ritchie heist film, where people are searching for a diamond. The dialogue writer tries his best to do a Deadpool by mixing every second line with an expletive but ends up falling short.It's not a typical superhero film and is certainly not meant for those who might go for it expecting tentpole budget chases and explosions.

196,ayoreinf,"Fun film made to fit Margot Robbie, but it does work",8,19 February 2020,"This film was born because Harley Quinn made it big among the funs of Suicide Squad. As I stated when reviewing that film it was one of the few properly written roles in that film, and Margot who's a superb actress made wonders with it. Combine this fact with the growing popularity of Harley Quinn as a character, and you've got the story of her ""fantabulous emancipation"" carrying an entire film. Thing is Harley Quinn's emancipation is pretending to be the secondary part of the movie, while the Birds of Prey, a group of female heroins fighting in Gotham seems like the real lead of this film. That's only the title, the moment Harley Quinn was made the story teller of this movie it was clear she's the real lead. Harley as a character can't tell a story in which she's not the lead. So the title is slightly misleading, but all the previews made it clear that this was her story all we had to find out was how much of the movie was left for the Birds of Prey. Truth be told, not much. But enough to make it fun to watch and to wonder whether there's enough here for a new franchise. The three real heroins in this movie are definitely under developed. Most of all the Huntress who's almost an afterthought in this one.All of this doesn't mean Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor didn't give a superlative performance. same is true for Ella Jay Basco as Cassandra Cain. And everyone else on screen was at least very professional. Must address one point that was made here by some reviewers."" All the men are bad"", almost true, but remember where the whole thing is taking place. It's Gotham, the most corrapt city invented in comics until Sin City was invented years later, and it's happening in Harley's backyard where the best of the most corrupt come together to play their games. Harley herself is far from a saint and that's part of her charm.So - go see it, just know in advance what you're about to see. Who knows, it might become a cornerstone of future DC mythology",Birds of Prey
197,themadmovieman,An absolute riot that bursts with energy and eccentricity throughout,8,7 February 2020,"An absolute riot from start to finish, Birds Of Prey is by far the best film in DC's Extended Universe, thrilling with delirious eccentricity and fun-loving action throughout. Bolstered by a dynamite lead cast, striking and energetic direction and gorgeous visuals, it's an enormously entertaining blockbuster.From its quirky, almost underdog-style action and humour to its immense energy, I was smiling and laughing all the way through Birds Of Prey. It's an enormous step in the right direction for DC, and feels light years away from the drab mess of Suicide Squad.It pops off the screen with a kaleidoscopic colour palette, flies along at rapid pace over the course of a fairly short runtime, and packs a great comedic punch with its fourth wall breaks, charismatic performances and self-aware sense of humour.The film definitely takes a lot of its cues from Deadpool, particuarly in its gleeful and still refreshing use of the freedom granted by its R rating. The action is spectacular and exciting, and with just enough violence to lend the movie genuine stakes - again a massive step up from the far more lifeless and sanitised Suicide Squad.Birds Of Prey is an anarchic, no-holds-barred comic book blockbuster through and through, and it has a heap of fun in that knowledge. With the exception of the names on the poster and the DC logo, this is barely a superhero movie, but more of an unadulterated action-crime extravaganza with a handful of thoroughly entertaining characters.The film's ensemble cast is absolutely brilliant from beginning to end. Although the screenplay gets a bit muddled as it attempts to establish five or six different main characters simultaneously, the performances are so dynamic and energetic that you're always eager to learn more about each character's story.Margot Robbie is dynamite as Harley Quinn, and leads the film with immense charisma - even more so than her standout turn in Suicide Squad.Alongside, Ella Jay Basco, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, Mary Elizabeth Winstead (whose appearance is rather brief) and especially Rosie Perez and Ewan McGregor bring delirious energy to the table, making Birds Of Prey more than just the fantabulous emancipation of one Harley Quinn, but a well-rounded and dynamic ensemble throughout.There's so much going on in this film that there's barely time to take a breath. While Suicide Squad attempted to use supposedly anarchic humour to mask an otherwise barebones plot, Birds Of Prey is filled to the brim with ideas, excitement and action, and director Cathy Yan brings it all together in spectacular fashion.Although there are a couple of occasions where the film gets a little muddled between introductions of all its characters, Yan gives Birds Of Prey such energy and life that whatever you're watching is an absolute delight. It doesn't all gel perfectly well as a consistent narrative, but every little side story is filled with more fun and eccentricity than the last.As a result, Birds Of Prey is an absolute blast no matter where you look. Its deliriously enjoyable visuals are backed up by an action-packed (albeit often muddled) plot, entertaining and likable characters, an eccentric and anarchic comedic vibe, big laughs throughout, a fantastic ensemble cast and directing that pulls it all together perfectly.",Birds of Prey
198,WalkdenEntertainment,Praise God This Is Way Better Than Suicide Squad!,8,15 April 2020,"Continuing on from where we left Harley Quinn after ""Suicide Squad"" (2016), things have now changed for poor Harley. The Joker has broken her heart and as you can imagine, Harley is not happy about it. Now living a life without the protection of Mr J (aka The Joker), Harley is wanted by many within Gotham City. Soon Harley finds herself in a situation that requires her to track down a Diamond as her life depends on it. But luckily for Harley, she will discover that she is not alone when it comes to battling new enemies.I personally wasn't a fan of Suicide Squad (2016). My review on that film received a whopping 5.5/10. Thankfully I found Birds of Prey to be a significant improvement as a sequel.Birds of Prey is a fun and brainless action film. While the plot is basic, it feels fitting for this instalment. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is once again perfect in every way. Her facials and dialogue delivery with this character ticks every box. She is extremely convincing in this role and I'm reminded that she was born to play this character.Margot Robbie isn't the only major character from the DC Universe in this sequel. For the film's villain, we have actor Ewan McGregor suiting up as Black Mask. McGregor gave a pleasant performance but as key character I was slightly disappointed to see there was no back story or explanation as to why the character exists or does the things he does. The use of colours throughout is also creative and goes along perfectly with stunning and entertaining action sequences. The film's audio and visuals were stunning and a great compliment.Any issues with Birds of Prey are minor ones. With Harley Quinn as a leading character, some other characters (such as Black Mask) don't get enough screen time or back story. The way the film tells its story may annoy some movie lovers. The film's plot constantly goes backwards and forwards, designed to give the audiences twist and mysteries. Even if some scenes don't make sense at the time, they will later in the film.Overall, Birds of Prey is a major improvement when compared to Suicide Squad (2016). Sure, the plot is basic but it's also just brainless entertainment and I had a blast watching it. Actress Margot Robbie is simply amazing as this character and naturally steals the show once again. Some key characters sadly (such as the villain) aren't given enough screen time or really fleshed out with any type of solid back story. The film's style in story telling will annoy some, but again, I found it welcoming and fun. 7.9/10 - Walkden Entertainment",Birds of Prey

208,zac-04879,Underrated Action-Comedy Pleasure,8,7 July 2021,"Margot Robbie certainly delivers the fun, fresh and comical Harley Quinn in this fast action-comedy. However, if it weren't for how well constructed and pleasurable the idea of Birds of Prey turned out to be, it would've been known as terribly executed and forgettable. The story revolves around Harley Quinn joining superheroes Black Canary, Huntress and Renee Montoya after being dumped by the Joker, to protect a mischievous girl from the wacky villain, Black Mask (also known as Roman Sionis played by Ewan McGregor).It's a pretty simple idea, but Birds of Prey ended up being an incredibly entertaining story with plenty of violent, silly action and enjoyable humour. Other than the entertainment value, another excellent element of this film is the characters. They're completely ridiculous and silly, but that's what's good about them. The lead superheroes, and villains, are fun and have well built personalities and looks.There's also lots of skill, action and laughs throughout the movie, which is obviously what you expect from a recent action-comedy. But most action films today are tedious, flat and boring. Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn) is definitely a fun DC witness for teens and fans of other films like Suicide Squad. The storytelling and events the film provides are light-hearted but violent delight.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Birds of Prey

210,darkreignn,"""Birds of Prey"" will give you one hell of a time at the theatre",9,9 February 2020,"""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn,"" could have, and should have, had a shorter title. To be honest with you, I feel like that's a major reason of why this movie have been underperforming. Well, that, and I'm sure the trailer, which echoed the schizophrenic tone of ""Suicide Squad's"" trailer, rubbed a lot of people the wrong way, esepcially since ""Suicide Squad"" was very mediocre to a lot of people. And that's a shame, because ""Birds of Prey"" is a million times better than ""Suicide Squad"" and the most entertaining DC film since I can't even remember when.First things first: Harley Quinn was looking fuegisimo in this movie. I actually found it interesting that so many people in the movie wanted to kill her because I'll be honest, I wanted to do something else to her if you catch my drift (make love). But beyond that, Margot Robbie is the ultimate Harley Quinn; I can't imagine anyone else in the role. From mannerisms to speech patterns, she embodies the character perfectly and is a blast to watch on screen. And even though the title of this movie is ""Birds of Prey,"" make no mistake: this is Harley's movie, through and through. In fact, the titular Birds of Prey don't even unite until the final 30 minutes of the film, and don't even officially become the Birds of Prey until literally the minute or two before the credits roll. So if you wanted more Harley and were worried those pesky other super villains would take away her stardom, don't be.From beginning to end, this movie is flat-out fun. Filled with bright colors, loud music, and goofy, Saturday morning cartoon-esque comedy, unless your name is Dan, I think you'll find something to enjoy in this movie. For one, this movie feels a lot like Scott Pilgrim with it's loud, poppy music, and vibrant, neon colors. Hardly a minute goes by in this film without an explosion of color and near-deafening music blaring, and that's a good thing. Sufferers from ADD fear not, because this movie is better than taking a Ritalin. I mean seriously, there's always something bombastic going on, and the editing ensures everything moves forward at breakneck pace.Now, you may be wondering, ""God damn, with this R-rating, how violent is this movie?!"" Well, not very. You see, there are few CGI spatters of blood that are very blink and you'll miss it, and there is one mildly gruesome scene involving Victor Zsasz and someone else's face, but other than that, and besides the exorbitant use of the f-word, this movie could've easily been PG-13, and should have been. Listen, I like bloody violence as much as the next guy, and I expected to see some in this movie. There wasn't. But honestly, that didn't bother me because of how great the action was filmed. Long takes, wide shots, slow motion when appropriate, and great choreography all combined to make some of the best action set-pieces I've scene since the John Wick movies. Now, I will say, this action isn't as good as John Wick, only because our heroines never really get hurt. You see, when they're fighting their enemies, the enemies just kind of stand still and let themselves get beat up. It's mildly distracting for sure, but it doesn't detract from the fun and excitement of the action scenes; I just wanted to bring that up, because it is a criticism.And when it comes to other criticisms, my biggest one is probably the fact that every man in this movie is a scum bag. I get it, this is a women empowerment movie, but literally every man in this movie is a horrible awful person, and it's kind of annoying, especially since the main villain, Black Mask, played by Ewan McGregor, seems to hate women for really no reason at all. But while this didn't bother me too much, I can see it bothering a lot of other people. And since I mentioned Ewan McGregor, I might as well talk about him now. This dude was amazing in this movie. He was so much fun to watch on screen and chewed up the scenery every time he was. This is definitely my favorite villain that DC has ever had on screen before, and I guarantee you that you're going to love watching Ewan in action. You've never seem him like this before, folks! But, I would feel wrong without mentioning only one complain about Black Mask: He's basically Joker 2.0. And this seems to be a problem that DC has with their villains. I mean, between Lex Luthor in BvS and Black Mask in this movie, DC really needs to think up some new ideas before audiences get fatigued from the crazy, goofy, insane villain cliche. But, regardless, I loved Black Mask and appreciated that ""Birds of Prey"" didn't resort to having an end of the world sub plot, and kept the villain and his plans very small scale.""Birds of Prey"" is the best time I've had in a theatre in 2020, and I'm extremely looking forward to watching it again. Definitely give this movie a chance because it deserves your support, and trust me, you'll have fun.9/10",Birds of Prey

Batman vs Superman, awsome, Justice league topped that, suicide squad and it was all about Harley Quinn and fabolous acting of Margot Robbie, but why this horrible flick after all that good work.
Joker was the best movie of all and now this is a complete disgrace to the franchise.
Firstly, Margot Robbie was superb in it, perhaps the only one who worked full heartedly.
Mary Elizabeth Winstead, never mind, she just like, the unnecessary. Jurnee Smollett-Bell, who and what she was, clueless till the end. Ella Jay Basco, super old for the role and cast. Ewan McGregor, you were not suppose to play joker and should not have been too inspired while filming for this.

213,TheCorniestLemur,Maybe not that fantabulous,6,10 November 2021,"I'm...surprised? Pleasantly surprised?The thought of any kind of sequel or spin-off to Suicide Squad, of all films in the DCEU thus far, was enough to make my stomach turn and my eyes roll back far enough for me to be looking at my own brain, but having said that, I'd be downright impressed if this was somehow as bad as Suicide Squad.There's still quite a gap between ""as bad as Suicide Squad"" and ""actually enjoyable"", however, and I was expecting this to fall somewhere into that gap, but I'll be damned, I actually kind of enjoyed this.It's far from perfect though, there's quite a few jokes that fall completely flat, the ""lawl randuhm"" presentation is often kind of annoying, there's some serious structural issues, particularly around the middle, there's still the occasional Suicide Squad-esque cringey soundtrack choice, and the potential depth of all the other characters is completely thrown under the bus for Harley's, making them all pretty boring.Having said that, given that Margot Robbie was just about the only part of Suicide Squad I could see some potential in, I did find myself not really minding all that much that she is the focus, and even though I think I would usually find this character really irritating, she's so damn good in this role that even her not so good one liners didn't really bother me.The other stand out is Ewan McGregor, who wouldn't have been my first choice for playing Black Mask, but he really does pull off the role of a crime lord, and you can tell he was having a lot of fun with it too.The story is fine overall, nothing you haven't seen before, but the thing I was possibly most impressed and surprised by were the action scenes. There's quite a lot of them for a film less than two hours long, and they're so much better than I expected. Then I found out that they brought on some of the fight choreographers from the John Wick films, and goddamn does it show.And I could yammer on about how it's not amazingly directed or shot, but I had fun, and that's already more than I expected, so this is a significant improvement from you know what.",Birds of Prey

Like, why does Harley Quinn not even look like Harley Quinn anymore?Anyway, after hearing mixed things I had to see the movie for myself, and it really isn't that great. Robbie is having fun in the role, and there is some decent action, but the plot is nonexistant, and it feels like yet another comicbook movie thats only interested in setting up characters for the next one.There are a bunch of cringey moments, and Ewan McGregor is almost as bad as Black mask, as Jared Leto was as the Joker, with his campy approach.It all feels totally unnecessary, and a step backwards after the new Joker movie was so great.

DC R-rated movie since Suicide Squad, and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker. It's absolutely everything you ever wanted from Deadpool himself. It's funny, action packed, dazzling, massive thrill ride, and masterpiece, and colorful explosive DC Extravaganza! Margot Robbie has done it again as Harley Quinn! And Ewan McGregor is not so bad as the Black Mask, one of the best supervillain of Batman Universe. This reminds me of one of the best DC's #1 hit from DC Universe... Harley Quinn.

Someone decided to ""try"" and make a DC version of Deadpool with Harley Quinn in the lead. This was a bad decision since you can see that the screen writer did not understand the comedic part of Deadpool and could not find the proper lines and scenes to match. Robbie is also awful trying to give a comedic performance - her performance is so bland and lifeless that it is embarrassing.
The supporting cast is beyond idiotic. The writer destroyed Huntress and Black Canary and instead of making them nice strong characters she made them a mockery with terrible performances and dialogue.

218,ivanmessimilos,Big pointless mess,3,27 August 2021,"A big mess from the movie, like they had no idea what to do. The film was supposed to be called Harley Quinn because it really has nothing to do with Birds of prey. Harley is the central and main character of the whole film and practically the only positive thing. The other characters are irrelevant, unimportant and do not have a good story behind them and characterization. The main villain is the caricature itself, it is neither funny nor scary. The whole movie wasn't funny to me at all or anything particularly entertaining. By far the worst DC movie on my list. What is the point of this movie anyway?",Birds of Prey
219,Chalice_Of_Evil,Suicide Blonde...,8,7 February 2020,"After an animated backstory of Dr. Harleen Quinzel's journey to becoming Harley Quinn (narrated by the film's star, Margot Robbie, who provides voice-over throughout the film), she breaks up with the Joker as only Harley can: Ace Chemicals go BOOM. Not having thought this through, Harley finds she has no shortage of scumbags gunning for her who were only held at bay by her connection with Mr. J.Meanwhile, there's a Gotham City crime lord called Roman Sionis/Black Mask (Ewan McGregor), who has a penchant for peeling faces off and is after a diamond that'll apparently help him seize control of the city. It eventually winds up in the hands (or rather stomach) of pickpocket, Cassandra Cain, who Harley finds herself wanting to help (for as long as it suits her, anyway).Also in the mix are a singer from Roman's nightclub (Dinah Lance/Black Canary), a cop (Renee Montoya) and a vigilante known as the 'Crossbow Killer' (aka Huntress). The first two get a decent amount of screentime and interact with Harley quite a bit, but unfortunately Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Helena Bertinelli feels underused and only really gets any time to shine towards the end of the film.The story is told in a non-linear fashion, which is something you'll either be fine with/able to follow or it will make you feel the film is 'all over the place'/'confusing'. It's actually not that hard if you pay attention. Could the story have been told in a 'simpler' fashion? Probably, but why should it? Other comic book films have played around with story structure, so why can't this one? And there's also nothing wrong with the film's soundtrack either.Margot Robbie's portrayal of Harley, like in Suicide Squad, continues to be the best part. She just brings so much energy and a real sense of 'fun' to the film, switching between a range of emotions, letting loose with her character's various quirks (her continued mission to enjoy an ever-elusive egg sandwich), taking delight in beating up bad guys (though resorting to non-lethal beanbag guns and glitter bombs when it comes to certain people) and adopting a pet hyena she calls Bruce (named after, according to Harley, ""that hunky Wayne guy"").Regarding the film's humour, it's no worse than 'bro humour' you get in films all the time, the only difference is this time it's female characters who are cursing/dishing out violence aplenty and enjoying themselves as they do so. No doubt this film will be put under unfair scrutiny, receive harsh judgement and all sorts of nitpicking from certain types of people (mostly those who were never going to give it a chance to begin with), but it isn't a movie for them. It's for those looking to go on an enjoyable fun ride.",Birds of Prey
220,TheVictoriousV,"A film I'm sure I'm not angry enough or happy enough at, as usual",5,7 February 2020,"Birds of Prey takes the DC comic-book movies back to basics after going artsy on us with Joker. Here's what I foresaw from the get-go (because it's easy to envision the future with films like this): ""Birds of Prey isn't really going to be that different from the previous time Margot Robbie portrayed beloved Joker sidekick Harley Quinn in terms of filmmaking quality, but it will be more overtly female-empowering in its themes and action, ergo the critics will let it slide"". And I don't think they strictly would have, were it not for the fanboys; now there's someone out there to spite.What makes Birds of Prey potentially worse off than Suicide Squad, which still did well financially, is that it falls into the modern habit of pandering to a crowd that will ensure better reviews, at the expense of the only sorts who would excitedly pay to see a Suicide Squad-type stinker in theatres. Nerds like that tend to be the most offended at inclusive, anti-patriarchal platitudes, so why alienate the only people who would've secured financial success (it's not like the average comic-book audience attends a film based on approval from critics)? Of course, anti-fanboy comments didn't harm Captain Marvel's box office. Is the popularity of Joker and Shazam gonna save this one? Will the progressive attitude make it succeed with another audience, even though this failed to salvage Charlie's Angels? Is the brand gonna help that? We'll see.I do agree that this is better than Suicide Squad (if I'm even allowed to acknowledge that film, what with James Gunn's forthcoming reattempt at a Suicide Squad stand-alone flick within the DCEU). It's superior in terms of characterization, cohesive editing, watchable color-grading, and having settled for one consistent tone by the time of filming - not having to make it a comedy in post with obnoxious graphics and hip music. Now we have something that's exhaustingly cartoonish throughout (Harley was already prone to getting old fast).The main character is definitely crazed ex-therapist Harley Quinn, despite the Birds of Prey comics ordinarily being ensemble pieces, and the fact that she is slightly more human than the ditzy sex object we last saw Robbie play has been enough for people to preemptively name the film either horrible or excellent. The rest include Rosie Perez as Officer Montoya, Jurnee Smollett-Bell as metahuman Black Canary, and last but not least, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress, who will be the forthcoming subject of ""This is totally me"" memes for girls who aren't preppy enough to communicate their supposed quirkiness via the Harley imagine macros. I take back what I said; DC knows precisely which audience to go for.The baddie this time is Black Mask (Ewan McGregor), whom I've known since teenhood as the DC mythos' equivalent to Red Skull, although his weirdly colored skull is merely a spooky mask worn by a cartoonishly sexist mob boss, don't you worry. His goons, including another well-known Batman villain named Zsasz (Chris Messina), are after a young diamond-stealer named Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco), one of Batgirl's alter-egos from the comics. Initially, some of the Birds of Prey are also after Cassandra, in accordance with Black Mask's bounty, or each other. The team proper isn't formed until the finale, in fact, but I guess the film's subtitle prevents its main title from being all too misleading.The heroines engage in ambitiously shot fight scenes, but the lack of quick cuts (although they're usually an annoyance) makes the occasional choreography hiccups too obvious. I suppose I should suspend my disbelief and enjoy the spectacle without nitpicking, but why settle with what's put before me when long-take fight scenes like those of Oldboy exist? Why pretend this is the best we can do?I don't know. I don't know how to review this in such a way that anyone from either side will hear me out, because I'm not inflating my verdict one way or the other, based on who I'm trying to annoy. I try to look at what's actually happening on the screen and how I feel about those things - one of several reasons I have my doubts I will ever get to do this as anything more than a hobby.I fear I am welcome amongst neither published film critics nor YouTube ranters (exceptions including the likes of YourMovieSucks and RedLetterMedia, since one gets the impression that they're sincerely sharing their opinions on the filmmaking, rather than largely basing the verdict on how feminist and/or anti-male they perceive the overall attitude to be). But then, I never did think fitting into one group was a virtue. Guys, what if I'M the Joker? So edgy!I appreciate the usage of Björk's ""It's Oh So Quiet"" in the trailer, though. I'll give you one half of a point extra for that.",Birds of Prey

Margot is so amazing in everything she does and I honestly like her as Harley Quinn. I liked the idea of the all female cast but not this particular cast, they didn't mesh well together and have very few scenes together. Also, where was the story? I found no exciting plot, nothing thrilling. Not a Rosie Perez fan, she had almost no need being there? Mary Elizabeth winstead im also not a fan of, she barely had a role. You can also throw in Ewan McGregor in there with not very likable. (Also I couldn't avoid the home wrecking business between them in the press :( I tried but ugh).

Cheap laughs...if even that.Joker in a R rating worked, because you could follow the story arch. Birds lacked any real story or script. To fill the R rating , they just added the F word arbitrarily throughout. And the movie felt like a DC version of Clockwork Orange in a weak attempt to feel adult like. Instead of feeling edgy, it was more repulsive. And black canaries last second superpower felt triteSuch a pity.

223,carlos37andre,Enough entertainment,6,26 February 2020,"I love Margot as Harley, I can't imagine anyone else but her playing the character, she is awesome.The movie is funny at times, and it has great fight scenes (I really think that's the strength of it). It has some plot holes (namely, how did Harley knew who had the diamond...?), but it's fine, I won't get into it that much.I love Ewan as Black Mask, I think he is over the top just enough that's truly entertaining to see him on screen every time.I don't like the storytelling approach they kind of went for it when trying to tell the story tho, for most of it, the storyline is all over the place, and can get a bit annoying at times. Maybe that's what they were going for? Sure, still, I don't think it was the right choice.I agree somewhat with some of the criticism that I saw some people having towards the movie. Yes, I think that sometimes, the its formula can get pretty dated, and you pretty much can see where they are going. Every single man on screen is a jerk, or a rapist, and etc. But again, I get what message the movie was trying to pass, even though it's far from being subtle, I think that it manages to give Harley the so called emancipation, and well, I'm ok with that.
If they ever make a sequel, I truly think that the formula cannot survive one more time tho, they will have to re-think some stuff.Overall, Birds of Prey: Harley Quinn, or whatever it's been called nowadays, is a good movie, is definitely better than Suicide Squad, it has great action scenes, and great acting, is funny enough and will get you entertained for most of its runtime.",Birds of Prey
224,ripcords,Love Margot Robbie. Just not this film...,5,19 August 2020,"Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is awesome. This film just doesn't cut it, unfortunately.

225,GomezAddams666,It's just okay...,6,7 February 2020,"A lot of conversations have flown around the quality and the message of this film. And in all fairness this is an okay movie, it's not bad, it's not good, it's just okay.In the great pantheon of Comic Book Movies I think this one shouldn't even be in the top twenty-five. It has nice set pieces, a few good action bits and a good soundtrack, I'll give it that.Margot Robbie is amazing as Harley Quinn, and Rosie Perez delivers an amazing performance as Detective Renee Montoya, that's pretty much it, other than that is a pretty by-he-numbers film, a pop corn movie with very few laughs.Jurnee Smollett-Bell is unrecognizable as Black Canary, she was pretty much thrown into the mix and the character could have been called any other name and it wouldn't have made a difference. Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who is famous for starring in Final Destination and Scott Pilgrim vs. the world phones it in as Huntress, but the worst of the bunch is Ewan McGregor, he plays Black Mask in a way that's very reminiscent to Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor, in a very flamboyant and colorful way that makes him more of a spoiled brat than a feared villain.The message was loud and clear, too. If you have heard people saying this movie does not have one good male character who's not a prick, an incompetent jerk, an imbecile or a would-be-rapist, believe them.This movie would have worked a whole lot better if it was a Harley Quinn solo project, as the group dynamic feels incredibly forced.Let's hope Harley finds the Gotham City Sirens, but then again, if it might end up like this movie, perhaps is better if she doesn't.",Birds of Prey
226,Tcarts76,If you get an A-list star don't use a B movie formula,4,22 March 2020,"I heard a lot of bad reviews before seeing this movie. Many said that they tried to lessen Harley Quinn's sex appeal and that was why it did poorly. While I could see why some may say that, I still think Margot Robbie brings the sex appeal anyway and that is not a problem. This movie suffers from several problems but that is not a horrible faux pas though, let's face it, Harley Quinn is a comic book character and sex appeal is the main sticking point for her character. I am being extreme gracious by giving this a 4 and that is because Robbie is always great to look at and may have been the only one not fully ruining men and women's Harley Quinn fantasies.The biggest problem here is they took Margot Robbie who they expected to bring in A-list movie bucks but they used a really bad B-movie formula. Most of the movie is a Jason Statham or Jackie Chan movie. Nothing wrong with those guys but this is not Jason Statham Fast & Furious franchise but Jason Statham when he was second fiddle to Jet Li in the Hong Kong movie scene. It is not Jackie Chan in Rush Hour, but the Jackie Chan in multiple movies years prior to Rumble in the Bronx and only seen well after they had already been released. You have Margot Robbie who is about the hottest girl in Hollywood next to Samara Weaving and everyone else is the nameless faceless, non-acting Hong Kong movie scene. She deserves a cast and crew that makes big movies not this dribble.Speaking of bad B-movies... Ewan McGregor has been living off the fumes of his one good movie, ""Trainspotting,"" forever. He was in the horrible Star Wars prequels that everyone wishes were never made. To be honest, this was likely his second best role though he did once get to play act next to Scarlett Johanson in a forgettable movie before. The problem is you saddled him with a relatively unknown character and if you are going to make a comic book villian at least give him a mask that will challenge that of a middle school kid with $5 and a ride to Michael's arts and crafts. Rosie Perez? Are you kidding? She hasn't been in demand since ""White Men Can't Jump!"" If you wanted grandma as the bad ass female cop you could have probably sprung for Betty White instead.Even though Suicide Squad was bad, you can't expect this pile of slop to haul in big dollars when you went out to get a quality purebred race horse like Robbie, but then saddle her with Hong Kong B-movie everything else. It doesn't help they made the name of it so long know one will waste time trying to remember it. You use the Hong Kong crew when you can't get play and roles in Hollywood. They make some semi-watchable action flicks that from time to time rocket ship a few stars to Hollywood big time movie fame. What you do not do is get your big time Hollywood superstar and send her to the minor leagues if you are expecting gold at the movie ticket office.",Birds of Prey

230,Lewis_Heather787,The story just isn't that interesting !!!!!,6,15 February 2020,"So we have arrived at the 8th instalment of the loosely connected and half rebooted DC extended Universe / Worlds of DC..........comic book film connected universe thing.........I'm lost these days, I have no idea whats going on with Warner Bros.Anyway this is the first all female lead , directed and written team up movie within the comic book landscape. Warner Bros / DC were the first to give a woman director and lead their first shot with 2017's ""Wonder Woman""...........now fast forward to 2020 and we have ""Birds of Prey"".......well for short, what a stupid title that other Harley Quinn stuff is.I am gonna be honest I had no expectations going in, the trailer looked alright but I knew I was gonna watch it any way. I am so mixed on this film...........the over riding feeling I got from this film was that the individual characters and their back stories were more interesting that the overall narrative of the film. The story to this film is just bland , boring and nothing really that new, fresh or exciting..........which is a let down. However there is a lot to like about the film its just unfortunate that the film around these interesting characters and great performances , isn't as good.Margot Robbie , what can I say..........she was terrible.........nah im joking,,,,,,,,she was obviously great again in the role of Harley Quinn. There is an attempt to flesh her character out more in this film and give here a proper arc that she was missing in 2016's ""Suicide Squad"".............This is cliche but I don't think there is another actress out there that could embody the role as well as Robbie does.........its not just the physicality but its the complete bonkers speech / dialogue pattern that is really impressive.The rest of the ensemble cast is great in there performances however I just have a few extra shoutouts to give. Firstly Ewan McGregor.......to be honest I am slightly biased because I think the man is a tremendous actor , I have done for years.....he cant do much wrong for me in my eyes. However I have to say that he was extremely good as a villain, you can tell he was having fun in the role. He brought such menacing energy and unpredictably , which you desperately need in a character without any super powers. Brilliant !!!!! The other shoutout for me goes to Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress, a character that I personally have been waiting to see on the big screen......such a rich background to the character that you can build on......would love to see her in future instalments of the franchise!!!My final positive area of the film is the directing from Cathy Yan. I could be wrong but I am pretty sure that this is her feature film debut or a debut of some description..........I swear I read that somewhere, I could be wrong. To be perfectly honest you would not have thought that this was made by a less experienced director.......the film had a nice flow, and was visually pleasing to watch!!!However all these good aspects of the film were let down badly by the story......its just so cliche and boring...........I don't no what else to say.........It was really dull for the majority, it sort of hit me about 20 mins.......how this film was going to go and yes funnily enough it did...........was hoping for some twists but nope........oh wellOverall for me this film won't be remember that fondly , I don't think the re-watchability factor for me with this film is going to be very high. Its 65% out of 100 or 6.5 out of 10........overall its just average/ok....meh........could this be the first DC film that everyone agrees is just ok, neither great or trash..........I doubt it. However thats not to say that there aren't some really good things in the film. I would love to see more of , Harley Quinn , Huntress and Black Canary in future films............unfortunately this film doesn't back up those characters and great performances.",Birds of Prey

232,mr_bickle_the_pickle,"Not so Fantubulous, Harley Quinn",6,7 February 2020,"I thought the film was kind of meh. First of all the film kind of takes awhile to get to the main plot. We start off with basically a montage/narration of the stuff Harley is doing post-breakup. You get a Suicide Squad style of announcing the characters you're gonna meet. The movie evenually gets to a point where Harley shows up at a police station and then the narration basically goes ""I need to tell you how I ended up here"" and we go back in time to an earlier point in the film. This is the moment where I thought to myself ""This is seriously taking awhile to get to this film's meat and potatoes. Is there no way they could have streamlined this? So anyway, you eventually get all caught up and brought up back to the current timeline. Its also within the same police station sequence that has some bad fight choreography. Like the typical everyone stand back while the protagonist fights off everyone one by one lameness. There's also a scene where Harley gets hit in the head and has a Marilyn Monroe sequence and I thought ""Why?"". It ends nothing to the film. It's just filler. There was other stuff to, things you'll have to suspend disbelief over, stuff like that.I also did not care for Ewan McGregor's character Black Mask. He was too cartoony. I mean, one might argue that Harley Quinn is pretty cartoony herself...but it works for her character. I just didnt find Black Mask to be threatening in any way. He was just silly. I was more disturbed by his right hand man played by Chris Messina. There wasn't really enough of Huntress for me to feel a connection to her. I thought Jurnee as Black Canary was good. I did really like Rosie Perez and felt like she was the second standout of the film for me. But of course Margot is the star of the film and she is really good at being Harley.I dont think the film was totally bad. There were some stuff that genuinely made me laugh and smile. And I did really the scenes and action when they finally got all together to fight (though this is towards the end of the film).But unfortunately moments dont really make a movie. Having some kick-ass moments or some funny lines doesnt really undo the pacing issues, some of the cringy dialogue and acting...and the very basic story. If Im being honest, I think this another miss on DC's list.",Birds of Prey
233,dormesher-21565,Great DC film better than Suicide Squad,8,9 February 2020,"Birds of Prey and The Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn. A great film in the DCEU not one of the best but one I enjoyed more than Suicide Squad with a simple story and some fantastic action this film is a fun ride from start to finish.The story is very simple but works for the movie the idea of Harley now going on her own is an amazing idea and this is great adaptation of that story arc from the comics.
Margot Robbie does an amazing job once again in the main role.The Birds of Prey are introduced and there story ties in with Harleys in a very good way and these characters are handled really well my favourite being The Huntress she was great the only downfall is we don't see enough of them as the Birds Of Prey and its treated more of like a backdoor pilot so they can do a spinoff movie.Ewan McGregor is fantastic in this as Black Mask it's not an adaptation I would of done with the character but it works for the movie and he does a brillant job in the role.
There are some unnecessary moments with him though like when hes making the woman strip in the club.The action is fantasic in this movie and a lot of fun to watch and I will say its the best action in a DC movie to date in my opinion it has a very John Wick style to it and is very stylish.
The humour in the movie is handled really well as well.The only real issues I have with the movie are We don't see the Birds Of Prey team that much and it seems more of a set up for another movie.
There's also some unnecessary scenes the club scene with Black Mask and there's a scene with Harley doing a Marilyn Monroe scene that just seems out of place.The final action scene is my favourite moment the Black Canary moment was awesome for a comic fan such a fun action scene and has some great comedy moments in it as well it also shows how great they work as a team.Verdict 8.5/10 a great movie that is alot of fun and has some great action in it Harley is fantastic and the Birds Of Prey characters are great just wish we saw more of them.

234,Avwillfan89,Men who hate women,7,6 March 2020,"Although Harley Quinn is a villain in the DC world, she's pretty much evolved into an anti hero who is relatable in many ways. She's not perfect and can be an asshole sometimes, but she manages to come off likeable thanks to her one-liners and badassery.Despite this film having a fun edge to it, there are a lot more serious issues going on. The main villain Sionis is a class A violent misogynist. He takes pleasure in cutting off people's faces, slapping around Harley while she is tied to a chair and horrifically humiliating a random woman who laughs too much at his club. Ewan McGregor wanted to make sure that everyone knew that there was no laughing matter in this guy, as he is epitome of entitled, violent men who take what they want, when they want.Women are not allowed to be themselves or even do their jobs the way they want. In the cases of Detective Montoya and Black Canary, they are forced to bend to the will of men in order to just simply exist. Harley's immunity from all the people she's wronged goes out the window the moment she and the Joker break up.Although this was a brilliant film about emancipation, I only wish it would have been a bit more powerful than that, other than breaking bad guys's legs.I also wished Huntress was featured a little more, as her character was badass and wicked.",Birds of Prey

I appreciate that it's trying to make up for the DC film universe's past ineptitude and bleakness by being a flippant and flashy romp in the mold of Deadpool, but there isn't a strong enough script to keep it afloat. Too much style, not enough substance. It completely wastes its potential of being a gripping yet witty character study. With Harley Quinn that practically writes itself.The performances are utterly charmless and forgettable and it feels like the whole time a different and more interesting film is trying to escape but can't because it's being roped down aggressively by formula. The action has its amusing moments but it gets carried away with the slow motion effects and for an R-rated film it's absurdly tame. By no means the worst to come out of DC, but it's still abysmal. Birds of Prey is disjointed, predictable and above all, tedious.I recommend watching the recent Harley Quinn animated series instead.

Excellent performance as the character.Great soundtrack too and decent action, although very unrealistic, it's ok.A good hero needs a stronger villain than them, to overcome. Sadly, the writer fails here. Ewan plays the part very well, but the character itself is weak. Mid level criminal and It takes all the Birds of Prey to overcome him and his goons for hire. Ruined the guts of the movie.Huntress is the only other bird of prey with substance. The rest are pointless or perhaps just badly constructed. Pointless really.This really should have been just a Harley Quinn film with assistance from a bird of prey or two. With a bad guy on the level or the joker.I was expecting a man hating movie or women are better than men theme. It had me in the bench on wether to see it or not.

242,Boristhemoggy,I'm very sad at what this film could have been....but wasn't.,5,8 March 2020,"They're offering covid-19 as the reason Birds of Prey bombed. I beg to differ.
I looked forward very much to this movie; I love Ewan McGregor and I adore MEW and Margot Robbie.
However, MEW needs a powerful story to really shine, and she did not have this as the screenplay was sub par even for an am dram by high school students.
Robbie needs a powerful and intelligent director to really shine, and this she did not have. The bits that were good about her scenes came from her, and not the director.
McGregor needs strong direction but good dialogue, and he had neither. He did well with what he had though.
The story was half put together and reminded me of a first draft script that hasn't been worked on. I still don't know anything about McGregor's character.
Finally, the non stop asides and throwbacks throughout the movie, voiced in that ridiculous accent, were off putting and not always useful to the story.
The film had no soul, no flow, and absolutely appalling directing and screenplay. The score was pretty poor too. I gave this 5 and 3 of those points were for Robbie, Winstead and McGregor for making the best job they could of a crap film.",Birds of Prey

Because to be completely honest, they were the only thing that made the first episode of this Duology (Thus Far!) worth watching. In any case, the plot (Thin though it be!) is terrible, so the pacing is more like meandering while hurrying though some Cinematic Hellscape instead of purposeful. Next on the list comes the acting and dialogue delivery which is perhaps the worst in cinematic His-Story. It's like the director, Cathy Yan, had no clue where to take this film, so she just kept shooting. And because Robbie was the lead actress and producer, she kept acting. No wonder the Joker booted Harley out of his life. The only shame is that we got stuck with her after the breakup. Oh The Humanity!",Birds of Prey
244,Slarkshark,Better than 'Suicide Squad'... Barely,7,3 December 2020,"Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor are good, the rest of the cast is pretty forgettable. 'Birds of Prey' was still a bit of a mess, but I see what it was trying to do and it had a goal. It was trying to be edgy, colourful, and filled with violent fun, but It's no 'Deadpool'. I would give this somewhere around a 6.7/10, so I was generous and rounded up. 'Suicide Squad' was just lost throughout and felt thrown together with some cool characters. This was able to take one of the more interesting characters, that being Harley Quinn and expanded on her persona.Seems to be a lot of hate towards this film. A lot of people calling it a social justice girl power flick. I mean, sure if that's how you choose to see it that's all you're gonna see as I won't deny there is definitely a component of that throughout. Just remember it's 2020, and that is the current trend, especially since the world has been fighting for equality, so of course there is going to be movies like this. It's to be expected, so relax.

Yesterday, I experienced an abomination that the worst people in hell should be subjected to on a daily basis.Birds of Prey got to be a case study on how not to make a movie. It is a monstrosity like no other in terms of every imaginable cinematographic aspect. From atrocious look, story and pacing to the horrendous acting and dialogue.

I loved violence, but fight scenes were slow enough to see that it was choreographed. The scene when she got slapped by the mob boss and they showed some random scene with Harley performing a song which confused me. The scene where she kicked the phone at a cop was mad unrealistic. The hyena was hilarious to see. Breaking the fourth wall in Narration was funny as well. Harley Quinn has been through the worse it seems.

248,MinistryofDoom,Mista J was a Big Fat Meanie: The Movie,7,6 April 2020,"Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn is as ridiculous as it sounds, but Harley Quinn is quite the ridiculous character herself. For the most part, the DC Extended Universe has been largely hit or miss. Since its inception, it has always felt like an on-the-whim pop culture reaction to get on board with the way that other studios are heading. The DCEU has never felt like it simmered in long-term development and planning to create one cohesive ""extended universe"" across multiple films. That is one of the many reasons why, with eight films under its belt, it has not been met with critical success and box office records like the far more visionary and cohesive MCU. The once area where Warner/DC succeeded is in casting. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, Henry Cavill as Superman, and, yes, Margot Robbie as one Harley Quinn.Margot Robbie was born for this role. She is the perfect Harley Quin, down to the mannerisms, and quirky spunk, and certainly the voice affectations that I'm more than convinced were inspired by Harley's Batman: The Animated Series personification. While 2016's Suicide Squad was an abysmal failure (for far too many reasons to mention here), it did shine the spotlight on Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn who did a superb job in her role. Now, here, in Birds of Prey, she resumes that role in what is considered a spiritual sequel to the Suicide Squad of 2016 (note that Margot Robbie will reappear as Harley Quinn in James Gunn's reboot of The Suicide Squad in 2021).Birds of Prey begins with a time jump into the future after the events of Suicide Squad by explaining the outcome of Jared Leto's Joker and Robbie's Harley. While a few brief flashback scenes depict what transpired between Joker and Harley, with the implication that this is the same Joker from Suicide Squad, Jared Leto does not appear in this film (He is reportedly done with this role following a fallout with Warner/DC over Todd Phillips' Joker film starring Joaquin Phoenix). Harley is recovering from her fallout with the Joker, which has left her vulnerable to retaliation from a wide assortment of Gotham City's seedy villains, one of whom is Roman Sionis...aka: The Black Mask played by Ewan McGregor. Sionis is a millionaire playboy who is connected to dark underworld Gotham City and lives a life of crime and violence. He's basically the evil version of Bruce Wayne. McGregor is fantastic in his role but his character suffers from a lack of proper development and his placement as the films ultimate villain is a little under-whelming. The lack of character development seems too widespread in this film. All the proper elements are there. In addition to McGregor's Roman Sionis/Black Mask, the film features veteran DC characters Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), The Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez), Victor Zsasz (Chris Messina), and Cassandra Cain. The problem is that none of these characters are fully developed, nor are their depictions accurate to the DC Batman stories. For instance, Black Canary is a lounge singer who, for some strange reason, has Bruce Lee-level martial arts skills but is incapable of standing up to Sionis who puts trust in her more than he should. Most of all though, the story revolves around a young pickpocket named Cassandra Cain who stole something that she should not have. DC fans should know that name very well. Cassandra Cain is Batwoman but here she's an awkward little girl living on the streets. Maybe the DCEU will develop her into a future on-screen role as Batwoman but I sincerely have my doubts. I suspect it's just a clever nod to the comic books; a not so subtle Easter egg if you will.Overall, I think the film is very entertaining the opening sequence was just fantastic and a really great way to start the story. All of the characters were wonderfully cast. Rosie Perez was delightful as Montoya and Smollett-Bell, McGregor, Robbie, Messina, and Ella Jay Basco all deserve praise for their acting. I just think that this film could have spent a little more time in the writer's room and that Roman Sionis should have been much more menacing and threatening than what was depicted.",Birds of Prey

251,BrickNash,"Not a great film, but a fun one.",5,10 February 2020,"Birds of Prey feels like what Suicide Squad should have been. It's a Harley Quinn solo film, but dressed up as an ensemble piece, and with that it works becasue it focuses on the most interesting and fun character. The movie has some good visuals and stylish action to keep the viewer hooked, and there's a much better (and more subtle) use of music here than there was in Suicide Squad.It's not perfect though. Ewan McGregor is awful here as he hams it up in a very one dimensional performance, and the rest of the cast are quite forgettable. The narrative is choppy and sometimes I was confused as to just where I was in the film.As for the accusations of misandry and man hating, well yes there's no denying that there is a bit of that here. Almost every bad person in the movie is male, and most of them are portrayed as rapey and unfeeling pieces of s-h-i-t. It does sort of justify the violence against them, but it's a bit of a bad generalisation of men too.Still, Margot Robbie is thoroughly entertaining in the lead, but it would have been nicer if the film around her was a bit more coherent and less gimmicky.",Birds of Prey
252,snowfre,"Uneven pacing and tiresome narrative, but solid action entertainment",6,8 April 2020,"""Birds of Prey"" (with respect to the writers, let's not forget its subtitle ""and the Fantabulous Emancipation of Harley Quinn"") takes the breakout star character of the otherwise messy ""Suicide Squad"" and let her star in her very own movie. Harley Quinn, fantastically played by a vibrant Margot Robbie, tries time move on with her life after a breakup from the Joker (Jared Leto is thankfully never seen), and through a lot of coincidences ends up fighting crime lord Roman Sinois (McGregor). ""Birds of Prey"" is director Cathy Yan's second feature film and she goes all in on the action; the fighting scenes are nicely choreographed and the large, climatic fight is a pure joy to watch. Otherwise, this anti-hero bonanza struggles with a lot, mainly it's screenplay. As mentioned before, not much of the film's plot is driven by the characters, but rather the fact that they accidentally cross paths with each other, reservations made for Detective Montaya (Perez). I don't know sort of narrative writer Christina Hodson was looking for, but the pacing is uneven and while ""Birds of Prey"" is colorful and action packed, about 60% of its running time is occupied by non-chronological, long introductions of each main character. And while McGregor makes the cut for most memorable antagonist in the DCEU yet, with some strange, unexplained homoerotic moments with his assistant Zsazs (Messina), the conflict between the girls and the boys is not the as exciting as one might wish for in a superhero universe. It is obvious that Hodson and Yan wanted to make some sort of feminist statement, and while it isn't ""in your face"", I wish they would have focused more on the actual plot and character building of the characters supposed to co-star with our favorite psychiatrist-gone-mad, Harley Quinn. This is her movie and Robbie delivers uncountable amounts of ball bustings in this highly entertaining film that seems to lack any sense or point in terms of storytelling.",Birds of Prey
253,plasticanimalz,A Fun Film,7,9 February 2020,"I don't expect much from comic book movies these days, I just hope to at least not be bored, and pleasantly surprised if it's a genuinely good movie. This was entertaining and fun, with a lot of good moments, but the script being a little too all over the place and needing some doctoring stopped it from being a solid win. Yes, I had a great time and got my money's worth...I just saw its potential and could see that the studio dropped the ball where they invest multitudes of time, money, and marketing into their male-led counter parts...yet, many of those still end up being steaming piles of hot garbage.Of the new DC universe, this is one of the better ones. The action sequences were solid and had some really good moments in a genre that has become very been-there-done-that, with little fresh to add. I really enjoyed Harley's action scene with the bat. That was solid. Margot Robbie was excellent. I really liked her character in Suicide Squad and her acting, performance, and fight scenes were great. Frankly, after seeing this, women are better at action scenes. Their bodies can handle the acrobatics better and make it look more effortless and cool. Kind of like Ben Affleck in the bat suit looking ridiculous and all I can think is this is impossible for him to move under all that massive weight. There's a reason Asian men dominate in action and as action doubles, because their lean frames are perfect for action, just like the female frame is, which is why Gal Gadot and now Margot Robbie look great in those scenes. Marvel and DC should use this to their advantage rather than always sidelining the women. Sure, big dudes punching things has their place but trying to constantly push that these guys who don't have the frames for it are gymnastic or kung fu experts is ridiculous. And for all the men screaming at the computer that women can't fight and it's unrealistic, just remember that MMA cage matches always used to be won by the tiny dudes using jiu-jitsu, bringing down, giant, more impressive looking men. Or the true stories of elderly Filipino men in San Fransisco beating the crap out of multiple gang members with a walking cane as their kali stick.I also loved the Cassandra Cain character. She was a great sidekick to Harley. She was very endearing and did a good job as far as acting. I wish they could have brought the women together sooner as I wanted to know more about Huntress, and Canary wasn't given enough meat to her character in the time she's on screen. I thought they were a great team and I wish the script could have been more focused on them and less about Black Mask, which, frankly, Ewan was a bit overplayed for me. He was trying too hard to be Joker. He wasn't terrible, but he was a bit distracting and not a good enough villain to match Harley. And I hated Zsasz. I just could not picture that actor as a villain. He wanted to be that guy so much, all I can see is Mindy Project. He overcompensated and his character just didn't fit the film.The directing was decent and the script was okay. Not bad, it just could have used some help to tighten it up. I feel Cathy Yan has a good future, as the film was pretty good for a newbie. I've seen other female directors advanced to fill the gap who are not quite there yet like Susanna Fogel and Greta Gerwig. Please, I'm not buying all the Gerwig hype, and I enjoyed Birds of Prey far more than Little Women. The style Cathy Yan presented was great. I loved the animated intro and the motion graphics throughout the film. It made it a lot of fun and her style of using animation, slo-mo bits, was overall fresh and fun, and complimented Harley's erratic personality. It had elements of Baz Luhrmann, but not quite as consistent as Baz, but I'm comparing to Romeo and Juliet, where, Baz had a lot more time to craft his skills at that point, and Cathy is a newer director.While Birds of Prey will not go down in history it was a lot of fun and I would watch a sequel. And despite all the men crying about the injustice on IMDB of this film daring to exist, it is on par with the multitudes of comic book films they are under the delusion are works of art. With some polishing and tightening up the script, Birds of Prey could be DC's answer to Deadpool",Birds of Prey
254,skullhead739,A huge disappointment,4,30 May 2020,"After watching suicide squad one redeeming factor was harley Quinn. I had big Hope's for this film but it failed miserably, here's why.Acting:
I liked Margot robbie as harley Quinn. She did decent with what little she was given. Rosie Perez (the cop) did crap. I hate her in almost any role, she's such a bad actor. Her character was also terrible and under developed much the same with the other female cast members. I really like ewan mcgregor and he did have some funny/decent scenes in this. But again like the girls he was given little to work with and was severely under developed. It's hard to critic these actors performances when they were given such crap characterization.Cinematography:
Pretty decent shots and cgi. The fight scenes/coordination was random. Some fight scenes were really cool and brutal with bones being broken and environment destruction. But others were pathetic. The typical one vs one fight scenes whilst the 10 other goons just stand back and wait their turn is a joke. I know this is based from a comic book but that doesnt mean they have to have such a lame attempt at fight co ordination. They should take a page from sam hargrave.Story:
This plot seems like it was written in 10 mins whilst on the toilet. It was severely under developed, lacked any plot direction and characterization. However there was still some nice creative scenes. Like some fight scenes, explosions, and funny moments here and there. But most of the movie was so random and seemed to go from fight scene, music b roll scene, dialog scene, in random order. There was no real major meaning, villain or purpose to harley Quinn's journey and as a result of lacking characters and plot you get really damn bored by the end of this. The script seriously seems like it was given to a high schooler. The director, and writers should feel ashamed.Summary:
This isnt horrible because there is some decent and creative scenes. But the plot and characters were done terribly. So this is a 4/10 for me. I wouldnt recommend this, Watch deadpool instead.",Birds of Prey

While the usual ""its a woman"" movie complainers have tried their best to force people to avoid this movie, having watched it its not really a feminist movie. It just happens to be a movie that has women in it. I couldn't see a single incidence of male bashing throughout. And thats something I am always critical of.
The tone of the film is a bit strange for a superhero movie of that universe. It doesn't have at times nasty humour of Deadpool but nor does it have the same level of engagement.
Thats my main issue with this movie. It sort of just happens.
For example the fighting scenes have almost zero tension. Its simply one or a number of women beating up men who fail to land a single blow on the women. The outcome is that there is no risk or peril involved. Its like a shooting gallery and I found myself checking my phone.
It does have the tone of a comic book adaption, probably more so that any of the recent super serious Marvel movies and it reminded me mostly of Tank Girl.
As for storytelling, it does jump around alot and not in a satisfying way. I found this frustrating at times as would have preferred a linear narrative.
Visually its well done and the cast is decent although its basically a Harley movie, the rest of the main cast are basically an add on for the final half hour.

Harley Quinn is arguably her best known and although she is a natural as the character it's unfortunate the two films she has appeared in have been disappointing.
This film is just another vehicle for this over the top 'feminism is great. Women are so strong' fad of the last few years. Women are strong but this constant obsession with raamming down throats has the opposite effect from the one intended - it makes women seem weak.
I felt the constant introduction of characters throughout the film slowed it down somewhat, though the story being told via Harley's point of view was interesting and added something to the film. Ewan Mcgregor was poor as an antagonist and never really had any character arc. He was introduced as a bad guy and just continued along that line with no expansion. The fact he's not a great actor either didn't help.
This really was a Harley vehicle with all other characters as bit parts. It's not a bad film, it's not great either. The sooner Hollywood gets over this obsession with 'Girl Power' and gets back to just making good films, with good stories the better.",Birds of Prey

It's smaller and more compact than some other DC films have been, but the wonderful performances from these amazing actresses, great direction from Cathy Yan, and Ewan McGregor clearly having the time of his life all make Birds of Prey stand out, and deliver from a script that may have been less entertaining if the right people didn't have their hands on it.",Birds of Prey

274,paul_3-960-896774,Good for a somewhat satisfying one and done viewing.,5,25 March 2020,"@garcwrites :
Birds of Prey is essentially an Harley Quinn movie with some sidekicks. It's pretty good. The movie has some redeeming qualities, because the best things about it is sort of brought down by the bad ones to settles smack in the middle of that line, or the hedge of that cliff that would make it a bad movie.The story is just ok, it's nothing to write ad nauseam about, but it has enough little gems that with some ""more"" work, it could have been a stellar script. The fact the story is told out of order is not a problem but it's actually one of the good things about it. It goes well with the tone of Harley. There are moments in the film that doesn't make sense even if the action is amazing at times.I'm not too familiar with the comic book counterparts of some of the characters featured in the film so maybe my impressions on the actor's portrayal is skewed. Let's talk start with the good ones, Jussie Smollett-bell as Dinah Lance / Black Canary is amazing, she's likable, believable and very good in the rôle even if she's a bit short-changed by the script. Chris Messina is so good as Victor Zsasz that you forget the lovable guy from The Mindy Project or whatever other role you've seen him in.
Ewan McGregor was good but cringy at times, he's one of the ones where I'm asking myself if my lack of knowledge on his character, Black Mask, might be the problem. Besides, I thought the guy was suppose to be queer. There was some queer coding between him and Zsasz but that's an outdated ploy to placate to the queer community with this semblance of representation that I'm going to pretend it wasn't there in the first place.
As for Cassandra Cane the actress is nice and all but grossly miscast knowing what I know about the character. Rosie Perez is kind of wasted in this movie because her presence doesn't bring much. And Mary Elizabeth Winstead is simply weird and awkward as Huntress and again maybe it's me not knowing the character too well or it's the way she chose to play the character? The story doesn't help her, her weapon of chose, the crossbow, has no meaning behind and looked out of place. Margot Robbie is a good Harley Quinn but Kaley Cuoco is so good in the animated show that Robbie pales a bit in comparison.The thing I liked the most in this movie was the action, there's not enough of it but what's there, is entertaining as hell. Now Harley Quinn makes sense in a fight; Black Canary is so badass that her ability becomes an afterthought. The fighting styles are effective and suits these two characters. The cinematography is pretty cool as well.Birds of Prey leans into Suicide Squad in areas it should avoid it like the plague. There's enough good for a somewhat satisfying one and done viewing.",Birds of Prey
275,therealjaysmoke,OMG! So pissed had to do a review,2,16 March 2020,"What in the world were these guys (DC) thinking when they did this movie? Argh man am sooo disgusted! After watching Joker, I truly had high hopes for this one but what a terrible let down. All the acts where horrible and the story was sooo silly. I really can't even picture a movie with Joker and this Harley. It just doesn't fit. The only thing that worked was the effect, everything else was highest level lame. What a joke.",Birds of Prey
276,Hussain-AL-Naseer,For Film it is 7 but 1 added Star For The Stellar Performance By Margot Robbie As Harley Quinn,8,20 May 2020,"From average to negative reviews and an underperformance at the box office, Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey is been unfortunate in every possible way, which is sad very very sad.
DCEU is already struggling by every means whether its critical reception followed by their box office collection having couple of exceptions which is not just enough but for this particular movie I would say we've been little too harsh on Cathy Yan. This movie does deserve every praise in every possible way because in my experience the film is hilarious, joyful and entertaining. From direction to its cinematography including well-choreographed action and chase sequences along with some great background music including the background narration everything about this movie is highly enjoyable and above them all is the stellar performance of Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. She is Lunatic, she is Bad-Ass, she is Nerd, she is Emotional, she is Lovable, basically she is everything in the movie. Robbie's command over the character is just phenomenal. Em not a comic guy so I don't know that Harley Quinn is exactly a villain or a Super hero but either way I just fallen in love with her and the sheer credit goes to Margot Robbie, she is indeed one of the most versatile actresses of present time and after Harley Quinn I've totally fallen for her.
I do agree with the point that Birds of Prey part was the secondary thing in the movie because the sole focus was on Harley Quinn's introduction and with Robbie's outstanding performance Birds of Prey gets totally shadowed but that doesn't really mattered for me because I got the hell of a ride within 1hour and 48mins and the fact is I couldn't really get over the Harley Quinn.
I also suggest that DCEU should revise their casting criteria as I believe casting big and popular names even in their supporting characters would help them to attract the masses which is desperately needed by the DCEU.",Birds of Prey
277,theredsky,Birds of Prey Review,5,12 February 2020,"Birds of Prey is the perfect definition of fun yet still mediocre. It has its own style and stays consistent with it for the most part except for some areas but unfortunately falls into the forgettable yet fun comic book movie. The performances from everyone besides Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor were decent. There wasn't anything special about their performances but they did the best with what they had. Margot Robbie is fun as Harley Quinn. She knows how to make the character work and she is easily the best part of the film. Ewan McGregor is hilariously over the top. He always takes each role he has with as much energy as he possibly can and it was always entertaining to see him on screen. The worst part though is that Margot Robbie is the only character who is developed. Everyone else is just there. They have little to no characterization which reduces their impact to the events of the film. Ewan McGregor's character is evil just to be evil. We don't get a lot of information about why he is evil, he just is. Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character has the second most amount of backstory but it feels forced plus I didn't really care that much about any of the supporting characters. An ongoing problem I have been noticing with the films I have seen this year is their respective scripts. Out of the three films I have seen, this has the ""best"" script but it was still pretty weak. Some of the lines of dialogue are very forced and the jokes are inserted in the same forced way. I felt only a small handful of jokes, such as the Harley voted for Bernie joke, were funny while all the others felt forced or just weren't that funny to me. The film's visuals were engaging and interesting. The presentation of the film never felt bland to me. It was always colorful and appeasing. The action is mostly well done. The police station action sequence is pretty awesome but it gets interrupted halfway through by narration which goes into another flashback sequence for about 20-30 minutes. That annoyed me because I was enjoying this badass action sequence and it got interrupted. The film does this at certain points and it can get confusing but I eventually got used to it. Overall, Birds of Prey is a dumb fun comic book movie with fun action and good performances from Ewan McGregor and Margot Robbie but the script and limited to no characterization take away from the experience.",Birds of Prey
278,ben-mckimm,Mess,1,14 February 2021,"I honestly never knew if I was watching the main narrative or a flashback. It jumps so much I couldn't possibly keep up. Shocking acting, too long, confused, terrible script, bad comedy. Not good at all.",Birds of Prey
279,loversofmovies,Absolutely brilliant,8,9 February 2020,Absolutely brilliant movie. It's nice to get a inside of Harley Quinn mind.Basically the movie is about after Harleys relationship with the joker.Well done DC.,Birds of Prey
280,Rino_Bortone,HARLEY: WHERE ARE THE BIRDS...AND THE MOVIE ?,4,7 March 2020,"DCEU lost its path before it even started a while back ago and it STILL tries to make working an universe with no clue at all of what to do / go / tell. This movie it should have been about the infamous Birds of Prey and suddenly it talks only about Harley Quinn, with a poor characterization of the other Birds. Margot Robbie is just perfect for the role once again, she's amazing and she's the one who drives the movie with an ""enjoyable watch"" til the end, because otherwise we would just had seen a bunch of ""heroins"" with mediocre acting. Floppy and sloppy stunts, boring action scenes and a no-needed narration-off-the-screen (breaking the fourth wall too) in a Deadpool 2-ish style, a sidekick-kid-without-a-clue-of-what-is-going-on (seen and re-seen in movies history), no characterization at all of all the main characters (which was the only thing to do), bored to death Ewan McGregor that portrays the worst Black Mask version (he could do much way better in characters like this) and a really odd direction. Despite the good reviews and votes, which don't reflect the reality and despite that it is barely watchable, but just if you don't think about all the flaws, we have to be objective and say that the movie is another missed opportunity by DCEU to shine properly.",Birds of Prey
281,pritol,Doesn't meet its potential...,6,23 November 2020,"On paper this should have been a great movie, with a great cast, focusing on Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, which was one of the highlights from David Ayer's Suicide Squad...and the other female characters who make up the Birds of Prey. (Although Oracle is missing from this one, and is replaced by Renee Montoya...)Unfortunately this film is overthought and overacted. Even Ewan McGregor who is normally always pretty solid is very unconvincing as the films main bad guy, Black Mask.They play up too much to the ""clown"" aspect of Harley Quinn, and jump around with the narrative to try and convey the ""mad"" personality she has...but it just doesn't work. Same goes with the other female leads, all great actresses but they don't convey enough depth to their characters here...the film feels rushed and tries to do too much with the time it has, as well as recreating some comic strip scenes, rather than being its own creation.So much potential there, but it just doesn't do itself justice...which is a shame.",Birds of Prey
282,joshbarton15,Fantabulous.,8,8 February 2020,"Introduced in the much-maligned Suicide Squad back in 2016, Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn was easily one of the most likeable aspects of the film, so it makes sense that she gets her own film in the DCEU, Robbie herself serving as producer for the project. Ever since the hot-mess that was Justice League, Warner Bros. have learnt their lesson and have given us some light and fun superhero films but can they keep that trend going with Birds of Prey?Free from her relationship with the Joker, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) sets about living her best life for herself. With knowledge that she is no longer with the Clown Prince of Crime, it's not long before she finds herself a target for those she has wronged, including crime lord Roman Sionis/Black Mask (Ewan McGregor).Make no mistake, despite the title being Birds of Prey, this is very much a Harley Quinn film, with the titular team not coming together until the final act. It's a film based around the idea of Quinn being free from the hold of the Joker and finding herself in a city full of deadbeats and whackjobs, yet it never feels as if they're trying to shove any messages down your throat. Christina Hodson's writing may not be the greatest but it does serve up a lot of fun dialogue and sequences that Cathy Yan directs quite wonderfully.Yan reached out to Chad Stahelski, the director of the John Wick franchise, to help choreograph the action sequences and the results are simply stunning. They let loose with the craziness for sure in all of the sequences, violence and wide shots aplenty as we get to comprehend what is happening, a trend I'd love to see continue in action films these days.Serving as a producer for the film means Margot Robbie works hard both in front of and behind the camera, her performance in Birds of Prey completely embodying the chaotic nature of Harley Quinn. It's one of those performances where you can just tell the actor loves playing the role and that feeling is infectious to the audience watching her. Being a female-centric superhero film means Robbie is joined by the likes of Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jurnee Smollett-Bell and Rosie Perez, all serving as fierce independent characters that can mix-it with the scum of Gotham. Winstead and Smollett-Bell are definitely two I'd like to see more of in future films. Ewan McGregor plays the main villain of the piece and he's clearly having a ball too, bringing out both the flamboyant and psychotic nature of the character very well.Birds of Prey manages to keep the momentum going for the DCEU, joining both Aquaman and Shazam! in being an absolute blast that focuses on having fun rather than moping around in doom and gloom. I'd certainly love to see more of Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and with her wanting to bring the Gotham City Sirens to the big screen, I think it'd be a mistake by Warner Bros. to not make that come true.",Birds of Prey
283,iamkeysersoze-13228,Don't be too judgemental.,7,5 February 2020,"The film has it's flaws, but don't give it 1 stars just because it has a diverse cast or because it's DC. The flaws in this superhero have been the exact same flaws in other MCU or DC movies. Stop being salty or stop hating cause its not Marvel (only generalizing)",Birds of Prey
284,iamkeysersoze-13228,Robbie and McGregor are brilliant even if the film suffers a tad at times,7,5 February 2020,"Birds of Prey is another great addition to the DCEU and whilst it certainly has its flaws, I absolutely had a blast with the filmMargot Robbit is perfect and she kills it. As for the supporting characters, they range genuinely are all good especially Mary Elizabeth Winstead who is awesome.
As great as Ewan McGregor Is, he feels generic and kinda of a stupid villain although his over the topness does work well. The bad guys are great even if they aren't revolutionary.
The story feels fresh and unique in style but if you look at the skeleton of a story, it really isn't anything special. I do love the cinematography and colours, it looks awesome.
There are some really terrific scenes here. The action is great and done extremely well (thanks to having Chad Stahleski help), it looks great, shot great and well choreographed mostly. The slow motion doesn't work. Some of it feels brutal and I I that. My favourite action scenes were probably the one in the evidence room and the alley fight. But I do like the funhouse fight cause it's kinda original.The reason why I like the DCEU is because all their films have different tones unlike the MCU which feel very samey despite being in different having different genres.
As far as Marvel Humour Syndrome goes, it does suffer not massively though. It just is a tad cringe at times (only a few), the light heartedness does work a lot of the time, but sometimes it could have done without
Overall as great as the film is, It could really use some more depth in the story, other than it is decent. But that being said it still is a win for the DCEU.",Birds of Prey

Margot Robbie is fine for that role, but sadly I liked her better in a suicide squad. Everybody else shouldn't be there. Why is Hollywood trying so hard and unsuccessfully to bring up those movies that suppose to empower women, but in fact look like a bunch of kiddies playing in the sandbox till the adults arrive? It's just ridiculous. Even the villains are a laughing stock, by the comics standards. It's not an awful movie by my standards, it's just not any good. Comics universe is about bringing the feelings of wonder to the viewer, but it seems as they try too much to make something out of it, that just doesn't fit the bill. I would like to see Margot Robbie again in that role, but definitely with another story and another cast.",Birds of Prey

287,Tactrix,Watch it for yourself!,8,7 March 2020,"I don't base my reviews on other reviewers. I always like to watch the movies myself and make a informed decision. So for this movie, was it chaotic? Yes. Was it eccentric? Sure. However that's what they were going for. The whole point here was that this movie wasn't suppose to be just another hero or anti-hero movie. It was suppose to be off the wall, and strange in it's concept and execution.Now onto the movie. First let me assure you that the reason why people think it's all over the place is because it is. The reason it appears this way is because it has no less then 3 flashbacks out of order, and a dream sequence that's a bit difficult to recognize until it's over.Having said that, the actual movie was excellent. The acting was top notch, the story was more or less realistic from the mind of someone straight out of Arkham. I really enjoyed the quirky humor, because it wasn't too over the top, it was just the right amount of quirky mixed with a gallon of crazy(aka Harley's recipe). As for the rest of the birds of prey, they were there, and had some parts to play, but they were minimal because the focus was mostly around Harley and her antics.All in all I give it a 8 out of 10, great vision, great writing, great acting, a bit discombobulated.",Birds of Prey

291,paulijcalderon,Sway around with Harley and her wacky misadventures,7,7 February 2020,"After my friend portrayed The Joker in a parody video I've been joking around that we had to go see what his ex was up to. Considering that the last time we saw Harley Quinn was in the 'fondly' remembered ""Suicide Squad"", neither one of us were that exited to see this. Which is why I'm happy to say that I feel fairly optimistic going out of this once. DC has been doing a lot better in the last year. After ""Justice League"" wasn't what is was supposed to be the creative team at Warner Brothers was re-arranged. Which turned out 'fantabulous'. Since then we've gotten a lot more creative movies where they let the filmmakers really thrive and do their own thing with stories with different personalities. For example, I never expected to really like ""Shazam!"". The reason? Well, it had heart.It was good that the Birds of Prey are going up against a villain operating on a grounded level. To me It always felt weird that Harley was fighting the Enchantress' army with a baseball bat. Roman Sionis (Black Mask) is a crime lord and a psychopath. A perfect threat for Harley and her friends. You also get a good sense of why she's good at fighting. She's got a strong intuition of things and impressive acrobatic skills. All showcased gallantly with the focused fight scenes. That was an awesome surprise! The narrative is at its strongest when it's concentrated on Harley's mindset and perspective. There's an endearing side to her. She's not just completely a villain. There's a limit she won't cross. Her interactions with the kid Cassandra offers us an insight to her emotional side. Maybe there was an innocent youth that was robbed from her? Perhaps due to The Joker? There are times when you need a movie that's fun and plays around with structure or narrative. You can take it as jarring in a few places because the story can jump around. Didn't bother me since it goes well in hand with the unreliable narrator gimmick. The movie kept me locked in. Although some of the supporting characters didn't have enough gravitas for me to get latched on to their stories. Harley is the one who really steals the show. She's the character you'll see the world from the most and therefore care for the most. A solid ""Good Time"" flick.

I already had a crush on Mary Elizabeth Winstead circa Scott Pilgrim, but she really nailed it as this fish out of water budding vigilante.This is a minor praise, but Ive always been kinda irritated with DC pushing the barely dressed sexy clown modern Harley quinn. They really get it in this movie. They completely yanked all that out and she's back to being more of a scary fashion deaf punk clown. Im glad they got the message. We probably have Margot Robbie as EP to thank.Its also mostly tween friendly. I suspect WB gleefully pursued an R rating hoping it would draw Deadpool money, but its only got a couple mildly gross parts.

297,IAmTheShyGuy,"""A wacky feminist comic book film with a tepid climax!""",6,11 February 2020,"This film which is based around the DC Comics Universe, narrates the quirky story of Harley Quinn, the psychomaniac girlfriend of the Joker, after her breakup with him. A young girl named Cass is on the hitlist of Roman Sionis A.K.A. Black Mask, the supervillain of Gotham city and Harley gets entangled in it. Three other characters - Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya enter the picture and what follows is an adventure packed ride, paired with crazy action turning the whole city upside down!Opening up with a cartoon graphic animation which gives a brief background of Harley's past, the screenplay unfurls in a fast paced manner as Harley herself does the narration of events. The nonlinear fashion with which it unfurls along with a good dose of fun, action and craziness, captures the viewer's attention.The film explores the emancipation of Harley as she tries to cope up with her breakup. It particularly unravels her liberation from the deep psychological stress that she undergoes, eventually getting unchained to unleash her true colours of fury & madness! Her standout attitude along with some of her demented interpersonal views is shown quite splendidly.It's really exciting to watch the characters display some wacky non-stop swift action, building up the curiosity of the viewer for the final showdown with the villain. However it kind of fails to live up to the expectations, with a rather tepid climax scene along with having quite a predictable outcome.Margot Robbie as Harley, gives out an eye catching performance with her tremendous rushes of energy and intense emotions. Jurnee Smollett Bell also stands out as Black Canary with her hot looks and impressive acting. Chris Messina as Black Mask's sidekick has performed really well and he carries out his cruel & rabid looks fabulously.Overall, this movie really stands out with several bouts of psychotic craziness and a good dose of action, however it's got some disappointment as it ends up with the expectations not living up!

I would also say its not really a birds of prey movie its more of a Harley Quinn movie that introduces the Birds of prey other than that its a pretty great movie.",Birds of Prey

Too many un-connected enteries without development, gloomy humour and cheesy dialog. The antagonist isn't even that bad until he acts like a d*ck half way through to show us that he is a bad guy.The climax could have been made better it was a little on the shallow side, i preferred scenes from the first half of the movie than the second half.A colourful movie with some entertaining passtimes and quirky humour, don't expect much more.",Birds of Prey

The film has little to do with anything, neither the performances nor the visuals stand out and both the direction and writing feel a bit amateurish as they are done by no-name newcomers. I can fully believe that this was a troubled production and I don´t get how any of this cost 85 million to film. Gotham or most of the Marvel shows on Netflix honestly ""felt"" more expensive.Don´t ask me where the Golden Tomato on RT came from as I struggled to enjoy myself despite being the target audience. The middling Metascore is way more accurate. I don´t necessarily think that the film derives to flop, which it actually might after the abysmal opening weekend, but I honestly don´t care for a sequel either. WB should have done a Gotham City Sirens starring Harley and a Birds of Prey film starring Batgirl instead with seasoned directors and writers. David Ayer and Jared Leto might get the last laughs here, lol.

314,angiris,"Absolutely tone deaf trash made by hollywood elite hypocrites, paid millions.",1,13 February 2020,"Title says it all really.So much drama surrounded this movie. Them telling us that its a movie made to empower women, meant to magnify how bad men are to women every single day, how strong and amazing women can be ( which nobody serious ever disputes and haven't for decades but who cares about the truth these days)So here is this piece of trash with a title that makes me sick to my stomach for not just being overly long but implying that Harley couldn't be equal to a man by being in a relationship to him.The insinuations throughout this movie... starting with the very title are just exhausting. And when you realize how utterly messy, poorly structured, horribly written with excessive disregard for baseline cinematography and story structure, let alone annoyingly large usage of flashbacks all the misandrist complaints become overshadowed by how utterly BORING this film actually is.I mean christ, I expected getting something out of the R rating at least but there is barely any blood in it at all. The action scenes, minus a few noticable ones directed by the guy who helped with John Wick, are so forgettable and tame.The movie feels like its 3 hours long but isn't even 2. I am baffled by how uninterested I ended up being at the sheer thought of rewatching it in the future.It is socially tone deaf, pandering, has tame action and as an objective DC movie it is PAINFULLY average. Badly written. I really cannot stress this enough. It's like they saw Justice League and was like ""yeah lets try to shoe-horn lots of stuff into a single movie again because that worked so well last time, lul!""I feel like ending the review arguing who the hell approved of this. But it is obvious why they approved it because they think the woke audience they pandered to during advertising was gigantic... and I hope that this film bombing, just like Charlie's angels, and T: Dark Fate sends a clear message that we are all sick and tired of tone deaf trash like this.No amount of good actresses like Margot Robbie, or cool characters like Harley Quinn ( Who I'll never forgive you for defiling with your horrendous writing and unwelcome delusions of how you think the world is) can save a disasterous story written with the single goal of pandering to people who think we have never had female leads before.Captain Marvel was better than this. And much better action
Suicide Squad was better than this.And thats just mentioning movies I didn't like.
I can't wait to reset my brain with the next Wonder Woman movie because regardless of the rumors of poor test screenings that movie might have, at least Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot KNOW how to write and how to make a good damn movie that appeals to EVERYONE.4 out of 10.
5 objectivley but I'm ducking it another point because I'm tired of this agenda. It's 2020, all you actresses are being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars if not MILLIONS... yet complain about oppression and mysoginy,
Poor elites... Life must be so hard for you!Give me a freaking break. Ricky Gervais said it best at the Oscars.You're in no position to preach to anyone about anything. Especially not you, McGregor! Ranting on the media about mysoginy, whilst having a history of cheating on your ex wife. Simply priceless.And that is exactly why this film is bombing so hard.

The action was the clear standout in the film, some really well chereographed set pieces throughout. Margot Robbie as well really is the perfect Harley Quinn, she was humorous and what you would expect. However Ewan McGregor as Black Mask was a total mess and miscast in my eyes. He just didn't suit the role at all, his characteristics as an actor just didn't match the role from the start. A poor casting in my eyes.

316,Dello_,"A movie with Margot Robbie, but a pretty colourful one",6,9 February 2020,"I'll admit I didn't care about the movie, I only went to the cinema to watch Margot Robbie doing stuff. And Margot Robbie is too beautiful to exist as usual, but she is also a very good actress and in this film she proves it once again. In fact she is the focal point of the plot and she is able to carry a lot of the weight of the movie very convincingly and her Harley Quinn is a fun character that manages to entertain. Other than that the film is very simple, the plot is pretty standard and the only particularity is that it is told with different time jumps. The side characters are barely ok, no one apart from Harley is interesting enough to care for him/her or to root against. Finally the action is good for the entire movie but I found the first part of the last fight a bit confusing and hyperkinetic. To describe badly ""Birds of Pray: and a title that is too long"" is a mixture of a bit of Deadpool and a bit of Kill Bill without the personality of both of them, super colourful and messier. And no I'm not saying that Tarantino and this film are in some way comparable, or even Deadpool, but I think these two movies were a strong inspiration to this one.
I spent my money with the intent of reminding myself how incredibly gorgeous Margot Robbie is and that aspect was present so this movie has reached his goal for me.

Very little character development for supporting cast. Ewan Mcgregor is wasted as the villain Black Mask. Dialogues are mostly bad except a few chuckles.

The acting all around is a mixed bag, definitely down to the director as these actors and actresses are definitely talented and can work with the right people. The jokes are very hit or miss, trying to be the DCEU equivalent to Deadpool while at the same time trying to do it's own thing which results in many scattershot attempts at humour that fail to make an impression. The script as a whole functions OK enough when you don't really think about it, but it's all of the other elements of the film that drag it down. The Birds of Prey themselves are barely in this film, so not calling it ""Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey"" from the get-go was an odd marketing choice.I'll say the movie has some elements of fun like some of the action, a decent soundtrack and unique visuals, but it isn't enough to save a deeply flawed film, regardless of what kind of political agenda it may have had.",Birds of Prey

You guys are just mean.,7,29 February 2020,"Now, I haven't done this since Batman v Superman, but I've been such a big fan of the recent DC movies that I actually went out of my way to see Birds of Prey in the first-run theatre, even though it's a sequel to Suicide Squad, which I hated. How was it? It was good! However, I didn't enjoy it as much as the other recent DC movies. It's not as campy or creative as Aquaman, it's not as funny or heartfelt as Shazam! and it's not as mature or gritty as Joker. It has all of those elements, but I didn't think they were as strong. I enjoyed it about as much as Wonder Woman. It's quite good, but I think it could've been better. I wasn't really into the story structure of the film. It was really weird, the first half of the movie or so is told in a nonlinear way with Harley Quinn narrating over everything. It jumped around a little too much for my liking. I also think the narration is overused, it got a little old after a while. There were also some weird editing choices, but it wasn't NEARLY as bad as Suicide Squad! There were also too many characters, it's both a Harley Quinn solo movie and a Birds of Prey origin story. I'm not really sure why they did that. Just Harley would've been enough to carry the film, the other characters weren't as interesting and the movie kinda drags whenever it focuses on them. If it were up to me, I would've retooled the story a bit to include Catwoman and Poison Ivy instead of the Birds of Prey and make it a Gotham City Sirens movie. Though, again, the ensemble cast of the movie is handled way better than Suicide Squad. Finally, this movie did not need to be an R. There's just some violence that could easily be toned down and some swearing that could easily be cut. It feels like a movie that would appeal most to teenagers, but (in the States at least) they can't see it. It's not like Joker, which really earned the R-rating with its subject matter. I don't feel like Birds of Prey really did. This movie would reach a wider audience if it were rated PG-13. Also, I don't like the title. It's too long and doesn't sound good or interesting to a casual audience member. However, with all that said, this movie is a lot of fun. It's very colourful and good-looking and it takes place in a very cool version of Gotham City. You actually get to see people being nice to each other on a beautiful sunny day, as well as the darkness and violence that you would expect from a Batman movie. This movie has some laughs, is well-acted and the action is well-done. When the real story actually gets going, it's engaging and entertaining. Harley Quinn is a great lead character and the movie has a good soundtrack. The villains are also very enjoyable! Oh yeah, and I LOVED the opening with the hand-drawn animation! Also, even though this is a sequel to Suicide Squad, it does stand on its own and no Jared Leto Joker is to be found! The Joker is in this movie, but they use the comic/animated series design. That was funny. I also think it's funny to imagine this movie as a sequel to Joker. Just a fun thought experiment. Overall, I do think the movie is holding itself back. I was expecting something more along the lines of Scott Pilgrim or Baby Driver, something with really creative and over-the-top action with great characters and comedy. However, I can't fault the movie for what it isn't and, for what it is, this is a good movie. I recommend giving it a watch, especially if you're a Harley Quinn fan.",Birds of Prey

330,drawlife,"Some things I like, but a lot I hated.",5,7 February 2020,"It's an entirely mixed bag...I liked some things about this movie BUT I also HATED a lot. It's more a Harley Quinn film as opposed to truly being a Birds of Prey team film, but it's a serviceable film, kinda...Firstly, the story-telling and editing is all over the place. Very very choppy and it tries hard to be in the style of Tarantino but it just doesn't work, because not everyone can edit and stylize a film like Tarantino himself.That being said Margot Robbie is quite good as is her supporting team who are barely in the film. Like I said, this is more a Harley Quinn film, and the film does a good job developing her and showcasing her quirks, quips and unpredictable personality.Shoutout to Mary Elizabeth Winstead who kills it as Huntress. I liked her the best out of the supporting cast. Jurnee Smollett-Bell is also pretty good in the role of Black Canary. It's unfortunate though her Canary Cry was only used once out of the whole film. It was such a cool moment, more of that would have provided kinetic flare that some of the scenes were severely lacking in.I disliked Cassandra Cain however. I wasn't sold with Ella Jay Basco's performance. I found her to be a nuisance to be honest. Didn't like Rosie Perez's Detective Montoya either. They did take some liberties with her comic-book counterpart and I wasn't quite happy with what they did, and to be honest I didn't feel like Perez gave a good performance. There is a joke in the film that speaks true to how I feel about her acting, as Huntress or Canary states how she carries herself like a standard 80's cop in film/tv and it's quite true, she does act that way.I don't think the film needed Cain in particular, and it could have therefore had more time to develop Huntress and Black Canary. Not sure what the creative team has in mind for Cain in the future but similar to how I felt about Montoya, I wasn't pleased here as I would have preferred a Cassandra Cain closer to her comic counterpart.Wasn't too happy with what they did to Black Mask, a villain I'm quite fond of in the Batman comics but Ewan McGregor is clearly having fun in the role, along with Chris Messina who plays serial killer Victor Zsasz. They are charming yet extremely unnerving. At first it was disappointing to see Black Mask be extremely flamboyant, but strangely I found myself to be entertained by him. I must admit it kinda grew on me and every time I saw McGregor popup I instantly got pulled back into the film.Action is over the top and violent, but it felt kinda empty and that probably has to due with the fact that it felt really really choreographed. I understand the stunt/action coordinator of JOHN WICK was involved, but I believe Keanu Reeves and the entire cast of JOHN WICK had months of training and preparing to the point where Reeves, Halle Berry, etc. can actually be stuntman/woman. To me at least, it looked pretty clear that the cast didn't have enough time to train. Despite that it was still fun seeing Harley break knees of henchmen with her bat, Canary kicking everyone she comes across, and Huntress killing fools with a crossbow.To sum it up, I wouldn't rank this below SUICIDE SQUAD or JUSTICE LEAGUE, but SHAZAM, MAN OF STEEL, and WONDER WOMAN are still the three best DC films so far. I would also rank AQUAMAN above this as well.Also just a fanboy nitpick, but I would have liked to see more connections to the larger DCEU, and I would have liked some connections to Batman, Joker and other stuff happening within the universe. At some point Walter Hamada the new president at WB (who is doing a good job), needs to address the absence of Jared Leto's Joker, Ben Affleck's Batman and Henry Cavill's Superman. Fingers crossed that they work things out with Cavill as Affleck is a lost cause, which is a shame cause with the exception of JUSTICE LEAGUE he is the best Batman on screen. Only time will tell I suppose.2020 is the year of female superheroes and while I didn't exactly hate this movie, I didn't like it either. I'm pretty sure though WONDER WOMAN 1984 and BLACK WIDOW will not disappoint.5/10",Birds of Prey
331,Benslie,Another DC movie that shows they're improving,9,6 February 2020,"Most movies have that one thing that all critics mention in their review of the movie and for this one, I have a good feeling that it's going to be the action sequences because they were on par with John Wick. I honestly can't say I've seen action sequences this well-done since John Wick in recent years. Every single action scene is well thought out on how it's all going to go down and how to keep everything in frame and use as little edits as possible. There are so many great action sequences that just show off how badass all of these women are. The women wouldn't be badass if they had weak actresses playing them and this movie does not have them. Everybody in this movie was outstanding in the acting department with some being obvious and others not so. The main stand out to me was Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. In Suicide Squad she was one of the good elements in that movie and she just further proves it in this movie. She helps bring a majority of the comedy and nails it so well. At this point, I think everybody who reads my reviews knows that Ewan McGregor is one of my favourite actors and he still kills it as Roman in this movie. I will admit at certain times he does go a little bit over the top but for a majority of the time, he's a great villain. I will say that the beginning of the movie is slow because they have to introduce everybody but once it picks up the pace it picks it up fast. I have to applaud the set design people because the sets in this movie were outstanding. The last thing I want to mention is the score, composed by Daniel Pemberton, that I could see myself listening to and jamming out to. In the end, I got sucked into the story of Birds of Prey and this movie is definitely worth checking out. I give Birds of Prey a 8.5/10.",Birds of Prey
332,richarddillomes,"While the Joker is schmoozing people at the Oscars, Harley and the girls are off to the MTV VMAs.",7,22 March 2020,"Birds of Prey (And The Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) brings back the villain we all love to hate, and love (not you Joker), Harley Quinn. After single-handedly carrying The Suicide Squad in 2016 (which saw a major demand for Harley Quinn costume during that year's Halloween) Margot Robbie took matters into her own hands and kept on working to get this movie off the paper and onto our screens. We follow Harley on her quest to move on from the Joker and finds herself in the company of four other badass women who are doing it for themselves in the poorest side of Gotham, where Bruce Wayne's parents were murdered and where the Joker is less likely to be seen. We are introduced to the villain Black Mask played by the ever-reliable Ewan McGregor (Sam Rockwell passed on the role), who's the bisexual spoiled brat version of Bruce Wayne looking to take control as the newest bad boy in town.Initially, the movie seemed doomed both due to internal and external forces seemingly working against its favor. While BOP has been tracking favorably before it's release, external forces such as the recent virus outbreak may be keeping people away from the cinema especially in Asia (there were less than 20 people where I watched but to be clear this was on a Saturday afternoon after Valentine's Day.) Of course, I'll only need to mention that so far, female themed movies with too many clothes on haven't been as successful as their less-clothed counterparts (Charlie's Angels 2019 & Ocean's 8 vs. Charlie's Angels 2000 & 20003.) As for the internal factors, these include confusion whether this is a group movie or a standalone for Harley with guests. It would make sense that it's a standalone movie seeing how larger than life Margot Robbie's portrayal of the quintessential sidekick has been but she was adamant about making it an R18 girl group film, so as not to be confused as a chick flick. From a viewer's point of view though it got confusing and it was an error to at the very least not make her the selling point of the film (there's a WB directive to rename the movie Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey at least via search engines.) Also lacking is showing how complex Harley is that you can not just box her as a heroine or a villain even in her own movie. The movie could've been way crazier (deserving of its R18 rating) but they failed to capitalize on this and made her look like another character in the long line of superhero movies waiting to be made.Final verdict? It's a good enough movie, worthy of being the 8th in the DCEU and enough to pass on the mantle from Shazam! to Wonder Woman 1984 four months from now. There are not enough words to praise Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, the comedy is dark but spot-on, the action scenes are fresh and impressive, the supporting characters played their part with Fil-Am Ella Jay Basco and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as standouts, the screenplay and directing needs a little more polishing but all in all, it's a fun movie and we should see more of the fantabulous emancipated Harley Quinn soon.",Birds of Prey

Visually, it is quite pleasing at times (the police station scene) and does have that Harley Quinn sort of quirkiness, but Margot Robbie's iteration of the icon feels barely acceptable, still not psycho enough. Financially, totally see why the film is a box-office bust as there really isn't much to market there, and the films feels geared towards a more female tween oriented market. Also a little abrupt what they did to the villains, feels unnecessary to finish them off in the ways they did.",Birds of Prey

335,shimenpf,Solid story,7,19 February 2020,"The writing of Birds of Prey is very good. The way the characters are managed is great. The motivations are always beyond money, and go much more personal and interesting than that. The structure is fun. The first half has these time-jumps that are strange but work. The way the subplots develop and ultimately collide is also satisfying. The conflict grows as the story develops, which keeps things interesting. Harley's arc and the overall theme of the story is very clear and works. The action sequences are fascinating.My only complain is the slight propaganda of most recent female-led films, in which all women are good and all men are bad. Why does it have to be like this?I like strong female protagonists, but why can't there be female antagonists as well? In the climax, the birds of prey + Harley are attacked by dozens of men and not a single female. Is there really not a single women gangster in Gotham? This is a recurring theme in the latest female-led movies, such as Bombshell and Charlie's Angels. The one female-led movie that I remember that doesn't go down this route is Little Women, and it was in the contest for an Oscar.Also, screw that guy in the theater that was talking on the phone and texting for 85% of the movie.",Birds of Prey

338,TheCasualReviewer,Pleasantly surprised with this one!,7,8 February 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
Word is out that Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) and The Joker broke up and that opens up a full-out manhunt for Quinn. She offers to retrieve a special diamond for Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor) in exchange for her safety as things get chaotic.REVIEW:
This movie impressed me a lot. Following a not-so-great, but slowly rejuvenating DC streak and a couple of unimpressive trailers, I went into this movie expecting to disappoint and quite the contrary.
POSITIVES:
I know it's no surprise, but Ewan McGregor and Margot Robbie were phenomenal. I mean Oscar like performances. I understand it's early and it's a comic book movie with comic book characters, but for me I was completely locked in with these characters and watching the movie I was just admiring the performances. Cathy Yan really directed this well. The shots were so beautiful and it felt like a real, dark world that I was immersed in. I knew it was going to have very cool color schemes from the trailer and it really enhanced some of the shots and helped build not just Gotham, but more so Harley's world. Very well done.
NEGATIVES:
Not all of the acting was on point and an entire police station sequence that was a really far stretch. I know it's a comic book movie, but the writing could've been slightly more clever there and the choreo really felt like choreo. Possibly due to time constraints, the fighting felt under-rehearsed. However, there were some very cool video-game-like combinations.
CONCLUSION:
This is a very fun movie that I think anyone would like. It is rated-R and unlike a lot of people, I do believe in most cases it adds something to be rated-R. It ends up being more realistic to me which helps me to fully lick myself in. I do wish it didn't feel like a ""How To flip a guy behind your back"" video, as much as a very polished choreo performance like the John Wick films. All-in-all a very fun movie that I can definitely see myself seeing again. Following Aquaman and Shazam, I think DC is taking steps in the right direction. 7.5/10.",Birds of Prey
339,filmtravel101,Terrible B film/script - Female Deadpool ripoff,4,11 February 2020,The script is horrible and directing and casting like a B movie gone bad. Margot is only decent character but even her talent can't hold this action flick from floundering. It's basically a total rip off of Deadpool but without directing or writing panache. At some point Studios will realize making Male action movies but with chicks does not work unless the script is solid and has some flair. Birds of Blaise. A 4 for Margot acting.,Birds of Prey

I loved the very cartoonish feel the movie had. Never took itself too seriously. Lots of humor and a decent plot. Fun action scenes and the movie was very fast paced. The way the story is told is definitely inspired by Deadpool, which works in some cases, and doesn't in others. Liked the villains, especially Victor. Cool to seem him on the big screen. Liked how it left Joker out (though I'm a huge fan of him). Hate pop music but the pop heavy soundtrack was actually very good.

343,WooderIce64,Misses the Mark,4,21 July 2021,"The DCEU is still trying to find its footing in the franchise-obsessed world of Hollywood and continues into the realm of villainy with Birds of Prey (The Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn). Or is it ""Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey?"" Who knows? This movie feels like a sequel to Suicide Squad and isn't much better, having many of the same problems. In this movie, Harley Quinn breaks up with the Joker and seeks out a life of crime of her own, picking up an all-female group of criminal accomplices in the process. The movie does have a nice style to it, but that can only take it so far. It is very disjointed, but that somehow seems appropriate.While this is the story of her supposed ""fantabulous emancipation,"" nothing really changes with her throughout the movie. She starts as a psychotic criminal who gets herself into trouble and ends as a psychotic criminal who gets herself into even bigger trouble. While Margot Robbie does make an excellent Harley Quinn that feels like the character of the comics, the character arc simply isn't there. The only change is that Joker's not in the picture anymore. Speaking of, the Joker should probably be in the movie. While it's clear no one wants to see Jared Leto as Joker again, especially after seeing Joaquin Phoenix in the role, he's probably the second-most important character in the movie after Harley Quinn. The rest of the cast is pretty forgettable. Which, I suppose, is better than having them be hateable.Black Mask was a pathetically terrible villain. In the comics, he's a sadistic crime boss with an array of tactics and weapons. Here, he feels like a stereotype of an effeminate gay man. While Ewan McGregor is a good actor and he's not terrible, there's no saving this character. He's just terrible. He also only has his mask on for 30 seconds at most. Such a disgrace. He's still not as bad as Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor or Jared Leto's Joker at least.While not the worst entry in the DCEU thus far (it's better than Suicide Squad, on par with BvS), it's certainly not their best effort. Given how messy the DC canon is, it's kind of hard to tell if this movie even counts anymore.",Birds of Prey
344,TheMysteriousReviewer,The Fabulous Emancipation,8,4 September 2021,"Birds of Prey is a very solid movie that has Harley's better film from last time. I'll admit, it can have some flaws like with the characters that don't have a lot of development. But it can have a very nice execution. I do like the story with the connection the movie is going for. The editing makes the movie seem intense. The characters are enjoyable. The narration from Harley Quinn is clever. And this especially has easily one of the most awesome stunts DC Extended Universe has produced. Of course, there are people that are gonna watch this movie that involves Harley Quinn. I do get the same thing people expected from the 2016 Suicide Squad, but this movie has made up for it. And I recommend this movie for those that would like to see a movie that's about Harley Quinn. This movie isn't in the levels of Joker, but I really think it's worth being action packed. With that said, it's time for me to watch the new Suicide Squad film that just came out this year.",Birds of Prey

346,lakishaferguson21,Maybe DC just isn't for me,5,12 February 2020,"I wanted to see this because... Theater behind my house has $7 Tuesdays. People on this site are making too big deal about it's ""girl power"" centric theme. Honestly I'm not a fan of any of the DC films (including the deadpool ones). I thought Margot, who's a really good actress, did the best she could with what she had, but she and Huntress were like the best parts for me; everything else wasn't good enough. I have more gripes than compliments for this movie.
I don't understand the whole black mask thing; he had shown his face 90% of the time and was obviously a psycho, what changed when the mask came out, also as an R rated bad guy he wasn't really scary. Black canary had no backstory to her ""ability"", did it kill ppl or was it just really loud? Rosie Perez's character really served no purpose I thought. I Really had an issue with the jokes (tried too hard to be funny & fell flat often) and fight sequences; none of them felt realistic (I get it, it's a movie!... But still). How r these 5 chicks, armed with one gun and crossbow, beating dozens of people (their opponents being Men, specifically, is irrelevant) with guns? I don't know the entire history of these characters but when did they have time to train to become the ultimate hand to hand combat fighters?? Also I felt the music playing during scenes was too loud, slightly obnoxious. I'm all for a fun, ridiculous film, but this was still lacking a story.
I will say I LOVE the idea and scene of fighting on a trampoline/in a carnival and on roller skates!!",Birds of Prey
347,Pistol219,??????,2,14 March 2020,DCU just watch Marvel Movies and that may help inspire you all. Only reason I didn't give this trash 1 star is because I love Margott and Mcgregor,Birds of Prey
348,moorek,Definitely not television quality...,3,24 February 2021,"The practice that DC does great television and poor movies continues here. It's a movie that I'll watch once and never again even though I've likely seen all DC and MCU movies more than once.DIRECTON. The Director does not know what movie she wants to make. Is it serious (skinning faces off live people), camp (big final fight scene right out of 1960's Batman), or comedy adventure, buddy movie?PLOTLINE. There really isn't one. Yes Quinn has broken up with the Joker AGAIN and people are after her. That would have been a good movie ignoring the fact that no one could be sure that this wasn't another temporary breakup or that the Joker, even with the breakup, wouldn't have been angry over those who attacked his woman - rejected or otherwise.But then we had the Birds of Prey origin story too with all their respective backstories although Black Canary doesn't get much.Throw in the street wise kid that we've seen in dozens of other movies and we are in for a messy plot that goes everywhere and no where.
EDITING. It might not be editing but just bad writing but there are pieces that stand alone with little context or logic. Some obvious examples:
*We see close link between Quinn and the restaurant owner yet within 5 minutes he has sold her out.
*He sold her out because too many people offered him too much money. How much? The bounty is only $500,000. How much would they give him so that he could move somewhere and open a ""good"" restaurant? This is not back in 1960's as it is post Suicide Squad so even the full bounty would likely not be enough. Also ignoring that after the attack to get Quinn that he likely would not get the insurance on his old restaurant.
*As Huntress goes to reveal to the group who she is, Rosie Perez yells out her real name. Yet everyone thought the whole family was killed. The young daughter was sent to Italy in secret for training. Even if Perez knew she was alive as a child, how would she recognize her as an adult?
*If the police station was so easy to break into then why are all the criminals going after Quinn for $500,000 when there is millions of dollars worth of drugs right there for the taking.
*Quinn and Cassandra drive off in the stolen car at the end of the movie, implied with the diamond, but a voice over says that the Huntress got the codes and the hidden money while Quinn kept the diamond. Poor way to tie up lose ends.
*Black Canary uses her power at an appropriate scene. Fans might have expected it but any other viewers will go WTF? It's the first and only reference to metahumans and powers in the movie and comes out of no where.Then there were small editing things that didn't sit right:
*When the Black Mask gets angry and has the woman dance and strip on the table and that fades away.
*When the henchman finds out Black Canary is betraying him based on a text from an unidentified number that could mean anything.
*The importance of the token (small car?) that Huntress had as a child and gives to Cassandra. Who BTW is not holding it in many of the shots immediately after being given it.CASTING (WRITING). I liked a number of the actresses in this movie but not in this movie. They can do better if they had a better script and direction.*Margot Robbie. She does a good job as Quinn but considering this is post-Suicide Squad, she comes across much weaker and less assured than we saw her before. She is portrayed more as a spoiled but protected girlfriend than as a badass in her own right. As we see later in the movie, she fights well and everyone should have known that from the outset.
*Rosie Perez. The opening scene with her was well done and thought out but that's it. After that you can't have any comfort in her judgement and certainly not in her fighting ability. At best she should have been the strategic thinking part of the Birds of Prey - not a fighter.
*Jurnee Smollett. I've not seen her in anything that I know of and she is a throw-away character when she should be more important. Her fight scenes are poor and not well choreographed. You certainly have the feeling that this actress has not done fight scenes before.
*Mary Elizabeth has been good in other movies and for the first part of this movie isn't bad. Then they turn her into some type of naïve out-of-water character which doesn't fit her assassin training and role.
*Ewan McGregor is just adequate playing a forgettable villain.Some of the secondary and minor characters were not bad.So overall the movie was tolerable for one viewing but another nail in the coffin of a huge DC universe wave similar to Marvel. This is sad as I have always been a DC universe fan but am forced to admit that Marvel is far ahead of them in live-action movies. DC has been ahead of them in animated movies and not likely to lose that soon. DC has also been better with episodic television esp after the Neflix series were cancelled but the new Disney series might challenge that especially as the CW series are starting to feel stale.",Birds of Prey

350,texxas-1,All of the negative reviews are well deserved,2,31 August 2020,"I feel ive been conned since the trailer looked so cool. When I heard this did really badly on the box office I naively bought the dvd thinking it can't be that bad. Boy was I wrong. Had I known that this was produced by Margot Robbie who also starred in it, I wouldn't have bothered because this is always an awful combination. What an earth does Margot Robbie know about producing a film? She's far too young.
It was also written by a women, I know the media were claiming that no one wanted to see this because it was written, produced and starred mainly women, but the reality is, and I say this as a women myself, that women just can't write for sh't. It's sexist but it's true.
I could have easily mistaken birds of prey for a netflix original because it was so poor, and I get the feeling it'll soon be one of those films available for free on prime. With the idiotic dialog that could have been written by a hyperactive 8 year old, Christina Hodson has brought shame on herself and should never be allowed near a film crew ever again. To top things off this was so dull and miserable, it is saw this at the bottom cinema I would have walked out. It felt very juvenile but at the same time it had gory violence and constant swearing.

351,misbegotten,One of those movies you just wish was better than it actually is.,5,9 February 2020,"BIRDS OF PREY AND THE FANTABULOUS EMANCIPATION OF ONE HARLEY QUINN is well made and undeniably entertaining, but utterly inconsequential. It's the cinematic equivalent of candy floss - bright, colourful and tastes good while you're consuming it, but afterwards you're still hungry and in need of actual proper food. It's completely Margot Robbie's movie - despite the Birds of Prey getting top billing in the title, the film should more accurately be called 'Harley Quinn: The Movie' - and the fanbases of both the actress and the character won't be disappointed. That said, most of the other main cast-members are given the chance to shine, though Mary Elizabeth Winstead draws the short straw - as Huntress, she's only properly introduced four-fifths of the way through the film, isn't given enough time to make any kind of impression, and only seems to be there to take part in the all-action climax. Speaking of the action scenes, they're particularly well-executed, with Harley's solo Terminator-style assault on a police station being the highlight, followed by her dispatching of a team of mercenaries in the evidence room while Echo Chamber's cover of 'Black Betty' blares out on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, the climactic battle between all the Birds and Black Mask's amassed henchmen in an abandoned & forgotten amusement park funhouse is disappointingly somewhat messy and disorientated in comparison.",Birds of Prey

LolThe storyline was so boring! I just wish she had the 2 hyenas she was supposed to have and didn't abandon the one she did have without a care!This is a man hating, half assed film that is super boring! I can't believe anyone actually liked it!The people who rated the film more than 4 should ACTUALLY watch it and not review movies just to berate those who have seen it!",Birds of Prey
354,seige-hound,"Better than Suicide Squad, but still underwhelming",6,15 February 2020,"I agree with other reviewers here that the title is severely misleading. This is a Harley Quinn movie, and the 'Birds of Prey' don't team up until the climax. I feel like the marketing team really missed the ball by not calling it Harley Quinn and the Birds of Prey or something along those lines. The overly quirky subtitle 'Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn' is fine and all, but I don't think it worked to the benefit of the marketing at all.My main issue with this film is the editing. Yes, it is much better in that department than Suicide Squad. They got good competent editors for the scenes, but my issue is more with the way the story was put together. Why on Earth did they not have the events in chronological order? They jumped all over the place, and it didn't add much to the story. I guess it's meant to show the frazzled mind of Harley Quinn, who acts as narrator for the film, but even then, the way it jumps from one day, two weeks ago, back to the original day, the next day, the original day from a different perspective, back to two weeks ago, and so on. It makes events harder to follow without adding much. The story would have been fine if it was told in chronological order.The most egregious example of this editing choice is when the movie has a (admittedly pretty solid) fight scene with Harley Quinn, but then cuts to the day before to explain why she has to go do this fight scene, before cutting again to the fight scene when it was finished. WHYYYYY is that even necessary? Just tell the story in order! I don't get it!Okay, but the positives. Harley Quinn is mostly good. Her hokey accent can be grating at times, but also it's part of the character so it works overall. Huntress was also cool. Liked her story, and the way she tried to be badass but kinda fails. It's cute. I wish there was more of her in the movie. In fact, all the lead characters were great. My main issue is that the film overprioritized Harley Quinn at the expense of pretty much everyone else, including the villain Black Mask, who definitely deserved some more screentime and development. The fight scenes were really well done, with some excellent, sparse use of slow motion. The choreography was fun, albeit unrealistic. And there is only one scene where there are superpowers used in the movie (I think the filmmakers forgot Black Canary had powers until the end) which made the film feel a little more grounded, less supehero, more martial arts heroes, if you get my meaning.To be clear, though. While I didn't like the movie as much as I would have hoped, I am liking the direction the DCEU has been going since Aquaman. Shazam is great, Wonder Woman 1984 looks incredible, and while this film is definitely flawed, Birds of Prey shows a a bit more self awareness and style that was sorely needed from the Zach Snyder films and Suicide Squad. I definitely want to encourage more female led supehero movies, and more female directors making these movies. Some of them will be duds, and I won't pretend to like a movie for wokeness points if I dont, but the DCEU is definitely leading the charge in this department over the MCU, and I do genuinely apprecitate that.Summary: Good fight scenes, good acting, confusing editing, underwhelming plot. 6/10",Birds of Prey
355,Eclectic-Boogaloo,Losing the person you've built your whole life and identity around sucks...,7,11 February 2020,"That's the point in life were we meet Harley Quinn at the start of ""Birds of Prey (and the fantabulous emancipation of a one Harley Quinn).""Like the above suggests, just in case you're wondering what the heck the movie is about, it's about Harley trying to make a name for herself and find her identity as someone other than Joker's girlfriend after he dumped her :(That leads her to do some crazy stuff that gets her involved in a crime story that involves a lot of really bad dudes and a few bad chicks, some of whom we'll eventually come to know as the BoP.The story is pretty straight forward but it's told in a cool non-linear, and yes, Tarantino-esque way. The movie has a great energy and is fun throughout, with a few genuinely LOL moments sprinkled here and there. The performances by Margot Robbie and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, along with the young lady who played Cassandra Cain were the real standouts. I also loved the chemistry between Ewan McGregor's Black Mask and Victor Zsazz ... it was oddly romantic but at the same time not at all romantic. Really weird, lol. And don't get me wrong, they were both scary AF too.The only things I'll caution against on the negative side are that it's more of a comedy-action chick flick than an out-and-out action movie. There's less big action and less gore than Deadpool, for reference, and it's also not as funny.
Props to WB and DC for having the guts to make this movie, though. It's such an odd and original comic book movie in all the best ways.

But the story is told in such an odd way that doesn't really suit the tone. I think one of the actresses made a choice to do an accent that sounded weird (not Harley btw). All the promo made it seem as if the girls were gonna team up in the beginning and the movie would focus on that, which is not the case. Even though the action is so good, there's just sooo much of it. Also I think this films are wacky tone could have benefitted from a little bit more humour.

358,MovieWarfare,"Good acting and action, terrible screenplay",7,8 February 2020,"Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) is the eighth film in the DCEU and probably contender for one of the longest titles ever for a film. Despite the film being called Birds of Prey, which was a team comprise of women superheroes,this film is really a Harley Quinn movie. The movie is even narrated and told in the perspective of Harley Quinn. They probably should've called the movie Harley Quinn and friends. I loved Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn from Suicide Squad despite how garbage that movie was so it is great to see her star in her own film.One of the things I loved about this movie was the fact that it gave a relatively realistic portrayal of Harley Quinn dealing with the breakup with Joker. She didn't just move on straight away, she swallowed herself in sadness and anger before accepting her new self. I also have to praise the rest of the cast and characters as well. Jurnee Smollett-Bell shines as Black Canary by giving a bad women character and Mary Elizabeth Winstead for giving a ferocious performance as Huntress. It is a real shame however, that for a film called Birds of Prey, we don't actually to get see much of the ""Birds of Prey"". Ewan Mcgregor gives a great performance as Black Mask despite how poorly written the character is. There is honestly nothing about Black Mask, he is just a typical villain with no depth to himself whatever or even genuine motivation or backstory. He wants power and diamonds and that is all there is to him. On the other hand, despite the small screentime Chris Messina is able to give a fair amount of character towards the secondary villain Victor Zsasz. This is based on a source material so I have to give a nod to the fact that the character of Cassandra Cain played by Ella Jay Basco is butchered and kind of pathetic. Movies of course don't have to be the same as the source material and the change to the character was necessary for Harley Quinn and the story they were telling. However, there is no really stand out moments from Cassandra Cain with the only memorable thing was stealing and getting saved all the time. A shame really.Despite the relatively lower budget of this film compared to typical superhero movies, the action scenes are phenomenal and well choreographed. Additionally, the soundtrack is unique and adds towards the movie. The movie also has a great visual style with colourful sets and storytelling with a chaotic order that adds to Harley's character. Still, the screenplay is not great honestly. Some of the dialogue are quite cheesy,generic or lacking in genuine banter between the characters. By the end of the film, I didn't really feel like the bond between these characters were earned or should even exist. I also think it should be noted that this is a feminist film and it really shows. For example, there is not even remotely one good male character in this entire film. It really pushes the women power message straight in your face which could have been done a little better.Nevertheless, despite the flaws, this movie continues to be a step in the right direction for the DCEU and I hope Warner Bros continues to maintain and exceed this quality of superhero movies. To anyone reading this, I recommend giving this movie a watch because even if there are some issues with the movie, you will still come out feeling that you had a good time.",Birds of Prey

360,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Birds of Prey Attacks the Big Screen,7,8 February 2020,"Welcome back to Stream to Big Screen! Now, it's time for the DC Universe to expand on the big screen. Meet the Birds of Prey as introduced by the fantabulous Harley Quinn. Yes, that irrepressible, wild card and former paramour of the Joker is emancipated from the Suicide Squad and shepherding us through the origin story of that lady gang, featuring Renee Montoya, Black Canary and The Huntress. Margot Robbie reprises effervescent and sly portrayal of Harley. Here, she dominates. I don't know what Birds of Prey would be without her.Like most origin stories, Birds of Prey starts each character off in their own contained silo until they all come together in order to service the plot. As comic book movies go, this plot is not important. A bad guy wants a thing that will give him money to dominate the city. The ""good"" guys, or in this case the better girls, want to stop him because he's a jerk trying to harm an innocent kid. Yada yada yada! Crash, bang, boom! The movie ends. Let's be honest, you're not going to see this movie because you want to be surprised by what happens.Cathy Yan's direction of the film can barely contain all of the energy Robbie brings to Harley Quinn, which makes the titular, Birds of Prey, take a bit of a backseat, and the screenplay by Christina Hodson is a little all over the place. I actually wish it had been funnier. There are funny quips here and there, but overall I wasn't LOLing as much as I had hoped. There's so much going on throughout the film. There are cartoon vignettes, explosions, and a lot of kicking butt. Also, Ewan McGregor, playing Roman Sionis, this movie's mustache-twisting villain, and Chris Messina, the sinister henchman, are so outsized in their performances that they make more of an impact that the Birds of Prey as well - although McGregor, in particular, should have been reined in a bit. In fact, I wish there had been more to The Huntress. She just recedes in the background while both Renee Montoya, played by Rosie Perez, and Black Canary, played by Jurnee Smollett-Bell, get good moments and hold their own against the otherwise dominating Harley Quinn.Nevertheless, there is a lot to like aside from just Margot Robbie. The film's runtime is manageable and not bloated like some other comic book movies - I'm looking at you, Marvel Universe. In general, the movie moves at a good clip, not really wasting time. The fight scenes have a lot of pizzazz to them, which is interesting considering how dark films set in Gotham can be. Also, there are some really good and interesting music choices sprinkled throughout.Birds of Prey is worth the price of a ticket in the theater. It was a fun night at the cinema. Sure, the plot isn't important but you're really just there to see Harley Quinn wreak havoc. And, havoc she wreaks!I think we completely agree on this one. DC Comics has provided one of their more entertaining films with Birds of Prey. When the dust clears, DC has provided the theaters their female Deadpool-like protagonist. I do wish the movie were a bit funnier and the villain a bit more essential to the story but I'll suffice with great fight scenes instead. This movie definitely is a good watch on the big screen but save yourself a few bucks with a matinee showing.",Birds of Prey

363,helenbassett,Harley Quinn: Birds Of Prey Film Review - Cathy Yan Directs Margot Robbie Tripping As A Badass With Glitter Bombs & Egg & Bacon Sandwiches,10,27 February 2020,"Cathy Yan directs Birds of Prey and...Harley Quinn, and who knew that Harley Quinn was a PhD, certainly not me. Our girl as a bonafide psychologist. I remember how she talked down the fire eating Diablo of Suicide Squad in the trailer - no alcohol for you. And it's a great asset in bat crazy Gotham. I saw the film opening day, before the name change, and I didn't know the DC Birds of Prey so think switching the name around is the right move. It's Margot Robbie's movie. And in the wild weather of half-term a trip to see Harleen Quinzel may be just what the doctor ordered.Even if Harley is having a hard time getting over Mr J. She narrates how they met when she was his doctor in Arkham and pledged their love in a vat of acid. But when Joker dumped our girl she took matters into her own hand and blew up the very spot where they had once celebrated said love. Take that Joker, and don't acid rain on Harley's parade! Ever again. Except she's all alone now, apart for her hyena Bruce. After Wayne of course. And he's so adorable, in crazy world of course.So Harley starts her cartoon life with a whimper; slurping cheese from a can, chopping her hair and getting plastered while ordering the shots. Even taking up roller derby as a (non-contact!) sport. Ice-skating seems so tame now. But because she's Joker's girl she's untouchable outside of her apartment. But what if the bad boys of Gotham found out Harley is flying solo now? Chief among them being Ewan McGregor's Roman Sionis, a big Gotham crime lord. And it's a wild ride of a story with his nom de plume Black Mask. I'm not sure where the name came from (DC history and all that) but Roman likes his African antiquities.But Harley isn't the only bird in Gotham with attitude. And in need of emancipation. Rosie Perez is a tough talking detective in the Gotham PD, but her Montoya never gets the credit for any of her busts. She finds Harley's necklace just after the acid blast and realises Harley is on her own. As do all the Gotham criminals on the grapevine. Harley has a target on her back. But Monoya is already chasing a killer who just took out a crew with a crossbow. Execution style. Someone really didn't like those bad boys. Turns out Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Huntress has a ton of history with Gotham. Her real name is Helena Bertinelli, and her family were slain in an eye popping display of blood when she was a child. She understandably wants those involved dead. And Jurnee Smollett-Bell is Dinah Lance, the Black Canary with the killer voice who sings for her supper at Roman's club. She was awesome with a roundhouse kick.Throw in the Bertillini diamond that Roman could make his fortune with, Ella Jay Basco's young pickpocket Cass finds it all very easy to swallow. Although it will be harder to recover. Roman has an idea, but Harley's option is the non lethal route. And comes with a Marilyn riff that was totally fantastic in an out of mind experience.There's plenty of glitter and colourful smoke bomb style violence. Harley is nothing if not stylish. Armed with her beloved bat. But at the end of the day she's just a girl who wanted to be loved. And when the chips are down with Roman calling out for Gotham's worst to come do their finest to recover his diamond, she and the girls know how to get the job done in a riotous fun house. And it's a wrestlemania with choreographed mayhem. And maybe just maybe they can blow the whole Kerpow style comic book of psychopaths to their mutual, and a tasty egg and bacon sandwich, with cheese, satisfaction.You go girls. With a great cast Cathy Yan passes the Bechdel test, these women don't need men, and Matthew Libatique makes the screen fizz with his cinematography and K.K. Barrett production design. That fun house was awesome.But does anyone really die in Gotham? Stay tuned.",Birds of Prey

I mean this is like, seventh or eighth movie or something along those lines and only Shazam and WW were worth a damn.As for the movie itself, it's mostly boring, plot is really thin and stupid, acting is okay for the most part. However, tempo, editing and general cohesion of the film itself is all over the place, trying to hide it's flaws with very messy storytelling.About mid runtime, there's a police station action scene, and it actually looked like it's finally gonna kick into the higher gear and start to be a good movie. But no, after that, it got boring again. Jokes are all but one - bad, flat. The only chuckle I had was during ""They call me... "" bits with Huntress.I don't think Black Mask is a good villain in general, however, this movie's version is probably the worst. For a guy that calls himself ""Black Mask"" he wears it - and I'm not kidding - for 20 seconds, tops, throughout the whole movie. He's kinda wacky, but really isn't.
As for the main ""hero"" cast, Jurnee's Black Cannary was probably the best character in it. But the camera is mostly pointed at Harley Quinn and, man, she's just try-too-hard, tiresome after a while.One more thing that I noticed, everyone is dressed so ugly, and the movie itself looks ugly, nondescript.For a time, I've actually expected at least fun movie, it really didn't have to be good, just fun.

Okay Jokes aside (actually I'm quiet serious about that), I was quiet worried when (before the release) some of general reviewers in Youtube called this movie a mess or quiet a little ""Meh"", I mean, c'mon DC, you were already on the right track since Aquaman (2018) until last year's ""Joker"", now you're gonna make another mess like BvS, 2017's Justice League, and 2016's Suicide Squad? I can't take this anymore, I'm a DC fanboy, I can't take any kind of embarrassment of a movie anymore, can't you guys be creative enough to consistently make a movie that everyone likes or even loves? I mean, you're creative enough to produce tens of comicbooks monthly, with literally the same characters which every fans read but suddenly it becomes sucks when you bring it up to the silver screen??? Have you guys learn nothing??? But thankfully, oh thank god, all those worry and disappointment washed away after I decided to watch it myself. Yes not so much were with me at the studio, which is understandable since it's not ""Endgame"", so I decided to just focus on the movie, and guess what? it's pretty fun to watch! Harley is funny, she stole every scene she was in, the absence of Leto's Joker gave rise to her charisma and interest in the general viewers regarding her personality and kickass action that I feel was lacking in 2016's Suicide Squad (though in the story his presence is felt almost in every filth of Gotham and his very name strikes fear in the hearts of the city's biggest mobs, since the filmmaker position him to be like Ledger's Joker than the one portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix). We also get to see her other side, her lovely kind-hearted side that would make anyone easily sympathize and fall for her, I mean seriously Margot Robbie is quiet stunning (almost with the same effect when I first saw Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman on her first portrayal in BvS) on the camera and her acting skill really bring up the best out of Harley Quinn, which makes me wonder how did I not realize this on her first silver screen appearance in 2016?. Ewan McGregor's performance definitely cannot go overlooked too, I don't quietly aware if his character's counterpart from the source material has the exact same personality, but Ewan reaaly kills it on portraying an evil of a mafia boss with anger management issue which constantly is always in a state of flux thanks to his insecurities. Black Canary's appearance is a little bit different from her image in the comicbook, huntress is a little bit weird to me (almost to the point that I think she is a robot), Renee Montoya's performance is sadly I think is just average, and Cassandra Cain, in my surest opinion, is not what fans would expect or hope for to the point that many of them will fall into disappointment. The choreography for the fight scenes, especially the ones that Harley performs, is very cool and badass, though sometimes I think some of it are a little bit forced by the power of the girls' plot armor. The style of some shots and the gag sequences remind me of any movie directed by Quentin Tarantino (maybe inspired, I don't know), some elements from Harley's previous movie are also brought up here (to make an indirect connection I guess) and most of the time, I enjoy watching it from the title to the credits. Sooooo, yeah, I think it's another win for DC, though not commercially, but at least critics like it more than 2016's Suicide Squad and saw this as an improvement and a good sign that DC is finally find it's own way, it's own style of bringing up its beloved characters without as so much as just blatantly copying Marvel's formula. I think DC should prioritize more on the critical acclaim rather than the commercial one, even though the latter is also very important, because in any company or corporation, the quality of the products must always be put first. From there, comes the trust and faith of the customers (in this case, the fans and the general viewers). From there, commercial success automatically follows.",Birds of Prey

Just seen them 'The Old Guard' on Netflix, and that was a brilliant movie it aimed at the right audience, as was the Image comics graphic novel It was based on.
Now this is where, both Margot Robbie & Cathy Yan got it completely wrong which cost them dearly in box office takings! The audience margin age groups, as I said below the film isolated it's core market! The younger audience!Don't get me wrong, Margot Robbie did a brilliant job with this movie! She is perfect in the role of the Villainess errrrr heroine! The others are kind of forgettable!
Too much violence for my liking, the movie just pigeonholed itself in a corner it's better off not being a R-Rated movie. That is the first mistake and biggest. It's lost it's fan base by isolating the age group when it can be a movie for all.
Second mistake, it should not have been Birds of Prey these are hero's they're first in the title name but it all surrounds HarleyQ.",Birds of Prey
376,NDbportmanfan,Best Movie in the Current DC Universe,7,9 February 2020,"Thoroughly enjoyed this one, my main takeaway was Roman Sionis. I expected that he would just be a filler villain with little depth while Harley takes most of the screen time, but I was wrong. His twisted personality was in full force and earned the R rating. They even included his germ phobia with the gloves. Honestly he might be the best villain since Zod.Action sequences were incredibly fun and the pacing was good. I would have preferred a more linear story with this type of movie but the back and forth wasn't too distracting.This doesn't even feel like a superhero movie, more like an uplifting crime drama. Does that make sense? I can see people watching this after a break up and feel better having seen it.

Robbie is fantabulous. She owns every scene, and she sells it as Harley.It's funny. I laughed out loud multiple times.The fighting choreography is excellent. Really fun to watch. This was honestly the best part of the whole thing.Cons:
The rest of the cast is really unimpressive. Not that they don't do a fine job acting, but I just didn't really care about their characters. This is a writing problem, not an acting problem.Ewan McGregor is just comical as a villain. I laughed at him, and when he put on his mask, I laughed harder. It was just weird.I don't get why DC can't tell a cohesive story. This movie was more cohesive than most of their other movies, but it was still all over the place. They just tried to do too much as usual.It was at least a half hour too long, and it felt it.The movie was sold as a girl-power-ensemble sort of flick, but the ladies didn't assemble until like the last twenty minutes.Overall, I'm glad I saw it, but I'll never watch it again.

The script and the dialougue is terrible - often cringeworthy - and the directing is bad (...and here's where people would accuse me of being a male chauvinist just because the writer and the director is female.) But if i know that the actors are great normally (Perez, Winstead, McGregor) and bad in a specific movie, the script and the directing is to blame.

I'm a huge marvel and dc geek so I judge heavily to a degree on superhero films. I'll say this off the bat; if you go into this film expecting anything other than a silly and action packed romp then you will be utterly disappointed. The story is a sequel of sorts to Suicide Squad after she breaks up with the Joker, and her trying to survive against Black Mask. Margot Robbie plays Harley Quinn superbly; even better than Suicide Squad I'd wager. The acting besides her was decent. Ewan McGregor played Black Mask to the best of the script which was still the strongest DCEU villain to date. Black Canary and Cassandra Cain were equally cool. I personally didn't like the cop Montoya or Huntress who played an overly goth child with rage issues and reminded me of a poor attempt at Sigourney Weaver; Zsasz also was blah to me compared to the Zsasz in Gotham. The humor was rampant and relentless; had me laughing at numerous spots. The action was constant and had some cringe worthy scenes for some who don't have the strongest stomaches.

The only reason I watched it was because I love Harley Quinn. But going by the trailers I had a bad feeling about it. And when they changed its name to more feature her, I worried even more.I finally watched it and I was very disappointed. While Robbie was excellent as Harley yet again, they wasted her potential. I'll skip the fact that the ""team"" doesn't get together until the last 20 minutes. But it felt like they really had no good ideas for a story and just ended up throwing in a bunch of super  stuff to try and sell it. Now normally I don't mind female power, I think it's great. Wonder Woman, Captain America...etc did it well. But it fell flat in this. It felt like 99% of the movie focused on every man in it and every woman was good. Literally even good men are shown as bad. And while I can agree the ""good"" men turned on the women, it felt over the top with its message. It lost focus on a good story.If you thought Suicide Squad was all over the place then you will find this to be a nightmare. The amount of songs in it was also a bit much. I do understand this type of goofiness is what you think of when you think of Harley, but it was very cringy in this. They would have been better leaving the Birds of Prey loose storyline out of it really. To be fair I can't think of what a good Harley story would be since people always associate her with Joker. Which is why despite how Joker treats her, she really works with him in a movie.The only reason I even get it a 3 star was because, again, of Robbie's performance is wonderful. You can tell she put a lot into being Harley again. While I doubt we will get any more movies with her, we are stuck with this. This flop. I feel like DC only makes amazing movies or terrible movies.

So the movie is set in the same universe as its predecessor Suicide Squad (yes, that mess) this time exploring the famous Joker girlfriend, former psychologist Harley Quinn and her (future) group of vigilantes the Birds of Prey.
The tone of the movie resembles a lot Deadpool, being slightly less violent but attempting a similar formula of the empathic mercenary, fourth wall breaker beating her way up to the main vilain!There are a couple of things that I found negative in the movie, the first being the lack of humanity of Harley Quinn. Sure Deadpool was more of satire than an actual superhero movie, but that's established and as the movie progresses that idea becomes more clear, Harley Quinn on the other end is a villain which of course can be explored not to become a 2 dimensional character however, she is clearly likable and easily made a hero here, which doesn't seem to add up - by the way this also applies to the predecessor Suicide Squad, for pretty much all of those characters, where we are supposed to see a villain or better yet an Anti Hero, we actually see heroes, not much of agrey are there to explore",Birds of Prey

Harley is now target by all the criminals that she and Mr. J hurt. When of Batman villain, Black Mask puts a hit on young girl who stole a diamond, Harley must team up with Black Canary, Huntress and Rene Montoya to protect her and bring Black Mask down.I've seen Bird of Prey show when I was in my teen with the original trio; Oracle, Huntress & Black Canary, but in this film version they left out Oracle out in it and replace her with her Batgirl replacement, Cassandra Cain. Harley Quinn was never member of the Birds of Prey. The movie has no plot development but it's meant to be a fun movie or cult classics in the future like Suicide Squad. The storyline is trashy and the screenwriter didn't do a good job researching for Cain as a pickpocket. They didn't give Huntress enough screentime, Renee Montoya has no purpose in the story and neither does Black Canary and Huntress are not interesting enough as they were in the TV series (live action & cartoon). But they real kick-ass like Harley. Other character that surprise not present are Commissioner Gordon, Harvey Bullock and Crispus Allen because they will defend Montoya at GCP. In the film all the police has no respect for her; but in Batman: The Animated Series they treated her equal. Harley Quinn BFF Poison Ivy is absent too, because whenever she not with the Joker she go with and team up with Ivy. They should not called the movie Birds of Prey because it was not about them until the end of the movie. Or they could just do Gotham City Sirens with her, Catwoman and Poison Ivy. The highlight of the film is the fight scene at the end.The only thing that save this movie is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Ewan McGregor. Margot steals the show once more like she did in the Suicide Squad. McGregor's version of Black Mask's crazy, sadist and is Narcissistic but he's enough to scary women and campy at the sometimes. I agreed with fans they shouldn't killed him off like that because he's Batman villain and he should be in the next Batman movie. I guess Ewan didn't want to be in another film franchise but he's still good. I won't be surprise if they will make a DC animated movie soon like they did the Suicide Squad.

It doesn't take itself too seriously, it's pretty funny and the characters and action are over the top.I think this movie unfairly gets a lot of stick because it's a female lead movie, but it's much better than other movies that try to have an all female cast.Ewan McGregor does a fine job playing a villain for a change. Might be your standard over the top villain, but I feel he blends moments of campiness and moments of intimidating bad guy to keep him more interesting than many more forgettable movie villains.Special mention to Margot Robbie expanding on the character she brought to life in ""Suicide squad"" and showing a more empathetic side, making her a likeable unlikely heroine.",Birds of Prey

Suicide Squad was a pleasant surprise compared to the vomit they had been spitting out for years and as pleasant a surprise is the Birds Of Prey.The movie has been accused of Extreme Feminism???? That the movie suggests men are bad, women are good propaganda?? You might be confusing this movie with the new Charlie's Angels movie. Just like the Joker can not be a woman, what did you want, the Birds of Prey gang to be men??

So I started to watch this and I couldn't even get through an hour. Its very good that Hollywood recognizes that female directors have something to offer. There are many good ones out there including Katherine Bigelow who has made some awesome movies. There are many Chinese directors who are also very good and have had very successful careers. So what I don't understand is the need to pick someone who had only done one other feature film in her short career, an arthouse pic. Certainly there were more skilled and deserving Chinese women directors out there. The tone of the movie is all over the place. The action was so choreographed I felt like I was watching a dance recital. The frenetic pace seemed to be a symptom of bad story telling, not a method of story telling. This could have been a good movie and still hit all of the necessary societal undertones it wanted to. Movies can be fun and still have a message, even super/anti hero movies. This is definitely not one of them and I felt the failure lay in the director's chair.",Birds of Prey

I know it was directed by a women (Cathy Yan) and I know the main Character is a women but I don't think it was needed for the story.Not sure how well a movie with a strong a Anti-Female message would go down. But then again it would never be made and that says something. Its very offensive to men in generalBut putting that aside I just could not get into this at all and it just felt stupid, immature and truthfully insulting to my intelligence and gender.If you want a true girl power movie then show how powerful girls can be not this garbage.

that relies on timing, comedic value and a good plot.Its cinematography and editing are much better than that of Suicide Squad.It's not a man-hating movie either, though the men in question are really not that pleasant.

401,gazzalodi,Suffers from too many undeveloped characters,5,18 May 2020,"The movie feels like DC/WB rushed it into production after everyone agreed Robbie was the best thing in Suicide Squad. Unfortunately WB didn't let Robbie carry this movie on her own and instead weighed the story down with too many other characters they tried to develop. In a better universe this movie would have come out after we had movie that introduced Huntress' backstory. It's only towards the end that we get to really have chance to see Winstead's take on the character. Her humorous social awkwardness was never really given enough room to shine in a loaded ensemble piece. Likewise Perez's Montoya and Smollet's Canary are not fleshed out well in the runtime allotted. The movie also feels like a step backwards as far as Harley's skills are concerned. In Suicide Squad she was lethal when not distracted by something shiny. Here her skills seem to play second fiddle to blind luck at times. DC has much more interesting characters than Marvel in their stable. It's really frustrating that they can't figure out how to do anything decent with them most of the time. The Harley-Joker breakup in the comics with Poison Ivy would have been a much better film, with less clutter and more of a chance for Robbie to chew up the scenery.",Birds of Prey

409,TakeUpReel,"I like this, but...",7,18 February 2020,"...there should have been a few changes to make the movie better.I thought Ewan McGregor performance (as Roman) missed the mark. I didn't find him to be a menacing ""bad guy."" His character was either way too over the top (yes, even for a comic book movie)...or...his character was too flat. Chris Messina (Victor) played a better bad guy than Ewan. I wanted the roles to be swapped as I was watching the movie.Rosie Perez's performance (as Renee) was cringe worthy. Maybe her character was written poorly. Maybe she did the best with what she had to work with. I don't know.Ella Jay Basco (Cassandra) was....meh. I think a lot of other actors could have played her role (and probably been much better),I really like Mary Elizabeth Winstead, but her character (the Huntress) seemed to be tacked on at the last minute. (I'm sure it wasn't, but it felt that way.....and that's the problem!) Speaking of M.E.W. was she get sucked into a black hole and elongated like a piece of spaghetti? She looks super tall and super thin compared to her role in Scott Pilgrim. For me, it was distracting. However, I would like to see more of her backstory in a B.O.P sequel.The title is way too long, although the studio(s) changed the title part-way through it's release in theaters.They could have used more of ""Bruce"" in the movie, but maybe they reached their GCI budget limit with the glitter scene.Margot Robbie was perfect in the role. She nailed Harley Quinn's character and seemed to have fun doing it.Jurnee Smollett-Bell was fun to watch as Black Canary.This seems like your average DC comic book movie.Was this great?...No!

410,verminhater,Margot's Harley can't carry a film on her own,3,20 April 2020,"First off Margot Robbie makes a good Harley Quinn. She plays the character perfectly. It seems as though those who made this film thought that was enough. There's precious little story told and the fight scenes ought to have had the ""pow"" and ""blam"" captions of the 60's Batman series as they were so badly choreographed it looked like they were aiming for the send up market. Having female leads, a female writer and a female director is not a substitute for a story worth telling. Harley Quinn comes across as strictly a sidekick rather than any main event and that ought to have been obvious right from the start.Try starting with a decent script, get some stunt women who can fight and stop relying on a sidekick to carry the film in their entirety.",Birds of Prey

412,Lost_In_Translation_,"First half setup slog, 2nd half okay plot.",5,6 February 2020,"Birds of Prey is split into two halves that really just don't fit well together as a full movie. The first hour or so is setting up all of the characters. Harley gets the most of this time, but Black Canary , Renee Montoya and Cassie Cain each get shortened establishment. The 2nd half is where the movie finally starts it's plot, but one that just isnt that interesting.The comedy is definitely going for a Deadpool-esque vibe. Although it never gets as raunchy as DP does. It's rarely as funny as it thinks it is.The Huntress was probably the only funny aspect because of her self seriousness in contrast to the other wacky characters. She's a dark serious type hero, a Batman caricature of sorts. The bit about being initially called ""The Crossbow Killer"" is decently funny. It's sad that she's only really a major character in the last 1/4th of this movie.The plot is really just a device to introduce the characters and tell Harley's story. It boils down to bad guy, Black Mask, is after a diamond with microscopic bank information etched in it, Harley and other mercenaries are sent to get it. This story doesn't actually kick in until the hour mark as Harley freeze frames and rewinds back to establishing Det. Montoya, Black Canary, and Cassandra Cain for the first hour literally just before the plot gets into gear. It just halts everything as now they want to make sure we really understand the non-Harley characters.The action was lacking and uninspired as well. It relied way too much on slow-mo fights or just too much going on to really understand it all. You know you have a poorly made fight sequence when they decide to use slow motion on every punch or hit to make it seem cooler than it is.I hate to compare it to Marvel and I'd like it to stand on it's own merits, but it comes off as a failed attempt at a Guardians crossed with Deadpool (which Suicide Squad was also a failed attempt at). It for sure could have taken a few notes from Guardians and how superbly well that movie set up the characters and got the plot into gear within the first 45 mins of that one.Margot Robbie is still great despite the material, and I really enjoyed Mary Elizabeth Winatead's caricature of a super serious dark hero, but besides those this movie just isn't that interesting. It's just a mediocre imitation of two superhero formulas done much better before it.",Birds of Prey

418,Web_Of_Doom,Some good amongst some bad!,5,12 February 2021,"So a 5 out of 10 is just about worth a watch if on TV already & if you in the mood for an ""action packed not taking itself too seriously film"" with some good choreographed fight scenes, as yes you hope for much more but you get about your expectations.I always feel with a movie like this if the movie makers took it more serious like the Christian Bale Batman films & concentrated on a better more logical storyline they could have then made a really great movie, however they chose not to go this route which is a real shame as a much better more believable script would have been a possibility. I think the actors & director needed a much better screen play script.Harley Quinn's character is literally ""crazy"" like the Joker character ( Heath Ledger, Jack Nicholson or even Cesar Romero all were believable in their Batman worlds ).
So the point is Harley Quinn can be 100% outlandish so long as everyone else acts how they would do in a normal world then you could really appreciate such a film.
So if like the original Batman series with Adam West you can have more family friendly characters, but with Birds of Prey it is a 15 rated movie so as fans we want something more like The Dark Knight 2008 as we want something that could then in theory cross over the best DC film genres, however Birds of Prey is not up to it.I personally did not like the film Joker 2019 but that was not Joaquin Phoenix fault, as again it is down to the script ( as others loved it so good for them ) but again we as fans want to see cross over films that are quality adult entertainment but so far let's say most of these DC films are just not as Marvellous ( pun intended ) as they should be. Only the Christian Bale Batman 2005 to 2012 trilogy is truly top notch & now I see in 2022 this great actor is starring in Marvel's Thor: Love & Thunder, which is a good indicator of where the best actors are finding the best scripts.It is time the makers of DC films had a serious rethink as they have the potential to be as good as Marvel films but they have to start by getting a truly great script for a movie & making sure they then have a great director & actors to make it great.",Birds of Prey

Not funny, not big on good action, IMO the characters are not entertaining enough to make a movie about them.Maybe Harley Quinn might have been good enough for a solo movie but adding the others was not a good idea. The script did them no favors. Using characters with no significant powers makes a movie with a lot of talking instead of action. They got a good female character with Wonder Woman and I guess they think they can just throw any script and females together and it will do as well as Wonder Woman.Wonder Woman kicking all that butt is believable because she has super powers. But somehow a small female can take out groups of men double her size is just stupid. In reality even a trained female her size wouldn't be able to make it past all those guys.The detective was annoying as can be.

421,soundoflight,Hot Mess,4,15 February 2020,"I went into the theater with pretty close to zero expectations for ""Birds of Prey,"" and for the first 1/3 of the film, I thought that maybe I had it all wrong. While the plot is so thin as to be almost non-existent, the storytelling was done in a non-linear way with a cute Margot Robbie voiceover that made it interesting to watch. The style and visuals were interesting and it seemed to be going for a kind of self-depreciating ""why so serious?"" take on the superhero genre, similar to the wildly popular ""Deadpool."" There was potential for a good film there.But this all fell apart quickly, and the rest of the movie caved in on itself in service of moving the ridiculous plot forward and the seemingly obligatory ""superhero"" action sequence of all the girls kicking butt, which was so corny and over the top I couldn't tell anymore if the film was taking itself seriously or had devolved into satire (I suspect the former, sadly). There is one moment in the fight sequence where the film totally ""jumps the shark"" so to speak and my theatre erupted in laughter (anyone who has seen the movie should know exactly what I'm talking about). The only redeeming thing that carried me to the end was Margot Robbie's acting, as she is interesting to watch in every scene. All of the other characters are cardboard cutouts.""Birds of Prey"" seems to have gotten filmmaking backwards. Good films start with solid plot and interesting characters and have their messages (if any) come out naturally. ""Birds of Prey"" starts with notions of female empowerment, women beating up men, and toxic masculinity, and attempts to build a story around these fixed and immobile points. Such an approach can never, and will never, succeed in making a good film.",Birds of Prey
422,pedroquintaoo,Has everything I wanted... Except a good plot,6,7 February 2020,"Finally Warner/DC gave the opportunity to their directors be full creative, as they're not worried about the the R rating. That's good and seems to be one of the ingredients to create new awesome (and different) movies.
Birds of Prey is really creative, the clothes, scenarios and cinematography are incredible; Margot Robbie gives her best as Harley Quinn; the action sequences are simple and very well choreographed (showing how sometimes a blockbuster doesn't need to have big explosions, cities in danger, or colossal spaceships to be awesome).
It's everything good, except the script and the editing. The first is more of the same and give us a story that doesn't have anything new, neither has a plot twist, is really predictable and sometimes can be just a little boring. The second tries to be original, looking fresh and but unfortunately sometimes the way that Birds of Prey is edited doesn't fix well in the main story.It's not bad, to be honest Warner Bros gave us a nice movie with some fresh concepts. However the plot isn't interesting at all and that's the biggest enemy of Birds of Prey. But, being optimistic, I think the DC Universe is going in a good way.For me is just a 6/10",Birds of Prey
423,mc1382,Yes yes and yes,9,6 February 2020,"Here it is, what I've been waiting for, the first mainstream comic adaptation that actually has style, takes risks with its story and feels personal to its director. There is a clear director voice here and it drips through every scene throughout. The movie is very hyperactive and has a habit of jumping all over the place (There are sequences where the film will speed up, have a choppy frame rate and become really absurdist, which might turn some viewers off) but I think it's a great narrative choice. This perfectly mirrors the personality of Harley Quinn and the narration ties into this idea and elevates the female perspective of the film in a big way.Margot Robbie is fantastic as Harley Quinn using charisma and a wide array of dynamic facial expressions to really sell her character. The side characters are great too with Rosie Perez and Ewan McGregor being standouts in particular. I can't get over how many hilarious scenes there is of McGregors freaking out, it really must be seen to be believed. There is also a self-aware element to the film which playfully acts as a commentary on cliched superhero films but it's never to an annoying or pretentious extent.The themes tie into the personal element of the film. Harley's journey of independence from the joker, her captors and the trap of her own life is very relatable and resonant. I think this also mirrors Cathy Yan's own rise in the film industry as she is a newcomer, seeks her own lane and plays to the studio system in her own way. This is why the film feels unique because it actually incorporates the journey of its creators into the film itself. While I feel some of the exposition choices are lacking, could've been more attention on certain characters and there are some bizarre choices here and there (particularly the ending) I absolutely loved this. Not only is it fun, crazy and ballsy but it has a personal element that really speaks to the unique narrative voice the director has. Make more films like this, please.",Birds of Prey

The villain shockingly bad (probably one of worst acting performances I have ever seen from Ewan McGreggor). The action sequences were done by someone who likes paint by numbers and is still unsure if it's right. The sets....oh dear....and one or two of the CGI (there is a terrible piece of computer generation as Harley takes the kid into a food establishment - done on an iPhone 3GS?).It's all so amateurish and I am so glad cinema audiences were never subjected to this absolute car crash of a film.It's really bad.Dialogue is so cheesy.I mean you watch this film with friends to laugh at how bad it is. How cliched and hackneyed everything about it is.Margot Robbie does her best but nothing can redeem this mess.Whereas Marvel have really thought out story (there are phases to their storytelling for goodness sakes!) and provided funding and found film crews to realise those stories, DC have failed.DC are just cobbling together scraps to make films.Their output seems to be for people so bored with their lives they want to watch something even more boring than their own lives.Which must say something about me.But, I watch them for the hope of finding a gem and yet unearth crap.Oh well, watch it if you are drunk, with friends and want to laugh at bad film making.

I watched it last weekend to prepare for this one, and it wasn't as bad as I had expected. Despite Margot Robbie continuing to be an incredibly compelling screen presence, that alone wasn't enough to save this from being a mildly stinky pile of poo.I always hate being negative about a film written by a woman and directed by a woman and featuring five badass women in the climactic fight scene, since we're still sorely lacking in representation. But it's hard to be overly positive about a shabbily written and derivatively directed movie that made me feel kind of icky and that while offering slight entertainment, ended up curdling into unpleasant and unbelievable girl power run amok. The casting was great and diverse and Margot Robbie made a really unpleasant character somewhat less awful.

430,reisen55,What fun?,4,10 February 2020,"The DC universe is soooo serious about itself and dramatic while Marvel learned that a soft shoulder and humor works wonders. We have only a few kinda sorta good films in DC but this is far from one of them. Theme still comes off of SUICIDE SQUAD which is quirky different fun but an acquired taste. Not bad. So I can survive violent fun films but here ...... wow, first 20 minutes and I walked out of the theatre. That bad. When the punishment by a villain makes one really want to upchuck the popcorn? Way bad taste. Trust me, you'll know it when you see it. So here is 20 minutes worth of bad and if you want 30, go for it.",Birds of Prey
431,FilmChamp20,This was a waste of characters,3,23 March 2020,"I tried to give this movie a chance. I wanted so bad to be proven wrong that it was just a cash grab political message. I wasn't.I wanted to like this movie for Margot Robbie's Harley so bad because in my eyes, she's the perfect Harely Quinn, much like Ryan Reynolds is the perfect Deadpool.
But...
The only good thing in this movie is Robbie's Harley, but it wasn't enough to carry the movie. The rest of the characters were awful. Not a single one was even an attempt at a respectful representation of the comic book character. Might as well have been new made up characters. Awful is putting it lightly. Black Canary, Huntress, Black Mask, Zazz, and Cassandra Cain were not seen in this movie. At all.To put the cherry on top of this horrible Sunday, the whole movie was filled with man hate, white people hate, and terrible man stereotyping. I would understand some of it to an extent due to Harley being upset at Joker, but the propaganda of the hatred of men was in every aspect of the movie...from all main characters. Too much misandry advertisement and display of disgusting people who happen to be men of course...displaying cliche stereotypical dialogue and actions.I hope I get to see all these characters again in a different movie and universe, especially Robbie's Harley Quinn. The rest of them need to be forgotten about.",Birds of Prey

Like 2019's Hellboy, the R rating was a HUGE MISTAKE.The action went from Power Rangers kids afternoon TV slapstick, to broken bones really strangely. Harley has never been an R-rated character, but I guess they wanted to pull 'Logan, Deadpool' money which I kind of doubt they will with how ridiculous the SJW, Neo-Feminism & misandry was (all villains are white men, slow, mean, stupid, rapists...).Canary, Huntress, Batgirl, Zsasz & Black Mask were unrecognizable & really weak pale versions of their interesting & exciting comic counterparts & Montoyas casting & character was a REALLY bad fit.
Rosie Perez looked uncomfortable the whole movie, & her 55 year old cop character joining a team of super heroes was stupid & made no sense.Costuming design was bad, casting was terrible.Ewan Macgregor should not have accepted this after reading how cringe his role & the story was.A lot of mistakes, poor decisions & a lot of stolen stuff from Deadpool, Suicide Squad & Spider-Man cartoon & probably 100 other things.

435,salinaqvi,Fantabulous Fun,7,27 February 2020,"Birds Of Prey in its 105min runtime gives us a truly enjoyable time. The action (which were done by the same team that does John Wick) was superbly done and truly something on the level of (uhh) John Wick. The acting performances of Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor were excellent. And the soundtrack was surprisingly awesome to the point where I can honestly say I could listen to most of these songs in my own free time. However the main complaint I would say is that the plot is somewhat basic, taking a deadpool-esque story which while okay didnt really do much except for the ending which was quite unexpected (in a good way). Also a little sidenote for anyone who reads comic books, the film aside from Harley Quinn isnt that faithful to its source material so if you do care about that, just be warned that you will be watching a different take on these characters. In the end, if you're looking to have a fun time (which this film definitely gives!) and you dont take the film too seriously, then you should definitely watch this.",Birds of Prey
436,rams_lakers,Worse than expected,1,20 June 2021,"Saw it on a flight, was a decent time waster but a horrible film. Other than Margo Robbie, who shines in her role, the other actors were miscast. This film was obviously a Robbie vehicle, as the director/editor loved to include many many various shots of her mugging for the camera. Robbie is great in smaller doses, like in One Upon a Time in Hollywood where she was the 3rd star. You want more of her, but when the film gives you too much you want less.Evan McGregor: love the actor, but in this film he overacts. Not as bad as Pablo Pascal in WW 84, but it's clearly obvious here that comic book villains must overact for some reason. Rosie Perez, the world's most annoying actress in White Men Can't Jump with her loud accent, was surprisingly more subdued here. Didn't care for her or her character though. The girl who played Huntress reminded me of Richie's date the Statue of Liberty chick in the 70's Happy Days Halloween episode. Tall, clumsy, and not really there. The Wallmart toy crossbow they gave her was laughably small. A better actress with a ""Darryl from Walking Dead-sized"" Xbow would've worked better. The girl with the booger nose ring, please ladies, stop with this nonsense. It makes you look much much worse and it's very distracting. And lastly the worst casting of them all, the fat asian who played Cassandra was unbelievably bad. Running away through most of the film, not only did she not represent the comic character in looks but she was a wimp with zero abilities.Most of the acting, directing and editing gets a zero. Do yourself a favor and skip this. No one's giving you the 2 hours back. I like superhero movies but this one falls flat.",Birds of Prey

439,rogier-86785,Wonderfully Uneven,7,2 November 2021,"Harley Quinn is a colorful, surprising, uneven but very loveable character to begin with, which right off the bat (pun intended) is a good summary of the film as well. In her core, Quinn is a selfish person but not always prone to pure evil, making her one of the more interesting personas from the DC Comics and as such, very easy to translate to the silver screen.It certainly helps that Margot Robbie plays Harley with a relish that suggests the character was solely made for her to perform it one day. What also helps is Ewan McGregor as the bad guy, showing us just how versatile an actor he is, because honestly, the character itself is not particularly interesting, yet Ewan still makes him so.Critique is also easy to give. The director has chosen to built up the story unevenly, in line with the main character. This both helps and hurts the movie. It helps because it's very creative because of it, but it hurts because you feel the film could have been directed tighter. The end result is that while the cast performs well, comedic timing and fighting is sometimes off. Let's just say the pacing could've been a lot better. It's just not so tight of a film overall.My main comment however is that because we're so focused on Harley, one of the main stars of this universe is forgotten: The city of Gotham itself. Compared to the many other adventures we've seen in this universe, most notably the absurd but fascinating Gotham series, the city gives us no sense of space or anchorpoint in this film. Thus will really feel like we're missing something because Gotham is supposed to grand, looming over all its characters, almost as it compells them to do evil. It's a real missed chance and a bit baffling to be honest.Still, it's a fun flick. Whatever the niggles, you gotta live Robbie. Erm... I mean Harley ;)",Birds of Prey

The performances are solid to great, the directing is basically an assignment at the Deadpool School of Directing (decently done), but it is the writing that fails this film. The second half is entertaining with awesomely choreographed fight scenes and Harley's playful/psycho side no longer feels contrived. While Ewan McGregor's Black Mask is a wonderful personification of the no-consequences, entitled frat boy culture, it loses a bit of its effectiveness because every single man is evil or incompetent. I am not certain if this is meant to mirror the standard Hollywood portrayal of women or...not? Finally, I found it odd that the movie used the same bookending device as Hudson Hawk.

The action isn't as near as John Wick's but aren't cheap quick shots that many action fight scenes love to do to save time; It was very much like Pulp Fiction and Deadpool, a narrator narrating different pieces of the story for different characters not so much in chronological order; but this movie doesn't catch as much of the humor that Deadpool had to offer(not to say that's a bad thing).

All men are either useless, stupid, misogynistic, evil or some combination of all. And the hero of this film is a narcissistic, violent, psychopath who loves egg sandwiches, isn't that cute, funny quirky and irreverent, laugh! You non-progressive oppressor. Btw, in what way was she emancipated? She had no restrictions on her behavior at any point, she makes no growth as a character, the one thing she does get over is her breakup with the Joker, but we never see him or the dynamic of their relationship, no codependency, abuse, nothing hinted at that she suffered from and then later overcame through the course of the movie. Leaving all of the subtext and messaging aside, the movie on its own merit isn't good. The villain couldn't be any weaker and more forgettable, the characters are paper thin because there are too many of them to flesh out and the whole poop out the diamond storyline, what is this a 1980s TV show? It's uninspired, unimaginative and dated. I can't think of one memorable scene in this movie I liked and no I can't get into fight scenes in which 200lb stuntmen fly around trying not to accidently hurt 120lb women in heels, makeup and wigs. How are they able to break bones or knock them out with one blow? There's no context in terms of rigorous training or super strength or agility. No, they're kicking their butts with feminism and if you don't like it you must hate women. Good luck with that marketing and trying shame people into liking your movie WBs, because it worked so well with Ghostbusters. It may sound like I didn't enjoy this film, but if it had a little bit more narration it might have swayed me, there were 2mins or so of screen time in which there wasn't any narration either telling me what I was about to see with my own eyes or trying to fill in holes in the swiss cheese storyline in postproduction. At least Suicide Squad was just a bad movie, this is a bad movie that makes you feel like Alex in a Clockwork Orange. You'd better watch and see what a terrible person you are for having a penis and if you don't I'll tell the world it's because you're scared of empowered vaginas. I wonder how all of the people that made, support or just enjoyed this film would feel about it if all of the gender roles were switched and if the answer is, they've already seen Hollywood make those films, then I hope they have enough self-awareness to then understand how I felt watching this.",Birds of Prey

It's an aright time waster, but I didn't care much for the characters.

This is a hell of a good popcorn movie, the one Suicide Squad was intended to be, with Margot Robbie's encore performance as Harley Quinn delivering once again all the snarky humor, action and appalling psychopathology that the fates decided Jared Leto's Joker just wasn't meant to. The reason it works so well this time, first, is that the charismatic Harley is now the center of attention, and second, they seem to have finally gotten the idea that a comic book movie, however dark, is supposed to be FUN.It's a seriously overstimulating film (a fight almost broke out at the screening I attended) with lots of cartoonish ultraviolence, a lickety-split pace and more candy colored bling than the Claire's at your local mall.

I was surprised and excited that the Birds of Prey we're getting a movie. The movie is a wild ride. I'll start out with that. This is 100% not for children, so be advised. Harley is the main character and I feel like this is as close to a solo film as we are going to get. Margot Robbie is better than ever as Harley Quinn. Her comedic timing is perfect and her action scenes are bone crunchingly bad ass! I am a huge fan of Huntress and have been for a long time. I also love Mary Elizabeth Winstead so I knew the character would be done right and it was. Renée Montoya is a wonderful character played by Rosie Perez. Renée is the oldest of the girls and she plays it with ease and with a sense of street smarts as well. She also has a mean punch. Black Canary is played by Jurnee Smollett-Bell and is a runaway stand out. She is sassy and can kick the crap out of anyone. The Black Canary also has the power of sonic scream and that is awesome to see on screen. The girls are best when they are together hands down. The fight scenes are part John wick and part deadpool in the best ways possible. I really loved the fight scenes. They were surprisingly violent. Ewan McGregor was amazing as Black Mask!

The 5 girls gather to fight at the end because of the fate (and the script).

It's actually a fun movie that feels like a comic book, bright colors, great visuals and nice violent action. The cast and characters have great chemistry and Margot Robbie is finally growing on me as Harley Quinn. Compared to Suicide Squad, this one doesn't feel like a cluster bomb of footage that's scattered around and doesn't go anywhere. Quinn feels like Quinn and the action is a lot of fun and well choreographed. The movie does take a good note from Suicide Squad as to how weird Gotham City is, and just how weirder it's inhabitants can be. There's fun violence and action and though it might bore some people in the year by jumping around a lot, it's more cohesive than a lot of other films. We're looking at the soft reboot of Suicide Squad and it's much more of a film to champion nowadays. Robbie is easily the best thing in it, but the whole cast is fun and play off each other very well. Ewan McGregor is so much fun as the villain and he's having fun with it. There's a lot of good character details that stay true to the comics, and it's good to see some new characters get the spotlight.

465,mcgrew,Why on earth couldn't this just have been Harley Quinn?,1,30 March 2020,"It's not clear to me that the makers of this movie ever read a Harley Quinn comic -- or indeed, a Birds of Prey comic. The best I can figure is they looked at some covers, ,and that's it. The story of Harley and the Joker is plenty of story. It's a battered-woman finding herself. It's a criminal coming to find a new role for herself in society. It's a woman who is an enemy to the Batman, discovering that he is a far more valuable human being than her ex. It's bittersweet. It'd make a great movie.But this? It's a movie that seems to have been rewritten and reshot so many times that nobody could remember what or who the movie was about. There were a bunch of terrible decisions. #1 - that Birds of Prey was a candidate for spinoff, and must therefore be given enough screen time to build potential audience. (This is based on the mistaken belief that Harley is merely a spinoff character from Suicide Squad.) #2 - That the story couldn't tell itself, and therefore had to be narrated (the ""Deadpool did it"" fallacy.) #3 - That Harley could not be an action hero, but had (for all of the character-introduction and much of the movie) to be a merely lucky buffoon. (Even when she blows up Joker's chemical plan, she's fall-down drunk.) #4 assumed that because the guy who played the joker for 2 minutes in SS wasn't available, they couldn't use ""the Joker"" as a character at all. Harley exists because of the Joker. He is the siren song of evil to her. Most of her struggle is to not be under his spell again. Read the flippin' comics. #5 assumed that you-go-girl was by far the most important 'message' that it should be shoehorned into the story in a manner rather like Harley's favorite weapon, a giant hammer. (The ""Ghostbuster did it"" fallacy.)Some say this is a remake of Deadpool. It is certainly intended to be as much like it in tone as it could be. But Harley herself? Not as well written, not as well plotted, and frankly, not as well acted. I've read that ""Black Mask"" was supposed to be a closeted gay, but the studio ordered that be dropped, because otherwise the movie would have been declared homophobic. It would have been an interesting inclusion, actually -- it would have made him afraid of his own organization as well as the good gals, and set him in a far more (and to many gay men, resonant) complex light.But Joker is the evil angel in any Harley story. Having her dispose of him entirely with a remake of the ""When he cheats"" music video is to miss out on, well, the story of Harley Quinn.Skip this movie. It's just plain not worth an hour-and-a-half of your life.",Birds of Prey

467,rnixon1974,The title was a bit much,3,8 March 2020,"This was no better (and no worse) than Suicide Squad.From what I can see, this movie is for kids who have had too much sugar/caffeine/stimulants over a long period of time.I found Robbie to inhabit Harley well, as she did before. As others have mentioned, however, here she has little to work with. The script is choppy, with some truly awful lines interspersed through it; they thud to the ground in more than a few places. Winstead, Robbie and MacGregor are normally strong performers, but Yan's direction and Hodson's screenplay have them standing in knee deep mud for about a third of this film.Other reviewers have bemoaned the film's feminist bent. There is a decent amount of male bashing in this movie. The thing is, after so many girl power flicks over the last several years, this one is just another in the line. It's not humorless like Atomic Blonde. It is not full of love triangles and melodrama like the television series Batwoman. That much is an improvement.Watch the 1990s cartoons for the original Harleen Quinzel. Better direction and writing, and also... Batman.As an aside, Joss Whedon did better than most superhero based films 20 years ago with a show about a certain vampire slayer. Anyone who paid to see this Birds of Prey mishmash would do better to rediscover Sarah Michelle Gellar and Eliza Dushku in that series, and the spinoff, Angel.",Birds of Prey
468,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,Harley Quinn and her Bird of Prey friends rule.,8,9 February 2020,"After I saw Suicide Squad, I so let down by how bland, tamed and poorly made it was for a movie made of up crazy and heightened characters. Birds of Prey luckily is not that. It is by far a huge improvement with how Harley Quinn and the supporting characters function into the story and tone.After finally breaking free from Jared Leto's Joker (and thankfully he is barely in it), Harley discovers the cost of being free from a toxic relationship with the most feared criminal is now she is no longer protected from every other criminal that wants revenge.Margot Robbie gets to finally make Harley Quinn feel fully realized in her hyper and abstract performance. While Suicide Squid's used flashbacks to show her obssession with the Joker, BOP instead uses her breakup with the clown to explore her sense of indepence in a world that wants her dead, in jail or to be used. The story greatly shows how Quinn's skills of being a former psychologist can be what makes her alienate and infuriating the people around her. Most of Robbie's BOP co-stars get moments to shine thanks to Christina Hodson's screenplay taking the time to explore how each of them deal with living in the toxic, crime-filled world of Gotham. Jurnee Smollet-Bell gives a moral dimension to Black Canary as the daughter of a former superhero trying to lay low. Her character is the closest to being a complete hero but because of a simple nice act to help Harley, she ends up unintentionally as one of Roman Sionus's hired goons. Rosie Perez shines as the veteran cop Renee Montoya whose mission to serve the law feels unsatisfying with her sexist male co-workers looking down on her and putting a strain on the relationship with her district attorney girlfriend. Breakout star Ella Jay Basco as Cassandra Cain serves the emotional center piece very well to help Harley Quinn feel she can be looked up to for once. While I was really wanting more of her on screen, Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Huntress becomes a scene-stealer with what little she gets from the way she brutally takes out criminals with her crossbow to awkward moments of her trying to be social. Ewan McGregor fully embraces how cruel yet also very pathetic his villain Roman Sionus/Black Mask can be. His character's attempt to prove that he is the coolest and most dangerous criminal in Gotham comes off as hilarious a lot of times. Yet there were moments when McGregor takes his performance to terrifying levels when Roman asserts his own power on others that he feels don't respect him in very disturbing ways.Despite Birds of Prey being her second feature film, director Cathy Yan shoots the film with superb confidence and expertise delivering a hyper and frenetic energy that makes all the scenes feel very lively and colorful along with help from cinematographer Mathew Libatique staging the shots to feel very vibrant with specific color choices. And when paired with John Wick director Chad Stahelski as the second-unit to push the quality of the fight choreography to superb, Yan makes the action of Birds of Prey feel very heightened and dirty but still look visually-stunning to watch.Unfortunately the plot is a little convoluted for a very simple story about Harley Quinn. The movie takes a lot of inspiration from the non-chronological narrative of Pulp Fiction and the fourth-wall breaking of Deadpool. While it does work with showing how unreliable Harley is as a narrator, it felt like it breaks the movie's face-paced, energetic flow. While the plot macguffin wasn't a doomsday device like in other comic book movies it still felt really ridiculous with how created large stakes for Gotham. It felt like it acted as a means to get the characters together to form the Birds of Prey yet it also makes their team-up feel like an afterthought. The reshoots on this movie did feel a bit noticeable with unusual scene transitions and certain character motivations. While these were problems I noticed, they were still nowhere near as bad as those issues in Suicide Squad. And BOP achieves what that previous DC anti-hero movie failed at is by embracing the full craziness of Harley Quinn and pairing her with a group of interesting and complex characters.",Birds of Prey

471,huntersmithx,A new and serviceable installment in the DCEU.,7,19 February 2020,"In light of recent improvements to DC's critically mixed Cinematic Universe (ie. ""Wonder Woman"", ""Shazam!""), we are treated to a solo adventure featuring beloved supervillain (and 2016 cosplay icon) Harley Quinn along with a bundle of kick-ass female crusaders in ""Birds of Prey"".I'm happy to say this is leaps above ""Suicide Squad"", and there's definitely good stuff to be had here. The action and combat scenes (especially one taking place in a police station) are rousing; and the acting highlights include Mary-Elizabeth Winstead as the crossbow killer, no I meant Huntress, and of course Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, one of the most spot-on incarnations of the character.Ewan McGregor chews up the scenery as the villain Roman Sionis, but goes all in and makes for an entertaining baddie. He almost reminded me at times of Tommy Lee Jones's Two-Face from ""Batman Forever"", but not in a bad way.While entertaining, the story is shortchanged by its' convoluted first hour (which might improve upon a second viewing) and mostly simplistic themes. Overall, if you're in the mood for R-rated action/popcorn fun this month of February; you might like it.Grade- B-",Birds of Prey
472,prietoheitor,It could have been a lot better but ...,6,6 January 2021,"Better than the Suicide Squad ?! No doubt, but it is also a little disappointing, they used these attributes so superficially that the two Deadpool films used (the fourth wall break) that was good, but it could have put more effort.

1. Why was this film rated MA or R, was a cheesy mess of a movie with no dark scenes.If they cut out some parts or changed them would of been a M rated movie.Who let this be released not M rated is stupid.As this is a young girl teen movie.
2. Should of been called Harlequin!!!
3. No Joker or Batman
4. Before this movie came out they where saying it will be another feminist ideology.
5. There was no serious scenes in this movie
6. They tried to make the movie fun,funny,enjoyable!!! ( This is Gotham)
7. Acting fell short (Harlequin over did it)

474,creator301,No man hating in sight. Shouldn't be R,6,12 February 2020,"Very fragile men must be writing these reviews, first and foremost because only weak and sickly men truly like the DC universe, and second because there was hardly even a ""girl power"" moment throughout the movie nevermind anything disparraging males. Really cool to be able to give girls superheroes that arent extremely lame like Wonder Woman. If you saw that movie youll know what I mean (somehow a human man is the hero in the wonder woman movie rather than Wonder Woman herself) This movie is really fun and actually well done right until the final scenes where everything falls apart and people decide to all of a sudden use their extremely useful superpowers that wouldve been helpful the entire time. No nudity or anything unfortunately and no blood or gore so I really dont understand why they alienated a huge portion of the audience of these movies by making it rated R. Needed more nudity and swearing to make the R worth it. I wish they had finished strong but whatever. Also the roller skating scene at the end couldve been really cool but I guess they paid the girl from scott pilgrim(her flat acting ruined the character she plays in this film) so much they wanted to get their moneys worth and stick her in a scene where she had no business being storywise. Major plot hole created there. Also she makes the comment ""its not a bow and arrow, Im not twelve"" just ruins her character. Anyone wielding a crossbow has accepted its the version of a bow and arrow to make archery accessible to those unable to use a real bow, not because it is better. Really sad that character was soooo lame but could've been so cool! I feel really bad for whoever thinks this movie is about hating men, and for their lesser unused genitals.",Birds of Prey
475,iamianiman,"A great all-girls group film, Birds of Prey eases itself up in the sky though meeting some obstacles to finding its worthy predators.",6,5 February 2020,"Admittedly speaking, remember there was a time when DC Universe was bashed because most of their movies were directed by Zack Snyder who decided that style-over-substance was more pivotal to making superhero films? Then, came David Ayer with a set of the best movie trailers ever created but the outcome for the anti-hero film, Suicide Squad was at best, a mediocre motion picture.Now after Shazam!, Aquaman & the masterpiece Joker, DC presents us with Birds of Prey, the fourth entry movie that proves that their tables have pretty much turned around by finding suitable directors for their movies and that they are catching up to compete with the Marvel Universe. No feud here please.Here's my thoughts on Birds of Prey:The movie features slick action scenes which complete with very acrobatic-like choreography that constantly pleases the eyes of everyone who are looking forward for femme fatales kicking ass. There are plenty of them to keep you amazed.Birds of Prey also delivers a vigorous energy throughout, it feels like you are high on drugs. The close-ups feel very intimate yet feel very caricature in a positive way. The quality of cameras & the colour palette capture a reality of life, giving a sense of how rough it actually is, very dark and gritty but... also sometimes sprinkles the dour tone with graciously boisterous and delicate tinted colours. The occasional slo-mo ampes up the already intense energy.Some of you might have asked regarding the feminist movement. Birds of Prey is a done right feminist film. A key successful factor to driving a feminist film is to create an innate story on women without being pushy on the political agenda. Birds of Prey does that. Another thing is this is not a guy-turn-girl remakes (Yes, I'm watching you Ghostbusters & Ocean's 8). And BOP does not or rarely knocks down the men genes as weak or indecisive. Kudos Birds of Prey!Now, let's talk about Margot Robbie & Mary Elizabeth Winstead. These two really go beyond the next level to dive into their character as uniquely as possible. Margot Robbie as always should be receiving a standing ovation as Harley Quinn again, after the meh Suicide Squad. She restrains from letting anyone steals her spotlight. If her and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker are caught together in a love story, it will be the best romance movie of the decade. The complexity and different types of deranged personalities they uphold. Wow! Winstead as Huntress is the runner up here, she gives out a hot breeze of aura that it is hard to back away from. Her charismatic sexual energy captures the attention like a bullseye 🎯. Bell as Black Canary is cool, but not as great as the other two. Bella as Cain shows to be mischievous but her character only pretty much follows where the major characters take her.It also offers decent humour overall. Harley Quinn is consciously great in this, her facial movements contribute a lot! Some are fresh from the oven, others are a bit obsolete but those humours though feel old keep us glued to the screen.Final battle, the best thing is the lack of unrealistic weaponry that they occupy which makes it all feels so real. It is entertaining and fun too as there are certain scenes that feature a low amount of quick cuts.Now, the most detectable problem with this movie is it spends so much time on character development of the all-girls group that it forgets that they can excite the audience with the combo pack. An hour later and they are still focusing on so many character devs!Because of this, the relationship between members of Birds of Prey is very shadowy and leaves an unsatisfied feeling by the end. Like somehow they have been forced exponentially to know and work with one another.So many developments but they forget Roman's character, the main antagonist which feels quite underdeveloped. When a scene of him pops up especially after 40% of the film, it really wants to tell something meaningful about him, but eventually moves on with it, providing us with a lack of knowledge of what his wholesome embodies.Hyena & police cop. With a lack of screen time, we do not really see Hyena attacking people at all which some of you might have anticipated. Renee as the cop is one that is really bad at acting, it needs fixing. It is like watching a brick talks with try-hard emotions.While this centres on supervillains, Birds of Prey fails on the costume design. Not a single character clothes himself/herself as a good superhero model portrayal of a costume. It feels very lazy thus, this however tones down the great energy the movie has possessed. It is so bad that varsity students can design them better.Verdict: Imaginative & darkly flamboyant, Birds of Prey proves that the comeback of DC is possible, adapting many characters into the big screen as a beacon of call to level itself with the colossal Marvel.",Birds of Prey
476,piggulu,A fun slog,5,8 February 2020,"If you disliked the long character introductions in Suicide Squad then this will irk you just as well since much of the beginning is plagued by constant backtracking for character expositions. Eventually things pick up, with some awesome fight scenes for the violence we all came for. But then the slog continues as most of the characters are just plain uninteresting. Roman, Canary, Zsasz, Cassandra - all bring little to the table and aren't enticing when being the main focus.Humor is all over the place, ranging from well-placed to ""let's just have Harley say something here to show quirkiness"" which can be off-putting or cringey.Personally, I'm not a fan of kid characters in adult movies. They show things down with constant babysitting, get in the way of potentially great moments, and are just overall unnecessary characters. This and Deadpool 2 are no different, and Cassandra could've be written out. This would have been better themed with Harley trying to pull off a big heist to show off her independent chops instead of the tiresome ""become a foster mother to this woeful child"" trope.",Birds of Prey

I am a man and I thought this movie was just a lot of fun. It's true that the story is all over the place but unlike the unintentionally disjointed mess which was Suicide Squad I believe this one was intended to be a disjointed mess in that it is being told through Harley's narrative. The fight scenes are well done and showcase Harley's skills more than what has been shown before. It is true what some have said about the opponents kind of being mindless lunks, including the police but how many of these movies are there where this isn't the case? Aside from Gordon were any of the other cops in TDK geniuses? It is also true to all of the men in the film are bad but from my memory that is only 3 men. This just wasn't the place for any heroic men and to include them would have changed the story. The bottom line is don't let the negative reviews keep you away. At least see it for yourself and you might just enjoy it as I did and as I know several other people who saw it did as well. It's a good time at the theater so at the very least it is the second best thing in the DCEU next to WW.

484,gabriel-80,Obnoxious,2,20 June 2020,"To pull of a movie like Birds of Prey, you need talent on both sides of the camera. Well, Birds of Prey has that, but not for this kind of movie, which makes me respect the team behind Deadpool even more.
Action/comedy is really hard to pull off, as this movie is a testament to. It just doesn't work. At all.
First of all none of the characters are likeable. Second, the story is paper thin. Third, no I will stop counting now, and just list the reasons...
The fragmented, time jumping storytelling, which is supposed to be hip, is just plain confusing and makes you lose interest in whats going on. The villain is boring. The violence is, like Deadpool, way over the top, but not in a cartoonish, fun kinda way, but quite off putting - skinning someones face will just never be fun. The main character is just plain annoying, and when the story becomes slightly interesting, telling the story of Huntress, which to me seems like a much more interesting story, Quinn takes center stage again, and the movie suffers for it. On top of that the choreography in the fight scenes seems amateurish and poorly edited. Lacking any exitement and awesome moments. The major flaw of this movie though, is that it just isn't funny. What a waste of my time.",Birds of Prey
485,lukas-ingel,Leveling Suicide Squad up - and owning it,10,7 February 2020,"Despite major criticisms towards Suicide Squad, it seems that DC wouldn't just let it be a mistake to leave behind and be embarrased by. They chose to keep a lot of the same elements (most of which were the ones highly enjoyed in SS) and elevate them and turn them into this crazy carnival ride, where Harley Quinn will find herself and gather a team next to her.
And despite many people's worries, I think the movie does a great job of seperating the Birds of Prey from Harley. Make no mistake, this is obviously a Harley Quinn movie. But by the end, you'll see just how she managed to make something that will be able to stand on its own which is just amazing. Let's face it, that just wouldn't have happened on the big screeen in the next ten years without the help from the iconic Harley Quinn (movie) character. They could totally do a spin-off alone with the Birds now - or maybe still keep Harley in a smaller role (Gotham City Sirens leading up to?).In the end, I think the movie succeeded in exactly what it wanted to be. It wanted to be a trip. It wanted to be a Harley Quinn origin story. It wanted to be a Birds of Prey origin story. It wanted to be a story about finding yourself after losing your identity (relationship, job, safety, vengeance road). Incorporating all of that means chaos...but that is the point of this Harley Quinn's character exactly. The movie is through her mind. And you just have to stick along and enjoy the chaos unfold in a delightful and sharp manner and explosion of colors... and other stuff.Note: I've heard several complaints about this Harley Quinn character being so different or not as good as the comic book ones or the one(s) in the animated show(s), sidecharacters not being treated with respect etc.... Honestly, people, just because this is a movie and it's given a big budget, it's still just a singular version of the character(s). Like in any other platform. Why should it try to copy (which, it still does borrow a lot and pay homage several places)? You wouldn't say that if this was a new comic book series with Harley and the Birds of Prey, would you now. Anywhere you start new, you start new. You don't just copy. (*cough cough* Lion King remake *cough* I mean live action version.) Enjoy every version for themselves please, I'm sure they all have good sides and bad sides you can take something from, and the approach here is clearly working for what DC has been wanting to do with their cinematic universe. Which IMO we all are being way too hard on. You don't see the same kinda pressure with the often formularic Marvel movies (with all the respect to them and what they are trying to do), so it should only be fair to show some respect and mercy where more creativity and risks are the things being prioritized. Right? This is just one version, not more and not less credit to it than any other version - just more people will probably see it because it's the mainstream one. And this cinemac universe will keep expanding in all layers. Remember to have fun. The movie is very inviting of that.",Birds of Prey

I haven't read the comic books, so I didn't really have sky-high expectations, but that's my case with most movies, there's a reason they made the movie, it's supposed to be a treat for everyone. Most scenes in the movie are a pop of colour, and I haven't seen such colourful fight sequences before. It definitely brings in a touch of fun and makes them quirky.

You expected a somewhat polished movie with the big budget funding it. But what we get is an abundance of cheesy dialogue, and badly (and cumbersome looking) choreographed fight sequences. The characters were very cliche, with Roman Sionis (Ethan Hawke) looking desperate to be a feared arch villain (yawn) and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) pushing crazy as much can as she can (eye roll). Since these two were the main characters, it was somewhat off putting to watch. The other characters were so abbreviated that you don't really care what happens to them.

509,kmjnhh123,Just Fell Flat,4,11 February 2020,"Okay so before i start this review i absolutely loved Suicide Squad seeing as everyone keeps hating on it & Birds Of Prey is not even comparable to suicide Squad.Right so i was really looking forward to this film as another Harley film was due, before i rip into the film i will say That Margot Robbie did do a good job of portraying Harley again, she definitely fell into character & hope she continues with the role in the future.Now i am a DC lover & preference DC over Marvel so before anyone downvotes this because its a typical ""bash DC"" type review.Following from the great acting by Margot only, all the other characters in the film have barley any back story & just tagged along to satisfy the plot, which was very generic of some bad guy gets angry & wants to kill the main character but in this case the bad guy wants to kill all of the girls because they have all done something to annoy him. Its almost like one of those films where each person has a mini part to the film then they all come together in the end but for different reasons. How many times have we seen that, i don't know what i was expecting going into this film but it just felt like another film to copy Marvel in a way, like she recruited people kinda way. I didn't connect with the girls or the villain because i didn't care about them like i do with other characters in other films, i felt like that was the problem, they didn't show enough to do with them, its just a mindless film, just look at the Joker for character feel, you can feel what he was going through & how he was coping, thats the connection the film needed with Harley alone, not with anyone else.The villain is your usual bad guy within the film, he has money, power an can do what he wants & because a load of girls have annoyed him he wants to kill them & thats the entire film. But as a villain he wasn't really effective, he just did a lot of talking & got his henchmen men to do the work & by the end of the film its the usual scenario of bad team of 100+ people vs a few people & you know who i going to win.I feel like the film could of been made in 3 ways, the way it is now being one usual recruit people type of film, the 2nd being like the Joker was, as in more about Harley, focusing on her & what she is going through after breaking up with the Joker & her getting back on her feet & doing crazy things Or the 3rd way which could of been Harley getting back at the Joker in various ways.In terms of a girl empowerment film or anything like that i have no comment as it doesn't bother me who is who & what is what.Overall we (Our film group of 4) were not amazed or going ""Awe"" or ""WooW"" throughout the film, it just didn't connect or make you feel any emotion for the film.Hopefully Wonder Women will be epic as i loved the first WW film.Age - 25

The story is based on Harley Queen and others play the supportive character. As-usual story. Nothing much to tell about. But the Harley Queen I mean Margot Robbie was fantabulous. She was damn good and perfect for this character. Robbie did not give in any part. Such as comedy in between action; or crying while laughing at the same time. This movie proves that the Harley Queen is one of the most powerful female characters in DC comics.Black Canary, Huntress, Rene, and Casandra's acting skill was also good.

513,politicidal,"Fun but not Fantabulous spin-off involving diamonds, hyenas, and an egg sandwich.",7,16 February 2020,"Margot Robbie shines as the maniacal DC villainess Harley Quinn in her spinoff.Make no mistake, this is a Harley Quinn movie through and through. The characters associated with the title team are present but as supporting players.
Margot Robbie remains pitch perfect casting for Harley Quinn. She's unhinged, manic, and as zany as expected. Her charisma carries the movie through the more conventional sections of the film. As a whole it feels very much like Deadpool if Deadpool was crossed over with Snatch. There is also a major story involving a runaway pickpocket whom Harley Quinn of all characters does form a heartwarming friendship with.Rosie Perez is a solid fit for Batman comics mainstay Renée Montoya. She has a tough streetwise moxie that expresses itself through eighties cop movie cliches. Huntress is more of a figure than an actual character in the story but Mary Elizabeth Winstead conveys a presence that switches from steely to socially awkward that's amusing.And lord does she kill so many people in this. She's easily the coolest of the three Birds of Prey. Jurnee Smollet-Bell is only adequate for Black Canary, despite having a lot of screen-time. She's good looking while fighting in skintight pants at least.Ewan McGregor is clearly having a blast as Black Mask, the Gotham gangster whose vile machinations unintentionally bring all the major characters together. He plays the camp and crazy scenes with relish, enjoying fine art and cutting people's faces off in equal measure.The story is again mostly about Harley Quinn. Otherwise without going into huge detail it's about this missing diamond plot which admittedly is pretty basic. But
Cathy Yan directs the action scenes surprisingly well for her first big budget movie. The final battle in an abandoned carnival is especially good. Much of the fights are stylized and over the top. The sets and costumes are pretty colorful and stand out from other recent comic book movies. The setup and characters are fun but the story could have pushed the envelope further into wackier territory. The violence is brutal when it is called for. Broken bones, gunshots to the head, and even someone's face being peeled off.Did the world really require a Birds of Prey movie that's really about Harley Quinn? Perhaps not but it's an enjoyable girl-power action film for the Deadpool crowd",Birds of Prey

515,jdgan,Boredom beware....,3,14 December 2020,"This is honestly one of my least favourite DC films of recent memory. Which is a shame because this did have a lot of potential to be good but from what I've heard, it bombed hard to the Sonic movie and right before COVID caused theatres to close down.To be honest, I think it was for a very good reason.The directing felt very shallow and uninteresting and as a result, some scenes dragged on rather than become memorable. The pacing was the worst thing about this movie as it not only felt inconsistent but that combined with the direction only added to the boredom. Unfortunately for this ham-fisted adaptation of Birds of Prey, the real boredom came from the lacklustre and incoherent writing, and as a result, I couldn't find a reason to care or to be invested in the story. To add insult to injury, the characters are completely different from the comic book counterparts and to make matters even worse, the changes that they made to the characters make them even less interesting (not even Barbara Gordon is in this film and she was the one who founded the group in the first place. And don't even get me started on Cassandra Cain, who is so different from her original character that if you changed the name or even took her out, it would honestly make the movie so much better. Just search up on her in this movie and you'll see what I'm talking about.).On the plus side, there's good action, decent acting (especially from Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor, both of whom looked like they were having fun with their roles.), and pretty great cinematography. But that's about it.Long story short, if the film suddenly disappeared from the face of the earth, I honestly think it would make absolutely no difference at all to the current DCEU. That's how forgettable it is.",Birds of Prey

517,Chris_Ego,Why the bad reviews? Here is why I liked it:,10,9 August 2021,"The female led production is packed with fun, an entertaining storytelling, a great score consisting mostly of uptempo songs, adorable characters and most of all: Margot Robbie. She lives this role like no other. Margot made Harley come to life with a sweet voice, hilarious grimaces and just the right amount of drama. The cast features lovely performances of Jurnee Smollett as a versatile artist and newcomer Ella Jay Basco as the notorious Cassandra Cain.Now I didn't read the comics and watched this film for entertainment purposes. I think the producers did a lot right concerning the action choreography, which was always intense and the camera work. There are many cuts but they are done smooth and less confusing than similar productions. The story is refreshing and mad, just a good contrast to the ever boring Marvel superhero movies.The settings are superb, like the funpark or Roman Sionis' different rooms in his mansion. The decoration is done with love and care about details. Many ideas like the rollerblades scenes or the female gang fights are executed in stunning ways. The characters have their unique ways of body language and thus appear interesting. Watch it for yourself and enjoy with friends on a Saturday night!",Birds of Prey
518,opinionated-alchemist,Popcorn cinema - entertaining but slightly bland,7,20 March 2020,"I feel, that a lot of people misrepresenting the movie here in their reviews. Let's face it: Joker has been very well received from fans and it isn't close to the usual comic stories. Maybe part of the story is, but not the overall tone nor the premise.However in ""Birds of Prey"" suddenly people are extremely concerned, that the material is not authentic? In what kind of twisted world are we living in, that a movie, which gives ""girls power"" is received so bad???But lets face it here. The issue of the movie isn't the political and sociological message. Its ""just"" the story and the context, logic itself.It starts entertaining. A bit like a high school comedy - loads of exposure, but in a very funny (4th wall breaking way); Mayba a bit too much exposure, but ok.
The villain Black Mask lacks a bit motivation and background. First I thought, it isn't that bad, because overall Ewan McGregor is playing well. But given, that all ""girls"" get a mini-introduction, it would be adequate, to understand, at least why he ""is"" the Black Mask.The action scenes are also very entertaining. However while it is understandable why Harley Quinn is so dominant in fights (craziness - acrobatic proficiency, educated in weaponry while her time with the Joker) - as well as it makes sense for Huntress, it doesn't make any sense for the police officer and canary - who happens to be a singer with a ""killer voice"".Let's also talk about ethics here: Joker got a lot of criticism, because the film highlighted violence. As the movie is almost a drama, I could not really understand this criticism, because it also had far less violence than any other action movies these days. Birds of Prey not only has far more violence - but also makes it ""entertaining"" and funny. While I am not so serious about it,. people should finally be reasonable. Either way, they disprove violence (especially in movies, which have a message that violence is not ""that bad"") - or agree to use violence as plot device...The point, where Birds of Prey really disappoints is the portrayal of the protagonists. It seems that the studio still didn't understood the appeal of some characters like Harley Quinn! They didn't learned this bit out of Suicide Squad: it is really not appealing to show the ""good parts"" of these characters. Let's face it: Harley is a serial killer who killed probably 100's if not 1000's of people, hurt a lot of people (inclusive innocents: think about blowing up a huge chemical factory...) - assaulted a police station... even though there is a sparkle of goodness in her - it doesn't really matter! It is her motives and her craziness which we are interested in!
Think Joker. The movie wasn't portraying the ""hero"" in him. It was rather showing his circumstances, his motives, his illness and personality. This made this movie so compelling.I would really like to see, that we see a movie which shows the craziness (in an entertaining way) of Harley. I am not interested in her good deeds. I am interested, in her madness! I am interested how she deals with her remorses (or how she doesn't deal with her remorses).Oh - and then there is the logic, which doesn't end up. We are in Gotham, where a police department is assaulted, where the chemical plant is attacked, where hundreds of mobsters are killed or are mobilized - but there is non sign of Batman - or the Joker (Harley made definitely enough noise that he would pay attention?!). That seems just odd and out of place.So no - the movie isn't that bad. Or not that good either. I like the overall idea, to show that girls can rule - but why not also show,. that woman can be seriously bad (and mad)?",Birds of Prey

523,kelboy10,The Margot Robbie show,6,15 February 2020,"Birds of pray offers a very different type of comic book film and I would say it is more female driven, very much aimed at female empowerment! It has good and not so great elements as a whole. Lets start with the positives, one being of course once again Margot Robbie. Robbie displays a psychopathic nutjob once more. A film that could be described as the Margot Robbie show. This time I'd say even more caricatured and wacky and much more comfortable in the role. Not that she was useless in suicide squad, but she definitely embraces and explores the character with what appears much more freedom in this one. Another warming performance was Ewan McGregor as the black mask. He pulled off an insane mob boss nicely and although he seemed to want control of everything he seemed to have trouble keeping himself in check at times. Director Cathy Yan shows some nice contrast not only with the visuals in this movie but also the wacky chaotic music. This pallet is very artistic in some shots and suited to comic style. I particularly like the scene in the amusement park with lots of shades of blue and the scene of the destruction of Ace chemicals. Occasionally I felt like I was going to be watching a comedy superhero movie like the mask in the early stages of the film. On a negative side the story is weak and sometimes various parts don't feel like they are part of the same movie. It's kinda dark in places but then comedic in others. The entire police force seem undermined and used inefficiently. Renee Montoya played by Rosie Perez is the main detective on the case but appears to assist our anti heroes by the end. Black Canary and Huntress are there but again this really is the Harley Quinn/Margot Robbie show. Just like in the 90s when you'd watch a Jim Carrey film with little plot and happily go to see Jim. By no means is this film terrible but neither is it great. If you like watching Margot do her thing as Harley then it is passable.",Birds of Prey

He vanished??
Result, the movie is another suicide squad.
Really bad jokes, Jokes in the moments that there is nothing funny to make fun of it (huntress story), no development, copy-paste from other characters (Harley Quinn), very plane villain, things happening but you don't care anymore because you are tired, it's PG18+ but look like for 12-13 years old The only thing that was good was the fights scenes.

529,ksharath1999,An unexpected violent thrilling roller coaster ride from DCEU,7,4 August 2021,"Birds Of Prey is a versatile experience from DC which deals with the aftermath of Suicide Squad 2016. The movie gets the wildest opening ever with an unexpected silly thing which surprised me a lot. The flick is praiseworthy when it comes to its wild artistic sets,non linear narrative,lighting,cinematography and of course its action sequences which form the core of the movie. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn excels above all with her performance as it felt she was straight out of HQ comic book. Ewan McGregor succeeds in portraying the complexities of the sadistic art lover don and felt terrorizing at times. Jurnette and Mary Winstead although sidelined got moments of their own where they too excel. The third act was not everyone's cup of tea but definitely mine which features a weird action sequence which is something i have never seen before. Last but not the least like a cherry on top of a cake surprises that happened in the end was enough too make my eyes pop out.When it comes to cons, Birds Of Prey has a simple plot which is narrow compared to previous DCEU outings. Cassandra-Harley chemistry that was supposed to work out did not excel as expected. Rose manages as Renee still she felt as a miscast at times.In the end, Birds Of Prey is a highly entertaining yet weird action movie which is one of its own kind.Rating:78%",Birds of Prey

531,ashecatlin,Could have done with a bit more fun,3,13 February 2020,"This shouldn't have been called Birds of Prey, they hardly feature in this. It is a Harley Quinn movie through and though, unfortunately it's not quite the same one we had in Suicide Squad. In this she is unlikeable with no interesting qualities at all, in fact no one in this is particularly interesting. Black Canary is there, people seem to talk on her behalf more than her actually saying something. Huntress is a joke, Cassandra Cain was actually pretty good but it would have benefitted from being called something else. As there is no connect between her and her comic counterpart, it could have just been an kid. Now I will say Ewan Mcgregor was very entertaining to watch as was the actor who played Zsasz, you could tell they were having fun when making this and chewing up the scenery whilst doing so.Even though the trailers present this as a bubblegum ride, it's actually quite bleak all the female leads are depressed in some capacity. There are some really boring parts layered though this as well, I think the worst part of this is the fight choreography. Everything just feels so weightless without any force behind it, like you can tell people are pulling their punches. Speaking of which Black Canary can only kick in this, there are lots of opportunities for her to throw a punch or block but instead she gets punched and kicks them after, fantastic. There is a lot of slow motion shots in this as well, which just seem to drag the scenes out.All in all it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, it's the worst DCEU movie so far. I'd still rewatch this though, as I like the characters it's nice to see them in live action. You just have to let go of their comic book ties as they share very little with them aside from names, Black Mask was worse than he was in Arkham Orgins but as I said Ewan was fun in the role.",Birds of Prey

Ewan McGregor plays one of the most obnoxious movie villains in recent years, the soundtrack is mediocre at best, the action sequences are hit or miss, the style is distracting and from watching the movie, you gain nothing. No new experiences and the film is so devoid of substance that it's impossible to care unless you're a Harley fan (which is seemingly the only audience this film has).At least Harley was better here than she was in Suicide Squad so that's something. Thank god James Gunn saved this character with The Suicide Squad.",Birds of Prey

The bond built among the birds of prey members and the girl they tried to rescue were convincing enough given the runtime of 2 hours. Character introduction and the case certainly needed more organized flashbacks. Ewan McGregor did a decent job portraying a villain with a morbid sense of humour. I hope the second outing will have a tighter script.",Birds of Prey
544,WillsFilms,Birds of Prey Still Needs To Stretch It's Wings,6,20 February 2020,"Birds of Prey is a mediocre comic book movie, with entertaining action, but not enough substance and a poor screenplay. Margot Robbie is fantastic as Harley Quinn, but the birds of prey aren't interesting characters. This is because the movie puts too much focus on Harley and, as a result, doesn't have time to develop the rest of the main cast. The only backstory they get is narrated over by Harley, completely destroying the weight and power those scenes should have. Harley, herself, is very entertaining. However, I'm not a fan of the insistence to make her more independent by everyone currently writing her. This is because the tragedy of Harley Quinn's character is her inability to permanently move away from The Joker, despite how much he mistreats her. Therefore, removing that element of her character makes her far less interesting and compelling. I also don't like the fact that, in this movie, her characterisation clearly rips off Deadpool. However, Margot Robbie is still very fun to watch. Ewan McGregor absolutely steals the show as Roman Sionis. In every scene he's in, McGregor is clearly having the time of his life and he's so enjoyable to watch, creating the best villain in the DCEU so far. However, Victor Zsasz is completely wasted and nowhere near as intimidating or psychotic as his comic book countapart, instead he's rather bland and uninteresting. Birds of Prey is directed and edited very well, I can't say I was ever bored watching it. The action is also very exciting and fun to watch. In summary, Birds of Prey has enjoyable action, solid acting and is incredibly entertaining, but the script is quite bad and the characters aren't very interesting. I'd personally recommend skipping this movie.",Birds of Prey

(Loved Aquaman but Shazam is my favorite.) . People fell out of love and don't trust DC to handle bringing the comics to live action movies. And the marketing for this movie was weak.

564,kaneeddy,"Entertaining at times, but is all over the place",5,6 February 2020,"Birds of Prey: and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn, is a movie I had high hopes for but it fell flat. I will start off this review with the positive aspects first such as: Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was a great casting and continues to be where I think she gives a better performance then her one in Suicide Squad, and Ewan Mcgregor plays a decent version of Black Mask. The use of colours and costumes I thought were great and I found some moments of entertainment through some of its action sequences.However, This film has a lot of problems, most of the performances in this film are very shoddy, especially from Rosie Perez who is a walking cliche' as Renee Montoya (and I know that's what they were going for but it just doesn't work}, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress who gives us some very cringey at times acting, and I think some of this has something to do with the screenplay which I also think is average at best. The humour that they're going for doesn't work at all I chuckled maybe once, and it was the same for my theatre. They also butchered Victor Zsasz which I found extremely disappointing as I was looking forward to his inclusion in the DCEU, the way he was portrayed was nothing like how he is in the comics and it seems like he is just trying to be some knock off version of the Joker. Also why is the film titled Birds of Prey? This is a Harley Quinn Movie, just like the trailers the Birds of Prey are barely in it and when they were they had small glimpses of being cool characters but for the most part they were some of the most cliched early 2000's era superhero characters I have seen since that era.Overall, I found Birds of Prey to be a disappointment I came into this film very optimistic but got let down, due to the fact that this films writing was just plain bad. If Margot Robbie's and Ewan Mcgregor's performances weren't as great as what they were with the nice compliments of the characters costumes it would have been completely boring and cliched garbage.",Birds of Prey

The story is for kids.-The film has some issues but the biggest one is that is not funny or clever. At least 95% of the jokes felt flat. The only couple of funny moments were with the assassin and a bit of socially awkward Huntress.-The script lacks wits and inventiveness. The dialogues are lame and dull specially the ones involving Harley. Harley was supposed to be witty and clever. Half an hour into the movie Harley started to annoy me.-Action sequences are obviously choreographed. You can see the baddies waiting their turn one by one to get their asses kicked. The fight at the carnival reminded me of a fight from 1997 ""Batman and Robin"".-Did not like what they did with the Cassandra Cain character. Remind you that in the comics she is supposed to be trained-from-birth-into-martial-arts Batgirl!Overall this movie have the same problems I see with the recent DC tv shows.

568,greggwager,Post-reality Fun House,9,16 February 2020,"If Americans are so irreverent to European traditions, why do children's cartoons and graphic novels (comic books) introduce us to characters based on commedia dell'arte, a tradition of improvisatory Italian folk theater? The biggest revelation I got from watching Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey is that the main character's name is a parody of ""Harlequin."" (After all, I only saw bits and pieces of Suicide Squad on television for the past year and never even heard of the Saturday morning cartoon debuting her three decades ago.)
I saw this film on a Thursday afternoon, paid $11, and was the only person in the theater. I had heard it was all but tanking at the box office, so didn't expect much. I had not even researched if I was to be in the DC or Marvel universe (let alone cared that much which).
Other expectations I took with me were that Thanos already showed us you can only blow up the universe a few more times before it gets dull; Scorsese taught us guilt for being curious about these post-cinema comics creations; a retaliating AARP invented new cinema awards for grownups; but Joaquin just won an Oscar for portraying Harley Quinn's ex-boyfriend. That and a couple of routine curses to the Libertarians for exchanging our once promising Star Trek future into a Mad Max one.
So, this slow-cooking razzle-dazzle about fighting chicks who do slow-mo cartwheels accompanied by lots of rock and rap music sneaks into an arid February release slot. In a panic, the studio even truncates the title.
Villain-protagonist Harley Quinn brings us plenty of moral ambiguity. It's Kill Bill territory or even Pulp Fiction's ""Fox Force Five,"" as well as Tarantino's convoluted narrative and skewed timeline.
Margot Robbie herself co-produces this most confident Harley Quinn incarnation, with only a few CGI explosions and a pet hyena as sole CGI creature. Rosie Perez deadpans her way as crusty detective who turns to join forces with fem vigilantes.
Fresh off Dr. Sleep comes a solid supporting role for Ewan McGregor as Roman Sionis, a.k.a. ""Black Mask,"" a sociopathic kingpin, sexually immature, who cruses for bruises and gets them from high-kicking, grenade-tossing girls. Kooky gender warfare.
That leaves seething Mary Elizabeth Winstead (unrecognizable from Death Proof and Die Hard IV) as edgy, crossbow-wielding ""Huntress;"" Jurnee Smollett-Bell as smooth crooner in tight pants named ""Black Canary;"" and Ella Jay Basco as pathetic teen pickpocket caught in the middle of it all. Fellow chick Cathy Yan directs only her second feature, first entirely in English, with style and humor.
No need to spoil a plot that is barely necessary anyway. Find your way into this post-reality fun-house of effects that jump into your lap and other colorful surprises and there will be a sense you've been thrilled as you step out of the theater.

But there are issues that I have with this movie.Pros: Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor do amazing with their roles and they clearly are having a great time in this movie. The action sequences are well utilized and the vibrance works well with action as well as the charisma that Harley Quinn brings out. Harley Quinn has better one-liners and character background. This is also an incredibly shot action movie and is well directed. It seems to take its time with the story and doesn't feel rushed in order to go with the fun action-packed scenes which was amazing. And the humor in this was very enjoyable and made me laugh a bit. Since this is a Harley Quinn movie, it's lighthearted, colorful, and has clever written ideas about her.Cons: When I mean it's a Harley Quinn movie, I mean that the movie title should be just called ""Harley Quinn featuring Birds of Prey"" because its mostly focused on her and the Birds of Prey don't team up until the climax. And the characterization is kind of all over the place. Harley Quinn, Cassandra Cain, and Black Canary seem to be the only characters that have character background. Even though Ewan McGregor did excellent as Black Mask, I didn't really get to know that much about his villain origins and only got to see him be scary and cruel. Huntress felt underused had a few flashback scenes that didn't really work for me. For the acting I thought it was solid, but when it comes to Chris Messina (Victor Zsasz), I just couldn't handle him because I think he was miscast and overacted way too much.

I am big Batman the animated series fan - and this Harley Quinn just reminded of the Harley Quinn in it. Margot Robbie plays the role so well - and writers and done a super job. It has the right amount of humour, action, darkness and also craziness with the dash of Harley Quinn colour. The movie it's self plot wise was great - nothing complicated.

I imagine the movie would not be bad if you are in that category, but if you are over the age of 20 this is a real let down.It could have been good with a great cast, nice sets, good color grading, but the wardrobe was bad, the script was bad, the great actors were BADLY directed and wasted and Margot really needs to hit the gym for a couple weeks before a movie like this, she looks way to soft to be an action figure. I am not saying you have to be in shape to be an actress, but if you are going to play an action super hero, you should look like you at least run around the block once or twice a month.Basically, this movie is made by kids for kids, and I wonder if anyone at the studio actually monitored this project while it was being developed and filmed?

588,0maro0,"Finally, a superhero movie I (almost) like",10,27 September 2021,"The film is fun, easy to watch and unlike many other ""comic book movies"" doesn't reek of hidden sexism and heteronormativity. It still feels very binary at times, but I guess it can be excused, since it's still better than anything else on the market and since Harley's emancipation (which is the main plot point of the movie) consists of recovering from abusive relationship (with a man) and actualizing her femininity outside of frames of ""male gaze"". It is an important point of Harley's story, since when she's in relationship with Joker she's often presented as a very dependent person with fractured sense of self. This movie does a great job giving her an agenda and tracing her journey of looking for new identity, not based on being in romantic relationship or being someone's sidekick. At times it kinda feels like commodification of feminism, but I will excuse any commodification for a movie about group of badass chicks in stylish outfits antagonizing local gay supervillain. It would be nice to have more films like this, because I am really tired of heteronormativity in this genre and in 2020-s diversity in themes and representation shouldn't be perceived as some kind of forced agenda.By the way, was quite amused to see some parallels with Tarantino's Death Proof. Disgraceful chick flicks all the way, from 2007 to this daY. And I need moooooore!!!!!!",Birds of Prey

The Birds of Prey take 1 hour and 20 minutes to finally team up, most of the side characters were dull or poorly written, and the disoriented narrative was mediocre at best. Some action scenes were great and there were tons of fun colourful sequences, but this movie is all show and now substance. Oddly, I welcome a sequel, because this movie is at its best when all the Birds of Prey were finally together.

593,skinzilla,Just awful,3,30 August 2020,"Harley is not a strong enough character to be a lead, her voice and antics just become annoying, whereas she was one of the only bright spots in Suicide Squad because she was not given too much screen time. I am fine with strong female leads but this was just badly done/tried too hard. The fight scenes are clumsy, corny and completely unbelievable. It is like the actresses had zero training for the film's fight scenes. Constantly seeing women under 120 lbs easily knocking around groups of large men has become so unbelievable and tiresome, Hollywood needs to give it up. I assume this movie is made to appeal to women but I don't think most women are interested in this type of drivel. Ewan McGregor was horrible too, so the blame is not gender based. The asian kid is an abysmal actress for a big budget movie and I think just added to pander to the market in China.. DC just cannot seem to make good movies.

596,stereo_1999,"Fire the writer, costume designer, director, and maybe hire someone that has made good movies",2,23 March 2020,Whomever decided these people with so little experience should do a DC movie should also be fired. None of these characters act like any of the characters from the books or animations. Did these people even look at any of the source material?The fighting is amateurish with no talking at all during the scenes. The writer seriously couldn't think of any funny quips or crazy remarks? This is Harley Quinn we're talking about! Why do so many bad guys not carry guns? Why do the police that have guns never use them? Why does the Huntress fight close range when she has a bow? It doesn't make sense!Then there's the costumes that don't remind me of any of the characters and one costume seems solely made for a wet tee moment so we can see her bikini underneath. None of the colors or styles look good or even feel like Harley Quinn. The Suicide Squad costume was way better and they could have went with so many similar styles to the comics or Arkham games.,Birds of Prey
597,benj-20839,Aimed at MTV music video style/Insta Girl loving teen girls.,5,11 February 2020,"The style of this movie is like a poor version of Suicide Squad/Kill Bill directed by a copycat Guy Richie. Its entertaining enough because of that combination of styles but there's no depth or emotional attachment to any of the characters, if that's what you're after. It's quite the shallow and bland action movie but because of its rollercoaster pace you won't be bored, i think. Oh and a couple of cheesy moments thrown in too.I wasn't a fan of Suicide Squad but i can neither say this was better or worse than it.I just couldn't see what they were trying to do with this film or where it fit, in the whole DCEU.The story is like that of a straight to DVD action movies with the likes of Seagal/Van Damme/Snipes etc.The film is definitely aimed at instagram girl/reality show/tictok/selfie loving young teen girls. And thats not meant to be an insult, its just plain to seen who its aimed at once you watch this.It doesn't feel like a comic book movie at all, just a generic all-girl action movie.Any engaging and exciting potential of all these characters seemed wasted here, except for Harley Quinn obviously, who the movie spends all of its time on. I wasn't taken in by her in Suicide Squad but i found her bearable in this, but Margo Robbie's performance was wasted in this movie.The main reason i went to see this movie was because i read that the John Wick director came in did some of the action sequences, then I kept hearing from critics that the action was the big draw here and i have to say that's a bunch of nonsense. There's one decent fight section but even that wasn't even on par with any of the John Wick movies and they used lots of slo-mo. A great fight sequence is when you can't see the choreography of a fight. John Wick does it brilliantly, it feels real with the occasional arm waiting to be grabbed but Birds of prey is the opposite, arms and bodies waiting to be hit, grabbed etc. with the occasional realism. Id say watch any John Wick movies if you want action and cool visuals to boot.The rotten tomatoes critics score shocks me at how high its rated.This film feels like it could have been so different, so much better.The many songs in this are what made this film more entertaining and fun for me.5/10",Birds of Prey

Most of the jokes were cringe and narration felt so weak. The characterisation was awful(except Robbie and McGregor, they were good, others were meh). They wasted Black Mask, the climax was disappointing. It's better than suicide squad, that's an improvement. I don't know about how others felt but for me, it was a below average film.",Birds of Prey
599,nafisbinreza,Horrible,3,16 June 2020,"Birds of Pray - Super Hero Action Movie
Cast - Margot Robbie, Jurnee Smollet-BellI am a huge fan of Harley Quinn. I think Margot Robbie is good at that role. I also like her so much. This movie is based on some events that occur after the breakup of Harley and Joker. I missed Joker in this movie so much that I though each second that now Joker is honna come and save the day. This movie has some nice scenes including the fighting scene in the police department office. But it was really somewhat like Tamil movies. Overall, I think the story of this movie sucks.The story begins with Harley's break up and showing how much upset she is without Joker. Then all her enemies come to get her because she doesn't have protection of Joker. So they are just trying to show that Joker is the boss and Harley is nothing without him. Cinematography in those scenes where Harley is chased by her enemies were interesting. Then Black Mask get her and she makes promise to get a diamond for him from a little pick pocket girl. Then the story becomes lame by showing just chasing and betraying. There is no massege, nothing special about this movie to remember. I think most of the super hero movies are like this nowadays. I miss those Batman:Dark Knight Series or Spiderman(not Amazing Spiderman). Those were the real deal of superhero movies which directly made the superhero genre so much popular. So I think directors should try to make more classic superhero movies rather than making a bad one just for profit.Personal Rating - 3/10

But (surprise surprise) I did -- and found a soft spot within myself for the prickly and over-dramatic Huntress, the hard-drinking cop, and the collaborator-like Black Canary. OK, I even liked the sleazy kid. Like. Not pity (although all of them engendered pity in some way). I liked them. And appreciated the quirky drive of the narrative, and didn't even mind the occasional timeline jumps that took me unawares. The tacky clothing didn't bug me. The black lipstick didn't bug me. The omg over the top accent didn't even bug me. And I was jammin' to the hip-hop hard-driving rap soundtrack, even though I normally dislike rap (hip hop's not terrible. mostly).

608,marcusman48,Some random thoughts from someone who enjoyed this movie as a guilty pleasure,5,16 February 2020,"Gotham City has been portrayed in films and television many times since the first Batman serial was released back in 1943, so you'd think that town would have worn out its welcome by now. But Birds of Prey takes great pains to remind us that today's cities are more than just bloated villages; they're multicultural microcosms. Most depictions of Gotham make it look like Manhattan (specifically, as comic book editor Dennis O'Neil put it, Lower Manhattan around midnight on the coldest night of November), but here Bruce Wayne's hometown smacks a lot more of Brooklyn, and 21st-century Brooklyn in particular (especially ironic since this movie was filmed entirely in Southern California). Harley lives in a hipster's paradise where you never know just what you might see (or what you might eat, since Harley is very fond of food, and particularly ethnic food). Everything looks like a carnival, and that's before we get to the Joker's former amusement park hideout. Not only does the location make a very fitting dwelling for the story's unapologetically bohemian characters, but in an odd way it brings a dash of realism to what is otherwise a fantastic tale. Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher constructed Gothams composed of what were basically glorified cardboard cutouts, while Christopher Nolan depicted a sterile and anonymous world where technology seemed to have utterly triumphed.But of course, the location is only half the setting; the staging is equally important. And what a stage we have here! All comic book movies contain at least a hint of the absurd, but Birds of Prey makes all of them look downright tame by comparison. I would say that watching it is like looking at the world through the eyes of the Joker, but then I remember that the Joker is even crazier than what's depicted here! But after all, Harley Quinn has been the Joker's disciple, and he certainly instilled her with a sense of wildly imaginative wonder in addition to all his other wacked-out sensibilities. Harley is a most audacious graffiti artist, and what a joy it is to watch her literally use the movie screen as her canvas! (Remember all those Day-Glo doodles in Suicide Squad? Here the entire movie is like that.) I think that's actually the key to Harley's appeal: there is plenty of innocence mixed in with her cynicism and coarseness, not to mention an inborn penchant for everything bizarre and outrageous. Compute all those factors and you get precisely what Birds of Prey is: an ultraviolent and very contemporary urban crime drama that often looks more like a classic Tex Avery cartoon. We all come to see the dark side of life at some point, but that doesn't necessarily mean we grow up.Oh, yes - the violence. It is with only slight exaggeration that I dub Birds of Prey possibly the most violent movie I have ever seen (including all the horror films). Quentin Tarantino and Zack Snyder may have raised ""violence porn"" to the level of high art, but when it comes to sheer spectacle neither of them can match what director Cathy Yan has crafted here. Harley is such a terror with her ""confetti gun"" that you're almost left wondering whether Al-Qaeda just created a ""circus"" division, and she strikes grown men with her ""Itchy & Scratchy""-style mallet viciously enough to crack jaws and break bones. (Home Alone burglars Harry and Marv were very lucky that they picked the McAllister residence and not the Quinn residence.) As if that weren't memorable enough, we also see the assassin Helena Bertinelli (also known as ""The Huntress"") using her crossbow to shoot people in the throat! And of course, how could I neglect to mention the scene of a runaway truck smashing into a chemical plant and causing it to explode in a cataclysm of neon-colored vapor? In the shadow of all that, the villain's nasty habit of slicing off the faces of his torture victims is almost forgettable.Many people have said - almost to the point that it's become a cliché by now - that Birds of Prey is ""feminazi,"" or ""anti-man,"" or something similar. Considering how far afield our American culture has drifted, I find an issue like that almost trivial. Anyway, Birds of Prey, with its more heteronormative take on gender roles than we often see in the junk culture (one character is a lesbian, but that almost never comes up), is much less offensive to me than many of the ""girl-power"" farces I grew up watching. I need only mention Buffy the Vampire Slayer, where a girl grows up to become the deadliest fighter in the world despite having spent her youth in privileged sloth. But that wouldn't include the countless cookie-cutter heroines who thrived irrespective of Buffy - ladies who were able to effortlessly kick you-know-what because, well, they were women, and to dispute that point was to reveal yourself to be sexist. Birds of Prey, on the other hand, is more grounded in reality in the sense that it acknowledges that gender difference does matter: not only do all the heroines dress in basically masculine attire when they're out doing hyper-macho things, but the cutesy-wutesy Harley is more a cheerleader than a star athlete; and in comparison to the other Birds, her martial arts skills are lackluster and would not serve her well if she did not have one of her trademark Joker-style gag weapons in her hands (aside from the fact that she also somehow knows some professional wrestling moves, because ha-ha, comedy).And that point brings me to the one ideological sweet spot that Birds of Prey hits right on the bull's-eye: despite its diverse cast and its message of female empowerment, the movie goes beyond psychosocial realism and straight to unvarnished emotional authenticity, thus becoming unabashedly politically incorrect. The humor is wacky, but it articulates a sort of antic disgust with the ""conventional"" world and especially with sociocultural pieties of all varieties. Harley Quinn may be a sociopath, but at least she's fair and rational, hating everyone pretty much equally and making the point that every single human being is a piece of scum at some point. In the course of reflecting on this movie, I'm reminded - fittingly enough - of last fall's Joker, wherein the Joaquin Phoenix incarnation of the character spewed misanthropic rhetoric with an absurdly ironic grin (definitely an improvement over Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, and Jared Leto, all of whom colorlessly drawled anarchic wisdom with the glibness of a Zen master). But whereas Phoenix's take on the Clown Prince of Crime was deadly serious behind the obscenity, Margot Robbie's Clown Princess manages to channel her rage into jolly camp. That's probably the one thing about Birds of Prey that most appeals to me: for all its flaws, it manages to tell a tale about Gotham every bit as bleak as Burton's in a way that leaves you feeling almost as if you've just watched a marathon of Adam West's Batman. By the time the Picasso-inspired end credits sequence rolls, you're joyously drained.",Birds of Prey
609,ShanTeaTime,DC Please Take This Directors Notes,7,21 February 2020,"""Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)"" is a 2020 superhero film that follows Harley Quinn as she joins forces with Helena Bertinelli, Dinah Lance, and Renee Montoya to save Cassandra Cain from Gotham City crime lord Black Mask.Finally FINALLY we get a stand alone Harley Quinn movie! It's also a pretty kickass one, also female director yay! We get an entertaining plot with plenty of action and fan service to go around that isn't too forced. I love how they showed Harley and Jokers ""break-up"", it actually makes you feel for her. I also love that they completely avoided showing Jared Leto's Joker completely except for his back in one scene. Hilarious.I loved the action sequences in this film, they were very stylized, well choreographed and the sets were great. Especially the sequence in the funhouse, that was so much fun to watch! The humor is there and it's pretty strong, a lot of that due to Margot Robbie's portrayal of Harley which is fantastically spunky.Our other lead women are all strong too, I actually really like what they did with Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead is bae) and Black Canary. Though Black Mask was strange, I was thinking throughout the film that what they did with his character was more like Zsasz. But then they reveal his right-hand-man is Zsasz so I was taken aback! Black Mask is more just a mob boss and he's also not very humorous or crazy (from what I've read) so it was different but not bad! Also his actual mask doesn't show up until later and I wish it had earlier, because it looks great. That mask has very family centered personal backstory to it, which I wish they would've explored but oh well!Definitely support this movie so we get more good DC films!",Birds of Prey
610,rdbrown-zeteo,Satisfied!,9,14 February 2020,"I left the theatre with that feeling of satisfaction you get when something hits the spot. I have watched a lot of movies lately that have left me a little empty. I find my self craving a little more of it.First, I'm baffled by a lot of the reviews - its like if the movie didn't fit their expectation perfectly it suddenly becomes the worst thing ever. This movie wasn't meant to be another ""Joker""-esk psychoanalytical piece of art. I also have a few other theories about why people seem to dock this heck of an entertaining movie. Some have docked this movie because of some cock-imposed conspiracy that it is anti-male. This did not cross my mind at all when I watched the movie despite all the criticism I read regarding it before hand. I watched a video of a guy giving his take on the movie and seemed really offended by this false ""premise"". Sure, a movie about empowerment, symbolic of women breaking free from the masculine construct of a woman's role and worth and that they are things and property, but to consider it a man-hate film would be overreactive and probably reflects. If we were to watch the masculine filled mile a minute movie playing next door that objectifies women then I probably would hear a bunch of men completely ignorant of it as women attempt to point it out. And disclaimer, I'm a man, and I loved this movie and will probably buy it the moment I can.Other reasons as to how the movie was made, the narrative and timeline of the movie and it being boring and all, and having little character development outside of Harley and the villain not being fleshed out - no pun intended - is all wrapped up in picky expectations. Sure, the movie may not be completely accurate to the comics, but there are many other movies and shows based on comics with a lot of inaccuracies - but people aren't criticizing them like BOP.To the movie itself:The movie was down-right funny. It was highly entertaining, the action scenes were wonderful and the way the action was filmed (unlike how it typically is these days) was refreshing. The story was simple, the underlying tone of empowerment (as referenced earlier) was relevant and wasn't shaming; it was loud enough to be heard and soft enough not to deflect from the value of the movie as a whole but to add to it. The acting was great spot on. One of the critiques is all the flash backs and the back and forth narrative. I admit, for some people this might not hold attention spans very well, but we can't use out own issues and processes with attention to determine how good the movie actually is. That being said, the DC movies do have a tendency to use this back and forth approach a lot rather than sticking to a linear narrative, and for the sake of audiences this might be something DC should take into consideration.In summary, I'm satisfied with the film we got. I know not everyone is going to be just as satisfied, but take into account that people bring with them their personal issues and preferences based on a context that isn't related to the movie at all - so don't let all of that taint your impression of the movie whether you have seen it or not.",Birds of Prey
611,KDCarson,"Harley Quinn was okay, the rest of it was not up to par",6,16 February 2020,"The girl who played Harley Quinn put her heart into the movie and you can tell she did. But from that point, it went downhill. The Huntress is one of the sexiest characters in the DC universe and they flopped badly on this character. Black Canary is supposed to be a classic blond white chick and they caved in to PC non-sense on that character and wasted so many opportunities just for the sake of clueless PC mentality. The guy who played the Black Mask was good in his role. But what is going on that white men are now the bad guys at every opportunity in superhero and science fiction movies?? There is some bigotry and shortsightedness there.

It was worth it.It's much better than Ocean's Eight at its social commentary, it's trying to be Deadpool when it comes to humor, it sometimes, momentarily, gets as dark as the Phoenix's Joker (movie). It has unhinged, quirky narration, explosions, mallets and baseball bats. No comment on bat men, but I think everyone's happy there's no Leto's Joker (character).This is a surprisingly good mixture, a well layered atmosphere, like a good sandwich. It fits the character and really deserves an 8, 8.5 by itself. However, the story itself is... well, obvious from the title itself, the finale felt extremely tame, even awkward, compared to the thrilling earlier scenes, and the villain could be written much better towards the end, for example by attempting what his right-hand-man tried earlier, for another layer of atmosphere.Like finding some foil in your otherwise great breakfast.",Birds of Prey

620,khaabd,A waste of time and outright misuse of comics,3,25 March 2020,"I was waiting for this movie as a good insight into the comics but frankly I was very disappointed in the movie, a very bad movie in all respects. Poor story, very bad conversations, trivial comedy, and worst of all, the action scenes were so bad. And all responsibility is borne by the director and writers. They misunderstood many real characters in comic books Especially personal Black Canary.
and Speaking of Harley Quinn, I did not see her with this ingenuity, neither in the comic books, nor in the old Animated series of Batman, nor in any old work, and in this film I do not know where she came with all this power. But we must give Margot Robbie her right For her diligent role-playing as well as Black Mask's choice to be the villain and the brilliant performance of Ewan McGregor.
The main goal of this movie was to please the Feminist and offend the real Harley Quinn character. I am not against women having a role in superheroes, because I personally liked Wonder Woman movie a lot and the producers in this film should learn from it.

Ewan Mcgregor has an amazing performance with some funny dialogue. He has the range to being charismatic and then becoming vicious with his character, Black Mask. Margot Robbie also gave an amazing performance. She's a brilliant actor who plays the role perfectly. The movie also had amazing choreography and fight scenes. This went well with a few of the songs from the soundtrack including ""Barracuda"" by Heart and ""Black Betty"" by Ram Jam. The one thing I thought they could improve was the costumes. I didn't like huntress' costume throughout the movie and black canary's could've been better. However, I did like the suits Black Mask wore. Overall I really enjoyed this movie and I recommend it.",Birds of Prey
623,zaidmnomani,"Female Deadpool with Worse Story, Poor Acting, and Unlikable Protagonist.",3,10 July 2020,"Due to COVID-19, most of the movies that were scheduled to come out this year were pushed to 2021. Birds of Prey was one of the few movies that managed to come out before lock down. However, it was still a massive flop, and I can't say I'm mad. It's a shame that out of all the superhero movies that were to come out this year, Birds of Prey was the only one that got released. From the trailer itself it looked pretty bad, but I decided to give it a chance anyway. While I don't think it's terrible or worthy of a one star, it was still an absolute waste of time.One think I noticed about the story is that it has striking similarities to both Deadpool movies. The protagonist is crazy, she breaks the fourth wall, and over the course of the movie becomes (kind of) a hero. There's a kid character who is integral to the plot, there's a generic villain who's evil for no reason. Both movies are also R-rated. Whereas in Deadpool all these things are important to his character, in this movie it feels very out of place.Harley was never a fourth wall breaking character at all. Granted, she doesn't have much personality in the comics so maybe they wanted to add some more characteristics, but they did it in the laziest way possible, by just making her female Deadpool. I always saw Harley as the annoying sister I never had, or a comedic sidekick. Which is why it doesn't really work when you try to make her the main character of a movie. Maybe a cartoon, or a comic, but definitely not a feature length film. You could argue that this is a team movie, but I disagree.All the other members of the team are so forgettable and are given such minimal screen time that I struggle to remember their names. They all have a five minute flashback backstory, then they operate on some subplot that is vaguely connected to the main story, and then they all end up in one room by the third act through sheer coincidence. And then they say: 'Well I guess we should work together as a team now.' It feels so contrived and forced.The villain is no better. Ewan McGregor brings in a decent performance, but his character is lacking. He's just a mustache-twirling villain who gets mad a lot and kills people. Still, I liked him way more than Harley Quinn, so much so that I was actually rooting for him to win. You can tell a main chracter is poorly written if you felt like choking her the entire movie.The editing gives me a headache. There's one scene in the film when Harley is captured, and the editing is on the level of Suicide Squad (definitely not a compliment). About one third of the film is a flashback sequence, so it's really hard to keep track of what's going on. And it's so unnecessary as well. Half the flashback takes place in a previous place that we have already seen, so why did they have to show the flashback?As for positives, I suppose the props and set pieces were good. I liked the action quite a lot, especially ones with Harley in them. The movie has an over the top color palette that is actually quite memorable, and there is a certain amount of style to it as well. Margot Robbie gives quite a convincing performance, one that is better than the one she gave in Suicide Squad (everyone else's acting sucked though).The director of the film, Cathy Yan, says that the movie performed poorly because the world is not ready for an all female cast yet. However, I completely disagree. This movie's poor performance is mostly because of it's R-rating. The only people whom I know that actually like Harley are a bunch of 12-13 year old kids. Aside from a couple of f-bombs and some mild gore, this movie feels very childish. It has no mature themes at all, and the jokes are extremely silly.The target demographic for this movie is adults, and yet I'm sure this film would make a lot more money if it was just PG-13. I guess they wanted to jump on the R-rated movie bandwagon after the success of Joker, but I'm glad to say it didn't work. Please don't watch this movie, it's a complete waste of your time and money.",Birds of Prey

625,lmahesa,This movie makes me sad.,4,10 November 2020,"Let's start with the good.Margot Robbie was stellar in this, and did well with what she was given. The amount of work and sheer effort she puts into the character is laudable. Ewan McGregor also delivered an incredible and believable performance, and I look forward to his Obi Wan series.As for Mary Elizabeth Winstead? Her delivery and moves were tight. She trained for her action scenes, and it showed. To be honest, she steals ever damn scene... but it does seem that that was intentional. Every good quip, every memorable scene - all her. Reloading her crossbow, trying to introduce herself, the slide, the motorbike... meanwhile, I can barely remember any specific scene for any other character. As for them...Ella Jay Basco. Is she related to a producer? She can't act to save her life. There's a scene where she's pretending to see people massing outside as she looks out of a window. Totally laughable and actually made me laugh.Rosie Perez. I could barely understand a word she said, as she slurs everything. I had to rely on subtitles. The character is shallow and unimaginative, adding zero to the story whatsoever.Jurnee Smollett. Bad choreography. I get the impression she didn't train too hard before shooting began.Now for the movie.What. The. Frack. Where did the budget go? The choreography and general cinematography was straight out of a CW 'Arrow' episode. Uninspired and unrealistic fight scenes, flubbed action scenes (watch Winstead as she exits the slide), poor action shots (Robbie's stunt double with thicker arms). The script? LOL. What was the point of the lengthy shopping scene? There's a 5-6 minute sequence starting at around 55:35 that served no purpose. After a lengthy car/motorbike chase sequence, two people on foot just materialize out of nowhere right when the plot calls for it.This was supposed to be set in Gotham, but never did I get that impression. No real effort was made with the set, lighting or cinematography. It felt like downtown in a nameless modern American city... especially during the daylight scenes, of which there were many.If you can find a fan edit of just the huntress scenes, just watch that.",Birds of Prey

628,writeguyr,Harley Hilarious Fun Hero,10,28 July 2020,"Harley Hilarious HeroUsually a film is about a good girl turned bad. Here Harley Quinn is a bad bad girl turned good! As she finds herself becoming a reluctant hero. Harley finds herself trying to save herself and a young girl from a villain named Roman Sionis ( Ewan McGregor ) and his henchmen. Harley finds help from three action characters. The Huntress a kung fu fighting crossbow assassin. (Mary Elizabeth Winstead ) Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett) a martial arts expert with a killer voice her high pitch can shatter glass! A former female police officer and former enemy of Harley's Rene Montoya ( Rosie Perez). Together they do battle with Sionis and company!
But this Margot Robbie's film. She nails the part of Harley Quinn! She is like the female ""Deadpool"" or female Joker. She is having so much in this film that it becomes a joy to watch. Harley has expert martial arts skills. She does back flipping martial arts kicks and expert fighting skills, that Bruce Lee is probably smiling down from heaven, giving Harley the thumbs up signal! I saw an older animated cartoon where Harley fought big muscle-bound Batman with martial arts fighting equal to his skill. But the main attraction here is that Margot Robbie brings this action comic character to life! You must remember that this film is taken from a comic strip. It supposed to be humorous with fun action. And here Margo as Harley Quinn delivers!
Lately male action hero characters: Batman and Superman have lost their way from their comic origins and become too dark and serious! Heath Ledger as the Joker in a Batman film stated to Batman ""Why so serious?!!"" That is a good question?!!
Margot here is a having a fun blast and you enjoy her antics with her! In the warehouse scene when Harley is trapped by a dozen villains. Harley finds a baseball bat there, she has a mischievous grin and says, ""Oh yeah!!"" With her martial arts skills and swinging of the baseball bat smacking the bad guys. The New York Yankees would want to sign her for bat swinging prowess! The finale fight showdown between Harley and her three sidekicks and Sionis large army of thugs in an abandoned amusement complex is pure Jackie Chan martial action fun and delight! Only here you have four girls as Jackie Chan! See this video for the fun time ride!!
I have seen the many negative reviews for female action heroes by males that feel threatened that their once male dominated action film genre has equal female competition. Now with Wonder Woman and Harley Quinn! I saw the male reviewers' comments like; ""Another Man Hating film where females bash and beat up men! No, it is female film action heroes bashing villains! Lighten up guys.....to repeat the Joker ""Why so serious?!!""",Birds of Prey

The story is not very impressive, but I think it's expected, nothing really special.Black Mask got exactly one comicbook scene...kinda.

Plus, its tone was very much disjointed - you get some stupid comedy most of the time, but then, there comes really serious and gritty elements for a bit, and then, again, back to comedy. I mean, for an action comedy movie, if that's was what they were aiming for, it worked, but, then, why those other elements? I don't really understand.
In addition, for a film that is named ""Birds of Prey""... ah... well... you only see them towards the end of the movie, and they only band together not out of necessity or something, but only due to circumstances that led them there. I know, that people on IMDB rates this a six, and, while I can understand that, but personally I'm very generous when it comes to movies and it takes a lot for me not to enjoy them, so...

Warner Bros. being scared of the public perception of DC being too dark but that's what the actual fans like and want so they just put out this mess of a film instead. Like I said, it was fun at times but just nowhere near what I wanted. They just wanted to cash in on Harley Quinn being the ""saving grace"" of Suicide Squad so they made a film based around her but couldn't really think how they would do it so they decided to throw the Birds Of Prey name on it. They should of started with the new name of the film in the first place ""Harley Quinn and the Birds Of Prey"" as it's her film completely and they're just thrown into the mix and completely wasted. Talking of wasted; Black Mask, he's one of Batman's coolest villains in his rogues gallery and yeah, he only had his mask on for 5 minutes of screen time, if that? I guess they were mostly banking on Ewan McGregor's face? Such a shame that he now won't be used in this ""universe"" anymore, same goes for Victor Zsasz unfortunately.
I'm one of the few who actually liked Jared Leto's Joker and it was upsetting not to see him make a return and we will probably never see him again which sucks.
I will say that maybe the last 40 minutes or so kind of save the film a bit, certainly the most fun part. The fight scenes were actually really entertaining which was nice. The fourth wall breaking from Harley is a big no from me, stop that, seriously, yuck.

I like Margot Robbie and I know she was heavily involved in this movie. It's a shame, because it's not very good. Most of the humour didn't hit the mark. We are asked to believe that a supposedly highly intelligent person becomes a kookie super hero/villain because she broke up with her boyfriend. So of course when one goes out on their own they buy a hyena for company! One minute she's ditsy, the next she is making a profound psychiatric diagnosis. Ding-a-ling-a-ling!
The baddie Roman was a cutout villain with no depth & no back story about how he ended up a villain. He was like a child who lost his favourite toy & having a tantrum.
There's a song & dance routine thrown into the mix when Harley nearly got knocked out that was superfluous, making no sense.

The entire movie focuses on Harley Quinn which is why they likely changed the title while this was in theaters to Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey. Their portrayal of Rene Montoya as a cop turned anti-hero vigilante is disturbing. It's like having Alfred tag along with Batman and Robin, only less useful. The movie could've ended on a high note with the loss of Montoya to a bullet, if they hadn't given her plot armor in the form of a bullet proof corset. Not joking. That's a thing. There's more dick punches than necessary, literally no strong male roles outside of the overly flamboyant Black Mask, which gets obliterated at the end, so RIP to him and potential sequels I guess.

The action is awesome, easily the best of any DC-movie, and there's a lot of it. The characters are so fun and a lot of their moments are also quite touching.I really liked this film, and it's nice to see that DC is going in the right direction with their films. A shame that it seems to be doing poorly at the box office though..",Birds of Prey

655,charliegeeza,I feared the worst but it was OK,6,26 March 2020,"Watched out of boredom and lack of options due to COVID-19, from the trailer and early reviews I expected to really dislike this film (we watched it because my partner wanted to).It was actually quite close to being a decent film. Without going into spoilers, some of the isses that went against it:1) Varying level of quality when it came to the action sequences. Some of the stunt and fight choreography was actually surprisingly good, and certainly I was surprised by Margaret Robbie's capabilities. However, for every ""wow"" moment there is multiple poor ones, with stunt men passively waiting on being attacked or being knocked out and defeating by moves that clearly were not hurtful (being thrown to the floor seemed to be a fatal blow in this film). The fact that some of the fight sequences were actually very good means this came down to just laziness on the director's part in terms of pushing his crew to get it right.2) A lot of the script didn't work outside of Harlequinn. In particular, Huntress was awkward and her dialog hard to sit through.3) There were just some rather dense moments that were puzzling. At one point whilst confronted by an overwhelming force, the female team take a break from fighting to just casually walk out of a building and get shot at. Or another moment when Harlequinn is ambushed at home, and then the people attacking her just seem to disappear for the convenience of the rather thin plot.It is a fun, wild ride with some laughs and some surprisingly good action. It just came dangerously close to being a good film with a bit more love and attention to detail.",Birds of Prey

The story was a bit weak in places, but Margot Robbie's performance is the saving thread of the film. Not that her character's depiction was pitch perfect at all times, but it hit most of the notes and continuously saved the story. The other characters were pretty lame and more like props than characters, except for Rosey Perez who character was strong in the first half of the show and then faded back in the final act for some reason.One could go scene by scene and nitpick what's there, or simply go with the flow and the ride.I overall enjoyed the film and recommend it for light entertainment by an exceptional actor in a less than exceptional story.",Birds of Prey

The only thing about Birds of Prey that was worth watching is Margot Robbie, simply for the eye-candy, but unfortunately everything else, including the story and directing of this movie is just plain awful.The villain is nearly non-existent and the story does not follow the comics at all. The characters are always, CONSTANTLY, trying to be funny and witty, as if this was a Deadpool knockoff. Who at Warner Bros approved of this? Every single scene is a big pile of cheese. What the fuh... you know what, I digress.The director, writers, and the entire Warner Bros team responsible for this trash need to go back to the source material, comics, animated series, or even reference movies such the Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix 2019 Joker, in order to bring a more serious, darker take on Harley Quinn next time.Harley Quinn seemed to be more of a broken person in Suicide Squad. She seemed like someone who can psychologically pick your brain and corrupt you, almost like Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight. There was potential there. Margot Robbie could have made Harley Quinn simply legendary... unfortunately, the director and writers decided to go the EXTRA SILLY route instead.PS. Warner Bros, hire me next time you need a consultant for a movie like this.

Margot Robbie was kinda alright but her performance in Suicide Squad as Harley Quinn was much better than this. Black Canary was cool and Huntress has some potential to be better but they completely wasted her character. Montoya was terrible. But the single most annoying thing in this mess of a movie has got to be Cassandra Cain. With all due respect, the actress playing Cassandra was so bad it hurts. She was annoying and completely ruined the whole movie single handily. A character like that deserves much better than this terrible representation. Black Mask was maybe kinda okay. The direction seemed off. The music was good I'll give them that. The STORY of this movie is so freaking weak. The movie's plot revolves around Harley breaking up with the Joker. Which they do not explain why or how, they just say that it happened and you have to go along with it. It makes no sense what so ever. It's like they tried to force it in a really bad way.

The violence is meaningless and cartoonish.So, why is this movie ok? Margot Robbie plays her part well. Some (not all) of the action scenes are well done and interesting. However, it's not enough to rescue this film.If you're bored and want senseless violence, consider watching this flick. Otherwise, just skip it. It's not for comic fans or male audiences.

Sound track was fun, the commentary was fun, Margot Robbie is a class act, but there's a continuous shot in Knight and Day with Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise where they run at full speed across an exploding beach in one continuous shot and during it they pass a table and she wrangles her bag and gets it over her head and onto the her shoulders while they are running. Cameron Diaz was fit. Margot Robbie isn't, she clearly lives a sedentary life style that doesn't translate well into an 'action' movie, although she is a better runner than the flat footed Kristin Stewart.
Cathy Yan's direction is better than Elizabeth Banks's by a long way, but the weakness of the stunts especially towards the end is really, truly appalling when you compare it to just about any other action movie, ever.

Margot Robbie's performance (along with Cathy Yan's directing and Christina Hodson's writing) really sell the character. I'd happily watch a dozen movies with her in this role.The rest of the cast including the actual ""Birds of Prey"" and and Ella Jay Basco's Cassandra Cain are great and become ever better when the team is finally formed and everyone is interacting with each other.While this to mostly be a stand alone/spin-off film, I do hope I get to see all these characters again in future films.",Birds of Prey

Margot Robbie does pretty well as the lead character but there is no drama, no tension, little genuine comedy, a cardboard villain and a non-sensical plot all of which leads to a poor film.

It's by no means a particularly good piece of film, but it's (barely) tolerable if you completely shut your brain off and like the schizophrenic and ridiculous things that you're witnessing without wanting more from the story or characters. It really does take a love of the performers/characters/aesthetic/directorial style to enjoy this. The dramatic egg sandwich narrative arc was a cute and very well done piece of this movie, perhaps even one of the best parts, which basically tells you everything that you need to know about the overall quality of BOP.

This movie started off badly, and progressively got worse from there. The narration, the order in which the scenes are ""told"" and the action scenes that make no sense... But why?
About the action scenes: Whoever choreographed them has either never seen an action scene in the past 20 years, or was a bumbling idiot. Perhaps both.
They make fun of ""Montoya"" - the cop that quotes bad 80s cop movies? Ironic...
I found myself asking ""but why?"" way too often during the movie.
It lasts 1 hr 48 minutes but seems like a 3h movie to sit through.
The scenes that are supposed to be fun, come across as cringe.
The music is loud, pompous and often horribly out of place.
Their attempts at humor are really not funny at all.
The cast, which is actually not bad on paper, must have woken up on the day after screening this, with a head full of questions. Hopefully their bank accounts will also have been filled with money because I see no other reason for any of them to have accepted to play with that script. The screenwriting is worthy of an episode of Blues Clues, actually make that a mediocre episode of Blues Clues. Come to think of it, I've actually sat through and watched episodes of ""Lazytown"" that were more interesting with better intrigue and writing.
Honestly, with the ""missing diamond"" plot - it made this seem like someone had an old Pink Panther script that was never developed, and instead decided to adapt it to the DC Universe (But why?) see? Again... but why?

Better yet what was she thinking while producing it. Obviously we could expect a lot of insanity, but with no real plot to back it up it becomes just a very loooonnngggg movie to watch. A breakup story and a girl standing on her own feet is not bad in general but does not lent itself to a super hero/villan movie.
Especially not Harley quin, like we are going to feel sad for her or understand her drama ? Dont get me wrong every actres in this movie is brilliant by themselves but as a group they just dont work.

What do they want? Did they want the female leads to be weak and subservient? Did they want the bad guy to be good?There are literally dozens of male led superhero movies. Off the top of my head, I can only think of three female ones. Including this one. So why are people acting like women are trying to take over Hollywood? For gods sake, they just want the same opportunities as men. I for one, don't see why that's a bad thing. If you're worried about someone taking your job, then you're obviously not very good at it. So stop whining, fix up and better yourself. It's just getting really pathetic now.This movie is awesome in my opinion. I'm not saying you will definitely like it as much as I did because everyone has different tastes and this is simply my opinion. Not a fact, which is something the negative reviewers fail to see when writing their foul comments. They will tell you not to watch this film. Basically trying to control what you do. I won't tell you to watch it just because I like it. Watch it, don't watch it. Just leave any politics at the door and enjoy the movie for what it is. Fun, action packed and whacky. I didn't go into this movie as a feminist and I didn't come out as one. But I don't have a problem with women standing up to better their lives like some people do.

Add the accent to my dislike of the continuous narrative voice over film model (show don't tell) and it was not the easiest film to get into. But eventually the action began to take over. The humour was evident, and I did have a few loud snickers, even if there were not many belly laughs (possibly because of the voice over). Was Harley the crazed, antic filled, zane-master any true fan of her infamy has come to rely on? Y...e...s... but with a heavier dose of pathos than one could normally feel for the traditional DC villainThe story's divergence from the original DC'verse is not a bad thing when one remembers this is not a 'DC' film. Will it ever stand up next to DC canon, or is it more of what Sony's Fantastic Four is to the Marvel'verse?

It flows really well from beginning to end. It has a great artistic touch to it, lots of stunts & choregraphies are pretty creative (several sequences are really striking), the settings as well as the lightings look very vibrant & colorful... The entire movie is magnificently shot & framed, the photography is eye-candy with some shots that look magnificent.Yes, the story/plot isn't the most groundbreaking ever, but the way it's built is pretty cool... Plus it is served by dialogs that are highly tasty, with interactions & one-liners that are a true delight. The chemistry between all the actors is obvious and shows ; which of course is pleasurable and makes you want to follow this ""adventure"" and know what's coming next for these characters...Talking about the characters, I think it's one of the strenghts of the movie. The writers, the director & the actors clearly enjoyed developing the characters, their traits/personalities, backgrounds, motivations, qualities & flaws. It grounds them in a nice way and makes you relate. Through Harley Quinn, Margot Robbie offers a fun performance that is worthy of Harlequin (with choregraphies & lines that are flamboyant), also adding numerous layers that make you picture the way her mind works and makes you appreciate each of her actions even more. And the whole experience of the movie definitely benefits from it. The other characters combine smoothly with one another, and each one has multiple moments when to shine. A mention to Ewan McGregor who (as always) has brought a great energy and presence to his character, making him pretty electrifying in every scene he's in.One last mention for the brilliant costume design & makeup artistry, superb... The music/soundtrack is catchy and works well all along the movie.

It seems there is general impression that people who are giving bad ratings are giving it without watching it. I assure you I watched it completely and with open mind. Although I knew it will be a normal politicaly correct Hollywood movie but I wasn't expectIng all the protagonists to be women.

That's why I was sad I didn't like this one. I liked Suicide Squad. Lol im not hard to please. LolGood:
Harley Quinn. Robbie is an awesome Harley. I don't know if her outfits were right but who cares right? Except comic fans which I'm not. Her voice, look, and etc is Harley.Fight scenes: they were good. Unrealistic with the whole women easily beating up men. But it's a comic movie I don't need realism watching Harley bop people in the head was fun.Black Canary: she was a great actress. Got Pam Grier vibes. Beautiful and dressed to the nines. 1 complaint how'd she get her powers and when did Gotham get metas? 100 Batman' movies and have never seen a meta. Yea Dr Strange has created some superpower villains. But how did she get her powers? Shouldn't she be in Star City with the Arrow?The Bad:
Rosie character. The detective with no name.The villain. He wasn't a villain at all he bought a diamond, Cassandra stole it and he wanted it back. Even said don't kill her. Not enough character development for him.The storyline: Harley breaks up with the Joker and everyone wants to kill her until the teen Cassandra steals the diamond and now Harley offers to get it back for Black Mask so he doesn't kill her. She swallowed it so they are giving her laxatives waiting for her to poop...Really the 1st HQ movie and that's the best plot you can come up with. Super lame.Huntress: she was more of a guy and had the personality of wallpaper.Birds of Prey: give us a Harley movie. No one cares about the BOP except comic nerds. You're not getting a billion from that predominantly male demographic by making an anti man chic movie.I'm a 39 yr old female. Went with my 17 yr old daughter and 60yr old dad. None of us liked it.

729,entertainmentish,The 7 is for Margot Robbie,7,18 February 2020,"Bird of Prey (2020) : Margot Robbie will always be the best playing Harley Quinn, the accent, the attitude , the craziness and her fights is what made me want to see the movie. And she didn't fail to entertain. However, the story was a little all over the place going back and forth in the telling of it. I'm not a fan of going back to a scene for at least half an hour to explain why the other scene is happening and it happened twice. It was annoying. I'm used to seeing Ewan Mcgregor As the good Obi-wan-Kanobe and in a romantic role. See I g him as a villain didn't sell it for me unfortunately- the mask looked like a dark version of Jim Carey's the mask - that's what I kept thinking staring at it. And I absolutely love Jurnee-Smollet-Bell (She was on full house as a kid) but because of not so great directing I felt she came in short as the Black Canary and her power wasn't given much attention in the movie . And No No No to the Huntress casting. She was awful, I don't know if it was her bad acting or was it bad writing or directing. Unfortunately the birds of Prey weren't as strong as I thought they would be. The fight scene choreography could've have been more interesting but it got boring at times - exception is Harley Quinn she had a real good couple of fight scenes that got me like whoa .. but the birds of prey were Meh.

730,dsohn7,Unfairly rated,6,14 February 2020,"This movie isn't about hating men.
Remember the sweet Taiwanese grandpa friend that sells Harley out? Or even the Joker? These are men she loved the most who crushed her heart. Did she seek out revenge on them or anyone? No. Because her agenda isn't about hating/hurting men. The Huntress's agenda is but only the specific men that killed her fam. If you're among the simpletons who decided to review bomb this movie -and probably my review- instead of, you know, actually critiquing the writing/performances/filmmaking, TRY to be more objective and less emotional.Okay, now to the movie:
too many voice overs. Very heavy-handed with the narration. Like ""this is me, I'm just an average girl! Except maybe I'm a little different!"" It's overbearing.The timeline in the first half was jumping all over the place.Some noticeably cliche tropes can be spotted, which diminishes the freshness they were trying to go for.Second half was better. One thing I appreciated in the writing is that her chaotic actions were always motivated as a response/reaction to another character so even though she's psychotic, she's a fun, sympathetic character. Margot Robbie does a great job balancing the mania and the vulnerability.Fun action, fun/colorful VFX, wardrobe, and production design. Fun action sequences, although I think I've learned to appreciate messier, clumsier fight sequences over the obviously-choreographed flips, tricks, and kicks.There were a couple of laughs.

Action scenes were really bad, it was like watching old 90's action movies where every scene goes on and on and things blow just for entertainment...

It's messy as hell, at times crassly mean-spirited, and mostly not that funny, but for the most part it's still a great deal of fun. Harley is still a fun character, and this version of her that is more than just an oversexualized girlfriend of the Joker is a much more interesting character to follow. Her girl gang and resentful breakup is also just a very human story. Yeah it was done better in the animated series currently on DC Universe, but still, this one is fun. The other Birds are pretty good, especially Huntress, but this really is Harley's show, and she's good. I do have to give love to Ewan McGregor as Black Mask. Yeah he's done villains before, but good god, this is one helluva villain. I love the character Black Mask, and he absolutely nails the character. Charming, funny, completely psychotic, I was a happy geek watching him on screen. Not to mention McGregor is clearly having a ball in the roll, and that energy does pass on to you. Overall though Birds of Prey is a mess. It's plot is basically Snatch but not as good, and it's attitude is aggressive, but god damn does it ever have an attitude. It has an identity, a style, and a look I can't deny, and I will admit it was pretty fun. It's got some solid performances, characters I wanted to see, and a solid style.

757,jogre17,"Messy, yet enjoyable cringe fest",6,18 August 2020,"I saw this movie back when it came out opening weekend in theatres, but I came out confused as to what I saw and I didn't know how to explain myself to why I didn't enjoy the film as much as I should've. Now that it's on HBOMAX, I gave the film a second watch and all the light bulbs lit up.What this film truly lacks is execution and giving certain characters an intriguing arc that actually makes you care about them. Three characters come to mind, two of them being the villains. Roman Sionis (Black Mask) and the creepy yet intriguing character Victor Zaz are a few minor grievances. Zaz was an interesting character, but wasn't explored as much as he should have been. He was mainly put in for the fans of the comics who know his character. Black Mask though started off very well. Ewan McGregor is a fantastic actor, but about halfway through the movie the writing team failed to make him feel like a threat and really just let him just be evil for the sake of being evil, which is really pointless and makes the conclusion fairly unflattering. The character with the biggest problem is by far Huntress aka Helena Bertanelli. The writing team really failed her as a character. She worked better as a mute character earlier on, but when it came to her dialogue, it just all fell flat and really didn't make me care for her. She was treated as a bit of a gag and that was just unflattering when the characters tried to tell us, the audience, how bad ass she is. Her character just fell flat the minute she started speaking.Other characters aside are mostly good to fantastic. The character Dina Lance was done pretty dang well. She had a purpose and did leave some intrigue to those who aren't familiar with her character so later in the movie when her big moment comes to shine, it truly pays off. Renee Montaya is your typical cop from any tv show or movie, but they run with that gag throughout and it just works with her character. I reall just wanted more of her honestly. Now it comes down to Harley Quinn herself, the true star of the film. Margot Robbie truly embodies the character that is Harley Quinn and works with it amazingly! Much better performance than Suicide Squad and even in that film she was the highlight.Other than the characters, the story itself had promise and a vision. The problem there is that they tried to do too much and make the film too lighthearted at times. That truly made the film feel off balance and kind of confusing. Especially when they start throwing in other side stories to make certain characters relevant. These ideas were good ideas, just executed at the wrong times. A good amount of what happened in the movie honestly should've been planned to be in the sequel. Let's face it, there's gonna be a sequel. What they should've done instead was give us more time to develop the 3 main characters that matter as well as more exposition on Black Mask as a character with his motives to help the plot feel more genuine.Is there fun to have with this film? Yes.
Will everyone like it? No.
Does the good outweigh the bad? For me yes, but that's truly based on personal opinion.If you can't sit down and try to have fun with this movie, then I can promise you that you won't like it that much. Is it worth the watch though? Yes, just go with it and maybe you'll be surprised. Find your own opinion and don't completely rely on what others say",Birds of Prey
758,magdikhanali,Why,1,30 October 2020,"I wish that they can allow us to contact the producers and the script writers directly

However if you were expecting some semblance of a movie forget it. From the beginning you will be assaulted by hyper-kinetic action scenes, and hyper-kinetic narration by Harley Quinn. That narration is really unnecessary, all you had to do was tell the story in order, not keep going back and telling the backstory every 15 minutes, that narration just destroyed the flow of the movie. There are a couple of scenes where the movie tries to be caring and sensitive, those scenes are completely out of place in this movie. None of the humour was funny. The villain was not even scary, he was just an idiot. I knew this movie wasn't going to be great, but I didn't expect it to be this stupid.

764,jpsimmons-72015,Another disappointment from DC,5,7 February 2021,"This movie looks absolutely amazing and Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor give high level performances as usual. Unfortunately, this movie ends up lacking the magic it should've had.First off, there's too much narration which makes it hard to get into the story at times. There's so much narration that it just becomes lazy story telling on the writers and director's part.Secondly, It seems to take a lot from other movies like kill bill, Scott pilgrim vs the world, and a lot of other films that don't come to mind at the moment. This could've been next level if the creators had the balls to be more original with the story.Thirdly, There is unnecessary overt social commentary sloppily forced into the script from time to time.Fourthly, The main antagonist doesn't feel threatening to the audience for one second. For example there's a scene where he forces a women in a club to strip that I guess was supposed to be menacing???Lastly, this movie should've just been a solo Harley Quinn movie. The movie ended up trying to balance too much at once which made it feel not as focused as it could've been. The other girls just got glossed over because the studio wanted to sell more tickets.I ultimately blame DC. Someone over there clearly doesn't belong in the film industry.",Birds of Prey
765,teamodro,"Ive never read the comics, not a DC fan really, and have never heard of Harley Quinn until Suicide Squad",1,25 March 2020,"The DC movies have mostly all been ""meh"" or lower in my eyes. Just not my favorite really. I have never read a comic book, but I do enjoy a lot of the super hero movies. So thinking that Suicide Squad was ok i figured i'd enjoy this enough to watch. Wow was I wrong........I played this movie for about 25 minutes, and shut it off. There was just SOOOO much bad in this short period alone that it wasn't tolerable. Margot Robie is pretty so there are points there, but theres not much worse than the stereotype NY accent. The story is a joke too....they don't take anything seriously. They couldn't even take the time to make jokes funny in this if they weren't going to write a real story. The woman cop and that singer just did me in. Such bad acting that I finally hung it up.The big takeaway. The #1 thing in my head was feminism. You can tell that this was written by someone trying to force women empowerment down our throats. The women in this movie were all tough, witty, indestructable, perfect and in your face. The men were slow, lazy, stupid and are tripping all over themselves. I came into this not reading any reviews, checking scores, or having any expectations really. So a cringeworthy feminist approach being picked up this fast by me (again, 25 min in) is pretty horrible. Stay very far away!",Birds of Prey

The story was very uninspiring, the violence and fight scenes with a couple of exceptions were poorly done and it simply skipped around too damn much trying to explain it's terrible story.The half dozen others who were in the theater were obviously as disappointed as we were from their very loud comments while leaving pointing out obvious flaws with the canon of Harley and her power set in being tranquilized so easily when she is virtually immune to toxins and chemicals ( I had to look it up make sure they were right and they were).Whether all of its flaws are the result of the usual studio interference of the DC movies or because Robbie was a producer of the movie is for others to determine.

777,jgardiner86,Its biggest failure is trying too hard,6,10 February 2020,"Ive seen this film twice now as wanted to make sure i hadnt overlooked anything or jumped to judgement after the first viewing. First and foremost it has very little to do with the birds of prey and instead is a Harley Quinn movie bar the final 20 minutes. It starts by trying to fill in the gaps between Suicide Squad and the start of this film, but essentially is just Harley explaining her and the Joker are no more. There's a loose plot but not what ud call a well developed or fleshed out one. By including the BOP they set themselves a huge task of trying to introduce them all, bring them together develop a plot all the while trying to give the bulk of screen time to the star Margot Robbie. The result is a somewhat chaotic mess that at points works but never fully realises its potential. Its clear they have studied and tried to use what Deadpool did as a guideline but falls short at nearly every turn. Yes there's the excessive use of swearing and crude humour alongside violence but it lacks the originality and character making it seem a little forced. You can see they knew what they wanted to achieve but in being so determined to try make it like that they have become their own biggest enemy. It feels like its trying too hard whereas Deadpool felt natural like they didnt try to write it a certain way its just how it was written. The film is different and has some genuinely good moments but it also feels rushed and a tad disjointed. There are moments where its a little too childish but not in a good way. I respect what they have attempted but ultimately i fear it will actually be the thing that prevents future sequels. If you have to try realky hard to make something seem genuine the chances are its not, i would have liked to see them not trying to mimick the success and style of other R rated comic movies and instead forge its own path. A longer runtime would have also allowed for more plot and character development. I think younger audiences will enjoy it altho the R rating makes that harder and subsequently will effect its box office. Its bright, energetic and has a good cast its just a shame they aren't fully utilised. The soundtrack is great and used perfectly. Its set itself up for future films but im not sure how quickly they will come around. Not much of an improvement on Suicide Squad and less enjoyable than than some of DC's more recent efforts such as Shazam which did a great job of incorporating humour. 6/10 enjoyable but ultimately tries too hard.",Birds of Prey
778,aakashsen,Something just doesn't click right.,5,20 March 2020,"The movie was surely beautiful, had great acting, costumes, humour and that was all.So where exactly did it go wrong?
The script was an entire mess ,I don't even know where to start.CHARACTERS :
Harley was just being Harley, props to Margot Robbie.
Surprisingly, the rest of the birds of prey were interesting characters as well, but they hardly got enough screen time.
Roman Sionis was... I have no idea what he was supposed to do. A women hating sadist, that's all his character is. Nothing more.
Victor Zsasz even more useless than Sionis. All he did was laugh in a creepy weird way, nothing else on the table. The guy probably had like 5 lines of dialogue.My main problem with this movie is that it says all men are bad, i mean there isn't a single male character that is just normal.
The plot was really simple, and the movie took a lazy style of narration, which is my next problem.
NARRATION :
3/4th of the plot was explained by Harley to the audience, she apparently knows what's happening in the scenes that don't even involve her. DC audience aren't dumb enough to have the plot spoon fed. And the worst part is, it was force fed.This begs the question of why the movie was ever made in the first place. DC took their sweet time to come up with this? The Joker and Harley Quinn breaking up, taking place offscreen.
Personally it felt like reading a fan fiction in an alternate timeline where Gotham is all glitter , sprinkles, Night clubs and horrible horrible men.I gotta admit though, the fight scenes and the humour were great!",Birds of Prey

Margot Robbie presents herself very well in her role. I think this movie was made because Harley Quinn did so well in Suicide Squad. The plot is based on the exertions of a bit crazy woman in her world. She even got an interesting pet, which not everyone has, I can only say.

Of course not. Is this your standard so so DC movie? YES. Sorry if you're DC fan but DC films are by definition inferior to Marvel. Having said that I'll sum it up: The action's awesome, it's filmed well, and I always liked the idea of protecting a child being the goal of protagonists which was the case here. Yes it is a bit corny and very Deadpoolish and yes the antagonist is for crap. You can have a cheesy protagonist and have a serious and scary antagonist (I.E Shredder from the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). Not sure why they decided to make Ewan McGregor's character so ridiculous. The mask he wore was pretty daunting. Deciding to make his character so flamboyant and cowardly was a dumb decision. That being said it was better than suicide Squad. Even tho it basically was Suicide squad minus their lame Jared Leto cardboard cutout version of the Joker.",Birds of Prey
784,JTReviewsPlus,At least it's better than Suicide Squad,6,11 February 2020,"Birds of Prey is an entertaining film that is bogged down by a disjointed, uninteresting and simplistic story. The basic premise is that Harley Quinn is tasked with finding an important diamond for Black Mask within a certain amount of time. Along her adventure audiences are introduced to new characters like Black Canary, Huntress, Victor Zaszz, etc. Margot Robbie excellently portrays Harley Quinn once again and absolutely steals the show. Her comedic wit and performance embodies the fan favorite character perfectly. Ewan Mcgreggor does a great job with the material he was given for Black Mask but ultimately the character didn't feel like his comic book counter part. The same can be said for the rest of The Birds of Prey. Although all the actors do a decent job, their characters are not too memorable or likeable especially compared to the comic book versions. There brief origin stories are to blame due to random flashbacks, brief conversations, and lack of screen time since we follow Harley Quinn for most of the film. The action doesn't disappoint thanks to the John Wick's stunt choreographer's contribution but there were some scenes that are hard for some to suspend disbelief... Black Canary, Huntress, and Harley Quinn beating thugs is one thing but Renee Montoya bearing a 6 ft 200lb thug one on one is too unrealistic even for a superhero film. If you enjoy superhero action movies you won't be disappointed with Birds of Prey. However, if you were hoping for a more team based superhero movie with amazing depictions of other characters besides Harley Quinn, then you will be hard pressed to get that here.",Birds of Prey
785,westerfieldreviews,"""The Extravagant Tale of the Harlequin""",8,14 February 2020,"""The Extravagant Tale of the Harlequin""Cathy Yan steps into the spectacular realm of superheroes with a wild ride of a film full of chaos and insanity that straps you in and never lets you go. ""Birds of Prey"" is the latest installment in the troubled DCEU (or whatever they're calling it these days) and places Margot Robbie's wonderful Harley Quinn at the forefront with a batch of fresh faces for a nearly two-hour film that is a solid entry for the franchise. With shades of its predecessors, the entire cast and crew of ""Birds of Prey"" unite to construct a strange rollercoaster of a film that basks in its outrageous style with no retrains and no regrets. When the bubble of superhero films continues to inflate every passing year, it is truly refreshing to watch something in the genre that does not take itself too seriously or have the job of building off of past films and setting up new storylines for the future. ""Birds of Prey"" is as wacky as its full name would suggest; it is a film that takes the characters and locals of the historical DC Universe and views them through a lens of lunacy that will either make audiences laugh or cringe (I experienced the former).
""Birds of Prey"" writer, Christina Hodson crafts a script that brings the legendary Birds of Prey team to the screen eighteen years after their last live-action incarnation. The story picks up with our titular ""hero"" Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) as she narrates the life events that have led to her downward spiral since her untimely breakup with the clown prince of crime himself, the Joker. This breakup has shattered Harley's heart, but given her a new lease on life; a fresh start to define herself as not just the ""Joker's girl"". For the time being, Harley takes refuge in Roman Sionis' aka Black Mask's (Ewan McGregor) nightclub where she becomes acquainted with the talented and lovely singer, Dinah Lance (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) as well as the prideful psychotic killer, Victor Zsasz (Chris Messina). However, in a final effort to destroy the fragments of her past life, Harley decides to demolish the binding place that sealed Harley and Joker's love, Ace Chemicals. The nearby explosion rattles a force of GCPD officers as they are investigating a grizzly murder by committed by the hands of a vigilante known only as, the crossbow killer. Detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez) hurries over to the ruins of Ace Chemicals and discovers Harley's broken necklace; she quickly realizes that without the Joker's blanket of protection she is in real trouble. Once the grungy criminal underground of Gotham City becomes privy to this news, Roman not only sends his goons on a search to uncover a diamond that holds the secrets to the Bertinelli family fortune, but he decides that going after Harley is also of the utmost importance; because with both objects, he would surely rule over all of Gotham. Through several moments of misfortune, Harley, Dinah, Renee, Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco), and Helena Bertinelli (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) all cross paths and must come together with a common cause and assemble to become the Birds of Prey.
Despite ""Birds of Prey"" not being a direct sequel to 2016's ""Suicide Squad"", it is hard to not compare the two seeing as how on the outside, a lot of the DNA infused in both films crosses streams almost directly. Production designer K.K. Barrett, art director Kasra Farahani, and costume designer Erin Benach take all of their immense talents and come together to create a world of insanity and madness that displays a visual style that is wild and unmistakable. Every frame is packed with a rich spectrum of color, every set is dressed with a personal approach that focuses on character, and all of the costumes pay homage to their comic book counterparts while making them one of a kind with their own unique flairs. On a visual level, ""Birds of Prey"" stands out from the bland pack of superhero films that flood the market today. The R rating of the movie is another key factor that helps separate itself from the myriad of other films in its genre; sadly, it is not fully used to its full potential. Within the very first ten minutes of the film, a least fifty (probably an exaggeration) f-bombs are dropped simply because it is allowed. The language can at times be seen as a bit juvenile when an expletive must be said within every other line of dialogue. Yet, despite the language feeling excessive and not adding to much of the film, the action is certainly propped up by its rating. In ""Birds of Prey"" the bombastic and erratic action that explodes on-screen is fast and deliberate. The individual set-pieces leading up to the third act are sparse while being quick as to not overstay their welcome; which is a plus. We as the audience get an understanding of the combat styles each of the ""Birds"" employ which is helpful for us to understand what tools each member has in their kit. Harley's brutal close-quarters style makes her a baseball bat-wielding ballerina, Canary's martial art techniques along with her sonically charged screams make her a massive threat, and Huntress' swift fleet-footed movements and mini crossbow give her a distinct range advantage that many of her fellow ""Birds"" can not cover. When all of the ""Birds"" come together combining their individual skill sets in the final act against Black Mask, Yan perfectly encapsulates that fierce violence and paints a memorable scene of blood and fun. However, no matter how much fun the spectacle of the film may be, the script does a disservice to the other ""Birds"" as they hardly get enough screen-time and are never developed in a meaningful way. Everyone outside of Harley evokes the same kinds of emotions at the beginning of the film as they do at the end. With some minor changes sprinkled throughout, most of the characters are depicted as being extremely one-note meaning anyone going into this film who is not already a fan of DC Comics, may not be as interested in them or their stories. Nonetheless, ""Birds of Prey"" bathes in its own extravagant chaos from start to finish which is an attribute that must be commended.
Although ""Birds of Prey"" does not utilize all its characters in fantastic ways, there are certainly some standouts that can not go overlooked. Both Ewan McGregor and Chris Messina who play Roman Sionis and Victor Zsasz respectively, deliver two performances that are truly exceptional. McGregor takes the traditional stale mob boss character of Roman and turns him into a deranged, unhinged, psychopath hell-bent on striking fear into anyone who opposes him while showcasing his malevolent power for all to see. Every scene McGregor partakes in is one he instantly steals with the haunting performance he delivers through the atrocious acts he unabashedly loves to engage in. McGregor and by extension Roman, is a true showman with a ton of baggage that is all used to exhibit a true sinister debonair devil. Then there is Messina who plays Roman's right-hand man Victor Zsasz. Messina's performance as this psychopath makes him one of the best characters in ""Birds of Prey"". His unsettling dialogue, tone, and mannerisms will make you feel uncomfortable with every repulsive action he partakes in. Messina flawlessly plays alongside McGregor that bolsters his performance (and vice versa) creating a villainous force that is as remarkable as it is menacing.
Any discussion around ""Birds of Prey"" can not be complete without talking about Margot Robbie's deep involvement with the project. Robbie had been shepherding the idea for a ""Birds of Prey"" standalone film starring Harley Quinn for several years before a script was drafted or pre-production even began. Robbie had a detailed plan she believed in and stuck with it until the studio gave her the green light. Her intimate involvement shows as she not only helped produce the project, but she also takes center stage. In many ways ""Birds of Prey"" feels like a completely standalone film for Robbie's whimsical portrayal of Harley Quinn to burst free; which is not a mark against the film as Robbie takes the complexities of this character to new and exciting heights. Robbie takes many emotional leaps forward evolving this character beyond simple eye candy (as she was utilized in ""Suicide Squad"") which is greatly appreciated. Robbie embodies this role with all of her essence and it is appearing as though that in the same way we view Robert Downey Jr. as the Tony Stark, I believe Margot Robbie will be looked at in that same light as the one true, Harley freaking Quinn.
""Birds of Prey"" is a sporadic film that is a blast of fun. The entire cast and crew all bring their best to create a superhero film that feels like nothing the genre has ever seen. Although at times the film will push in a certain direction that can feel a bit unbearable, it always quickly recognizes its strengths and pushes onward showcasing its best attributes. Despite a lackluster script and stunted character development, all of the performances are serviceable with a handful that are absolutely impeccable. ""Birds of Prey"" is a film that is not ashamed of itself nor anything it says or does which is a truly refreshing revitalization that is sorely needed in this bloated cookie-cutter genre that we have all grown accustomed to; that being the ""superhero film"". However, IF we ever see the Birds of Prey unify once more, the other members will need to be further developed and propped up in order to play on Harley's level.Final Verdict - B+",Birds of Prey

787,Artist_TRS,DC Fans Were Preyed Upon,2,1 July 2021,"2020's ""Birds of Prey"" (the remainder of the excessively long title I refuse to type because it's so obviously a pretentious desperate attempt at being artsy and I loath it) is one of the worst superhero movies I've ever seen. The title should've instead been ""Harley Quinn and The Birds of Prey"". Because this is not a Birds of Prey movie; Harley Quinn takes centre stage and the team is treated as her background set pieces.I'm an avid fan and reader of DC comics and this movie is an insult to the beloved source characters. Many characters are near unidentifiably depicted, lacking any sense of respect and homage for the time-honoured characteristics you'd expect of them. It's an insult. Irrelevant alterations to characters, especially sociopolitical ones, are not clever, it's desperate pandering and creatively hollow. And if you're basing a movie from the original source material, intentionally riding the coattails of the original source material, but it has nearly no semblance of the original source material, how could the filmmakers and production executives think this movie would be a successful fan pleaser? And slap the title ""Birds of Prey"" on it. Why bother with the IP? Selling chocolate to someone who asked for carrots. Anyone out there who likes this movie... you're a duped sheep.* The only element of this movie that I fully enjoyed was the action scenes. They're fun. But that's not praising much because they were apparently among reshoots with an accomplished choreographer hired to enhance the movie's initial lack of action scenes.",Birds of Prey

792,ty_lattimore2007,No idea where to start,5,30 March 2020,"I saw the film earlier today and I am still processing my thoughts of it. Because of the coronavirus, the title was moved to VOD early. After trying 3 different occasions to see this film before this pandemic started, each time the universe prevented me from seeing this film. One time it was weather related. Other time, it was scheduling. Last time was because the projector at the theater broke. So I had to see Bad Boys for Life. Well, today I finally saw the film while being comfortable on my sofa at home. Maybe I expected too much. I liked Suicide Squad a lot and I am a comic book/movie fan. While the film is not terrible, it definitely was not great and barely even good. I am not sure what to say about the plot but this one was all over the place. The constant flashbacks became nauseating as well as the voice narration. Used sparingly they can move the story along, but these tools were overused the complete film. Margot Robbie is one of my favorite newer school actresses. She just did not capture the character the same way she did in the first film. She actually became irritating and boring. Not words ever used to describe Harley Quinn. It seemed like she was phoning in the performance. Ewan McGregor was awful. Period. Black Mask is not a well known villian to make us care. Not sure where they got this Huntess from but she can go back. She has been performed much better by the actress on the CW shows. I wanted to care about Cassandra Cain and her plight. But I wasn't at all invested. She was just irritating and we were not given any reason to be invested in her outcome. The only thing I can say that was good about the film was Jurnee Smollett. I have seen her in many films and shows, but nothing quite like this. Her Black Canary was different from past interpretations, not just because she is African American, but she has more nuances in her portrayal of the character. The audience is given some reason to root for her and be invested in her well being. I have not seen Rosie Perez in anything significant in awhile. She tries her best as Renee Montaya, but mostly fall flats. Knowing her reported back injuries from a tv show a few years back, I just kept grimacing every time she is throw into something. The stuntmen and woman definitely had alot to do in the film. There is quite a bit of action and its always good to see women kicking but on screen. Lastly, I wish there had been more references/ easter eggs to other notable Gotham residents. There is much more to Gotham than the Joker and Batman. But after watching this movie, I could be wrong.",Birds of Prey

That may be true, but only by a razor-thin margin.This movie tries way too hard to be cool in a very Deadpool-y way, but it's way more cringy than Deadpool. It's truly embarassing to think that this was made by adults, for adults.Every single character is annoying. The plorlt is needlessly complicated and some plot points make about zero sense. Full of jokes, and 98% of them are absolutely unfunny. Annoying overuse of well-known songs.

795,jp7570,"A hot mess, and not in the way you want it to be",1,19 August 2020,"Where do I begin? This movie was a WOMBAT - a Waste Of Money, Brains and Talent (or Time, depending on your perspective). The director was clearly over her head and needs more experience before helming a big-budget action film.The first error was not developing the supporting characters. Time was spent with the backstories for Huntress and Montoya, but virtually nothing for Black Canary. No explanation of her powers (how she got them, why she passes out when she uses them, etc.) That could have been handled in a 60-to-90 second montage.Second error? Unnecessary cuts back and forth in time (4 minutes? really??). This got old REAL fast and made no sense.Third error - voice-over narration. It is a good rule of thumb to be wary anytime a film uses this trope. Sure, in the right hands, it can be effective, but it usually is used when the writer or director doesn't know how to link scenes together.Fourth error was the lack of convincingly menacing villain. We know Ewan is a good actor, but the material just isn't there for him. And there is ZERO explanation as to why he decided to wear a mask in the final fight sequence? Everybody already knows his character's name. This just looked weird.The fifth error was the final fight sequence. Over-saturated colors in an amusement park. Holy 1960's Batman! I half expected to see the words BAM and POW superimposed on the screen, a la the old campy Batman television show.Finally, there is no credible explanation how any of the female leads (generally around 100 to 120 lbs) can effectively and consistently take down much larger male characters in hand-to-hand combat. I'm all for kick ass females, but please make it realistic.In the end, the writer and director delivered a sloppy mess of a third-rate DC character. It's time to retire Harley Quinn for good.",Birds of Prey
796,heyitskeane,Birds of Prey: Oh it's a not so fantabulous solo flick of Harley Quinn,4,16 February 2020,"Birds of Prey ... or is it 'Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey' now? The Harley Quinn movie? Yeah that works.Directed by Cathy Yan and starring Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor, it's ... not good. Now this is just an opinion. Not a fact. Some people liked this movie, some people didn't and most weren't bothered to watch it (evidently so).Cathy Yan did her best in directing the movie, it's not exactly a flaw there's nothing wrong with it. I suppose the good parts are Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor's performances. I will say, Black Mask/Roman Sionis was actually very well done. Possibly the best part of the movie (in my opinion).Other than that, there isn't much to say about positive aspects of the film. The writing was rather thin and dull. Most of the dialogue (other than some from Sionis) was disappointingly poor. A handful of the jokes landed, but the rest were honestly just throwaways. The plot was simple (not bad) but it was just dragged on and on throughout the movie and you eventually just want to get to the point.The first act was also rather slow and somewhat pointless. There wasn't much that contributed to the actual plot of the movie. Yes, they introduced all of the main characters in that bit of the movie. But even that was rather rushed. There are also some flashback sequences in the first act in attempt to weave all the character's narratives together but it was just messy and honestly disappointing. Throughout the entire first act, I felt that the movie was still trying to figure out exactly what kind of movie it really wanted to be before starting the second act. And that says a few things about the writing.Another aspect that disappointed was the action sequences. They were just not immersive or exciting (except for the 'big one' in the third act, some of that was alright). Most of them were somehow quite repetitive, if not boring. And having a slow-motion shot every now and then doesn't cut it.Finally, the rest of the characters. Oh, what a waste. Other than Harley and Roman, none of them have any sense of connection whatsoever. They're basically just there because the writing says so. They were just shallow and forgettable. The movie did attempt to add some substance to them with backstories and flashbacks, but there's no point in showing who they are if you don't get to know them at all.But then again, some people did enjoy this movie. Maybe others are taking it too seriously. Who's to say?",Birds of Prey
797,Sabaher,Exceeded my expectations by a mile,6,8 February 2020,"This movie is an absolute blast from beginning to end. It's very similar to Deadpool. Both have non-linear storytelling, they're irreverent, hyperactive, the lead character narrating the film and they both have meta-humor. The comparisons are fair, but this is not a ripoff of Deadpool. It has that same energy, but it does something different with it. Deadpool is a straight-forward revenge story told in non-linear fashion. This a lot more in common with Guy Ritchie's Lock Stock, Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. It has intersecting narratives dealing with a criminal underground with a MacGuffin the characters are trying to get all told comletley out of order. It's all very interesting and it keeps your mind engaged. It just feels like a fresh and interesting way to tell a story.Another great thing is the cast. The entire cast is a ton of fun. Two obvious standouts are Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor. Robbie gets to go full Harley Quinn. Of course you get the zany antics, her weird mind and how weridly she interprets the world around her. She gets in on the action and it makes for a ton of great action sequences. She also gets to amoat a lot more. You see the character there and not just the cartoon character. That was a really nice touch that they really made acharacter out of her. McGregor is just so flamboyantly fun yet terrifying at the same time. His character has quirks about how he wants the world to be around him which is so fun to watch while st the same time adds tension into all the scenes.This might have the best action of the entire DCEU. All of the actions sequences are both beautifully coreographed and shot. It can also be quite brutal. There's a lot of broken legs inside of the film. Harley Quinn is just destroying these guys by going for there knees and it's all very fun to watch. It can also be graphiccally violent. I'm so glad they went for an R rating.It's also really funny from beginning to end. It's being narrated by Harley Quinn so we're seeing all of this interpreted from her weird perspective. It just finds every single opportunity for a joke.The bad thing about the movie is that at times it can be a little confusing. With all of the time-jumping and non-linear storytelling I was way more confused than I should have been. This isn't really a big deal, but there are elements of that in the film.Second bad thing is that Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ella Jay Basco felt like the weak links in the cast. Almost everyone else is really good and for different reasons each of their performances felt a bit off. Basco felt like a younger actress. She's next to some people that are in the Oscar category and she just felt not quite in their league so her delivery wasn't as sharp. Winstead 's character is written to be a bit awkward inside of the story which is a bit of an excuse for this, but her acting for me just felt flat. There was a clever idea that they were doing with her that I just didn't find as convincing as I found everyone else.But those are very minor issues, but overall, this is a movie that I found incredibly enjoyable and absolutely blew my expectations out of the water.9/10 you should definetley go see this film.",Birds of Prey

801,StevieG338,Not awful and not great,1,9 February 2020,"There are two ways to look at the film - as a stand alone film or as a Harley Quinn film.Getting the latter out of the way, it's not a Harley Quinn film, nor is the awful Suicide Squad. This is a character loosely based on one of the most liked characters in DC comics. But that's not an issue as I don't believe it's meant to be the same character.As a stand alone film, it's ok. It's trying very hard to be Deadpool in many parts and falls flat at that.
It's also not all that fun though it tries desperately hard to be ""fun"" with the colours and sounds and attempted jokes throughout which in a lot of scenes back fires. Ewan McGregor is also not all that great in the film, it's hard to understand his motive, he seems to have a different motive in every scene.Warner Brothers has completely wasted their own properties with DC Films really, if they make a sequel to this how does it fit with Suicide Squad? Why would they make a sequel to either, the audiences didn't walk out screaming for more, nor or either memorable. Add this to the long list of poor, disconnected DC films, it's a mess.

Fight scenes are poorly executed, especially ones with Rosie Perez as she can barely move.

I was surprised whit characters like Huntress, Black Canary and Victor Zsaz.
The only character under my opinion that didn't have anything special funny or something like this is Cassandra Cain.
Margot Robbie is spectacular in his role as Harley Quinn.

805,PatoRonald,Everything that suicide squad wanted to be,7,18 February 2020,"The film has potential, but it does not take much risk, having a slightly slapstick humor that comes from the harlequin and that sometimes tries something more daring, and that sometimes it really succeeds. Something that bothered me in this film is its rhythm, which tries to appear electric and shaking, but I believe that the narration off is not a good way to speed things up. As for the characters ...
I liked everyone (maybe the hunter was a little off, but whatever)
I especially liked the villain, who in this film has much more personality than in his original material, Ewan Mcgrory is fantastic and manages to give his character unique ways. I didn't really like the ending, kind of anti-climatic.
Anyway, this film is everything that suicide squad tried to be, but in this film the fights are frantic and fantastic, the soundtracks are really used in a right way, it has a good villain, an ok script and, most importantly, it has a good montage, something very teen, something that is not enough to be boring and / or tiring, in addition to valuing your characters much more than suicide squad.
Even with several problems, it is still a great film and a positive step in relation to DC films in the cinema.

Margot is the only saving grace but even she forgot how to play this character a little and devolved into a slightly cooky long islander. None of the characters actions make any sense. The movie makes huge leaps in reasoning and logic. I didn't have high hopes and was still let down tremendously. Rosie Perez's character (along with nearly all characters) is pointless and 1 dimensional. If Euan Mcgrecgor ever takes his own life look to this movie for the seeds of failure based depression.

After the ginormous dumpster fire that is suicide squad, I did not plan on seeing this movie if it had any relation. A friend of mine actually dragged me to it, and I have a happy to say I was delightfully surprised.Not only was this nothing like suicide squad, but it made a 180 on the franchise. With a new director, writers, and much better plot, they actually tried on this one. With the oversaturation of superhero movies on our market today, it's really hard to make a winner. This did it for me.From beginning to end, this movie was so much fun. Margot Robbie please the perfect Harley Quinn, and it was a smart choice to make her the lead role. Because of the way they framed the trailers, I was worried it was another girl group ""feminist"" movie like Ghostbusters, but I was so wrong. It's Harley's story. It was a refreshing take on anti heros. It did what suicide squad tried to do but it actually succeeded and being entertaining and not problematic.The characters were well fleshed out, the plot was solid, the villains were captivating, the humor was balanced, it didn't pander to any kind of audience, and there was no major traditional Love story which is refreshing.I could not have been more surprised and more thrilled with the outcome of this movie, especially coming from a mentality of wanting to distance myself from this genre.If you have major doubts about this movie, you're justified.

828,oreddish,This was a bad movie and here's why,1,15 February 2020,I can't believe that this movie has such a high score right now. This movie was extremely hard to sit through.What was good:There was a beautifully choreographed scene when she finds a bat. Best part of the movie.There are some funny and fun scenes to be enjoyed.What was bad:The movie is split into 5 different stories. None of which are given time to develop.Too many soap opera overly dramatic scenes out of no where.Very anti man in general. Every decent person is female and every one is a man. So over the top.I could not believe how poorly written some of this movie was. There was quite often no explanation to the events occurring. Where did she get that motorcycle?!Every single fight scene had someone getting hit in the nuts. Every single one.The movie had no idea what it's tone was supposed to be at times during the beginning. It kinda wanted to split the baby between suicide squad and deadpool. It does come into its own toward the end.The worst part was they took Harley Quinn's character and made her into a caricature. She lacked depth.,Birds of Prey
829,dave-sc-30170,A great disappointment,4,16 February 2020,"I hoped so much that this movie would be good. The first half was just awful, silly, unpleasant and chaotic. Even if some people behind me in the movie theatre inexplicably laughed out loud at every predictable gag. The film later had a couple of scenes that were decent. More exciting, better told and underlaid with more serious music. Overall, however, I'm disappointed with what they made of Harley Quinn, who was amazing in and the only shining light of 'Suicide Squad'. I absolutely love Margot Robbie, but Birds of Prey is one of her weaker films.",Birds of Prey

If you're bored and have nothing to do then check around and make sure you absolutely have nothing to do and then if its still nothing then it'll be okay to spend that hour and 46 minutes.

Sorry fellas Harley isn't wearing a tube top & hot pants in this one (which is really why most of the reviews are bad) She's strong, independent & has an amazing story arch throughout the film. The supporting cast are all very strong & bring very different things to the table, in particular Black canary (omg she's actually black! Another reason the bigots trashed this movie)
The glitter/smoke gun scene in the police station is epic!!! A fun must watch, as long as you can handle seeing a female in charge who doesn't have her nipples showing in a wet t-shirt",Birds of Prey
835,briz_boy_10,A fun time.,7,2 December 2020,"I thought Suicide Squad was a decent movie. And so did many others including Jeremy Jahns until they saw the other critics reviews then hopped on the bandwagon of hate to make themselves seem more prestigious. One of the things i liked from SS was Margot robbie as Harlequinn, which i think most would agree.This is very much a harley quinn story so it feels a slight bit misleading to call it a BOP movie.
Anyhow, i enjoyed the movie for what it was. It was a fun, colourful themed movie with some good action sequences. Margot is a lot of fun as harley and to be fair i could watch her all day.The films plot is okay but doesnt make itself the forefront enough. There are little side bits going on at the same time which take away from the general idea of the movie.Understandably one of the main concerns at the moment in cinema is representation. Representation matters - we have all heard this and although its prominant message should be to be inclusive, i can understand some critics annoyance of the way men are
perceived in this movie. I think there may be one decent guy who 5 minutes later turns out to be a sellout. The rest are truly god awful. I take this with a pinch of salt however cos i imagine the purpose of the film is to show gang related scumbags and not the good side of gotham.I liked the style of the film. However, looking at an overall big picture its hard within the DCEU to see where this would fit. Its hard to imagine Batfelck or even Lex Luthor having a conversation with Ewans Black mask. Also little side note, there should have been a backstory to Cassandra - without this i have no idea why we're supposed to root for the little thief? Atleast make her a bit charismatic ot humourous maybe..! Also, Huntress is severely underused to the point she didnt really fit into this movie.The DCEU needs some serious work. However, i found this film to be a good overall fun themed
movie. Good action scenes and a standout peformance again by Margot Robbie.",Birds of Prey
836,chloeurc,Pros and Cons of Birds of Prey,8,25 January 2021,"A DC comic book movie about girl power in Gotham City? Um yes sign me up! Saw Birds of Prey last night, it was a cool movie, 8/10 for me. It had some pros and cons though:
(Minor spoilers)Pros:
Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, no one can play this role as good as she can! Like RDJ is to Iron Man this girl made this role HERS. She narrates the entire movie which was a cool touch.-The action, man the stunts in this movie are awesome! All the fight scenes and chasing cars on roller blades was directed and displayed amazingly. The other actresses seriously kick butt as well. It was reported that all the girls did the majority of their own stunts so props to them!Girl Power, this movie was directed by a female, written by another female and features a whole TEAM of females as the focus, something no comic book movie has done. As a female it was great to see some girl power represented, even if Harley Quinn isn't exactly the best role model.-The laughs and freaking Obi Wan as the villain! Ewan McGregor had some hilarious parts that made me laugh and yet he was so creepy as the villain, I thought the casting was great for him. The other girls including Harley Quinn had some funny moments although it was not as hilarious as Suicide Squad was.Cons:
The R rating, this movie isn't making a lot of money because the majority of Harley Quinn fans are young girls and this movie ISN'T for kids. A movie like the Joker deserved an R rating but this movie didn't and should of been PG-13. Throwing in F words and blood splatters doesn't mean you got more creative, if anything it made it look less intelligent.-The storyline, Harley Quinn narrates the film and then stops and realizes she's telling the story out of order in which the audience gets confused. In fact the plot is harder to follow than Suicide Squad in a sense that you don't really know what's going out because you watched scenes out of order.-The Birds, Black Canary, Huntress and the gang are not as cool as Harley Quinn and get overshadowed the whole film (Huntress had total potential but is hardly in the movie). The young teenager Cassandra Cain isn't a good actress and is really annoying, not very likable.-No Joker or Batman, okay I know a lot of people don't like Jared Leto as the Joker but he's mentioned like a hundred times in the film and yet never appears. Old shots of Suicide Squad are shown where you see the back of his head but never any new scenes. This decision to make them break up for good sucked for all those who wanted to see him as the Joker again and a slap in the face to Jared Leto. Also Batman is never shown or seen which doesn't quite make sense when Gotham needed him, but I guess the girls did take care of it!",Birds of Prey
837,ammoncrossette,"Terrible, forgettable, blah",4,31 March 2021,"Here's a few reasons why: number one is that this is a story that takes place in Gotham City, yet there's no Gotham in this movie at all. Generally the story is ok- not great, but ok. Casting is ok but all the headliners seem to be phoning it in. Supporting cast is great. Margo is meh, but that may be more the writing of her character and directing than how she's playing it. (Honestly I was never in love with her Harley to begin with so bare that in mind.) The haphazard action scenes around Quinn are pretty good, but they lack something I can't quite pinpoint- the narrative aspect of this film may be the biggest mistake holding it all back as it lacks the wit required to pull off this method of story telling- idk the charm just isn't there for me.Is it an anti-man anthem? Meh... if you want to read it that way I guess you could, but it's not over the top so. It does go from one cliche to another in that respect which really betrays the story and Quinn's character. Quinn is chaos and carefree, that's her thing- she is the female Joker. That's why they're a pair. However not in this movie. Here Harley is more of a secret mastermind, yet a mastermind of nothing really. It seems like the writers didn't have a solid concept of the character.Now, the fight scenes: okay, kinda cool, kinda bad-ass... But really contrived, mostly out of place and serve no purpose to the story or characters at all. It's like they just rummaged through a bunch of old comics looking for pictures to create fight scenes around and then forced them into a film they didn't want to write. There's not one moment of hazard to our main character, not really.In short there is nothing extra about this movie. It feels in every way like a movie a few friends made without any consideration of a larger audience. I could go in to spoilers but why? There's so little of this movie that feels fresher than an old sock already.Number one issue: this isn't Gotham in any way. It's a generic punk movie with zero character development and not much more plot.I've been writing this whole thing while in the back of my mind trying to remember the name of the main bad guy (actor) in this film. You know who he is. You might even think he's a great actor- and he has been at times. But honestly he and his character in this film are so insignificant that I can not recall his name. And really that's the feel of this whole experience.",Birds of Prey
838,archit-pal2,Not up to the expectations,10,8 February 2020,"I had high hopes for this movie, I thought this would be a unique type of movie but it didn't stood up to that expectation. But coming to the best part of this movie is Harley Quinn other characters are just touched in this movie. Action scenes were great, believe me they were superb. Also I think they didn't do justice to the Black Mask character, he is very powerful guy in comics but in this movie he is shown very weak and full of frustration. Black Canary was better than I expected.",Birds of Prey
839,schmoab,It's OK. Margot is wonderful.,6,10 February 2020,"This is kind of like a female version of the Joker movie, but not quite as interesting. Joker did something very different from most comic book movies in its structure because it was focused on character and not ""good vs evil"" plot with random object chasing. This one has a very typical Marvel-type plot where there is a bad guy who wants a diamond.The first third of the movie where we get a real introduction to Harley and she acts truly crazy was great. The middle third was ok. The end had some great action, but was also mostly just a beat em up ""grande finale"" that are so typical of these movies. I know Hollywood isn't usually willing to take a leap and switch this story. I was just hoping for something a little bit more interesting.I did have a hard time believing that a 100lb woman could kick the crap out of multiple 250 lb men. So it is basically a fantasy movie. And the fantasy is that women kick the crap out of men. It's not really subtle at all. It would have been more interesting to me if she had outsmarted them in some way. But instead they just present the story like an episode of the A-Team, where the crew punches out or shoots several hundred bad guys. Basically these women behave just like men in every action movie. They would be interchangeable with men.Overall a decent start to the franchise. Maybe the next one will take more chances.",Birds of Prey

841,onionbagel,SURPRISINGLY I Liked It!,9,8 February 2020,"*****Let me just get a technicality out of the way first: my actual score is 8.75*****Where to start with this movie...I think the best place to start is when it was announced; When Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) was first announced, I was 100% ON board! I thought ""Another Suicide Squad-esque movie with (Margot Robbie's) Harley Quinn!? Yes please!!!"" THEN, I started reading all this stuff about LGBTQ representation and was pretty much diving OFF board! Factor into all that how neither of the 2 trailers made the movie look good AND the (mostly) HORRIBLE soundtrack! All that being said, I was pleasantly surprised!I think the best way to describe this movie is ""DC's Deadpool""; I don't just mean they're both rated R comic book movies, but B.o.P. (like Deadpool) has a non-linear story (which is a personal pet peeve of mine and accounts for one missing star from my score).B.o.P. has lots of action (a lot of reviews claimed it was lacking in that department), (good) humor and it's nowhere near as political as a Disney movie (Captain Marvel, I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU)! As for the LGBTQ aspects of the movie: In the very beginning of the movie (in the animated intro.) there's a slot machine that shows both genders while Harley summarizes her love life; We find out that Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez) is lesbian only because Harley mentions it in narration; Although Ewan McGregor's Black Mask (the villain) is VERY flamboyant, neither he nor his second-hand-man Victor Zsasz (Chris Messina) ever kiss/have sex with other men/each other so I don't know what all the fuss about the villain(s) being gay/bisexual was about? The movie also has some subtle feminist undertones and a quick jab at ""rich white men"", but again, not nearly as blatant/nauseating as Cap. Marvel!As for the characters: I do agree with a lot of people that the movie focused too much on Harley simply because other awesome characters (Jurnee Smollet-Bell's Black Canary and Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Huntress) didn't get as much screen time as they deserved; however, it did set up for a sequel/sequels and within that setup, it righted what I thought was wrong with the movie/title (Harley's not a member of the B.o.P.).*****Side note regarding Black Canary: a lot of people thought it was dumb how she fainted after she did her shriek, but you learn she never uses it so it made sense to me; if you bottle up powers as opposed to using them all the time, it could affect you more.**********Side note regarding Harley: another thing people thought was dumb was Harley using non-lethal rounds at the police station, but (A.) she's not a completely horrible person (villain) and (B.) she was there to break someone out NOT slaughter a bunch of cops!?*****In summary, if you like Deadpool and/or Suicide Squad (and you're okay with female-led movies that aren't necessarily ""feminist""), you'll probably like this movie. Is it a movie you watch for plot (Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice, The Dark Knight trilogy, Watchmen, etc.) no, but it's VERY entertaining!PS - the missing, unaccounted for .25 star is for the SUBTLE agendas the movie has buried beneath the surface; it they were more blatant, this review would be A LOT different!",Birds of Prey

Those are clearly marvel girls and marvel manchilds who hate everything from DC/DCEU! It is so obviously they are here just to rate this movie 1 star even if they haven't seen the movie!

Don't forget it's a comic book movie and tc anyone who is familiar with DC would know that's her superpower.Definitely check it out. I was pleasantly surprised. I knew it could be a train wreck or great. I thought it delivered. Not horrible girl power cliches like in Charles Angles!!! This movie held it's own.

It is honestly one of the best pieces of cinema I have ever seen it just completely blew me away no matter what was going on + it has the 2nd best soundtrack I have ever heard in a film in my opinion just getting beat out by Speed Racers terrific score! To finally end this review I just have to give massive credit to Margot Robbie and gang, especially to her because she isn't Margot Robbie in the movie.

She wasn't bad but she wasn't all that, more flat but I guess everybody is entitled to their opinions.Bottom line: If you are looking for a movie that has quirkiness, think Looney Toons, and you can take a joke and are not looking for some overly inflated Oscar Chariots of Fire type movie, give it a shot and you will be impressed.Yes there is an underlying message but in a world where women can stand up to the Harvey Weinstein of the world, you are going to see these dogs and if you don't like it well then your probably a Harvey Weinstein yourself.Give it a chance you won't be disappointed unless I guess your a die hard comic person then get over it and make your own movie, until then calm down and stop tagging on this movie.",Birds of Prey

I was really excited to see it and generally wanted to like it but that turned out to be almost impossible. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is still an amazing casting choice but the character of Harley Quinn is bland in this movie. The plot is simplistic but for some reason made way too complicated. The pacing is fast but weird and messy and not in a fantabulous way. Certain characters have a really exciting backstory but than it quickly turns into bland uninspiring character development. The movie still has entertaining and funny moments and if you are looking to watch something and turn your brain off , this is the movie for you !",Birds of Prey
851,roujin_d,"I never read the comics, so I review this as a stand-alone movie.",6,14 June 2021,"I think the main issue with this movie is the script. It's all over the place, it kind of makes sense when you realize it's being told from Harley's perspective but that doesn't make it good.The action sequences felt a bit too clean and choreographed for my taste, it's like watching a ballet performance.I never felt any connection with the characters. And I never had the feeling they were in any real danger.Although I'm no expert on editing, there was one scene that I think goofed up a little. I'm not sure if that was the editor's fault, the director's or simply because of budgetary reasons but it screwed up the flow of the scene to the extent that I feel like including it in my review.Then there was a scene where Black Canary showed some true super power level stuff but it felt extremely out of place with the rest of the film. In the cut that I saw it was never explained either, it just came out of nowhere.I personally didn't like the art style, but other reviewers claimed they liked it so that must just be me then.Other reviewers have also stated that this R rated movie seems more targeted at young teenage girls, and I completely agree. The rating seems out of place with the target audience. Comparing this to a female version of Deadpool kind of makes sense, however it's not nearly as funny.

Go see it yourself and make up your own mind! Having said that...I really enjoyed this movie. I thought that the action in this movie was executed very well and the color palette was used to its full potential. I love that DC is shifting away from trying to be a carbon copy of the MCU and is now focused on being the alternative. Hard R. Villain-centric. Letting their directors put their own stamp on every movie.Margot Robbie cements herself as the Harley Quinn of this generation. She's funny, vicious and walks the anti-hero line with grace. Ewen McGregor chews up every scene that he's in. A pure adaptation of Black Mask? Nah. An entertaining take on the character? You betcha. The cast top to bottom is great and I hope we get the chance for a follow-up in the future.Some of the storytelling is messy. There's an abundance of narration that sometimes works but other times feels like a shot of nitro to revealing exposition. The timeline jumps around a bit but telling this story linearly would take away its iniquity and make it feel like every other comic book movie.Overall, I give it an 8 but I bumped it up to 9 to counter the trolls trying to trash this movie for not being the movie that makes them feel better about themselves.",Birds of Prey

The mixture of the R rating and cartoonish tone do it wonders and Margot Robbie continues to be fantastic as Harley.This is the sort of movie Suicide Squad should have been the first time around, if they were wanting to go down the comedy route, and it gives me confidence that the reboot will be significantly better.So, whilst not perfect and not quite as good as Wonder Woman when it comes to the DCEU, it's still one of their better movies.

Margot Robbie did a great job. But the rest of the characters are just boring. I really feel that Ewan McGregor was wasted in this movie since he's capable of doing more than he did in this movie. His character of Black Mask is largely wasted in this movie and acts like the typical villain. Also I think the swearing was overdone. Almost every line in this movie has someone saying the F word basically which I attribute to bad writing because it felt so misplaced it made me cringe throughout the movie.Overall I'd give it a 5/10. It definitely could have been better though and did feel dissapointing.,Birds of Prey

865,anuraagt,"Awful all around, despite another strong Margot Robbie performance",1,12 August 2021,"Robbie is always entertaining, and brings charisma and scene-stealing energy to her work, but her portrayal in this fell so far short of Suicide Squad 2016 that I'm just flabbergasted. Gone is that rich Long Island accent, the garish and vulgar persona, all of the evil charm that made the 2016 character so memorable. This one's watered down, uninteresting, dull. Such a shame, considering that they already had a rich foundation to build on.The movie doesn't lack for Hollywood production values, great colours and sets, great costumes, but it's just so poorly made - the director fails thoroughly to extract any nuance, any essence, any truth from her scenes, it plays so flat, so uninventive, so boringly. A movie you can watch half-asleep and not miss a thing. She tries to do a sort of Guy Richie in cuts and style, and flashbacks, with layered stories, but just doesn't pull it off. It's just hackneyed, dull, very mediocre work.And to believe that this was meant to have an overtly political message! Just unbelievable. There's zero politics in the movie, there's no structure to it to suggest anything relatable or insightful, that could possibly draw the audience in. In contrast, even the most commercial Hollywood movies are able to rise to the level of philosophical and emotional essay, where they connect with deep and resonant human ideas or themes. This movie never hits a single high point of any kind. Just awful!Inexplicable that it has 6 stars on IMDb, deserves at best a 5, so giving it a 1 to help offset the nonsensical reviews it seems to have gotten. I just wonder if having a female director, screenwriter and protagonists is enough for some to justify its entertainment value, simply the political symbolism of that arrangement. Not for me - there are remarkable female writers and directors out there, who deserve to be recognised for their work and not because of their gender. In this case, the team disappoints thoroughly, and fails to make a statement of any kind, good or bad.",Birds of Prey

The guy was delightfully psycho.There are some choppy bit like repetition on some stuffs but I can overlook that because the characters are delightful and interesting. Huntress definitely stand out from the other girls. Next to that is Black Canary and the lil kid. The Policewoman was kinda boring (sorry to say).Overall it is a good watch.

882,mikekisil,Leave real-life at the door and just go with the flow !!,7,18 February 2020,"This film just goes to show that Gotham City is one helluva' town. What a great start to a potential franchise !! Action-packed,full of crazy stunt work,as colourful as the comic book pages that these characters have sprung from - this is the crazy movie that should have been the flip side to Wonder Woman. Margot Robbie,the producer,shows she has the chops once more to put together a crowd-pleaser. Margot Robbie,the actress, shows yet another side to her talents - she's done serious, now she can do comic edginess. Could she ever play a comedy role? Her timing here and the way she breaks through the fourth wall implies that that step is not too far away.
As for the director/writer team of Cathy Yan and Christina Hodgson,Yan shows that for a second film she is a capable director of action and Hodson shows that she is well-tuned into the fantastical DC universe - her work on ""Bumblebee"" showed she could bring to life cartoon characters into a modern setting.
As for the cast, Robbie is good,Smollett surprisingly so, Winstead's part is a little underwritten for an actress of her pedigree,Cass is an interesting newcomer with an ability to hold her own amidst her elders,Perez can do little with a stereotype role of a capable female detective disdained by her male colleagues. It is the villains that are the let down here. If Messina's Victor Zsasz had been the main villain and McGregor's Sionis his sidekick, then the balance between the goodies and the baddies would have been a bit more horizontal. As it is, the audience doesn't get the truly psychotic showdown that the film is gasping for. Still, if there is a next film, then, maybe, Robbie, the producer,will address this and the film will get 9* from me.
One last thing, I'm assuming that Weta Digital was responsible for creating the Hyena. If not,and he/she is for real, then Robbie needs to sign he/she up right now !!!",Birds of Prey
883,chrisgavidia,Robbie shines as Harley Quinn,9,2 March 2020,Margot Robbie is tremendous as Harley Quinn. Every scene she is it's a fun time.

884,darrylinnes-30541,Dreadful,1,12 February 2021,I thought Suicide Squad was bad but this is even worse. One of the most dreadful films I've ever seen.,Birds of Prey
885,ronaldosievert,"Worst big blockbuster since ""Venom""",3,6 February 2020,"""Birds of Prey"" was directed by Cathy Yan, starring Margot Robbie, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ewan McGregor. After Harley Quinn and the Joker have split up, she joins forces with The Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya in order to save a young pickpocket who stole a diamond from Black Mask.This is Yan's first big feature film and some of the action is actually well choreographed. Unfortunately that's pretty much all the praise I can give the movie. The action is not horribly edited, however it gets very repetitive very quickly and is simply unnecessary violent.After Todd Phillips' ""Joker"" grossed over one billion dollars at the box office and was nominated for eleven academy awards (most likely winning 2 or more on Sunday) it was obvious for DC to create an R-Rated Universe that is more suited for adults as an equivalent to Marvel's MCU. The problem about Birds of Prey is that it doesn't understand why the gruesome depiction of violence and the controversy about the movie worked for Joker.Whether you liked Joker or not it was safe to say that Birds of Prey was highly unlikely to be able to hold up to Joker's hype and its themes about a descent into madness. As a result I went in with quite low expectations, because this movie was being dumped in February most likely with the intention to have its opening weekend overlap with Oscar night and therefore generating as much hype as possible for DC after Joaquin Phoenix's performance in Joker is going to win Best Actor.Even though I kept my expectations low I was left disappointed with almost every decision of the movie. There is a scene in the first ten minutes of the movie where Harley Quinn jumps on someone else's legs, breaking them. That was the moment I was done and the first of many moments to come that left me shaking my head. The direction, the cinematography and the editing definitely had their moments during some action scenes. The score is decent and the performances are alright, but could have been better if it weren't for very poor writing. The screenplay is neither funny nor is it refreshing or entertaining.I could go on and on about how much I despise this movie and how much it blatantly failed to match Scorsese's influence on the Joker movie and at one point even calling the villain ""The Godfather"", absolutely disgusting. I would not recommend this movie to anybody.",Birds of Prey

You can't base the entire film out of a political ideology and give it no more to lean on.What we have here is a generic and even nonsense ""kinda comic action movie"" with some decent features just as the action choreography and cinematography, but
with mayor weaknesses, those being the plot, the lack of characters development, the events and the whole idea of the movie itself.While it's not a boring flick per se, it fails to pull out any kind of interest out of the spectator. You'll be pretty much watching some generic bad guys being beaten in the most stylish ways, decorated with the most cliché and predictable elements you could imagine for an action movie.
The plot, seems to lack of real effort spent because it's all over the place. The main villain? It couldn't be more goofy and generic. The events? Some scenes and characters actions are inexplicable or nonsense, even for this kind of movie. There's nothing really captivating about all of it.As I said, there are some positive point here and there. The acting is mostly good and so is the visual presentation overall. This includes the action choreography sequences, which are well done.So well, it will probably be a major disappointment if you sit through it expecting to watch a decent movie.",Birds of Prey

I hope more people will check this one out with an open mind. Just turn the old brainpan off, and enjoy.",Birds of Prey
889,maxwelloreocookie,Just Fun. Good if you don't take it too seriously.,7,14 February 2020,"Honestly surprised, wasn't as bad as I thought it would be and as I hear most people online saying.Obviously Margot Robbie is the star and the most entertaining in the whole movie. I found her kinda annoying in Suicide Squad and a little cringe, but she's much better here. I don't get why it's called Birds of Prey when this is mainly Harley's story.The other main girls are okay, but don't get much development. My fav out of them was Huntress, it's not often you see a badass who's also socially awkward, so that was fresh. But sorry, that little Asian girl playing Cassandra Cain was horrible and pretty bad actress. I know it's just a child, but still. Millions of dollars go into movies like this, so they should've gotten a better child actress, looks like they just pick some random little girl from off the street. She's also supposed to be future Batgirl. I think they should've went with a better and more fit child actress. She should've been like Hit Girl from Kick-Ass, flipping around, stabbing people, and being badass. I also just wasn't buying the relationship between Harley and Cassandra because it wasn't developed well and the Cassandra actress is terrible. I actually wanted that to be better than it was.The action and fight scenes were one of the best parts of the movie. Huge upgrade from the action scenes in Suicide Squad. Most the action scenes are amazing, and it was because the fight choreographer of John Wick did them. I heard the director of this movie was relatively new and didn't know how to do action, so they had to get another director just for the action scenes. But there is one mediocre fight scene that stuck out like a sore thumb, and it's obvious the John Wick choreographer wasn't present for that one. That one fight looks almost straight out of old-school Adam West Batman, without the cartoon exclamation effects.I'm not familiar with the comics, but I liked the villain of Black Mask, but that's mainly due to the actor. It's freakin' Obi-Wan Kenobi, one of the most underrated actors in the mainstream. He isn't given much to work with though, but he always elevates what's he has to work with. But his climatic end fight was super underwhelming. I mean, it's Obi-Wan Kenobi, so he could've obviously had a final sword fight with Harley, that would've been epic. I even hear from comic fans he's a master swordsman, yet they didn't use that at all in the movie. That was a huge wasted opportunity.Ewan Mcgregor plays an over-the-top misogynist. I heard some people complain about the feminism in this movie, but I didn't think it was too much. It really wasn't too noticeable. There was only one real scene where Black Mask forces a girl to take her dress off, and it just feels so out-of-place. It was just randomly there for ""muh feminism,"" but he's the bad guy, so you're supposed to hate him anyway, but still.Also one of the last fight scenes where all the main girls overpower like 100s of dudes in a fight scene. That's where it took my suspension of disbelief too far. Plus what happened to all their guns? That scene would've been better and more believable if the girls were strategic about it and had more of a plan, maybe split up at some point. Plus it's Harley's hideout, so the movie should've showed Harley using her brain and taking advantage of having the home court. Would've been way better and logical if the girls use their brains somehow to realistically overpower those huge hordes of henchmen, rather them all just running and gunning everyone and actually winning unrealistically that way. And would've been a way better way of showing female empowerment, rather than it coming off forced when 5 women all beating the crap out of 100s of dudes with guns blazing with no strategy. It also doesn't help that this is the worst fight scene in the movie, the only one with bad choreography that I was talking about earlier.It's still just a fun entertaining movie that I wouldn't take too seriously. I think it could've been way better, but it is what it is. It's just I think Margot Robbie is an amazing actress and deserves better, but this movie was still passable.",Birds of Prey
890,tayangangambar,Nice build up to Harley Quinn & her gang,7,7 February 2020,"This is a nice comic book movie with great action and humor. The story line and script was good and the fight sequences were enjoyable. Although some of the story line seem rushed and convenient, it is forgivable due to the time constraints.Margot Robbie was top notch in this movie with great humor, narration, controlled madness and great action choreography delivery. It would have been easy to go over-the-top and over-act, but she did a really good job making the character likeable.Although the movie is ultra-feminist and male-bashing, it fits the movie theme as it is like how Harley Quinn would see the world after being abused, abandoned and gone-mad by the chauvinistic and selfish Joker.In terms of the action, it was really good, fluid and sleek. But I wished it more to John Wick's level of action cinematography, editing and sound effects, which would have made it perfect. Margot Robbie and Mary Elizabeth Winstead seems to express the action scenes well, but Jurnee Smollett-Bell actions fighting shots seem poorly framed, edited and choreographed which made it look amateurish. Not too sure whether she was not as prepared or not, but this should have been able to be compensated with camera and editing master craft.In terms of the acting, all was well done, but when the ladies get together, there seem to a lack of chemistry or bonding, which made it feel a bit awkward. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was serious and less expressive while Rosie Perez, at times, looked out of place, probably due to lack of character development or poor transition from cop to vigilante. Ewan Mcgregor did not seem the most fitting for his role in this movie to me, but I might be biased (type-casting) by his previous movie/series roles I have watched.Overall, I would recommended for you to watch it in the cinema now.",Birds of Prey

Especially for the audience without any background, it is difficult to quickly accept and understand the plot.
Finally, there was a DC film about the Women 's League, where the characters were pale, simple and without connotation. As for the cooperation of the female protagonists behind, it is simply casual and childish.
In addition to these, the movie music is pretty good, and if you don't ask for a deep and meaningful story, the plot is quite crazy, refreshing and personal.

And apparently, a lot of sad boys get their fee-fees hurt anytime when a movie is obviously paying tribute to anything that's non-white male establishment.Don't get me wrong-I'm a longtime fan of decades of awesome ""white guy"" actioners. But certainly we can have a world that's big enough to accommodate other points of view without it automatically being ""politically correct"". Breaking out of the mold does not destroy a film's merit just because women, POC, non-binary gendered folk etc are featured in roles that have traditionally been for white dudes.That being said, I enjoyed this movie. Margot is awesome, and there's something I really like about Mary Elizabeth Winstead. The set dressing was phenomenal, as was the soundtrack and music supervision. All and all, a lot of fun.

Harley-Quinn is just not a compelling character. I understand some people will like it. Because it is mindless fun.

John Wick is compelling because we can empathize with John after losing his dog.
Is this movie very funny like Deadpool, or had some emotional depth where we can empathize with the main character.It has neither.
This movie was made by people who didn't really know how to make it funny or compelling, without tossing in misogyny to blow up some controversy for marketing. I don't care that all the men are bad in the story, and they are! At least make something deeply likeable and endeering about Harley.....which they didn't do. Because Harley is a meme and a trope. She is a sidekick.It's easy to make a 30 min short story with Harley. If it's silly funny and action packed. But 90 minutes of tropes just doesn't have enough meat to fill the burger.

DC is not constrained by ratings and are trying to appeal to an adult audience (like Joker before), but will probably suffer in the end. I have to say this one satisfied.

But in this case evey single female charakter is stong and heroic and every single male charakter is evil and weak.

912,jcsallows,I loved this movie,8,9 February 2020,"I'm trying to figure out where all the hate is coming from because I'm shocked at how some people are viewing this movie. I understand that people may have felt burned by Suicide Squad (I personally wasn't hyped for that movie and - like previous DC movies it was a hot mess of very good and very bad things) and I will say that if you hated Suicide Squad with a passion (for whatever reasons) that you probably won't like this movie. Fortunately, one good thing that came out of Suicide Squad was Margot Robbie's portrayal of Harley Quinn which is so spot on and comics accurate it's a pure pleasure to watch onscreen. That same performance and visual presence continues through this movie and really leans on Margot's amazing acting abilities by telling her own story, her own way. This is what you're signing up for.Even though the story isn't the greatest it's so Harley Quinn that I can't help but love it. Watching this movie felt like an R-rated, modern spin-off episode of Batman the Animated Series with a focus on Harley instead of Batman or his other villains. Much like Suicide Squad, the greatest element of this movie are the actors and characters. You could easily argue that the other ""Birds"" were underdeveloped but you'd be kidding yourself if you think we won't see them again; this movie makes me want to see this version of Huntress or Black Canary in more DC movies - there's so much potential with those actresses and characters in the DC-Universe. Give me more!I do have some minor criticisms. I think they went a little too real with the outfits. Harley looked amazing in every shot but Black Canary and Huntress looked too much like common, generic street thugs. Hopefully by the next movie they look much closer to their comic book interpretations. I think some people are also complaining about what they did with Black Mask's lore and honestly, he's not the greatest Batman villain so I'm glad they tweaked his characterization with Ewan Mcgregor's amazing performance. The action sequences also felt inconsistent but not as bad as I thought they would be since I knew there were re-shoots. I think if every fight scene felt like John Wick but with a badass, female, DC hero/anti-villian instead of Keanu, nobody would be complaining.Lastly, I think there are some criticisms that are just ridiculous and feel like I have to address. Is this movie anti-male in order to be pro-female? No. I personally think the movie handled its feminist commentary well but others, obviously, disagree. Although these girls kick ass they are far from perfect (no Mary Sues here) and even comment, repeatedly, how nobody likes Harley (but the audience I was in was laughing with Harley the whole time). Does this movie have poor editing? It's either a love it or hate it situation. It's a matter of taste. The editing in this movie is better than Suicide Squad but more disjointed than your common action movie. As I said in the beginning, if you understand Harley as a character, you'll better understand what you're signing up for before watching this movie.Thanks for reading. 8/10 - I loved this movie.",Birds of Prey

Harley has long been one of my favorite DC universe characters, and Margot Robbie portrayed her well. The violence was first rate, Leto was nowhere to be seen, and the entire cast had good chemistry. What more could anyone ask for in a Suicide Squad sequel?Was the plot intricate and awe inspiring? No, of course not. This is a DC movie, after all. But it had a decent, simple story and carried it out well. There wasn't so much as a single eye-roll inspiring ""twist,"" like, for example, having enemies stop fighting each other and start working together because their moms have the same name. So, that's good.Basically, if you like action comedies and want to leave the theater with a silly grin on your face, give it a shot.

With some great movies such as Wonder Woman and Shazam!, they've hit a new height. A big reason for this is Margot Robbie's performance as Harley Quinn. She encapsulates the character brilliantly, switching from slightly depressed to absolutely crazy on a dime. The pacing is kinda all over the place, and while that's usually not a good thing, it fits this movie and the tone perfectly. The film also oozes style and contains some frantic editing, which again, fits right in.Ewan McGregor as Roman Sionis, aka the Black Hood, is the best villain of the DCEU so far. He's charismatic but menacing and you're never quite sure what he's going to do next. I got basically everything I wanted from this movie. Humour, great action sequences, very nice cinematography, costumes and production design. It's as in your face as a Harley Quinn movie should be.

My favourite secondary characters is Black Canary because is the only one whose life is not entirely narrate by Harley, it's more more subtle so you can understand her by actions, i didn't like what they done with Cassandra Cain i whis they had given her another name. in short, I wish this would have been a Harley Quinn movie and her emancipation focusing on it and we would watch the rest of the characters through the interaction with Harley and reserve the Birds of Prey team up for sequel delving into these characters (Black Canary, Huntress and Renee) because here they feel so secondary... the name of the movie is in the epilogue mentioned in the worst possible way, narrated quickly by Harley.",Birds of Prey

She fully embraced the anarchy of Harley Quinn and isn't just eye candy like in suicide squad. Also the action is colorful and fun. The humor from Harley Quinn mostly worked.Unfortunately everything else is very one note and bad, namely the awful plot. I'd argue that this movies story is even worse than suicide squad. It's so disposable and cliche, it's about a power hungry villain wanting a diamond stolen from a thief. All the other characters are either redundant or pointless. Black mask is just another angry rich jerk, the thief kid is laughably underdeveloped, and huntress feel like she belongs in a different movie. Lastly, this didn't really need to be a birds of prey movie, they don't team up until the very end and it felt awkward and forced.I wanted to like this from the interesting trailer, but it's very underwhelming.",Birds of Prey

By the end, I had enjoyed myself and while it was a little too much on the 'women good - men bad' train that seems to be going around these days, it was tolerable. My biggest gripe with the film was even bothering to include Birds of Prey in the title, the movie should simply have been called the Emancipation of Harley Quinn. The phrase 'Birds of Prey' only comes into it at the very end of the movie and even then it is nothing more than a throw away line, not even enough to set up a stand-alone Birds of Prey movie, not that I could see much of a demand for one.But the movie is fun, a great afternoon filler at matinée or cheapie Tuesday prices.

I did not want to believe the Birds of Prey is as bad as people say.I just watched half of it on HBO Max and I decided to just turned it off and maybe finish it later when I'm mentally ready, it's that bad.Ok... it has it's moments here and there, and I like Margot Robbie, and there are some interesting fighting scenes. However, the story is just very empty, comic inspired movies doesn't have to be bad! Look at Deadpool and most of the Marvel movies...It's hard to engage with the charactersThe acting is not goodThe story telling is strange but predictableThe action is slow most of the time and just look rehearsed that you'll see the bad guy #1 just fake being busy waiting on the side until bad guy #2 falls on the ground so he can then jump on Harley Quinn... it was painful to watch that.As an asian woman, I really want to support a young asian female director and the majority female cast... but this is so beyond disappointing to me sadly.I gave this a 5 stars, 2 1/2 for Margot and the 2 1/2 for the production crew for all the hard work.",Birds of Prey
934,viktorsavic,Great just how I've expected,9,11 February 2020,"Considering Suicide Squad is my most favorite movie ever made, I was really looking forward this movie to come out! I adore Margot Robbie and especially this role of Harley Queen. She really has that crazy but sexy vibe like that character should be. Birds of prey has great action scenes and one funny story and the most important thing is that while I was watching this movie, there wasn't one single moment when I've wondered like: ""Oh, when is this movie gonna end?"" This stuff really keeps attention from beginning to the end! 9 stars only because it always can be more good and there are really rarely perfect perfect movies. 😂",Birds of Prey
935,zhenwenho,Just watch for the action scenes,6,11 February 2020,"So what once was a Bird of Prey centered title for the film, after a certain rebranding by WB today, the title suggests that this is a Harley Quinn centered film rather than a team up which is indeed rightfully so. This movie completely centers around Harley Quinn and the team up is left until the final huge fight scene in the movie. So, basically the movie is about Black Mask trying to obtain a diamond from a child whom stole it from him and Harley Quinn becoming a lone wolf rather than having to rely on the Joker and that's about it.
First off, I must praise the main actress, Margot Robbie I think she is amazing as Harley Quinn which indeed is true as the best part of Suicide Squad was her performance. I'm here to say that she brings the psycho to the table and delivers a really good performance here. Other than that, Ewan Mcgregor's performance was fun for the most part of the film but I feel that his performance was let down by the writing department whom failed to really bring his character to life as his character is so one-dimensional and in the end he's just a douchebag without any real reason.
And of course, the best part of the movie, the fight scenes whereby they had the John Wick team to assist them with the fight choreography and it does absolutely show in the movie. The police heist vent that takes place within the movie is absolutely spectacular and just all around gorgeous to look at. It is literally bursting with colour which brings about quite a spectacle when you think about bringing a gymnastic sort of character to a fight scene with vibrant colours.
The problem I have with this movie is that the plot is nothing too amazing, but, the movie is plot driven and that's a problem right there. The side characters, well, I've never read the comics or what not but basically the others excluding Harley herself don't really have enough character building for you to really feel or like them. The pacing of the movie is also another issue I had with it whereby the movie tried to formulate the Deadpool-isc time jump that they had going on in the first movie and it didn't really go out that well as the time jumps are at often used to introduce a side character's backstory or well it takes you from a cool scene in which the case would be the bank heist scene whereby they just stopped the momentum of the scene and cut back to a time before, which is yet another issue I had because the best part of the movie is indeed the fight scenes.
All in all, this is an enjoyable film and well, I went into this movie with no expectations whatsoever so, I didn't experience the joyful disappointment of Justice League. But yes, this movie has a few issues with it but hey, props to those intending to do something wacky, but just seriously, at the same time do think of the movie's pacing, that's really important.",Birds of Prey
936,gwsteinmetz,Okay,5,14 April 2020,"This movie tried too hard.Margot Robbie was good as the titular Harley Quinn and I wouldn't be mad if I got to see more movies with her as that character. Ewan Mcgregor was really hamming it up as Black Mask and it's not his performance I hate, it's how they write him, man did they make him horrible in this movie. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was good and the character was also well-done. The action in the last 20 minutes was also very good and fun.Now time for me to say mean things, first, since I already touched on it, I hated Black Mask in this movie. He was just so badly written and his death was equally horrible. Also this movie rips off Deadpool in a couple ways, one being Harley narrating the movie, it worked in Deadpool because it was Deadpool narrating Deadpool, but in this it's it Harley Quinn narrating a Birds of Prey movie. Also the part where the characters team up was extremely sudden and it felt very jarring for me and didn't work. Also a dash of bad CGI doesn't hurt, right?

953,Lokisgodhi,Disappointing. Very disappointing.,4,16 April 2020,"I'm a big fan of the DC live action films. I think Leto's Joker in Suicide Squad was a brilliant updating of the tired and cliched portrayals of the character, which in previous incarnations was stuck in the 1940s. Margo Robbie's portrayal of Harley Quinn in this movie and in Suicide Squad is the epitome of the character. Unfortunately, in this film, that's where it ends.The casting of the other major characters is uninspired. The Arrowverse managed to cast three actresses in the role of Black Canary who created more compelling versions of this DC character. The Arrowverse cast a more compelling Helena Bertinelli. Gotham cast a more compelling Victor Zsasz.My guess as for these casting failures is that they were deliberately down casting these characters in an attempt to not outshine Margot Robbie and portray her as the clear and unambiguous lead. This turned out to be a major mistake. Robbie clearly needs quality first string actors to act off.The story line is okay but flawed. It operates on a false premise. That villains with an axe to grind would go after Harley Quinn for revenge if she broke up with the Joker. I have a hard time believing no villain was smart enough to have asked themselves this question: What if I kill Harley Quinn and then the always unpredictable Joker changes his mind and decides that Harley Quinn was the love of his life?The answer is, of course, there isn't likely any place on Earth far enough away for them to hide from a Joker seeking vengeance.Suicide Squad worked because Harley Quinn was part of an ensemble of significant villains, some played by significant actors. Bird of Prey falls flat because in it doesn't put her in with such an ensemble.Better luck next time.",Birds of Prey

I had to give it a 10,10,16 September 2020,"Firstly, if you haven't seen this yet, but partied your way through the first ""Kick Arse"" movie, watch this ASAP.During Suicide Squad, as a man, I was somewhat distracted by Harley Quinn's outfit..... etc. I must admit that I came here, expecting something similar. This time though, none of the women were overtly sexualised, and that was a good choice.What was presented was a fun filled carnival ride of over the top action and girl power fun. There were so many whoooo laughter moments, and smart arse dialogue, that ramped up to a crescendo. The imagined scenery was fantastic, perfectly suited to the comic strip story, and the final battle was played out in the perfect arena.For those that can't accept female heroines beating up on male villains..... grow up and get over it.

959,chewitt-99762,Not all men are BAD!,4,9 July 2020,"I was once excited for this movie up until I was told that it was a feminist movie. Don't get me wrong there were good scenes in this film, but it fails when it's trying to make a statement that all men are total a-holes. Why does it have to be that way? Why can't it just be a COMIC movie and not some film trying to ""make"" a point. Other problems outside of Harley Quinn herself is the fact that casting choices for comic book characters are just lousy in the DCEU. No one other than Harley looks like their Comic counterpart and one in particular felt like a complete waste of time. I'm referring to the actress who will eventually become The Question. She was the character I hated most in this film for being unnecessary and a complete waste. Huntress has no character whatsoever other than being awkward and bland. Black Canary was decent but could have been better. As for the girl who will become Batgirl she didn't need to be such a brat. Actions scenes are great, rating this movie R was odd because it never felt like it and the title was very misleading since they don't become the Birds of Prey until the end of the film (they don't look great in their ""costumes""). Black mask was terrific as well as Harley Quinn. Give it a shot if you're interested in feminism other than that it's just another one and done film.",Birds of Prey

It portrayed the grittiness of Gotham city way better than other DC films and the fighting scenes were incredibly directed and a visual master piece! This film was brilliant from start to end and had the same chaotic energy and excitement as what a good Harley Quinn film should be(the version of her in suicide squad was a pathetic attempt which was far too focused on the male gaze and had no substance what so ever!!). Sure, the black mask could have been more menacing but considering how many other villains there were, I don't think it's that huge of a deal in the grand scheme of the film. From the writing to the directing, to the brilliant soundtrack and cast, this film outdid my expectations!P.s I feel like the sort of people who HATED this film take themselves and their opinions waaay more seriously than this film takes itself (we all know the sort of people I'm talking about here)!",Birds of Prey

The story is ludicrous and small and just involving. Most of the many characters are thoroughly annoying - and I include Robbie as Quinn whose face pulling just irritates - and the result of that is that you don't really care what happens to any of them.The fight sequences are silly and poorly stages. I think they are supposed to amuse but the stupidity of having one crazy unarmed woman fight off several large men with guns is just stupid.

968,harrisonwelshsfs,"some potential, mostly disappointing",4,19 February 2020,"Birds of Prey is alright. It is functional in its technical aspects, has enough energy to be entertaining and has some legitimately great action choreography that is well shot. Unfortunately, the story is tired, the characters are underdeveloped, the thematic messaging weak and the tone muddled.The once untouchable Harley Quinn now has a target on her back after breaking up with The Joker. The story is narrated non-linearly by Harley which helps to keep the pace moving along and distracts the audience from the over done story that basically boils down to, get the thing before the bad guys. As is often the case with narration in film it adds very little to the movie, for the most part telling the audience information which we could already figure out for ourselves. This might be excusable in a film like Deadpool where the fourth wall breaking, self-aware nature is a part of the character or in a children's film. But here it is unnecessary and feels like the filmmakers are talking down to the audience, not trusting them to pay attention.The production design and costuming are a stylised evolution of the garish glitter puke aesthetic of Suicide Squad with noticeably better lighting and overall execution. The music also improves upon Suicide Squad, there is still an abundance of pop songs but here they feel more fitting and less like a brash music video compilation. What elevates Birds of Prey above the schlock is the hand to hand fight choreography. The stunts, rhythm, creativity, and interesting choice of locations for the fights are all well executed in mostly long takes and wide shots giving the audience a good sense of visual continuity and special awareness, showing off what is some of the best action seen in a comic book movie.Despite some rather awkward dialogue and a lack of depth to any of the characters the performances in the film are all serviceable. Margot Robbie turns in a consistent performance as Harley Quinn and tries to add some much needed relatability to the character, but Harley remains quite unlikeable making it hard to empathise with her and stifling much of the film's attempts to draw out an emotional response from the viewer. Non-committal in tone shifting jarringly from scenes of comedy to disturbing drama the film lacks a sense of clear direction. This lack of commitment is also present in the movie's themes. At first it seems to be about Harley finding individual strength and independence then as the Birds of Prey are introduced the theme shifts its focus to the importance of overcoming differences and embracing teamwork. Meanwhile the story also touches on abuse and the victimisation of women. Any of these themes could have been developed to convey an interesting or important message but the ideas are spread too thin and don't work together so ultimately the film doesn't really have anything to say.Birds of Prey is an improvement on the likes of BvS, Suicide Squad, Justice League and Aquaman, it is competently made with some sense of style and has impressive action but it falls flat with a weak script and a lack of clear direction making for a disappointing missed opportunity.",Birds of Prey

998,ItLookedBetterOnBetamax,Anyone who crosses Harley Quinn is a complete Joker,6,7 February 2020,"Considering that as this film came out after the colossal success that was the Joker, I feel that this film was always going to disappoint some people and confuse others who might have thought it was set in the same timeline. Just to be clear this film is classic DC comic book film, nothing like the dark and gritty social commentary that was the Joker. This film doesn't even feature the Joker apart from in a short cartoon at the start. The film is more akin to Suicide Squad.I was somewhat pleasantly surprised and marginally underwhelmed by Birds of Prey. The film started off as an interesting quirky story about Harlequin going it alone and learning a few things in the process. It was full of colour, cartoons and the odd joke. However the film slowly descends into a bland and drab picture with many missed opportunities, which left me disappointed as I genuinely enjoyed the characters in the film and would like to see more of them in a much more action packed, crazy, colourful adventure.DC needs to be more bold here. If you're going to make a film about a quirky character then add lots of colour, humour, over the top action and WTF moments. Don't play it safe like this movie tried to do as that ultimately made the film underwhelming and tonally all over the place. For instance in one scene Harley Quinn is battling with some thugs in a police confiscated property office. The thugs shoot a pallet of drugs which causes everyone to get high. At this point I was expecting a massive drug fuelled fight scene with crazy colours, visions and over the top action. Instead what we got was a quite short and bland fight scene. This is one of many missed opportunities to really add some character to the film and give it that crazed Harley Quinn feel. But instead they opted for a weirdly bland fight in which people are getting their badly CGI legs broken. This is one of many missed opportunities throughout the film.The pacing of the film was a major dampener as well as the film introduced a bit of action, humour or drama for about a few minutes then immediately cut away to something else with a completely different tone. It just meant that nothing felt impactful, nothing was really that memorable and the film never really built to anything. It also really undermined the humour in the film which was a real let down. The actors tried but they were given really bad dialogue and bland jokes which at most would get a small chuckle out of the audience at the cinema. Perhaps a longer run time would have allowed the characters and plot to have been developed more thoroughly as well as having longer and more varied fight scenes.Also there were moments in the film where the cinematography changed to more of a comic book feel. These scenes always felt a bit out of place as the cinematography in the rest of the film was nothing special. This is something they should have added more into the film. Giving a unique comic book feel would have made the film more of a visual spectacular and given the film the right tone.Onto the good. I really like Margot Robbie's quirky Harley Quinn interpretation and Mary Winstead as the Crossbow Killer, and thought the other actors did a decent job throughout the film although felt neither really had a good opportunity for character development in the film. We never really got to hear what they were thinking that much just them reacting to things around them. It leaves their characters feeling a bit underdeveloped and hollow.I would like to see a sequel to this film where DC really ramp up the quirkiness, over the top action, surreal-ness and humour to really separate it from every other comic book film. I also would be interested in seeing a Crossbow Killer gritty and dark spin off with Mary Winstead. Something akin to the darkness of the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo to give the Crossbow Killer the dark and gritty world which I believe she deserves rather than the half badass assassin half awkward comic side relief they tried and failed to do in this film.The film also has a great almost all female cast without constantly beating you over the head to tell you how amazed you should be that they cast women as lead roles in comic book/action films for once (looking at you Captain Marvel). All good actors in their own right that deserve a better opportunity at creating the Harley Quinn universe than this films script gave them. Look forward to seeing more of them in hopefully the sequel with a much better story.6.0/10",Birds of Prey

It didn't add to the storyline, and at times was just uncomfortable to watch (and not in a good way). Harley Quinn didn't seem to know whether she was a hero or a villain. A villain should be evil to the core and never consider anyone else's thoughts or feelings, but Harley Quinn was doing bad things sometimes, helping people other times and feeling guilt for doing wrong. And when she was doing bad, did I feel empathy for those she wronged? No. And by the looks of it, everyone in the cinema felt the same way. I looked around and it was just a sea of silent, blank faces. The attempts at comedy were pathetic, the audience laughed once throughout the entire showing, which was right at the end of the film.

It's just an enjoyable, funny, loud and violent movie. Pure entertainment.The acting was amazing, especially Margot Robbie, as expected. The soundtrack was a joy to listen to, the visuals were amazing, and the story line was often predictable, but good. The dialogue was good. The movie was genuinely funny and kept me entertained and rooting for all the characters. I loved, LOVED, the characters - all the women are from different walks of life, but really come together as a group and that is always fun to watch, and something that is often lacking in these superhero movies.The movie didn't take itself seriously, and knew how to make fun of itself in a Deadpool-esque way.I urge you to go and watch it as long as you keep an open-mind and are there purely to be entertained. And I really hope there is a part 2; these are all characters I'd like to visit again.",Birds of Prey

It's so obvious & exaggerated that it's annoying to me, and I'm not even a feminist. In addition most of the cast are just terrible actors/actresses. Very disappointing especially the lady detective and little kid. The dialogue & humor in the movie is also just plain. Not much thought put into it. I wouldn't recommend watching",Birds of Prey

Margot Robbie and the talented women making this film actually got me out to the theatre and I was not disappointed. The ladies kick some serious tail, and the Harley Fu made the fight scenes entertaining and satisfying when I usually find fighting boring. The disjointed narrative is perfectly congruent with the state of Harley's mind. They problem-solve and succeed by supporting each other as total badasses.

And not even kidding, a super bad guy who wants to harm/belittle women. Nobody is even neutral, so to speak. Come on now, how 'bout being a little realistic?With this, we come to how unrealistic this movie actually is. It's so colourful that it's distracting. The first 20 or so minutes are as dull as dust. Editing is a mess and on top of it you have a narration by Miss Quinn herself, who likes to start off with bits and pieces of her story from wherever the heck she wants and whenever, while she's at that.Since Deadpool came out, there has been an increasing trend of adding cheeky humour while you kill a bunch of bad guys. It doesn't work all the time, not in this movie at least. The whole thing is pretentious, dialogues are just meh. What is good here, I cannot seem to see. It was a chore sitting through the whole thing.Conclusion: Below Average. You're not missing out on anything",Birds of Prey
1018,bourchakoun,Utter garbage from all levels,1,11 February 2020,"If you want to root for a psychopath, have your intelligence insulted and see men depicted only as incompetent or evil, then the movie is for you.
How anyone can even cheer for this version of of the man-hating feminist Antifa-inspired Harley Quinn is beyond me.For example - in the first 5 minutes the movie depicts her father as an evil man who dumps her repeatedly and then successfully at an orphanage led by nuns. Obviously anti-Christian Hollyweird has to depict the nuns as evil who spend their days thrashing Harley. She takes revenge by smashing a nun's teeth out with a baseball bat. Nice eh? It gets better. She gets herself a Hyena, but then feeds the Hyena the owner of the exotic pet shop because he dared being a creep to her - the movie shows his body being fed to the hyena - murder is all good if you are a creepy man I guess.
Then in a club she breaks a man's legs because he dared to call her a dumb slut. She behaves badly towards both men and women - by the way - her friends are like a radical feminist man-hating Antifa battalion - gulag chapter 4.
Oh - and they claim instantly that Harley was the brains behind Joker - patriarchy holding down women 24/7 - pure feminist psycho-dogma.The movie goes on from there. These are just the terrible actions of this psychopath in the first few minutes. And that is what we should cheer for?The original Harley Quinn whih was created for the Batman Animated TV series was funny, charming, crazy in love with the Joker, she also used her sexuality, but only had eyes for one man. She was no psychotic maniac. - even superheroes let her go at times, because her biggest crime was being in love for the Joker and helping him. This Harley is a first-rate psychopath that anyone should be advise to not be around.",Birds of Prey

1025,just_funme,"Entertaining, but not a cinema movie",7,22 March 2020,"Well, just watched this, at home, in silence, with nothing better to do. Thought "" meh, how bad could it actually be"" since I've seen good reviews for Alien: Covenant and we all should know what piece of turd that movie is.And I must say, it ain't that bad. I'm not a die hard fan of the comics, I've seen animated movies displaying Quinn, but Robbie fits. What is all this hate for ? She makes the character alive and human, not just some overly crazy woman with Stockholm syndrome. Her interpretation feels right on the money for me and no amount of crappy reviews can take that away from her.The plot.... At heart, it is exactly as the title says, the emancipation of Harley and it's focused on that. The subplot is easy to follow, not all over the place as some people state: dead dude carved the codes for his fortune on some diamond, alive dude needs money = alive dude needs diamond. Also, alive dude hates Quinn for her prior to the break-up. what's all over the place about this ?Birds of Prey... yeah, that was the dissapointing part of the movie, but it wasn't really an origin story now, was it ? They could've cut that part out of the movie, gave Quinn some extra plot armor and it would've been the same story. So, I do agree with the people complaining about that, but again, not even close to their level.And not being a cinema movie ? I for one don't enjoy time skips and narration when I watch something at the cinema, just takes you out of it. It's supposed to be personal, at least in my head. It worked for Deadpool I guess, but that's a whole different level of 4th wall breaking.At any rate, I get that comic book fans have a problem with this movie, but most of us average joes appreciated the effort. I do hope that the fans get a better Birds of Prey movie, I'm curious what the original format is.",Birds of Prey

-Margot Robbie played very well;

This movie is in relation to the comic series Harley Quinn: The Rebirth when she officially ends things with the Joker. The movie isn't about men being bad guys and women being stronger and smarter, its about Harley Quinn finding herself, her voice, her path. For the first time, she isn't making decisions based on if it makes Mistah J (Joker) happy. With all that said, this movie falls flat with the script. The actors are great, but the movie seems rushed and compressed. The characters are only introduced not established.

This movie wants to be Deadpool. It wants it soooo bad, but it fails. It's rated R, but it still looks and feels more like Batman and Robin than Deadpool.
This seems to be another movie that doesn't know if it wants to be campy and fun, or gritty with dark humour, so they went ""Why not both?"" and the result is this.
Now, to be honest, Harley Quinn and the Birds of Prey are characters I know little about, apart from the comics I vaguely recall a TV series about them, so I haven't got any relationship with the characters that might have helped me enjoy this movie more. Fans of the characters might see things differently.
All in all, it's a movie that didn't manage to keep my interest, but there are some pretty colours in it and I didn't turn it off in disgust (Did start to read a book to keep myself entertained while I watched it, though), so I'll give it 4/10.",Birds of Prey

Action didn't excite too much and the props used for that seemed to come out of nowhere.

1077,josephinecarvill,An insult to the comics,1,25 July 2020,"I tried to enjoy this film, I really did... but I was just inconceivably frustrated throughout. As an avid DC fan, I was extremely disappointed with pretty much the entire film.
1. The characters.
Black Mask doesn't even come close to the badass villain he is in the comics- a mass murderer who wears a mask carved from his own father's coffin... not some club owner who wears glitter gloves. Seems like a knockoff Suicide Squad Joker to me! No offence to Ewan McGregor- He's just not the man for the job.
Generally, the characters are poorly constructed with little to no development or arcs. Although, the screenwriting can be held to account for this. I was also incredibly annoyed that they killed off the Joker at the start. Personally, I enjoyed the relationship between the Joker and Harley in Suicide Squad and felt as though they could have progressed that aspect more rather than destroy him with little to no real reason. A backstory behind their twisted love story perhaps ???
2. The writing.
Did the writers even read the comics ??
Honestly, I still couldn't give you a simple plot summary because the story is so directionless and Harley's narrative segments are just cringeworthy.
The film seems to emphasise ""men are bad"" throughout, despite the whole story being based upon the fact that Harley no longer has Mr J to protect her...
I'm all for girl power but personally, as a woman, when it's THIS repetitive, it gets boring.
3. Action.
Perhaps the film's only redeeming quality... the action sequences. They look good and that's about it but hey! I'm struggling to find pros here.
Some people may say ""oooh but the comic characters are meant to be interpreted differently so it's okay if they're not the same as the originals"". I agree with this but not if it's a shoddy script with utterly atrocious character creations.
Someone referred to Tim Burton's Batman when I argued that this film is an insult to DC... a comparison between the two clearly shows their minimal understanding of a good DC film.
4. I could write so much more but I don't want to waste much more time on this train wreck.
Even the soundtrack is tawdry.
Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.",Birds of Prey

Margot Robbie carried the whole movie tho in my opinion. All the other characters are ehhh, some are okay, Black mask is kinda annoying sometimes. The music and scoring are definitely some of the best parts of the movie, other than the action sequences.

They even managed to soften Harley's character when she was supposed to be a badass. All and all a boring plot. Unoriginal.

1089,rockdude-68045,Odd but somewhat entertaining,4,10 December 2020,"Just finished watching the movie with no prior expectations coming into it. Honestly, it was entertaining but there were elements to the movie I didn't care for and others simply prevented it from ever reaching its potential. For starters the movie jumps around a lot based on choppy narration which just felt disruptive to my experience and unnecessary. The main antagonist wasn't even who it was intended to be because honestly his right hand man Zsasz was more intimidating and active as an antagonist than Black mask. I won't get into to much detail but long story short this movie felt like it was intended mainly for women to connect to strong female characters and I think it did just that. However, in every other theme/aspect of the movie it didn't flow, felt predictable, and honestly felt like I was watching a bad Scott pilgrim vs the world take on a comic movie around Harley Quinn's break-up with the Joker. It's unlikely I will be re-watching the film but I enjoyed giving it a chance and seeing strong female characters fight it out in some great action scenes. I can say in that sense it was slightly refreshing from current movie options but still very much a lackluster movie that could put some to sleep or paying more attention to their phones only to serve as background noise.",Birds of Prey

1093,theredbaron2007,Just watch Harley Quinn the animated series,4,23 June 2021,"This is my second time watching it, or trying to. I either fell asleep or turned my tv off because there is no way I watched 3/4 of this the first time. I don't remember anything past the intro.Just the opening monologue annoys the vinegar out of me.I much prefer Kaley Cuoco's portrayal and the world they've built there.This is just a stupid idea probably pitched by a suit who has no understanding of either of the source materials. Which isn't a bad thing, except they should have made a birds or prey movie AND a Harley Quinn solo feature. Not combined the too because frankly women deserve it.And this feels almost on purpose like some angry dude trying to cap two bad ass female driven pieces of DC IP.Idk maybe I'm not the audience but this just feel like tokenism versus actual representation. Like where oracle? The disabled vote?Oh and the face tattoos? Seriously? Ok Jared Leto.Aftern finishing, I've upped my rating from 1 to 4.It's a bad movie and I do think DC needs to have faith in their intellectual property and stop shoving all these names into one movie. But I enjoyed it.And they need to stop sucking batman's codpiece, why is oracle not in this? You've replaced an integral DISABLED superhero for another minority character with no legacy other than a name commissioner Gordon says once in a while. No connection to the birds of prey.I'm totally cool with race bending black Canary. Like that plus the kid were enough. You could have given representation to the disabled community, but no her other name is batwoman. Ergo stop sucking batman's codpiece, especially if you're not gonna feature him where he's appropriate. (The boss fight)Same reason they turned the green arrow edgy and dark.

1094,Kilrogg,If you're a Harley fan you will like it,9,9 February 2020,"I loved the movie. That's the first thing I've got to say. I've been a Harley Quinn fan since the 90's cartoons, and I thought Margret Robbie nailed it!! I mean she did an amazing job making this crazy character believable. I love how the movie is all narrated by her. The editing is done in a way where it's just as wild as her mind. She goes back and forth explaining everything to us as she sees it. I also love the Joker, and although I was a bit disappointed he wasn't in it, by the time the movie ended I thought it was better without him. This isn't a movie about him... we already have a ton of movies showing us what the prince of darkness is capable of. I've been waiting for a movie about Harley Quinn forever, and this movie really delivers. I partially think most people are too torn up about the Joker dying (as far as she sees it in her mind) and they aren't willing to watch the movie. It's a fun ride and I highly recommend it if you are a fan of Harley Quinn. For me it was as good if not better than the first Deadpool movie. It's quite similar with the narration, R rating, and over the top action. The only difference is that the other characters think she is crazy since she talks to us as though she is talking to herself, and sometimes forgets who she's talking to. I loved it and already want to watch it again.",Birds of Prey
1095,virtualjupiter,Excellent!,10,14 February 2020,"Margot Robbie and the other cast members do such a great job! Ewan McGreggor really put on a great performance too, I almost didn't recognize him! These women reflect emotions that are universally felt by women in the real world, and of course, the men and women are over the top, exaggerated representations as one would expect from a comic book, but the feelings are understandable to pretty much every person who grew up female. Some viewers may be put off by female angst against masculine oppression, these themes in art disturb the comfortable and comfort the disturbed, as is reflected in many of the reviews here. I thought this film kicked ass, plenty of exciting action, great acting, the writing could've been a bit better, but overall I really enjoyed this film.

Yes, the movie had plot points, and yes the movie had some corny moments, and of course the hot topic ""feminism"" - but hey, wake up - this is a comic book female super villain movie. It's not supposed to make you contemplate existence or think about the secrets of the universe. It's supposed to be fun. And that's just what it is. Suicide Squad was as well. People hating on these movies, but loving Wonder Woman - a movie that is basically a huge plot hole, a pathetic try of a ""feminist"" labeled superhero blockbuster.Birds of Prey is what it is - nothing more, nothing less than a very fun movie to watch!Margot absolutely killed it as Harley Quinn - with her mood swings, sexiness, craziness, deadliness and everything in between. Winstead also did her role justice, as she introduced the socially awkward assassin into the franchise.

1107,jan-nebendahl,Amazingly bad movie,3,8 August 2021,"While others have pointed out that almost all men are portrayed as bad, this misses the point. Almost all women are lacking character as well. Furthermore it is a riddle how this movie can be seen as empowering to women, when there are no positive female characters in this movie.Starting with the positive, the soundtrack and the set design are at times very good. Gripping, creative and fun. (EDIT: There are some funny dialogues in there, as well.). All in all the movie can be enjoyable on a very superficial level.The story, however, is lacking in many departments. The main plot is how Black Mask wants to aquire the wealth of a mob family. These are encrypted into the structure of a diamond. Everything revolves around this. The story is, however, told very complicated, and through a lot of narrated exposition, included flashbacks that explain scenes that have already happened. Which is distracting at best and really bad storytelling at worst.As an origin story for the Birds of Prey - with a focus on Harley Quinn - this falls flat on many levels. The 4 Birds of Prey characters, Harley Quinn, Black Canary, Huntress and Renee Montoya, all have their own subplots, that at times blend into each other. Additionaly the diamond is stolen by a teenage thief - Cassandra Cain - which further complicates the story for Black Mask.Harley Quinn is an anarchic, evil character. Her story arc is about her emancipation of The Joker, her ex-boyfriend. They just broke up, and now she needs to get along on her own, hunted by scores of people that she crossed, insulted, humiliated, maimed or mutilated during her time with the joker.Black Canary works as a singer in a club owned by Black Mask and becomes his driver after Harly Quinn broke the first driver's legs after a he told her to step down from a table.Renee Montoya works as police officer on a case regarding Huntress.And Huntress is on a revenge spree against the people that killed all her family, the original owners of the diamond.None of their subplots work, and none makes the viewer like the characters. Plus, they do not drive their own story, but are only reacting to externalities, triggered by men.Harley Quinn behaves like is expected from the character. This is actually fun at times, and Margot Robbie is a perfect fit for the role. She blows up the chemical factory, where she jumped/fell/got pushed into the chemicals that make her look like The Joker. This ultimate psycho ex-girlfriend move - a terrorist bombing - makes it known that noone needs to afraid of Harley Quinn anymore because of The Joker. This triggers all kinds of people to hunt her, wanted to kill her. This includes Black Mask, for whom she accepts to find the thief of the diamond. This plot is the center of the movie. But it is a bad plot. While Harley Quinn wants to be independent and free, she never actually does anything on her own. Oscillating from anarchic to pure evil. When her only friend turns against her because of money, this finally breaks the plot. She takes his view point ""it's all about business"" and wants to turn the diamond (or the thief who has swallowed the diamond) over to black mask. There is no core of virtue in this character. Only a selfish and cruel person, that lets others control her life for her. Why she is somehow suddenly on the side of the other three, instead of getting killed by them because she is clearly an adversary... remains a mystery.Black Canary works in Black Masks night club as singer and then his driver. While she is depicted as the moral center of the story - because she tries to help the thief she knows from her apartment - she never acts unless it is forced upon her. She does not act when Black Mask and Victor Zsasz cut of the faces of an asian mob boss, his wife and his daughter. She does not act when a lady is humiliated in Black Masks night club. The only thing she ever does is to give information about the thief to Montoya. Even when encountering the thief and Harley Quinn, she does not act until Zsasz attacks her. Another weak character. No stringent set of values, no inner core of belief, no character arc to speak of.Renee Montoya is being depicted as a smart cop who somehow did not get promoted because of her gender. Then, however, she steals evidence from a crime scene and brings a supposed ally, the female state attorney, into a potentially career ending situation. And gets suspended for it. Which kind of shows why she did not get promoted, because she places her own vendetta above legal procedures.Huntress, finally, is portrayed like a soulless killing machine. She hardly speaks, just kills the people who murdered her family. No character arc, no inner motivations, no values, no choices, no obstacles.This movie empowering? Not at all. Just like Captain Marvel, kicking ass is not enough to make a good movie character. There needs to be the possibility of an emphatical bond between the audience and the viewers. For me as a man, who does not give female characters more credit because of their gender, this falls completely flat. There is the cruel and evil psycho ex-girlfriend terrorist; the hesitant singer/driver with bad choices for friends, who only helps people she privately knows; the corrupt cop; and the bland revenge taker, who only distinguishes herself from the ones who want to take revenge on Harley Quinn by her skills.That these 4 start working together, although their goals are diametrically opposed to each other (Harley & Canary, Montoya; Montoya & Huntress) or have no connection to the others (Huntress + Canary, Harley Quinn), just by doing magic girlpower handwaving, makes the movie not better.All in all: Unlikeable characters that do not bring the plot forward, are formed into a Superhero Girl Group by the magic of handwavium.Not to mention the fight scenes that want to be like Matrix, but look like Bud Spencer & Terence Hill for the most part.",Birds of Prey

No. This was just a sad attempt at milking money out of superheroes and being first at the ""female superhero genre""But this is a film that sets women lead superhero movies back .

They have every right to audition for any role. All it means is I don't think that they are meant for particular roles.

I thought it was a great movie with some laughs and giggles and Margaret who plays Harley Quinn does a really good job in my opinion. And she looks really good on screen. I did and I didn't like when they tried to make Gotham a bright and good place I see what they were trying to do but it did not work for me.
Story views
The story in my opinion was not great at all did not like it, Also did not like the idea of Harley Quinn being sort of good person a bit like Loki.
It all felt a bit rushed to me story wise.What could've made it better!
For a starter I was really disappointed that there was no joker in the movie I would've loved to seen the cameo between Joaquin Phoenix,That would've been awesome and a story that they would've split apart would have made him tie in to the modern Era but oh well.
I understand what they were trying to do with the movie but in my opinion did not work for me so that's why I'm giving it a 5 out of 10.Not bad /not great

Fourth wall breaking CHECK
Over the top violence CHECK
Crazy wise cracking mercenary CHECK
Anti-hero with a small heart after all CHECKA positive note on this: where Ryan Reynolds seems to be born to play Deadpool, Margot Robbie seems to be born to play Harley Quinn. I really like her version of the iconic character.The story also has a weird glitch in it: Harley Quinn seems to get away with everything she does: stealing, blowing up a whole chemical plant (!!!), Shooting up a police station, etc. Everything seems to forgiven in the end. Also, I kinda hoped that the Joker or Batman would make a appearance.The movie looked great, acting was good, fun humour, nice action scenes, story was all over the place, I liked Ewan McGregor as Black Mask and pretty nice soundtrack.Overall fun movie, better than I expected, tries really hard to be the female DC version of Deadpool.

It's additions of Black Canary, Huntress, and Renée Montoya provide a new type of character develop that we've never seen in DC movies before. In addition to Black Mask, this badass team of superheroes provides a perfect blend of insanity, awkwardness, and that feeling of total badass you get from watching the team plow through Black Mask's entire army.Of course, I couldn't close off this review without mentioning Margot Robbie's stellar performance as the siren herself.

1130,enzoalgarve,Harley Quinn mad head is a new form of art,9,10 March 2020,"I got to say, I wasn't expecting much of this movie. Even When the firsts reviews came out I still had some caveats about It. Seeing the BOP history from Quinn's perspective was something... unusual, but in a very positive way, because we can connect with this character in a very unique way, in which not only we can see how they are in a group, but as unique individuals, and for me, It's a new way to make movie.
The movie will only be good if you buy what it is selling: Quinn's mad head. If you can buy that, the movie flows just perfectly.
On the technical details BOP are very good, with the biggest highlight to the soundtrack, which fits perfectly with Harley's crazy narrative. Another highlight is the cast chemistry, seeing the BOP together is one of the most awesome parts of the movie and Ewan Mcgregor version of Black Mask is great, It really represents how a misogynist man is. The script also discuss femininity in a very touching way, in which we can see routine female problems applied to her reality, and, again, perfect. Last but not least, Cathy Yan direction is also amazing, not only on the camera moving, but also in coordinating the cast.
My only caveats are in Rosie Perez and Ella Jay Basco performance, which are not on the level of the rest of the cast, making all the scenes they are alone really boring. Also with the costumes, which are really weird. And the scenario is really different of what we are used to see in Gotham, so It takes sometime to get used to It.
My advice? Go to the theater and watch it",Birds of Prey

I've always been skeptical about Margie Robbie's interpretation of Harley Quinn and this movie just ascertained my opinions.Overly childish and pretty immature, this movie was badly scripted and made me cringe more times than I can count.The plot was all over the place (despite being overly predictable) and DC is now forcing us to accept a version of Harley Quinn that goes against everything we've come to know her for. Where's the fierce, saddistic and ingenious character that we've come to love through the comic books?There were very few highs in this movie and numerous lows. The only thing you'd mostly remember is the high pitched squealing from Harley everytime she attempts to talk.P. S.

1133,siddhantraiz,"Original, Funny and Exciting",9,7 February 2020,"Birds of Prey continues DC winning streak and cementing DC and WB as movie studios allowing directors to bring their own vision to the table and going all out. This movie could easily have been PG-13 minus a few violent fight scenes but the fact that the studio didn't bother to alter them to PG-13 is awesome. Now coming to the movie I liked for the most part and was conflicted when it comes to a few areas.
The movie can be called a sequel to Suicide Squad which focuses on Harley Quinn after she broke up with the Joker. Now why the movie is called Birds of Prey I don't know because Harley Quinn is definitely the front and centre and the other characters shows up from time to time and team up towards the end. The movie is told completely through Harley Quinn perspective and is narrated by her thus the sequences of event that happened in the movie are a little out of sequence showing the chaos in her mind, It shows very well the chaos in Harley Quinn's mind but I think kills the excitement and build-up of a few scenes. The comedy is very quirky and organic which I love in contrast to the one forced upon. The action scenes are very well done and are exciting except for the last action sequence, It didn't do much for me and I was feeling bored towards the end of the movie.
The cinematography was great and some sequence really popped, the soundtrack was great as well.
The actors here have done a phenomenal job especially Margot Robbie, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Ewan Mcgregor and Chris Messina.
Margot Robbie is the definitive Harley Quinn and each of her sequences lifted the movie. Ewan did a great job although I wished I had seen something more from the character than we got. Huntress was an interesting character but we didn't get much in this movie and Victor Zsasz was menacing.
In all I really liked the movie except maybe the last 20 minutes, I am excited to see Harley Quinn and Birds of Prey in future movies.",Birds of Prey
1134,acnlds,It's a cute watch!,7,11 February 2020,"Didn't know what to anticipate when watching this film but had read one bad review about it not having much of a plot which I agree. The plot line is weak and somewhat boring the only thing that holds the movie together is the fight scenes other than that it seems messy. The film feels like they wrote a soundtrack then produced the film it's almost like a musical and even though the album is great as I had listened to it before the movie release it was just TOO present in the film throughout. I feel like they should of included the joker even if it was for 30 seconds at some point in the film; his absence as a ""they broke up"" excuse just wasn't enough to make the movie seem like that was now the cause of everything that unfolded that suddenly everyone wants revenge because Harley isn't protected anymore. Harley is bad as anything and I feel she doesn't need the Joker as she should have her own reputation by now. Birds of Prey film title makes no sense either until they decided last minute to make it relevant. I almost feel like we need a second film but scrap whatever happened in this film and maybe go thoroughly in depth in a unique way like the independent joker film how Harley became who she is present day and why there is no chance she can go back to life before. They show a cartoon brief breakdown at the beginning but it has so much more potential.I mean any other film made now featuring Margot as Harley would probably still be better than this. I only like it because the costumes are fun, Harley looks expensive than she did in suicide squad plus it's her feature film so we see her 100% the soundtrack slaps and as a woman I feel like it would be cute to watch every once in awhile with snacks. And these are everything that's wrong with the film, I shouldn't like it for those basic reasons.",Birds of Prey

Cass was not true to her comic source, but still provided an entertaining revision fitting the mass Hollywood audiences.It was leagues better than that unfortunate Suicide Squad.My complaints are it should have been significantly more violent (considering it was rated R), and the character development should have been better on some supporting characters (ie Montoya).",Birds of Prey

I don't know why, but from the trailers it looked awful, much worse than it really is. But, despite everything, it is a rather mediocre film with a bad agenda, which makes it at times fake and unreal. The other thing is that this is absolutely a Harley Quinn movie, as many people feared. In general, the other characters are there, just enough to mix up a mess and not be empty. I've never been interested in Birds of Brey comics, but even I know Harley Quinn was never present. Anyway, the problem with the film is that it starts out quite fascinating, no matter how simple the story is and to be honest until the last third, I was surprisingly satisfied. But the closer we got to the end, the more ridiculous and unconvincing things became. For example the terrible contrast between some action scenes plays a role, because they invited the director of John Wick to re-shoot some of them, because they were obviously quite bad. Therefore, there is a great contrast to how some fight scenes are great and original, and others are downright pittyful, especially when little women beat men at 2 meters, 120 kg.The film goes downhill exactly where it shouldn't - when their team gathers. Somehow, when I watched the stories of the chicks intertwine, it was much more interesting, but when they got together, something really didn't work. And the nonsense they started talking and doing, at times approached dangerously Cartoonish levels. Also I didn't like that men are portrayed as misogynists, scoundrels, idiots and some primitive beasts. This was very annoying.However, I managed to have fun in the first half, it was not bad. I also recognize the good roles of much of the cast, most impressed by Margo Robbie, who is as fantastic as Harley and Ewan McGregor, who definitely had fun in the role of the Black Mask and at times was a very pleasantly exaggerated character.",Birds of Prey

1166,angelic_wounds,"Don't take BOP too seriously, and you will definitely enjoy it",8,23 February 2020,"Let me begin with the most important notion, the one you should keep in mind whether you go watch this movie or whilst publishing a critic on it; Birds of Prey was released neither as a tragic documentary nor a philosophical approach on the ways of life. It is, simply, a fun movie, a colourful, action heavy and easy way to enjoy yourself at the theatre. It doesn't need the dissection people put the Joker movie under, or the deep excursion into yourself, and society in general, that Parasite put you through.Birds of Prey is, to a point, what Deadpool is to Marvel. A crazy, roller-coaster ride from one of DC's craziest antagonists, as she tries to survive in a city she has no one to protect her from. The plot is just a plot of ""I got myself into this mess and now I must somehow untangle from it"" and, honestly, it doesn't need to be anything else.Margot Robbie visibly attempted to distance her iconic character from the clutches of Suicide Squad, where she was, more often than not, the version of Joker's girlfriend. In this movie, she shines through as Harley Quinn without being vulgar, carries a movie on her shoulders through light, sometimes not as funny, humour, fantastic action sequences (you'll see the John Wick elements before you realise who directs them), and a narrative, twisty trip through a Gotham that, quite frankly, wants her dead.Along the way, she meets exquisite singer Black Canary, the assassin with the cross - um, I mean the Huntress, aspiring lieutenant Renee Monroe, and a pickpocket in Cassandra Cain. I'd like to avoid spoilers, so I'll say that all these characters somehow find themselves on the path of Roman Saionis, the flamboyant yet sadistically crazy villain whom Ewan McGregor portrays just wonderfully. Along with his henchman Zsasz (oh my God, will they ever stop making one of Batman's biggest villains into a sidekick?!), he'll require something precious that Cain has stolen, and Harley, Canary, Cain, Monroe and the Huntress will find themselves trying to either get that back or trying to protect the one who has it. All, while Roman's patience wears thin.Heavily packed with wonderfully choreographed action scenes, which use just the right amount of slow motion, laced with a powerful soundtrack and a dynamic performance from Robbie, Birds of Prey is a movie that won't make it into the annals of the pantheon of cinema, and that's okay. Just like Deadpool, this was never its purpose. Its purpose was to make Harley Quinn a character of her own, while establishing a movie that is sure to leave you, above all, grinning.I mean, Deadpool had no plot at all and no backstory whatsoever to its supporting cast and it somehow earned the praise of everyone on the planet. So, I ask you to approach Birds of Prey with the same mindset. Quite honestly, anyone who praises Deadpool but has issues with Birds of Prey harbours problems that go beyond cinematography, and that's that.I definitely recommend it, and I'd love to watch it again.",Birds of Prey

Luckily I watched it for free, would have hated to have paid money for it. They were pretty much banking this movie off the popularity of Harley Quinn from Suicide Squad. It didn't work. Feel sorry for Robnie, she did her job and I am sure was under contract. Let's hope James Gunn's The Suicide Squad redeems Harley Quinn character from this disaster.",Birds of Prey

1169,AdnanAwes,Worst Movie Ever From DC,1,4 June 2020,"I seldom write reviews here but this was one of the most garbage movies I have ever watched, let alone one of the worst DC movie. The acting is absolutely horrendous by each and every cast member. Lame one liners that make you cringe, action scenes look like from the early 2000s, the story line is gargled, too much to and forth transitions, really poor scripting, poor choice of villains, they aren't scary or dangerous or anything.....like this is literally nothing I liked about this movie. It was a nightmare. Never recommending this to anyone.",Birds of Prey
1170,john_titmus,Awful..... even by DCEU Standards,2,27 September 2020,"Shame the focus was to appease the women lib rather than make a reasonable film.There was new territory with the character and story to make something fresh and original however A director was appointed with 1 crap film under her belt, a writer with a few poor films under hers.There was a lot of poor imitations to copy success and territory from other films such as Guardians and Deadpool which fell flat. A semi popular song every 10 mins weirdly incorporated and the forced swearing and poorly executed backdrop flashback failed miserably. Margot Robbie couldn't carry this film. The scene from Wolf of wall street we all remember her for didn't provide enough star power.Ewan McGregor did ok despite his poor script and no direction on how to execute his character.You can be PC, appease the social media girl power trend and still hire talent. Women have carried films successfully before - Sigourney Weaver, Julia Roberts, Charlize Theron, Meryl Streep etc etc and Directed with style- Katheryn Bigelow, Sofia Coppola, Patty Jenkins.You kind of undermine what your trying to achieve in the first place when you put no talent in front and behind the camera just because of their gender.",Birds of Prey

(as a girl). It's not the same for me to say that I want to be like superman or batman cause they have their own style and they are men and even If i try to imitate them, we have very little in common but when I get to see movies like this where women are the stars is just WOW. I feel super connected with them because they're not only superheroes or villains but they are girls that get dirty and fight and not the common stuff of a delicate girl or whatever stereotypes are for us. Idk.. I just love to feel like I, as a woman, can be super powerful as well. for good or for evil but I can get dirty and grotesque and fight as well. 10/10 I loved every single moment of it, although is not really the best movie in cinema aspects, it's a superhero movie after all and I feel like it should be seen as that and don't care much about if what you see is ""stupid"" or ""dramatic"" cause that's the point.",Birds of Prey

Especially after what they did with Wonder Women which was a great movie, by far the best DC Film at this moment of time. This Film didn't give me anything, i kept watching it hoping it would turn around and blow me away, but sadly it didn't. I felt the fight scenes were tacky not at all convincing in the slightest, I will admit that there was a couple special moments with the baseball bat that was awesome but that's no enough. it was poorly written, messy a bit all over the place, repetitive in some places and Harley Quinn look just didn't feel like her. The huntress actress just wasn't right for the role, she wasn't convincing for me, the actress didn't seem comfortable in the role I felt it really showed. I've seen her in other movies, so i know she can act. The comedy was too cheesy for me. A lot of the film was too far fetched. Dc have made it obvious that they are dark. This just didn't match their style, I don't know what they were trying to do, by for me it didn't work.The Black Canary, I really like her acting and the way she portrayed her character.

However, it does not achieve even the level of passable entertainment. Robbie chews the scenery and locks her face onto the camera at all times, the rest of the ""Birds of Prey"" are just accessories, Ewan MacGregor is not only useless, but quite literally directionless, as he shouts some of his outbursts with THREE different accents competing one against another, and the rest of the male cast are idiots and dweebs.

In terms of the films that DC/Warner Bros has been making the last 20 years, this picture is one of most entertaining, if not one of the best.It feels like the film that 'Deadpool' (2016) wanted to be but couldn't quite live up to. Taking a page from 'Deadpool', the film uses Harley Quinn as a fourth-wall-breaking narrator, but seems to make better use of it than 'Deadpool' ever manages.'Birds of Prey' clever screenplay that hits all the beats that it should while doing so in fun and unexpected ways. It features a very strong cast, with Ewan McGregor and Margot Robbie giving career standout performances.While the film is titled 'Birds of Prey' with the subtitle mentioning Harley Quinn, make no mistake: this is the Harley Quinn movie. For comics fans expecting to see a story centred on familiar 'Birds of Prey' characters, you will likely be disappointed. But for the fan of 'Harley Quinn' comics, particularly the Conner-Palmioti comics, you will be pleased. As faithful an adaptation as one can hope for.Overall, for comics fans or casual viewers, this is one entertaining film.",Birds of Prey

It's violent for no reason, the characters are all screaming idiots and the plot makes no sense at all.

Throughout the entire film you get the sense that the movie that was pitched, the screenplay that was written, the movie the actors showed up for and poured their hearts into, the film the director made, the movie the studio mucked with, and the movie we wound up with are all vastly different creatures. You get the sense that at least one of those iterations would've made an enjoyable romp...but the finished product isn't one of those.

It was fittingly absurd and over the top for the character, the action scenes were actually really cool, the soundtrack was cool and I loved the costuming. I was very glad this was not directed by a man!It did obviously have some glaring issues. It had the classic ensemble film problem of not having time to develop either the characters or the plot, would've been far better as a Harley movie rather than trying to shoehorn the other characters in for like one scene at the end.Also while he may be a classic comic villain, choosing a white guy who has a collection of African masks and art who wears a black full face mask when he's in ""villain mode"" was... a choice...So I'd say it was generally entertaining if you decide not to overanalyse it and refreshing to see a comic book film with a cast of women who aren't continuously sexualised throughout so that's a plus...",Birds of Prey

Is it because their target audience is people who have the attention span of a golden fish? Or is it because they intended it as a way of hiding a bad plot? I cannot answer that, only the producers and director can, but the result is a tiring, silly film.My rating is not lower for two main reasons:
At least it is not another brain-dead macho action film. We have had enough of those. Is feminism approached in a silly, unsophisticated and way too commercial manner in this film?

1220,Somalocadecor,A story told by one Harley Quinn,8,22 February 2020,"I really enjoyed this movie. Its set in a Gotham we know, but haven't seen before- somewhere between the NY streets of 'Joker' and the high camp sets of the Adam West era. It works well, as this is a comic book , live- action movie, so has one foot in a world we know, and another planted deep into the absurd fantasy of a comic villains den. No spoilers, but for those who know the Adam West villain dens, you'r going to love the final fight scene.
Set in the days after Harley breaks up with Mr J, this tale is narrated by Harley. Margot Robbie just plays it to perfection, and her action and fight scenes are breathtaking. As you'd expect from a tale told by Harley, its kinda scrambled. She forgets to tell you bits until she realises she's forgotton something and has to back track and expain. Its just so well done, all in the dreamlike world between the printed comic , film realism, and the world of Harley Quinn. The cast does a fantastic job. Huntress is a simmering comedy gem. Black Canary has some wonderful lines.I loved that whenever Harley meets a foe , their name is put up on the screen, and their key grievance with Harley, what she did to them in the past. When she is confronted by Black Mask, ( Ewan) , the grievances flashed by too quickly for me to catch them all, but i think they summed up the reason why some people have given this rollercoaster of a movie a low score and written reviews that only question their own empathy and intelligence. I can't wait for the Blu- ray so i can go through them as that could spoil the momment for anyone who hadn't seen this yet.
I hope comic book fans get behind this film. It is not a chick flick, its a fabulous breakout for Harley, a nod to the Gotham of the 60's, and a really fun story, brilliantly told bu one Harley Quinn.",Birds of Prey

Reasonable soundtrack.Too verbose and with conversations that could and should have been cut back significantly without affecting what was trying to be conveyed.Illogical, Wildly unbalanced execution and content of the fight scenes
Not funny enough.Too much tell rather than show.Mates scored it as a 'five' given that the female actors looked 'good in hot pants' so also failed in selling its Wokeness.
I'm giving it a 5 as I can't go below average as in that area you find '6 Underground'

No there's no Barbara yet, no it's not Gotham City Sirens, but for what it is it's actually a very enjoyable movie.Margot robbie was amazing as Harley even more so than in Suicide Squad and after seeing her determination to get this movie made, I truly saw why this project means so much to her. There was no point where it seemed like she was trying to make this movie the Harley quinn show but rather a film that spotlights a multitude of DC women who if not for this movie probably wouldn't have seen the light of day this early in the DCEU.The movie is very funny and has great action scenes, but what makes it most enjoyable is the cast.Jurnee and Mary killed it at Huntress and Black Canary. This movie is meant to be a backdoor pilot for the Birds of Prey team and it does a really great job setting up their stories so they could operate as the team we've come to know from the comics. Rosie perez makes a great performance as Renee. Ewan was FANTASTIC as Black Mask and his dynamic with Victor Zsasz was great to watch.Lastly, although Cassandra Cain isn't the same cassandra we know and love from the comics, Ella Jay Basco does an amazing job portraying the Cassandra we see in the film. I can definitely see her shaping into a more comics accurate version of the character in the future.This isn't the WOKE SJW movie trolls are saying it is. The movie deal with daily misogyny that women have to go through yes but it doesn't come off as an ""agenda"", it's just things that women today deal with often. A female led movie can be empowering without being dismissed as trying to be woke.",Birds of Prey

You can try to ground it in reality as much as possible; ie, ""The Joker."" You can use science fiction to explain superpowers; ie, ""The Antman,"" ""Captain America,"" etc. Or you can lean into the cartoony unrealistic nature of the original medium, which is what this film does. This has a Tarrantino-like sensibility combined with the 1960s Batman TV show. (All the fight in the funhouse lacks is big cartoon ""Pows!"" and ""Whams!"") And since Harley Quinn started in the Batman cartoons and not the comic book, this live action cartoon is perfect for her. Robbie commits to her character as usual. If you find gleeful over-the-top violence committed by morally questionable people led by a deeply silly but fun-loving sociopath entertaining, you will enjoy this film.

1237,dchipoco,Poor story for amazing characters,6,28 May 2020,"The movie has a simple plot, not that it needed a more complex one, but it has some loose ends and a termination that seems convenient for the plot yet unrealistic or goofy. The break of the 4th wall gives dynamism to the story, as well as the constant flashbacks which resembles the chaotic mind of its main character, Harley Quinn. However, they create an unnecessary disorder which may result in some confusion. Also, many flashbacks are use just to explain the background of the other women characters of the movie which is conveniently known by Harley Queen before even meeting them nor spending much time with them afterwards. There are many characters included in the story besides Harley Quinn: Huntress, Black Canary, Renée Montoya and Cassandra Cain. In the comics, which are the basis of this movie, they are huge characters with their own personality that is not well exploit in the movie. Here, they are presented as simple associates with few lines. I seemed to me that the team came together just because the producers wanted to have a women team rather than an actual need of the story. The performance of the actresses was not bad, moreover, Margot Robbie understands Harley Quinn very well and embodies this character; however, I think that the pseudo mentoring of Cassandra Cain would have given the movie enough for a story and could have left Renée Montoya and the other girls as little guests in the movie, a perfect seed for future DC movies which could have been useful for the franchise. The music and sound settled the mood, but the lines were a little bit loose. The final scene was forced to look as a huge women empowerment, which ultimate goal is awesome, but Wonder Woman has shown us the best way to do it: not yelling at everyone and having convenient plots for this, but letting the audience recognize it in the main character. Overall, is a fun movie with a lot of innovative elements a little bit forced women empowerment, but could have been much better (as I thought it would be from the trailer...the same happened to me with Suicide Squad).",Birds of Prey

This movie in a rare combination is both. It wants to be Deadpool so bad. Only HQ's voice is unbearable. It jumps around and doesn't know what it is. Whoever edited this movie should be fired. It's so noisy. Like nails on a chalk board. The story is terrible. HQ telling them story makes it so convoluted and unwatchable. It's made for people with A.D.D because HQ clearly can't hold a real conversation.
In Gotham Victor Zazz is funny and psychotic. In this he's a lunatic who cuts himself. The story builds up to a 10 min scene and then completely abandons that as Harley abandons the crew. I died laughing when the singer blows them away with her voice. Are you kidding me? I ended up hating Harley Quinn by the end. I felt bad for Ewan McGregor. It must have been a cash grab because he probably filmed his scenes in less than a week. You think well maybe there will be a good fight with him at the end. Nope dead in 30 seconds from a grenade. Once again every man is stupid and incapable and every woman is bulletproof and unstoppable. This movie was made for teenage girls with ADHD but is rated R for some reason. This is the worst movie I've seen since Open Water and is definitely the most annoying. It honestly hurt my head. It was like cats fighting, or bats, or sleeping in a machine shop.

One of the things I enjoyed about this movie was Margrot Robbie's performance. She absolutely crushes it as Harley Quinn, and she is very funny and entertaining to watch. I also loved the villian. He was smart, creepy, manipulative, and very unsympathetic. The aspects I did not like about this movie were the other characters, and the overall story. The story and vibe of the film felt like a rip off from Deadpool. I dont blame them for going this route, especially with a character like Harley Quinn.

That being said, this is my only positive about the movie. Every other character was either very boring and had nothing going on for them, or poorly acted and just embarrassing to see.
There were many Mary Sue characters during the film too, which overall had me very uninterested during the action scenes and even the climax of the film. I wasn't worried that Harley Quinn would lose or anything like that, cause during the entire film she's borderline invincible. The reason why I find batman such an interesting character to watch is cause at any moment he can lose and get seriously injured. In the batman universe he gets injured and loses several fights, so I'm always worried if he'll lose. I never once got that feeling during this film, I was more or less just watching flashy action scenes.
I wanted to like this movie, I really wanted too, but everyone was so boring and uninteresting leaving me just sitting there wanting something to grasp onto for entertainment.

Harley Quinn's character is poorly defined and doesn't make any sense. She goes from being a psychopathic murderer to the kind of person who assaults a police station with beanbags to save their lives, to then go quickly back to murdering prisoners, then back to having a stereotypical Heart of Gold and rescuing the child that was in danger. Along the way they managed to destroy anything you liked about the first one. Harley's costumes are terrible. The lighting is lazy. The plot makes no sense. The film is just wall to wall bad. I can't believe we made it till the end. It really shows some dedication that we stuck it in there and let the thing keep playing until it wound itself out on the floor.Margot Robbie is a great actress, but she doesn't show it in this movie. Ewan McGregor actually tried hard. I'd say there is a bright spot of the film if that he tries to be the true psycho villain that they want even taking it into heavy character territory at some point, thinking he's more in, perhaps Henry a portrait of a serial killer than this garbage mainstream quasi comic book movie.That's to say nothing about the obvious politically correct pro female agenda of the film, which, unfortunately, as with the new Star Wars movies fails to accomplish their goal. Even people that support their ideas and theories, would not come away from this film thinking that women are great heroes.

So, as a die hard Harley Quinn fan (and one of her toughest critics) I admit I do not think Margot Robbie is the best casting choice for Harley even though I love her as an actress! That being said she did a MUCH better job on the character work in this film than Suicide Squad. Margot definitely had more freedom to be the fun and silly Harley we all know and love, without being objectified.My biggest qualms with the film was that they seemed to haphazardly throw in HQ comic book references without any explanation, which I guess would make them easter eggs? Still, I would have loved to see Harley have a conversation with her taxidermy beaver ""Bernie"" like in the comics or even extend the roller derby scene since that's such a big part of her life in the books. Also, I'm always down for more blood. Admittedly Huntress' character seemed a bit awkward and flat, but still packed punches of her own.Aside from all that, this movie was so fresh and entertaining! When I wasn't busy laughing off, I was completely captivated by the epic fighting sequences and in awe of the gorgeous imagery that felt like an acid trip or even like seeing the world through Harley's eyes! Not to mention the great soundtrack.I'm still a bit confused how people are saying this movie is racially biased and pushing a feminist agenda because I didn't get that vibe at all. The ones spouting this nonsense must be extremely repelled by women and multiracial people.This movie has its flaws, sure, but I paid money to be entertained and they did not disappoint! We all knew going into this movie that it wasn't going to be the work of art we know ""Joker"" to be, but a bright and fun exploration of Harley as a character, and anyone who knows Harley's character should have expected exactly what this film has produced. Ignore the bad reviews and go see this film. 10 stars for reminding me why I love movies and making me feel like a kid again! (And to help balance out the pointless 1 star reviews) This film was a really good time!",Birds of Prey
1278,HeatherMoxley,Ignore the HATERS!,10,8 February 2020,"Okay, so as a die hard Harley Quinn fan (and one of her toughest critics) I don't think that Margot Robbie is the best casting choice for her even though I love her as an actress! That being said she definitely did a MUCH better job on her character work in this film than the previous Suicide Squad where she was much more objectified. She seemed to have more freedom to be the silly and fun HQ we all know and love.My only qualms with the film were that they seemed to just throw in material from the comics with no explanation, which I guess might make them easter eggs? I really would have loved it if Harley would have had a conversation with her taxidermy beaver ""Bernie"" like in the books! I also would have loved to see more of a roller derby scene since that's such a large part of Harley's life in the comics. I also felt that Huntress' character was a bit awkward and flat but she still managed to land some punches! I also wouldn't have minded more blood.Now I'm not saying this movie is the work of art we've found ""Dark Knight"" or ""Joker"" to be, but it definitely serves it's purpose in being extremely entertaining. When I wasn't busy laughing off, I was completely captivated by the colorful and almost psychedelic like visuals and feel, and completely in awe of the fighting sequences. The film felt like it was almost like viewing the world through Harley's eyes.I'm really not sure why people are saying this film has a strong feminist agenda or that it's racially biased because I didn't sense that at all! The people saying that must be extremely repelled by women and multiracial people.The reason for going to the movies is to be entertained and this movie does exactly that! Don't believe it or give into the haters that want to bash this film just so they can feel like their voices are being heard. This was worth every penny and I'd go see it again! 10 stars for reminding me why I love going to the movies and feeling like a kid again (and to help counter all those pointless 1 star ratings)!",Birds of Prey

I went into the movie thinking it would be something near Suicide Squad's depth of awesome and seriousness but I was surprised during to find that it is not! It seems to be more fun, bright, silly, quirky. That's all great! I didn't mind. It had my daughter and I cracking up! Everyone's talking about man-hating and it being a chick flick and I'm wondering...well...did you see any trailers for the movie or look at the cover?! Of course it's a chick flick! And she just got out of a horrible break up! But the point of the movie is for women to come together as a team in the end and defeat all the ideas that women need men and women are basically just their little puppets. Sorry not sorry. It happens in this world all the time! We've got tons of movies vice verse. Women being abused, hurt, broken and just falling into darkness. Harley never does that! She always keeps going and stays positive (in her own crrrrazyyyy way!) Yes. The film needed help. The story line was a little all over; the director should have made this run more smoothly to function better. Yes. The fighting scenes were a bit too choppy and unrealistic at times. Yhe choreography needed some help. But damn that baseball bat scene where it flies back to her hand was bad ass wasn't it?! 😂 and the glitter bombs?! HELLO. Amazing! Even my fiance laughed at the cocaine when she inhaled and got all weird. 🤣 FUN! Some of the sets were super cool. The fun house. Perfect. They should have put more depth to the birds of prey. They should have given more darkness and more scary parts to the Black Mask. And I'm not sure what the point of a hyena was. If they're going to put a hyena in the movie they should have given him a bad ass part as a sidekick to Harley. I think overall the actors and actresses did an amazing job in this movie to make it fun to watch if you aren't too serious of a person and to make it watchable. I absolutely love Margot and Ewan! But I think the vision of the director definitely missed the mark on some things that could have made this movie a 10 for me or apparently way more than the 1s and 2s it is receiving from other people.Okay!

1290,rangrnav,"Good performances, horrible writing",2,10 March 2020,"I like Margot Robbie. I like Ewan McGregor. They delivered good performances for the parts that were written for them, HOWEVER...
The overall writing was garbage. The plot was fairly easy to follow, but there were so many scenes that were so ridiculous and unrealistic that it detracted from the story. I get it, it's fiction, so it requires some suspension of disbelief, but just about every action scene is so flagrantly unrealistic that no degree of buy-in makes it believable. For example, even though this is a comic book movie, the main protagonist is a woman with no superpowers, but she is protected by plot armor of Star Warsian proportions. She is able to singlehandedly lay siege to a police precinct, in broad daylight, with a single-shot weapon, with virtually no resistance. All off the male police officers that stand their ground are handily pummeled by this 120lb woman, while the rest run away like scared schoolchildren(apparently cops aren't issued guns in this universe). This was a theme throughout the entire movie: aside from the main antagonist, all men were either bumbling idiots, cowards, or scumbags. But the middle-aged lady cop was able to handle close quarters combat with a bunch of goons no problem. Sure. The character with the most potential was huntress, but her arc fell completely flat. I'm still trying to figure out whether Mary Elizabeth Winstead phoned it in, or if she was scripted to be that dull and ineffective.
I came to this movie because my 14yo daughter wanted to see it, but the toxic themes espoused by it are not conducive to making well adjusted young ladies, and the main protagonist is not a good role model by any measure. This entire movie was a girl power, down with the patriarchy, virtue signal. Identity politics before story. A little research after the fact, and I find that the director pitched the movie as exactly that, and the powers that be at DC were happy to oblige. This virtue signaling, garbage is exactly why the DCEU is failing. One-off successes like Aquaman and Wonder Woman (who did a phenomenal job with a strong female lead) are not enough to overcome abject failures such as this. If they are going to survive, they need to listen to the fans, focus on good story and compelling characters, and stop hiring ""woke"" activist directors.",Birds of Prey

I like my female empowerment movies to be subtle, and this? Well it felt forced. The movie was action packed however the fight scenes were messy and not properly choreographed (when you can tell its the actor vs stunt double you know you didnt do a good job) I think Robbie is a GREAT HQ, (she really was the best part of SUICIDE SQUAD) but something felt a bit short here. Overall not the best...but could have been worst. With that said...PLEASE HIRE A NEW SOUND MIXER/EDITOR. This movie was obnoxiously LOUD. But of course ...I could barely hear the dialogue!

I would also like to say that it was weird when swapping between two different characters perspectives. It was very abrupt!Enough of the bad and on with the good! This movie was stunning!

Also great performance from Margot Robbie as usual, but this time she steals the show. There is some great choreography in fight scenes and that brings me to bad stuff.
The whole movie is basically Harley kicking everyone's ass. There is even a fight scene where a lot of big dudes trying to kill her and she perfectly owns everyone. Sometimes she does things as it seems like she has some superhuman skills.

It could have been funny with some good one-liners, but it didn't. I might have laughed once or twice, but more because of the absurdity than actual humor.
It could have been a nice Girl Power movie, but the girls have no depth. They were all so dull.
Whoever decided to go after an R rating for this moving, made a horrible decision. This should have been a fun, action filled comedic, anti-hero movie. Instead it just made me wish DC would stop making movies that ruin comic book characters for us all.

The fight sequences were all well done, and the acting was all good. Trolls most likely don't like it cause it's a very open movie.

Have any of y'all read her comics? The girl is nuts! Even her comics are all over the place and it's a great way to show how her mind works. The movie was done beautifully. I sympathized with the girls and it showed a lot of the struggles real women face in the work place.

I ALMOST didn't bother because multiple people said it was worse than Suicide Squad (which I hated). It's not.This is not a superhero movie. This is John Wick with ladies. It's not quite as good as John Wick, but still totally worth a watch.The story is fine, it's nothing mind blowing, but decent. A bunch of criminals and a cop become intertwined because they're all after the same thing. Then team up against the villain. The action is decent, it's not as violent as Wick, but it's that style (great choreography, no crazy fast edits, you can see what's going on). The cinematography and editing were good, and fit the bubblegum punk style.And Ewen McGregor goes ALL IN. He's so weird it's funny, but not funny bad, funny with how he pulls off such a weird but evil character. There's a bit of mediocre acting, but for the most part it's not bad.And as far as the criticism that it's just ""man-hating"" garbage, that's so wrong. Yeah, all the men they encounter are scumbags. But also, everyone they're around are criminal scumbags, so what would you expect? In fact, the way men treat women in this movie is probably the most realistic part of it. But the movie is about women. And if you have a problem with the fact that they're kicking the crap out of men... I don't know what to tell you.I'm not a fan of ""woke"" social justice bullhonkey being inserted into movies, tv, or comedy. This is certainly not that. It's a decent movie that's getting a bad rep.

1311,davidjunderwood,Just Very Forgettable,4,8 February 2020,"I liked this movie for about the first 20 minutes or so, but after that it just loses all momentum. The movie is essentially a fusion of ""The Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ""Deadpool"". But it is much less enjoyable than either of those movies. It's just action, forgettable character scene, more action, etc.
The parts of the movie I like were Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, doing a fun take of the character, no longer in an abusive relationship with the Joker, and Ewan McGregor as Roman Sionis. My biggest disappointed is Zsas, because I am a fan of the Arkham video game series and he just felt wasted here.
I would say skip this movie its just forgettable and not really worth your time or money. If I had to say watch ""Parasite"", ""Uncut Gems"", or ""1917"" if you want to see a movie in theaters, because none of these will disappoint.

The soundtrack is really great.It is one of the plus points of the movie. And the best thing is Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. Its literally the fantabulous emancipation of one (and only) Harley Quinn. May be the main title of the movie about Birds of prey. But to me its more about Harley Quinn, the anti heroine. That doesn't mean its bad, not at all.Using well established crowd loving character to build up a all women super team is a great idea. Plus all other characters also portrayed well by the actressesI didnt talk about the villain (or the villains) didnt I? Thats the biggest problem I found out in the movie. If Black Mask could have been a little bit challenging to the not yet established group of young (in experience for some of them) heroines, the movie would have been perfect. So far in the DCEU, the villains devision has been good.They are worthy villains for the heroes(except steppenwolf for Superman). Otherwise the movie is worth for your time. Plus being R rated doesn't hurt the movie in fact it fit with the tone of the DC characters.",Birds of Prey

The costumes are so colourful, great direction & the photography( in my opnion) is spot-on . It' just so much fun so why such negative reviews I do not understand( all written by blokes maybe-watch it again then fellas) How many of you loved 'Charlies Angels'? When I read negative reviews by critics 8 times out of 10, I have proved them wrong--in my mind. I believe Jurnee Smollett sang her own songs--well, what a voice !!- a true talent .

1318,teja-49372,Overall an enjoyable film,7,12 February 2020,"So I love Harley Quinn and was so excited to see this film and went it to it with high hopes. It did not disappoint.
The cast was incredible, each portrayed their character so well, with a great deliverance on lines. Margot Robbie was absolutely hilarious, a truly entertaining Harley. Whoever played the villain did a fantastic job. The actress who played Dinah though is the one who really stood out to me well watching, Full House fans may recognize her as she appeared on the show as a child. The movie was a joy to watch and full of laugh, from the jokes, to the awesome fight scene the movie was overall enjoyable.
What Keeps it from being great though is the fact that it's all over the place, which may be intentional since it's Harley who's telling the story, along with the fact that it's not exactly true to the comics but then again how often do comic adaptations stay true? Despite the movie being all over the place it was still quite easy to follow.

Which is a huge compliment considering the hole it had to dig itself out of because of suicide squad. The only redeeming part of suicide squad is and forever will be Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. And once again she is what makes birds of prey work. This movie had several flaws..... If it was a marvel movie I would have probably been disappointed. But Margot is the PERFECT Harley! And some of the fight scenes in this were flat out beautiful! It is like gymnastics met UFC. The biggest flaw of this movie is how predictable it is. But..... I understand the choice to make it fun but play it safe after the catastrophe that was suicide squad. This movie is fun, well shot, and worth the time. Imagine a female version of Deadpool, but the only fun character being Deadpool. I definitely want Robbie as Harley from now on and forever!

It is unnecessarily disturbing. Not exactly graphic but considering my 11 year old daughter was really waiting to see this movie-that ain't gonna happen-it's needlessly gruesome. This movie is too silly to take seriously and too serious to politely excuse as ""it's just a movie, lighten up!"" Almost everyone is horribly miscast except Margot Robbie. She's great! The writing is bad. The sets are bad! Man, the clothing is even bad, and I never notice such things. The villain (I won't say his name) from the comic book has been emasculated to the point of being more insulting than threatening. The implication is that he's a gay, psychopathic killer; if that's true someone at DC needs to learn how to make their gay psychopaths more ruthless (they missed the mark on Lex Luther in Batman vs Superman too).

Still, some of the fight seems were entertaining and I did actually enjoy Harley's hectic (but also kinda hard to follow) storytelling at the start.

1328,emmammurphy-77540,Does the idea of an all-female Deadpool 2 reboot excite you?,5,13 February 2020,"Then you'll probably like this movie fine. Granted, it's not an exact comparison, but the humour, plot elements, character archetypes, themes, even editing decisions are all reminiscent, and for me, it was at the point of distraction. When they were directly copying beats from Deadpool, it felt shoehorned in. The only thing that it doesn't quite copy, oddly enough, is how graphic the violence can be. This movie could be PG-13, and not lose much. It's not necessarily a bad direction: after all, DC has been criticized in the past for being too dark and edgey, and taking itself so seriously. Shazam and Aquaman have started to turn the tides a little.If you're a casual fan of DC, then you'll likely recognize these characters from shows like Gotham or Arrow, but if you're completely new to this universe, this movie does a great job of summarizing their backstories. One of the largest flaws with Suicide Squad were too many characters with so little time devoted to them that they were difficult to keep track of, let alone form legitimate connections to them. Fortunately, DC learns from their previous endeavours, and responds to their fanbase, which I think is really cool.Returning from Suicide Squad is Harley Quinn: the Joker's right hand woman. Coming back to this universe after the Joker's solo outing is a little jarring, but Margot Robbie fits the role like a glove. I like the scenario that they gave us. I'm sure it's been explored many times in other media, but I thought that it felt natural to the characters, to the world: it was a great set up, and it was, at least to me, very reminiscent of a comic book in how that aspect was portrayed.This is also an origin story for the Birds of Prey. We've had a lot of superhero origin stories as of late, and this one is pretty unconventional. Kind of (but not really) like watching X-Men Origins from the point of view of one of the guys they saved. Because so much of this movie is centered on Harley, and granted, she ties most of the cast together, but the core character of each Bird of Prey is a joke, or follows an aspect of patriarchy, with the exception of Cassandra Cain. Badass motorcycle riding crossbow wielding mafia princess? A complete try hard. A cop who's accomplishments have gone uncredited for years struggling to serve her city due to the lack of an encouraging work environment? Only speaks in 80s cop dialogue. Backstories that could have been interesting feel especially glanced over.
Again, at least these characters have recognizable character traits, unlike Suicide Squad. Honestly, I don't even mind their portrayal all that much: the actors do a great job of making their characters feel deeper than the writing allows. It's a way to weave humour in, and allows non-Harley portions to be slightly more engaging, instead of one note slogs. I connected to some characters more than Harley, and though I would have loved to learn more, I think anything extra would have been detrimental to the flow of the movie. What it is works fine.The movie will halt the story to go back in time to exposit plot information. Having a character as our narrator, it feels a little less awkward than it could have. Some of it feels redundant, and there's one inconsistency that really bugged me throughout, but you're not going to get lost in this story: it's pretty straightforward stuff.Ewan McGregor is a fantastic actor. His character, on paper, is the blandest villain archetype that you will ever see, with no real motivation, and no surprises. But he does a great job: there are moments with him, one or two in particular, that make you feel genuinely uncomfortable.It's colourful, the fight sequences are fun. The biggest goal of this movie was to be a female empowerment piece. There's a lot of danger to be had in that, a lot of scrutiny that the movie is putting itself under. It's not a great thing when you have to point out ""Look how progressive we're being!"", or demonizing half the population to make the other half look more in the right. It's very understandable if you get sick of it. The goal is equity, but examples of that are hard to come across in feature film.Here are a couple of things that I liked in that regard:
Showcasing a diversity of women, specifically ages. Not every character is 20 something with perfectly done makeup in skin tight spandex. Most are, but not all, and it's baby steps in challenging the standard for how females are represented.Allowing these characters to have imperfect lives. Big greasy breakfast sammies, cocaine, laxatives, and other such aspects that you wouldn't typically associate with female characters. Just little things that ground us in this world.Harley Quinn offering Black Canary a hair tie in the middle of the climax. I don't think we've ever seen anything like that before: not only is it practical, but it alludes to this deeper sense of community, this willingness to help one another out no matter who you are. That's a good message. Small gesture, but big meaning.We should always strive to judge something for what it is, not for what we want it to be. Is this a great film? No. But everyone I went with had the same reaction: ""Huh. That was better than I thought.""
It's not a long film, and the hour and a half isn't completely devoid of anything worthwhile. I probably won't be watching again, but I can't get as angry or hateful as some of the other reviews.You know what does make me angry? There are screenshots going around the internet of fans of this movie attacking the Sonic movie (which isn't even out as of writing) for having racial and homophobic slurs, allegedly in an attempt to keep Birds of Prey at the top of the box office. Some of them are jokes. Some are not.If you're one of those fans who are seeking validation, you're not going to find it here. Likely nothing in this review will change your viewpoint, but these actions go against the entire aspiration for Birds of Prey: striving for a better world in which working together, and supporting each other are normalized behaviours.Films are art, and each person should be entitled to their own interpretation, but it's always better to give it a fair shot first. It's sad when films are bogged down by controversy, especially when it's something so petty, and it's going to leave far more of a bad taste and impact Birds of Prey more than anything in the film's runtime.",Birds of Prey

They learned that Villains must have violence and profanity. Wrong again. The whole story of Birds of Prey needed no violence at all. If the movie is all about Harley making a name for herself and female empowerment, why are all the vilence necessary? They tried too hard to be Deadpool.What a waste for Margot Robbie.",Birds of Prey
1331,cwesten-60609,Just Above Decent,6,12 February 2020,"Compared to Suicide Squad it's an improvement for the DCEU.Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is great. This is her movie. Some have complained that because it's Harley's the movie shouldn't have been named Birds of Prey, but instead of been titled solely after Harley. I don't think it's a big deal and don't believe people should be angry with it being Birds of Prey.Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Helena Bertinelli/The Huntress, Jurnee Smollett-Bell as Dinah Lance/Black Canary, and Rosie Perez as Renee Montoya we're all good portraying their character who were the Birds of Prey. The movie could've, and should've, followed The Huntress. Compared to all of the main characters in this film The Huntress had the least screen time. The Huntress arguable had a bigger connection with the main conflict in this and should've been a bigger presence in the film. Black Canary was an interesting character. The film should've addressed an ability of Black Canary before near the end, which is my only complaint for the character. Renee Montoya was the weakest link in the Birds of Prey, but was still a fine character.Ewan McGregor as Roman Sionis/Black Mask was really good. I was really surprised how much I actually enjoyed Black Mask in this film. Black Mask was a grade A douchebag. The only issue with Black Mask was his motivation. I'm only going to say that his motivation wasn't great and obviously could've been a lot better. The film states that there are many reason why Black Mask might hate Harley, but the reason given for his hatred wasn't a good reason.Christina Hodson was the writer for the film. The story that she wrote was a pretty good story. The issue with it was that it was a nonlinear style story. The nonlinear style of the story is a real negative for the film. If you compare this film's nonlinear story telling to a film like Deadpool, it's easy to see that Birds of Prey failed to properly tell the story compared to Deadpool.Overall Birds of Prey was a fine movie. How the story was told was a major negative and should've been told in a linear story style. Black Mask was a really good villain, but should've had a better motivation. The DCEU has made improvements with their films, but still have some work to do.",Birds of Prey

On the end Harley is certainly girl who we can not judge as regular criminal or bad guy.",Birds of Prey
1334,GiritharanReviews,Freckin Fun Flick F**F**F,7,12 April 2020,"DC Comics after their great success on Wonder Woman, a Female Superhero comes with a bunch in Harley Quinn : Birds of Prey.
This movie has a Narrow Plot on Protagonist which gets wider when Co-characters introduced on screen as Fellow Partners of Protagonist. Harley Quinn is actually an Antagonist both as in comics and as similar in movie but we can't feel her as like it rather than filled with heroics and fun is my complete assurance. This movie may fail you in Story but not in entertainment.
Alongside Harley, Black Canary played by Jurnee Smolett done her best job will share more screen time next to Harley Quinn. Huntress played by Winstead is a deadly assassin with sad past and seek revenge same as like Deadshot, a DC Villain but Cute while in Crew(Birds of Prey). Atlast but not least Harley Quinn is full of Fun and will never miss you to entertain.
These are all Positives about the movie along with excellent Stunts and Visuals especially **Best Scene** in rescue of Cassandra is Favourites. While analysing about the movie I mostly felt that major of credits goes to Morgot Robbie played as Harley Quinn is great success for DC universe (fittest in playing Harley Quinn and any no one can replace her) I think they will also felt it as like audience. Watch out for Morgot Robbie's cute expressions and comedy along with other crew Winstead as Huntress and Jurnee as Black Canary performances.

This film certainly met many of these in my opinion.Margot Robbie was brilliant, endearing, awesome stunts and very intense but in a whole different level to the recent a Joker performance, but still very well played.
The story was weird but I followed it and it made sense despite jumping backwards and forwards, it's a style, accept it and move on.
All the Harlequin toys and props are there in the film, awesome and funny seeing them actually being used like the baseball bat, hammer and all the rest.
As for the Birds of Prey, yes, these were disappointing and this was the only let down in my opinion, but it's a starter movie, it's how she became independent of Joker, I'd expect a sequel to use them more and introduce them in a deeper way.
All in all, great, I hope it becomes a success and a sequel made",Birds of Prey
1341,totochris,Cut and paste (cg) videoclip movie,6,15 November 2020,"Margot Robbie is a good actress no doubt. Shame her talent never reaches it fullest potential. In this scene after scene compilation, because that is what it it is. More like a high school musical. Ideas pasted together in the best order possible.I will shortly mention two scenes (minor spoiler) ahead:
-
-
It is highly sacrilegious to have a great 'set piece' like the 'Amusement Mile' filled with weird CG surroundings and bad lighting. And let us not forget: (and how could anyone) the pop gangster music in most if not all of the action scenes, really guys? MTV is dead already!The police station scene and the Amusement Mile action is at times quite clever and fun to look at, different. Especially the last one like a funhouse. Shame about the endless slowmotions and horrible hip music. No orchestra, supensefull or 'fun fair/circus' music, that's sacrilegious enough!All in all it was amusing enough but there was no coherence in all of it. 6 out of 10. Arkham Games are way better in cinematic storytelling and setting a ""fitting"" mood. I rest my case.",Birds of Prey
1342,jakelanda1994,Exactly what you want. Action. Crazy. More Action.,7,29 June 2020,"While this is a clearly feminist movie, I - unlike the cellar-dwelling comic book fans all giving this 1/10 - have no problem with that. It was a much less ham-fisted approach to a feminist anti-hero feature than Ocean's 8, and thoroughly entertaining at the same time. It's no masterpiece but it's exactly what you expect turning up to a movie like this.Margot Robbie is fantastic as Harley Quinn. She's a once in a generation actress who does a great interpretation of the character. That's what movies are. Interpretation.If anyone is giving this below a 5/10 it's most likely because it didn't live up the the hyper-sexualised wet dream they had reading the comics. Spoiler alert - people don't make those movies because they're gross.",Birds of Prey
1343,homeofthefalcon,Are you kidding me?,3,8 February 2020,"OK let me start out with this: I love female characters - I am a man yes - but I really don't care what gender the character is, as long as it has been well written and performed. I could give tons of examples of movies where the female characters outshine (in my mind) the male characters - but let's just take Guardians of the Galaxy where Nebula and Gamora are my favorite characters... Ok...You know this is bad when I have to make a disclaimer first right? :-)I really wanted to love this movie... but... ""insert random profanities here""Ok the first and most important thing to point out is this: This movie seems to be very poorly managed. In fact, the action scenes looks like they aren't all part of the same movie - so I had to look it up. Some of the original action scenes were apparently SO BAD that they called in the guy who did the action scenes in John Wick to RESHOOT them ... and it shows! Those scenes + Margot is the only reason why I even give this movie 3 stars...The Birds ... holy s... I mean really? They are just so weak it's insane... and no I'm not talking physical strength or fighting prowess - but story telling - or lack there of. Poorly set up, ""out of the blue"" abilities, lazy lines... It's not even worth going on about it, since I already spend more time on this paragraph than the writers did on this script!The Black Mask/Roman Sionis - Ewan does what he can with this character, however it is the most generic villain of them all (in the comics) It is just ... WHY THAT CHARACTER? I mean SERIOUSLY DC - you are TRYING to build up the franchise - and on top trying to make this about female empowerment - then why the H... did you pair it with a throwaway antagonist? It makes 0 to little sense - unless you actually didn't care about this movie... which... is... what... it... feels... like. For crying out loud DC...... And lastly it commits the cardinal sin... it's just not funny. I mean I laugh very easily - and I think I smiled like 2 times through the whole movie and laughed 0. It's a movie with Harley Quinn... how am I not laughing - she is probably the funniest character in the DC catalog - or at least in the top 3...... so how did they manage to make me laugh 0 times?I literally can't grasp how people are giving this movie 9 and 10's ... Suicide Squad was better - and that says a lot since I hated it! Is it only because of the fact that it has a theme of ""female empowerment"" ... or is it a ""R rated superhero movies are AWESOME ALWAYS"" thing? I honestly can't think of anything else....Love you Margot - but you should never have signed up for this pile of incompetence!",Birds of Prey

1346,RoryIrish,I don't get it,6,2 March 2020,"This isn't really a movie.
It aspired to an R rating as a badge of honour, cutting out a huge chunk of teen girl audience but weirdly didn't use that R rating to be either explicitly violent or have a lot of swearing.
Harley is front of centre and I like Margot Robbie but there is zero peril in this movie. It moves from one incoherent sequence to another, focusing on colourful characters, but fails to make any of those characters remotely compelling.
This is not a movie - it doesn't go anywhere, doesn't add to Harley's mythology and features zero allusions to the D.C. universe other than mentions of The Joker.
It's just an odd, odd series of decisions masquerading as cinema.

1349,bamafanjrb,Liberal man hating garbage.,5,21 March 2020,I had high hopes for this movie after watching Suicide Squad. Terrible casting besides Margot Robbie. Terrible acting from the rest of the cast. Should have had The Penguin as the main antagonist and had Victor Zsas as his hired help. Roman Sionis wasn't even needed for this movie. Unnecessary foul language. I don't mind cursing in a movie but when every other word is a curse word it's a bit too much. Also too much man hating liberal b.s and here I thought that #metoo crap had went away.,Birds of Prey

1351,hanentr,Hits Strong with the Intended Audience,9,9 February 2020,"Birds of Prey is not trying to do what most MCU movies do and reach a broad audience. It's aimed at women who have been beaten down in life, whether by men in power, societal pressures, poverty, etc. To someone who hasn't experienced those things, characters may seem underdeveloped. But I didn't find this to be the case. The movie uses quite a bit of shorthand that many women will understand so that it doesn't need to spend too long on the backstories of five different women, and can instead jump into creating a dynamic between them. My favorite interactions were those between Harley and Cassandra, and those between Harley and Dinah.That's not to say this is a perfect film. The first 20-30 minutes jump around in multiple different time-frames, and can be difficult to follow. Once it gets rolling in a chronological structure, this problem disappears, and it becomes a well-paced wild ride. Secondly, many people have pointed out that the movie focuses much more on Harley than it does on the Birds of Prey. This is 100% true. If you're coming to see a Harley Quinn movie (which to be fair, is largely how it was marketed) you will be very satisfied. If you wanted more of a Birds of Prey movie, you may be disappointed. Finally, I'm not well-versed in the comic book lore behind most of these characters, but as I understand it the movie takes a lot of liberties with them, and their movie counterparts are essentially different people. This could upset fans of the books who were hoping to see these characters represented on-screen.However, if you're willing to look past these things (as I was) and you pick up on a lot of the subtext and implications, this is an incredible movie. In addition, the cinematography makes it a treat to the eyes. You could pause on almost any moment and have a great picture for your desktop. Finally, the action is fantastically choreographed, shot well, and the lighting makes it easy to see what's going on.I highly recommend this movie.",Birds of Prey
1352,c-wauters,What a monkey race...,3,27 March 2020,"I started watching this movie with chips, chocolade, peanuts, a few joints, a drink, under a warm blanket in an exciting way. I started smelling excrements after 10 minutes and the stench got worse by the minute. I didn't know where to look first anymore, that chaotic and confusing. That is: confusing is not the right word for it, therefor you first must have a storyline and there was no. The kind of storyline we got from this flick is the kind I write dozens of in a day if I wanted, while doing the dishes and playing with my cat. Come on Miss Robbie, you were on a roll, don't roll back, for God sake",Birds of Prey

In my opinion, Harley Quinn's character stands out when she is bantering with her ""new friends"" the viewer can feel the chemistry, but that happens just in the last bit of the movie. Another pro is the villain, Ewan McGregor gives such a great performance. Sadly there are missed opportunities in the tonal shifts of the movie from the first to the third acts, the men hating women portrayal that is just so in your face, and the resolution of the villain which felt anticlimactic. Also, the crew could have benefited from more screen time together. 1st 1/10 2nd 2/10 3rd 6/10. Total 3/10.",Birds of Prey

1366,rubin-79337,"Enjoyable, slightly convoluted",7,9 February 2020,"Birds of Prey has a good story, all the performances are great, and the movie is visually great. Margot Robbie continues to be great as Harley Quinn, making her even more wild with her narration. But the narration makes the story slightly difficult to follow, with continued flashbacks. Mary Elizabeth Winstead could have gotten more screen time, but she did well with what she had. Jurnee Smollett-Bell kicked ass as Black Canary, even though she only displays her powers once. Rosie Perez plays Renee Montoya as a badass who learns not to take crap from other cops, who are usually corrupt. Ella Jay Basco does a good job as a young Cassandra Cane, even though it's not really accurate to the comics. As for the villains, Ewan McGregor does a great job showing Black Mask's somewhat bipolar nature, going from calm to insane in an instant. Chris Messina is crazy as Victor Zsasz, making a pretty good interpretation of the comics.The film has great comedic timing, and the colorful visuals alone make it much better than Suicide Squad. It has shades of Deadpool and Guardians of the Galaxy without too being too similar. Take the film for what it is, an entertaining movie with some pretty good action, and some great jokes. Just because it's female led and the two main villains are men doesn't mean it's anti-men. Unfortunately, it likely won't have a large box office because of its R rating, along with it being marketed to a relatively younger audience. Strangely enough (not really), it's getting generally good critical reviews, so take that as you will.Lastly, that bacon, egg, and cheese looked really good so I don't blame Harley.",Birds of Prey

1377,jgreg-37981,Entertaining but a bit messy.,7,8 February 2020,"Birds of prey shows that DC has finally righted the ship after several early stumbles in this franchise. By focusing on smaller, more personal stories with more personal stakes. Birds of prey is a very entertaining movie, albeit one with some irritating flaws.Firstly, Cathy Yan directed the hell out of this movie. She really knows how to frame an exciting action scene with nice wide, full body shots to show off the great stunt work. The movies style and colour pallet are very eye catching and visually interesting. Margot Robbie continues to be excellent as this franchises version of Harley Quinn, and Ewen McGregor looks like he's having the time of his life as a sleazy but intimidating villain.Most of the movies problems for me come from the script. The first half is very messy as the movie bounces around and moves back and forth in a Rashomon attempt that really didn't work and kind of annoyed me. Once an action scene in a police evidence locker takes place though, the movie calmed down considerably and is a lot more watchable. Also, while the other members of the cast and the villain are entertaining to watch, they only have only surface level characterisation, seemingly interesting on the surface, but not really much underneath. Some ardent birds of prey fans may be disappointed in the lack of actual birds of prey, given about 85% of this is a Harley Quinn movie, which leads me to wonder if they side the birds of prey name for brand recognition only.In conclusion, birds of prey is a fun, colourful time at the movies, But some serious screenplay flaws prevent it soaring to the heights of the DCEU, but it comfortably pitches high above the trainwreck that was suicide squad.",Birds of Prey

1381,klarapeeters,Classic comic style Harley but not enough BOP,9,8 February 2020,"For those who've read some of the comics they'll agree that Harley isn't someone who necessarily plans everything before she does it which is what Robbie took into account when bringer her to life, things from the comics such as Hyenas and beavers were brought in the movie as well which is nice to see as a comic fan. Also in a scene towards the end we see officer Montoya wear one if Harley's bust plates which are quite reoccurring in the comics. Other characters weren't as developed and praised as Harley was (but she's the narrator so what can you do), This movie showed Harley really being and becoming her own person; her habits, her dress style her attitude in the outside world but didn't do the others justice. Huntress was boring with one mission which she fulfilled. Canary could've been made more interesting if they had included more of her screeches and vocal abilities and officer Montoya was boring too. Only the last 20 mins showed the characters come together. Great set and aesthetic design and even better makeup and costume.

1390,etherealtouch,A very heartbroken DC fan...,2,28 December 2020,"I wanted to like this movie. I really did. It suffered from a lot of issues. My chief concern is that the people that made the movie had only a preliminary understanding of 'Birds of Prey' and didn't quite comprehend its nature. Then rather than focusing on ensuring the basic building blocks were given the proper amount of care, added insult to injury by stuffing the movie full of unnecessary fluff.This is the nth time that newer movies have fantastic source material to work with but completely trip over themselves due to hamfisted messaging that makes the characters and plot suffer various inconsistencies. In addition it becomes fairly obvious about mid-way through the film that minimal attention was spared on a properly thought-out interpersonal dynamic and the setup that leads to it in the movie.I should clarify that I am in no way detached or unsympathetic to the monumental undertaking that translating a graphic novel/comic book/etc to cinema is. I understand that the product tends to turn into a caricature of the original that's glazed in creative liberties and changes but this is a bit much. The way that 'Birds of Prey' worked does not really match what is seen on screen. The changes are so significant and unnecessary that the entire basic premise no longer matches and fails in a rather fundamental manner. The kid was seriously like throwing a lego block into a 1000 piece puzzle and saying 'yeah, that works'.While I enjoy non-sequitur storytelling and character development, it truly seems as if this movie suffers from a lack of clear and concise boundaries. It feels like a hot mess that jumps from one thing to the next and doesn't really provide much in terms of emotional bond or build-up that makes me as a viewer feel invested in the characters and their plights.The villains and 'bad dudes' of Gotham were almost 90% of the time more fleshed out and methodical, even in the original portrayal of the Birds of Prey. What we're shown here is by far a very stark contrast that feels like it's from a completely different intellectual property and universe. It feels as if they're just hollow vehicles to try and propagate the obnoxiously polarized generalization of 'man bad, woman good' that so many people mindlessly succumb to these days.This had such tremendous potential that was wasted for all the wrong reasons. I think Margot Robbie was fantastic. While I don't care for the re-imagined version of Harley Quinn- I definitely think that she handled the role rather well and the mannerisms were fairly true to her character.I'm honestly seriously heartbroken about this. I was looking forward to this movie a lot despite my trepidation after having watched the absolute trainwreck that 'Suicide Squad' was.",Birds of Prey
1391,rmcgee-65362,Good for casual fans but bad for comic book fans,5,13 February 2020,"***If you dont want SPOILERS skip the bad***This movie had the good, the bad, and the ugly.THE GOOD: The overall plot was a fun little women empowerment promotion. Honestly the amount of female characters in comics it's only justified that something like this makes it to the big stage. The action scenes were really well done and the way most fought complied with their own ""style"". The costumes for the most part were well conceived. I particularly liked the approach for Huntress and Black Mask.THE BAD: Ewan McGregor was wasted in this movie. As far as his performance, it was spot on for Black Mask's personality. Sadly, he never actually gets to showcase what actually makes HIM particularly dangerous. He get relegated to a cowardly big bad that hides behind henchmen and gets taken out by a child. The worst part is you have such a talented actor as McGregor AND YOU KILL HIM OFF. I understand he may not have reprised the role in The Batman later on but why waste the talent without him really getting to showcase it.THE UGLY: For any comic fan, you probably already know what this is about. Cassandra Cain! In comics she is one of the most dangerous hand to hand fighters of all the Bat family. Basically this movie could have used Suzie from apartment 308 and not have changed the story one bit. Instead they decided to completely destroy any semblance to who Cassandra Cain really is. She was never taught to talk. She was taught to Express her emotions through combat by her father, David Cain. (One of the deadliest assassins in DC) In her first showing, Cassandra could momentarily hold her own against Batman himself as a 12 yr old. This movie delegate her to a bubble gum chewing, oblivious, horrible pick pocket. Cassandra becomes Batgirl not long after meeting Batman because she is capable of holding her own with little training from him. Most his training he gives her is to be less lethal. So how do you throw everything about this character out the window? The only resemblance between the movie and comic is the name and asain heritage. This character deserved SO much better. For those casual fans picture Hitgirl (from Kickass) but more serious and arguably more skilled.",Birds of Prey
1392,jeffreyhobson-94235,Best Harley Quinn adaptation ever,8,1 March 2020,The movie was great and entertaining and I can see where people give it bad reviews but super entertaining for me and I'm a movie critic.,Birds of Prey
1393,ProfGenki,Better than Suicide Squad but that isn't an achievement,4,31 August 2020,"A not so ugly film with very weak character development.
This movie does some things better than Suicide Squad but it is still not a good movie and average at best. I do not know the comic origins of Birds of Prey so i only can rate it as a film.
Acting was ok most of the time, Margot Robbie was the best part and the other actors were average at best. Movie looks flashy and colourful, cinematography was good at times but nothing interesting or new.
The action sequences were absolutely bad. Although i appreciate that they filmed most of the action scenes with wide shots, but their movements feel unnatural, the choreography is lame and you can tell to 80% of the time that the actors/stuntmen are waiting for their sequences.
I gotta admit that i always like these kind of movies. You know deadpoolish kind of thing. Movies that doesn't take it too seriously with an exaggeration of jokes. But Birds of Prey really misses the point on what makes such movies so great and that brings me to my main concerns about Birds of Prey.
You need freaking well written characters and have an understanding how to write good jokes! And this movie has none! Harley Quinn is just brainless and this is her actual character! She does goofy things gets in a lot of trouble and always gets away with it not because she outsmarts them, no, because her opponents are even lower IQ than her. All her jokes aren't smart or well thought out. Example: a guy trips over and landed on his head, she says ""gotchya uhuhaha"". I actually made that up, because I don't even remember one single joke from the movie and believe it or not, this is the calibar of jokes you will get. Policelady is an absolutely generic character and all her relationships with her collegues, her ex and Harley is 0 developed, and that begs the question: Why does she want to be in the Birds of Prey?! Because they are cool together in the last 20 min.? By joining them she overcomes her problems? Or just cause..
The same goes to Black Canary. Generic and she doesn't really have a developed relationship to all the other characters as well, and not even to the little girl. Her interractions with her in act 1 and 2 is less than 1 min. combined. But it is enough for this movie I guess. Roman and Huntress have most potential in my opinion. Roman could have been much much better. Why not gave him some philosophical reasons with an obsession to art (skinning faces) they instead gave him, once again, smth generic: HE WANTS MONEY AND POWER. I guess its too hard to write smth with depth and twist. Huntress could have been interesting as well, at least it shows her motivation why she wants to kill all these ppl and some background story. But in the end most of the time she is the bottom of a not-so-funny-joke.

Amazing fight choreography and visuals that give this movie a lot of personality. I enjoy how the fight scenes aren't just gun fights and are creative and well-thought out. Don't expect anything deep or profound though, this is a simple superhero themed movie at it's base, but with a quirky attitude that is refreshing to see among the superhero movies that take themselves way too seriously. Executing a simple idea well is better than fumbling the execution of a complex one. I thought the main characters were all equally likable and interesting with depth and though the ending was abrupt, I thought it was weirdly fitting for the movie.Unfortunately we live in a world where an action film starring women is somehow offensive and ""political"" to men.

Well, it's all about a woman (Harley Quinn) who was powerful because of the joker but when they broke up she is nothing but a helpless girl. What she wants is that everyone is still 'scared' of her without the joker. The movie is just about getting equal. Woman are the same as men. I was more expecting a good action movie.

I see a lot of people criticize this movie's choice to tell it's story. The film jumps around as it gives you information for the scene your about to see. I personally loved this choice because it really put you in the mind of Harley Quinn. I loved when the film freeze framed and would show chaotic vandalism-like drawing over the frame (presumably written by Harley). It just helps put you in her mind. Also this direction of story telling was also in Deadpool and people praised that film (because it's amazing) and didn't even bring up how it told it's story in such a chaotic way. Honestly, the chaotic story telling works better with the character of Harley Quinn anyways because she's a psychopath.

Why it was originally called birds of prey I'll never understand, as they're barely in the film until the last 20 minutes. Most of the action is fun and surprisingly brutal at points, however the story is not engaging and changes nothing in the larger scale of the DCEU. The only NEW character that I genuinely enjoyed, Ewan McGregor as The Black Mask, gets killed at the end. I was really hoping he'd be back for more as every time he was on screen, my eyes were glued.

The new guy I'm using is also an American, but more of a mid west agricultural type, bit daft but means well sort of thing, and he gets straight to the exercises without trying to convince me that organic chia seeds aren't just dried ants made to taste like cow pats.Having finished my half hour sesh with billy bob and eating an exciting root and stamen salad, we stuck the movie on, and for the first half hour I remember being reasonably entertained, I recall one scene in particular saved me from having to gauge my eyes out with a teaspoon from boredom, but it also brought on the biggest wave of sleepy tiredness I'd felt in a long time, one of those rare and amazing sleepinesses where you know you're falling asleep, and you know it's going to be brilliant.Needless to say I woke at the end of the movie, and my partners facial expression of ""meh"" suggested that hitting rewind was in no way a priority over more sleep, so I waited until the next day to watch the rest, and can safely say my partners facial expression spoke a thousand very accurate words. It's just ok, and while some of the acting was clearly being done by those who had acted before, and as such was passable, there were clearly quite a few actors for whom this was a first outing, or who just wanted a 9-5'er acting equivalent pay check, and who will clearly realize that acting isn't for them when they see it, and who will hopefully then get employment where being filmed with a camera isn't a requirement. We can but hope.Anyway we are watching Air Force One for the first time this evening, and it's a rest night from bouncy bands with billy bob, so I'll hopefully be able to matchstick my eyelids through the whole thing.

The actors all feel right in the roles especially having reas a myriad of comics featuring them. If you're a fan of Gotham Central or the Geoff Loeb Run of Batman you'll dig this. The messages are not shoved down your throat and if you're just having fun with it you may not even really notice them.Robbie McGregor and Winstead are the standouts but everyone comes ready to the party.Give your 10$ and go see it.

I'm almost sure most of them just thrive on being a contrarian.Anyway, Margot Robbie is great as Harley Quinn and the rest of the cast is great too with some amazing chemistry between all of them. The art direction and visual style give this film an unmistakable identity that wouldn't be rivaled until James Gunn's The Suicide Squad. Really the only valid criticism I can understand is the differences between comic Cassandra Cain and the films interpretation, but even then that doesn't make the rest of the film any less entertaining. And I think it's made up for with the 2nd best version of Harley Quinn outside of the comics, best is obviously the Batman Animated Series. Cathy Yan does a great job and I would love to see her at the helm of another DC movie, maybe a Gotham City Sirens movie with Gunn as producer. One can dream.",Birds of Prey

Margot Robbie is great as HQ but this movie gave her an absolutely terrible story arc that was something you have seen in better movies, many times.

IMDb users sure are flinging a lot of shade at this ""woke, anti-men PC"" flick.Well, that's a bunch of bull and makes me question how many of those reviewers have even seen it. For one, the film makes no big deal at all out of its heroes' genders, but two... egads, the action! How could one watch this movie and not gush about the blisteringly inventive choreography? I lost track of how many fights there are, but there are a few prolonged setpieces that got the very small crowd at my theater hollering like it was a packed house.Some fights remind me of a very darkly humorous take on Jackie Chan's work, and honestly, I'd say it has some of the most entertaining fight scenes I've seen since his 80s Hong Kong heydey.The soundtrack is another standout, and the film is often quite in sync with it (akin to Baby Driver), which made for some really groovin scenes. And I can't end this review without mentioning Ewan McGregor, whose madcap, unhinged performance as a gangster who just wants to have a really good time is an absolute delight. He lights up the screen and owns every second he's in.I'm not the biggest fan of comic book movies (I've seen everything from Marvel and a couple DC films), but Birds of Prey is one of the most fun times I've ever had in a theater.

It's more as the movie over than Suicide Squad (way better), and Margot Robbie was totally born to play Harley Quinn this makes her becoming a Powerhouse actress.Without Robbie, Harley and the movie wouldn't work at all. Not just it's a solid Harley Quinn movie, this also blended into the origin story of Birds of Prey's women that so perfectly well done. All I can says is that I want 10 more of Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn movies and the BOP's women stand-alone movie for sure. The most genius point of the movie is this had Rashomon's storytelling style and the action-sequences are in the same style with John Wick and Atomic Blonde that will pleasing the audiences a lot ! This movie will gives a lot of opportunities to Cathy Yan to do a lot of great female-action movies in the future, and it's satisfying breakthrough for her as well. Great cast with Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rosie Perez, Jurnee Smollett-Bell are fantastic and Ewan McGregor's best role since Obiwan Kenobi. Great soundtrack too, and it's a much better female empowerment movie than 2019's Charlie's Angels that also a big middle finger to Elizabeth Banks too, basically, it's the best #MeToo movie we got so far.It's a must for DC's hardcore fans and female's audiences, Recommended this in IMAX.",Birds of Prey
1461,edwincervantes70,A decent and watchable film that ironically doesn't live up to its title.,7,2 April 2020,"The DCEU has had a rocky start. It started modestly with Man of Steel dividing critics and audiences, only to further polarize them with Batman v. Superman and Suicide Squad. Then came Wonder Woman which has been DCEU's first and greatest film to date, only to repolarize critics and audiences with Justice League and once again slowly reimproving with Aquaman and Shazam.
I was very agnostic on this movie from the movie trailers alone. On one hand, I was looking forward to it given how much better the DCEU was in producing their stories. On the other, the trailers looked too promising as I saw more of Harley Quinn than the Birds of Prey themselves (speaking of which, Barbara Gordon does not appear in the movie despite being one of the main characters). However, by the end of the movie I was more impressed than disappointed as it was another fine addition to the DCEU both as another cohesive story and beating the MCU with the film's first rated R flick.The movie starts off well with a brief but comical introduction of Harley Quinn in the likes of Deadpool, complete with some breaks of the 4th wall throughout. Despite the rushed break up between Harley and the Joker (their relationship which we never further explored after Suicide Squad), the movie gives her a clear purpose to find herself amid her newfound freedom and goes on an outrageous journey through Gotham looking for Cassandra Cain, a pickpocket who steals a valuable diamond from Roman Sionan (Black Mask) and Victor Zsasz. Along the way the movie quickly introduces the other characters including: Renee Montoya (who gets caught up in Harley's way while investigating mob killings), Black Canary (who has a partial grudge with Montoya and the GCPD, in general, after her own mother's demise as an informant for Roman), and the Huntress (who seeks revenge against those responsible for murdering her family).Despite not really being faithful to the comics, there's plenty of action with it's well choreographed fight scenes such as at the police station and the carnival, and a good enough appealing storyline that keep the keep the momentum going from beginning to end. The cast of characters give pretty decent performances, especially Margot Robbie as Harley herself, Jurnee Smollett as Black Canary, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead who is amazing as the Huntress.Despite this, there were certain downsides to the movie. The movie's villains, for instance, fell short as I felt they were killed off prematurely. Victor Zsasz, for instance, dies before even posing an actual threat to Harley or the other women, despite being a prominent villain in the comics. Similarly, despite a great performance by Ewan McGregor, his Black Mask character dies in a somewhat anti-climactic matter as he doesn't get to be a formidable foe to Harley beyond generic kidnapping and extortion, and also despite being a recurring villain in the comics.The film does end on a modest note with Harley and Cassandra Cain enjoying their newfound freedom and wealth from the diamond while Dinah (Canary), Helena (Huntress) and Rene become the Birds of Prey taking it upon themselves to fight crime. This film was ironically a good film with a misleading title less than accurate portrayal of certain comic book characters. If they just called this movie The Emancipation of Harley Quinn, not only would the title have been more appropriate as Harley is the main protagonist, but also it redeemed the character after the not-so-stellar performance of Suicide Squad. This is a film I could see again and again but I just wouldn't call it Birds of Prey because it's not.",Birds of Prey
1462,ericschi,Robbie and McGregor are brilliant!,8,10 March 2020,"Went in with no expectations, loved most parts of it.The parts where Robbie is on screen it really feels as chaotic as Harley Quinn is. High paced, mad and quirky as it should be. It really represent the character.McGregor as the over the too bad guy (is that snot?) was well done. Yeah he's a bit one dimensional but shows that one side in all it's facets. Proper performance from him.The bits where neither were on screen the movie felt very flat. The story of the cop wasn't needed and added nothing. I'll make an exception for Winsteads performance, she did alright.I wasn't bothered by the feminist bit, with zero male characters doing something right and I could accept the group of women bonding.

(Animated series was great and Suicide Squad was pretty damn good) I can sit through most movies and with being stuck in quarantine I figured this would be a fun actiony comedy. It is not..or was not. I only made it 30 minutes and felt what little is left of my soul leaving my body. It's cheese and not in the good way. Fight scenes have so many cuts in them you may have a seizure. The narration was positively unfunny, more cringe or plain boring than anything. My eyes still haven't recovered from the amount of rolling they've done.
My favorite part in the 30 minutes I was able to sit through was watching a sandwich get made.I'm trying to think of a movie that would induce more suffering than giving that one another try...I honestly can't.

Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is easily the best thing in the movie. Every scene she's in is gold.As much as I like this film, it's not perfect. The scenes that don't feature Harley Quinn weren't nearly as interesting, and Ewan McGregor is fun but not very believable as the main villain. The scenes also feel a bit disjointed at times. For example, there's this big action scene where Harley Quinn takes out a bunch of cops, and then afterwards, the film goes back to explain why this scene is happening, and the flashback goes on for a long time.Another minor nitpick: this is very much a Harley Quinn movie and, despite the movie's attempt to develop their characters, the Birds of Prey feel completely secondary by the end. Yet for some reason, this movie is called Birds Of Prey with Harley Quinn being given a subtitle. Why didn't they just call it Harley Quinn & The Birds Of Prey right from the start?

Next to her stood Ewan McGregor as Black Mask who I thought was also a wonderful cast choice and did not disappoint with his interpretation. I walked in open-minded for the Birds and was pleasantly surprised by Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who I would love to see again, but on the other hand, not convinced of Jurnee Smollet's Black Canary (who btw happens to be one of my favourite DC heroines). I'm always open for multiple interpretations of already established comic book characters, but something in her depiction lacked that gave me NO Canary vibes at all. Else, Chris Messina as Victor Zsasz was trouble-free to watch so that I was definitely fine with it, but nothing outstanding. Ella Jay Basco's performance as Cassandra Cain was good acting-wise, but the writing of the character maybe not bad, but also very plain with space to work with. Would love to see her grown to the badass she's known for! And well, Renee Montoya, I hate to criticize, but she was the weakest of them all. The plot wouldn't be much different without her so that it's not just Rosie Perez ""fault"" but the writing.All in all, the script was mediocre, but it was very fun to watch and visually great. The 'feminism' people seem to be put off by is subtly applied, thus not try-hard at all. It's just a movie with strong fighters as leads that happen to be females, nothing to complain! This comes from someone who's easily irked (not angered!) by 'in-your-face-feminism'.If you're going to watch this, please do it without expectations, don't hope for an oscar-worthy movie, be open for it and you will certainly enjoy it just as I did :)!",Birds of Prey

I dunno, I was expecting much more, but I just found myself, well, bored. So much exposition, this movie didn't know if it wanted to be clever, sexy, action, or thriller. The praised fight scenes? Maybe I missed them? Gore? I mean, maybe? Nowhere near modern action movie amounts. All I learned from this movie...Men bad, women strong, Harley loves breakfast sandwiches.",Birds of Prey
1500,jcjhgames,My ONLY complaint for the movie is its name,7,11 February 2020,I really loved everything about this movie but I belive its becasue I didnt have the same expectations as some people did. If you go in thinking it's a Birds Of Prey movie I can see how you would be sadly disappointed. But I never once saw it as a Birds Of Prey movie its Harley Quinn's movie with some side action of the Birds Of Prey.

This is a great movie with some confusion and minor plot issues.Great fight choreography, Some really solid and enjoyable acting performances by its various stars. The soundtrack is rocking, it's funny, action packed, and some awesome scenes (the fight in the police station is worth it for admission alone).In the negative column, the plot at times feels a little confused, and not in the sense that this is Harley Quinn being an unreliable narrator, in the sense that they had some issues figuring out what they were doing. But it really doesn't detract from the my enjoyment of the movie.The birds of prey were kind of robbed as this is definitely a Harley Quinn movie first. Huntress in particular needed more screen time.But again, this movie was a lot of fun. Looking at the negative reviews people have left (one and two stars) I wonder what the hell movie they were watching. But it wasn't this one.

To much going on the entire time, set looked cheap compared to other comic movies, but that's kind of dc universes MO. Nothing will touch the first few Batman's with Nolan as the director.

1514,pinkbunnies1772-1,Probably the best DCCU film so far,8,8 February 2020,"This film delivered on fronts for me, it's a solid action movie. The cast was without a doubt the best part as they all shine in their own ways and through some masterful direction fit together with ease. Even with Robbie's immense screen presence, it doesn't feel like as much of a ""Harley Quinn show"" as I expected. Rosie Perez chewed up the scenery every chance she got and the world is truly a better place for it. Jurnee Smollett-Bell brought a real ""blacksploitation"" feel to the movie. I would have loved more of Winstead's Huntress but I understand why they didn't give her as much focus to the story. Hopefully we get a sequel where we can get more of her awkward badassery. Ewan McGregor was such a great villain, he felt truly vile and petty, giving us such a fun character to root against. Last but absolutely not least, Ella Jay Basco was delightful. That kid has one hell of a future in Hollywood if she decides to stick with it.The action is non-stop and flows from brightly colored setting to brightly colored setting with ease. The fight choreography is brutal, just over the top enough to make sure you know it's a comic book movie, and with plenty of moments to get a crowed reaction. It's violent, vulgar and grimy feeling in the best of ways.The amount of love and care that Margot Robbie has for her character and her drive to set up this story (and I hope this leads to more BOP and Gotham City Sirens films) shines through more than anything. She fought tooth and nail to get this movie to happen and we have ended up with what is in my opinion a very good candidate for the best DCCU film thus far, which is saying something because Wonder Woman, Shazam! and Aquaman were all pretty excellent.While not a perfect movie, it's damn good. 8/10.",Birds of Prey

Harley Quinn takes the film and the rest of the cast has every perfect moment to shine, although they should have had something else. It is realistic and its photography together with the production design is very striking and original. Ewan McGregor is perfect although he would have given more prominence. Huntress and Black Canary are very
interesting, although they lack screen time. It is full of action which is very good and well choreographed, and each character has his battle style. The rhythm of a moment is boring.

I was very pleased with how  they made the fight scenes from the women involved. They didn't make anyone seem ""weak"" or push the ""woman"" card and as a woman I loved that.

I thought it was going to be another R-rated superhero film that tried to push the envelope, and while it was certainly an R-rated film, it was very enjoyable with the R-rating content feeling not forced but a smooth fit for the film.The characters and cinematography are colorful and energetic. The film is told very non-linearly, but it fits Harley Quinn's hyperactive stream of consciousness perfectly, making her the perfect narrator.A lot of flack is given towards the film regarding not the subtitle, which seems to be the main plot to this film, but its main title, which seems developed on the side.Yes, the characters are sort of sprinkled in as the film goes along, but I prefer this over Suicide Squad's character intro assault from the beginning of that film. This feels natural and builds up to the inevitable Birds of Prey that this film advertises.It feels messy, but the sort of messy when you have sweets all over your fingers.

Did you really watch your movie before releasing it? Did you take criticism on board?Director, the flow felt off, a good example is the big fight scene towards the end! A simple fix, slightly speed up the frame rate and the fighting would have made the fight seem real rather than a rehearsal take on slow Mo.The style of filming, well just watch the movie, disjointed with different styles but adding nothing to benefit, the lighting, the speed and so much more was just off.If you think I'm being cruel and insensitive then think about the actor's and actresses you let down.If you want it fixed then I'm willing to help as it wouldn't take much with the right people at my side but try and save it.To the producers, you had an opportunity to make a movie with real impact...

1555,NesteaZen,not as bad as people make it out to be,7,6 May 2020,"So I'm a somewhat avid youtube user and the youtube male drama scene made the movie out to be way worse than it actually is, probably because of how the movie or ewan mcgregor promoted it. What I believe went wrong with how he promoted it is he tried to compensate for what a psycho and slight misogynist he's playing in birds of prey, and wanted to make sure that people don't perceive him that way off the screen xD.The movie is lacking that special something to be an 8 but it's definitely not a 6. Cinematography, acting, visuals are top-notch. The only thing lacking is Gotham's grittiness (in certain scenes, they seem to be jumping back and forth, I'm not sure how I feel about it). Visually the movie is great, especially the scene where she enters the police station.Story-wise it isn't any worse either. I'm rating this as someone who hasn't read the comics and we always have to be realistic: it's very hard to translate comics into film.She splits up with Joker (and funny enough the Joker that I'm seeing is Jared Leto most probably because of Suicide Squad (can't stand that guy)) and the whole town is out for revenge mainly because she was Joker's girlfriend and now a bunch of psychos want to exact revenge on her personally, and for still being somewhat of a proxy to the Joker. All in all I thought this movie would be way worse. I've seen worse SJW in the MCU. I haven't actually planned to watch the movie given all the drama it came with, but I thought I would give it a try.The only other thing I would complain about is the lack of stunt-doubles they used. It's very admirable that the actors did most of the stunts and fighting choreography themselves but it's really hard to remove the human physical slowness and show fast and fluid hero-like movement in fighting scenes. In that regard it looks a bit dated.The title is fitting, Joker splits from her and she's tries to redefine her life.

Ewan Mcgregor as a bad guy was really fun to watch and Chris Messina was incredible. The story was fun, plain and simple, and I would absolutely recommend you watch this movie while stuffing your face with candy on a saturday night. The action wasn't really top notch until that last fight, I loved the roller skates. One review said this movie was ugly, but I have to disagree. It has none of those horrible green/yellow/grey tones that some actions movies do. I enjoyed the colour palette and outfits. Oh and Ella Jay Basco hopefully has a successful career ahead of her!",Birds of Prey

Tries to shock with the swearing in a comic book setting. Some of the scenes are like a violent version of the 60s Batman TV show.

It's like DC tried to make a Deadpool, unfortunately they failed, big time!!",Birds of Prey

No, there are no men being replaced by women here,
no there are not outright downgrading of men here,
but simply that all men are depicted as...business like toward women. Even the nicest men Harley knows end up doing something that can be seen as not nice toward her.The story just flows smoothly. The cut are tight and the storytelling is quite entertaining with interesting way to use flashback. The characters are delivered with best performance possible by the actors. Highlights are Rosie Perez's Montoya and Chris Messina's Zsasz. Well, of course Margot Robbie's Quinn is delivered as crazy beautiful girl, and Ewan Mc Gregor's Black Mask is delivered as sadistic flamboyant with great performances, but Montoya and Zsasz are delivered here naturally. Well, as natural as stressed out, underrated smart detective and slice-happy psychopat as possible.Mary-Elisabeth Winstead's Huntress unfortunately is barely in the movie, but when she appears, she's just great. A bit of socially awkward crossbow toting assasin, Black Widow if she's not selling her sexiness if you will.Jurnee Smollet-Bell's Black Canary is so on point.

If they wanted HQ-centric superhero movie, they should have filmed a Gotham Sirens instead. Otherwise, it's a well-acted and action-filled flick with some good and some not-so-good jokes.

To be honest, I don't see where any one of them are accurate. I am a big fan of the Gotham universe and right away, I could pick up references from DC's New 52 line; Harley Quinn: Hot in the City Voume 1 (I prefer graphic novels over comics) and found myself submersed in her world.The fourth wall narrating didn't do it for me, but I wouldn't call it a complete mess or disaster. I just found it didn't complement the movie in it's entirety.Harley Quinn; I would love to see someone argue a better casting than Margot. She's something special and pays homage to the character beautifully. I read a post that said she is 'dangerous and deranged' but it wasn't displayed. I beg to differ. She was completely compulsive and displayed maniacal behaviours.Roman Sionis; Ewan McGregor... well there is something sinister about him that works well. The 'fight or flight' displayed is how I image it when reading graphic novels.Supporting cast also worked well to complement the visions and direction of Cathy Yan.Verdict; while the beginning isn't my first preference of submersing viewers into the on screen world, Birds of Prey: and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn is a fun fast paced, whack'em with your hammer kind of movie. My only wish is that we would stop with the labelling of this movie and see it for its core purpose: entertainment.",Birds of Prey

And polic knocks on the door and then as they are about to escape from the window there is a guy at the window who catapults a bomb looking ball in the house now things which are wrong with scene are multiple.
1. The behaviour of HQ is not consistent with this gril. She is caring and friendly to her and then she just doesn't care.
2. How are they planning to run through a window second or third floor. Were they planning on jumping out?
3. To top it off she calls for Bruce the pet Hyna to take it with her. How?
4. The ball looks more like a rubber band and less like a balastic device.
5. There is damage to very specific areas of the flat. It looks bad and fake.
6. Once HQ realises that she has been sold out by his faviourite restaruant owner she runs down to find him - where is the police now which knocked on the door at the start of this scene?
7. Why would this guy sell the info to the police when prize on her head was from the villain.I skipped through the movie and thankfully I watched it on computer but I still ended up wasting half an hour of my time.

1593,jmurray5521,I don't understand the hate at all,8,30 March 2021,"I would like to preface this review by saying I am a massive DC Comics nerd and also a man, so all these guys saying that ""only feminist women who don't understand the comics like this movie"" are completely wrong.The hate this movie gets makes no sense to me at all. This is a stylish, superhero comedy with excellent directing, acting and action. The cinematography during fight scenes was just beautiful and the fact that they are allowed to show graphic violence makes them so brutal.Also, the comedy lands so well. It's so strange to me to see the same people who give Deadpool and Guardians of the Galaxy high ratings give this such a low one, in my opinion it tops Deadpool in the comedy department.I would say the only weakness in this movie (for me) was the portrayal of Black Mask, only simply because I prefer his comic counterpart. That being said, I don't mind most of the changes to these characters in comparison to the comics, I thought Margot Robbie's performance as Harley was absolutely fantastic, it really shows of her version of Harley without that awful script that was Suicide Squad. Jurnee Smollett gives such a strong performance as Canary, while I know she is very different in the comics, I liked the different approach to the character. Mary Elizabeth Winstead did a great job, I just wish they had fleshed her out a bit more, but still she was very good and had an intriguing backstory. Ella Jay Basco gives one of the most convincing child performances I've seen in a while, it would be really cool to see her as batgirl one day. Lastly, Rosie Perez was great as Montoya, who I was happy to see finally get a big role in a movie since she plays a big part in many comic stories and the animated series. Comic book movies change characters all the time, I don't know why everyone cares so much with this movie specially.I seriously do not understand the hate, here we have a movie that doesn't give a crap and is willing to show us some graphic fight scenes with great choreography and comedy which lands and isn't cringy, like in previous DCEU films, and some great performances, and every hates it. I'm 99% sure that this movie is just hated because men have to hate movies dominated by females for some reason.

Whatsername that played the heroine was ok, but no one could have saved this vacuous muck from the bin and I strongly advise her to keep away from comic book films if she wants a career ... Another one of these and I'll think twice if I see her name attached to anything ...

Decent soundtrack, acting is great (for the most part) and I personally thought Ewan McGregor was the most fun to watch. His character (Black Mask) was not the same character from the comics. The same can be said about every other character in this movie. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is about as good as you can get casting wise. No signature outfit though. Wardrobe overall was not so good. I liked ONE action scene, the police station. Very well directed probably my favorite scene. The other action moments just were not as well done in my opinion. They went out of there way to make every man a bad guy, like unrealistically. A cop character is held back because her partner got a promotion for her work, and he is keeping her down. Other scenes with the men talking down to the women. The singer ""It's a Man's World"". It just felt like they were beating you over the head with it. If you are a fan of the source material, I am sure you will be disappointed. This is NOT a Birds of Prey film, it is a Harley Quinn movie. And none of the characters are represented as they were in the source material. Cassandra Cain is the worst offender by far! The character misrepresentation pretty much tanked the film for me. The writer, director and Margot Robbie herself claimed they were researching the characters and wanted to make it great. This is probably what bothers me the most. If they did research the source material, they seemingly tossed that aside and just get character names.

Not that I don't love to sit back and rewath all the different Batman remakes too.This movie let's the characters have fun, it definitely reminds me of a lot of the humor that I loved in the first Deadpool. So if you are a Marvel fan then come in thinking it's most in style of Deadpool. I also have no idea why I see reviews of people saying the violence is played down, I laughed so hard during an explosion that blew a guy apart that another person in the theater felt the need to comment afterward. So, yeah, snapped legs, people literally blown to bits, etc.It's funny, the action is amazing and you'll enjoy yourself.

Just some of the words that spring to mind after watching this at the weekend.
Let's start with the main character: Harley. While as a character in an ensemble piece she came across as one of the plus points, hanging a whole movie on her actually just shows the character is as annoying as Jared Leto's joker.Then there's the script/plot, which jumps all over the place and doesn't really seem to know what it's doing or where it's going - one flashback piece lasting so long that when it returned to the correct timeline I'd forgotten that we were even in a flashback!
There are some pretty violent scenes in the movie, but they feel completely out of place and are handled badly.
Then there's some of the fight scenes where it is very easy to see people actually pause and/or move in to position to get hit by the main characters.... sack the stunt coordinator!I won't go too much in to the whole ""storming a police station with a bean bag and glitter gun"" scene, because quite frankly, the fact that isn't actually a dream sequence and is presented as actually happening in the film is beyond a joke. Gotham City... violent Gotham city - and the police don't pull a gun on someone storming the percent....

1625,virematthew,The bad reviews are BS,9,7 February 2020,"First of all I apologize for the spoilers but to give the right review it requires that I include them. Secondly I apologize about the length of this review but I just have a lot to say. This movie was one of the most overall entertaining movies I've seen in the past year or two. Let me tell you why and I'll start with the small stuff. Costumes, hair and makeup, set direction. The colors in this movie are used for a reason. They reflect Harley Quinn's personality. She's glittery and funny and exploding with character. She's a ""colorful"" character. It also fits with the fun female aspect of the movie which a lot of people complained about. I wouldn't really call it a feminist movie. But even if it was why is that a problem?? You don't have to agree with the feminist movement but it's extremely relevant right now. So many movies are focused on macho men. A lot of times overly muscled and shirtless for no real reason other than SEXUALIZING MEN. A female-led cast is very refreshing and fun and I hope we see more of this in pop culture in the near future and for a long time coming. One thing I thought was interesting is that I didn't think they overly sexualized the women. At least not as much as they could have. The plot wasn't focused on sexual relationships and there was no nudity which I kind of expected there to be. Some people complained that it was all about beating up men. I agree that that theme is seen throughout the movie. Making all the men out to be bad guys that use and betray women. But I think that fit for a movie that is driven by girl power. That's how it should be. That's the fit of the genre so anybody complaining about that is an idiot that's missing the obvious point. The movie is about women that are used by men who think they own them. It's about women that are looked over and treated as lesser than. It's not like that in all of modern society but it does happen and that needs to be talked about. It needs to be exposed. These women in the movie got revenge on the men who wronged them just like any woman OR MAN would and should want to. Harley was right when she said that SHE was the one Gotham should fear. She didn't need Mr. J to protect her and she proves that throughout the movie. So don't complain that it's some sort of feminist movement statement because even if it is that doesn't mean it isn't a good movie!! Next point. The humor. The humor was consistent throughout the movie and I never really felt any cringe moments. I enjoyed the humorous narration. I enjoyed the slapstick violence humor that is seen throughout action comedies with both men and women. The use of language was done well even if there could've been less of it but who really cares?? Margot's facial expressions were brilliant!! Far better than in Suicide Squad. The whole getting Cass to crap the diamond out was a little juvenile but the choice to swallow it was made by......you guessed it, A KID. Next. The costumes. Harley's costumes were great and also fit her character and personality. The only thing I would say is that her clothes were constantly changing between almost every scene which was slightly confusing but also just a part of the movie. It was really big deal in the long run. And they weren't overly revealing. Next point. The set decoration was fun, colorful, and well thought out. It also was another aspect that reflected Harley's personality. Next. The action was so much fun and very well choreographed. The violence was intense and fun as well and added some dark humor. The cinematography was superb. Camera angles and visual sequences were mostly seamless with a few exceptions with video editing that were only slightly distracting. I loved this movie and I think they did so much right. Now I'll get to the few things I didn't like which were the only reason I gave this a 9 and not a 10. The casting of Ewan McGregor didn't sit right with me. He's a brilliant actor but I didn't believe him as a villain. I would've loved to see someone like James McAvoy or Jeremy Renner. The other thing is that despite a strong female cast some of the dramatic acting was a little weak for just 2 or 3 characters. That's something I can look past. Some people complained about the jumping around in time but they did that for a reason. They wanted to only give you information piece by piece to bring it all together later on. Not a rare format of movie and very enjoyable when done right. Really not sure why people complained about the music. I thought that all the music fit the movie and the specific scenes they were used for. I especially loved the fight scene with ""Barracuda"" playing in the background. I really hope Margot Robbie snags a Golden Globe for this or at least a nomination. She was brilliant and absolutely hilarious. Don't listen to people complaining about this movie. I think this is the new direction of comic book action comedies and I like this direction as long as they continue to do it the right way. The ending implies sequels that I really look forward to. Remember that this is not a Harley Quinn origins movie so if that's what you're looking for you won't find it here. It's of course, as named, a Birds of Prey origins story. You can say that it's just a set up for the future but I think it was important to have a thorough explanation of how they met and how they banded together. It ensures that we know the basis of their relationships. For those that complained about it and gave it 1 star. My guess is you already knew what you were getting into when you decided to see it so don't be morons. If it wasn't for you I get that but sometimes you just have to take a movie for what it is without bias. This was an all around fantastic movie even if it wasn't perfect. I had lots of fun. Oh and one other thing....I'm NOT a woman ;)",Birds of Prey

When is Warner Brothers going to learn, if it's not like the original creators character, it's not going to work. Paul Dinni and Bruce Timm created an amazing character. You had a wonderful talent in Margot Robbie, playing said character, and yet the writers and director instead turned Harley into a degenerative character of truly sad, trash. Drinking and swearing her way through a confusing and grotesque world, and worse meandering script, that did little to raise the character into the realm of interesting.

While I do not like Harley Quinn as a character I believed Margo portrayed her just fine she played the role but damn is it a badly written role, like who is this movie even for? I have been following both major superhero universes for a long time, and I have accepted that the demographic is ""family in general"" or a younger audience than me. I've had my time, but this is just cringy to watch, everything about it is. What is that brown chick with the cornrows doing? Is she comic relief, where did she learn to fight? Her acting is so shallow and uncomfortable to watch. Is this her debut? as she never acted before? Was she forced into this role and didn't wanna do it, or is it just the writers fault? It is honestly hard to tell.So what, Harley Quinn can beat up any man, and avoid the drunk cops' punches w ease, but all of the sudden she can barely win a fight against her? This is just one of many things that makes this movie so painful to watch. NOT TO MENTION: THE DIALOGS. Sounds like they were written by a random joke generator. This movie has no depth og meaning to it whatsoever, you just destroyed a potentially cool character and i will never forgive you for that.
The movie honestly just feels like a one woman suicide squad movie. I is the exact same movie, only w fewer people, and way too many uncool references.And give the women som clothes and muscle. I get that fighting technique is a thing and you teach it to level differences in size and speed and such, but are you tryna tell me that a girl with arms the size of a toothpick can do damage to the mountains they are fighting, nope nope nope ain't buying it. Not even while trying to take the movie from what it is, a movie made to entertain young kid nerds. Honestly this is offensive even to them.And what even is that little asian girls' role? She seems super stupid. Running away from people trying to protect her pointing a gun at them, eating a freakin diamond, and of that size?? that's gonna kill her, diamonds are super sharp. it's gonna tear up her insides. She is a super irrelevant character, only in the way. She does not evolve (though none of the characters does, and I know it is probably just bad writing bc they were so focused on making it laughable for their 10-14 year old audience). Besides her acting is really bad, all her lines seems like they were recorded at the same time, speed and in the same emotional state and she just had to mime them with the exact same facial expression.Maybe my expectations were too high, everyone was just so excited about this movie, really talked it up especially since the they threw the joker out but I think it was a waist. Jared, just as Margo has done their characters justice, it is not their fault that the joker in this universe sucks, but if you've read the comics you'd know that that's just what he is like.This film should at max get 1,5 stars, but that was not an option, and since this is my first review, I've decided to be generous, you are welcome.

Theres no reason i should find a lead character in any movie to be annoying or dumb unless they are intended to be. I actually found a movie where I didn't like Ewan Mcgregor.

1662,kelseyhinton-23085,SOOOOO DISAPPOINTED!!!!,5,19 February 2020,I absolutely love Harley Quinn and Margot Robbie does amazing job playing her role and made me love her even more. I just went and seen the movie tonight and have NEVER been so disappointed. I bothered my boyfriend for WEEKS to take me and it was such a disappointment. Since when does Harley Quinn shoot glitter at people and blow they up with colorful smoke bombs? This isn't the Harley Quinn character we all know and love AT ALL.

1665,DJonFireAgain,"IGNORE 90% of the User Reviews, but not this one!",7,13 February 2020,"Let's get this straight, Birds of Prey is a pretty good movie, objectively. It sits somewhere between a 6.5 - 7.0 rating. It's quirky, violent, styalized, stylish, and has some very well choreographed action set-pieces. John Wick's director stepped in to help out - that should give you an indication of the hyper styalized hard hitting action and general tone of the film. Brutal and Fast-paced.Some characters are a little underdeveloped, and the story is quite simple. It has flaws, but nothing too glaring. Its a fun time and worth the price of admission.Now let's address the elephant in my pants ... The REASON you are seeing so many 1 star reviews is because, for whatever reason, the studio decided to market this film as a ""woke"" movie, which often garners a negative audience reaction. Birds of Prey is perceived as a ""Man-bashing"" and ""Anti-male"" movie, and to an extent . . . it is. I really wish I could defend this movie, because I did enjoy it, but I can't.Every male character is despicable. Every theme has patriarchal undertones or overtones. From men acting like a-holes in the workplace, to men calling women b*tches, to men controlling women, to men being portrayed as rapists and backstabbers, to women losing out on promotions to less competent and less capable male counterparts etc. It's throughout the movie. Couple this with the general female empowerment message, and the feminist marketing campaign and it just didn't FEEL right. The movie came across as slightly mean spirited and sexist. And this is coming from someone who actually liked the movie and went in open minded.",Birds of Prey
1666,lyssashorrormoviefreak,Enjoyed it for what it was,5,8 March 2020,"I actually liked this movie. A lot of the reviews I see on here that don't like how it empowers women are mostly men.

I do wish the story on the whole thing was a little more clear. Not a movie I'd pay lots of money in a theater to see. But watching it at home free, I found it to be entertaining.",Birds of Prey

It's about Harley Quinn, and she broke up with the Joker. She is obviously upset and mad and that is why he is portrayed badly. The main villain is also a man, but that's not really unusual.

If we're comparing it to Joker, it's the exact opposite feel. It's really just a joyride. Don't go in looking for any deep messages. It's more upbeat, with a few serious scenes that really establish the threat. Warning, there is a scene with sexual harassment that was very jarring, and it's definitely a rated R film in regards to the swearing and violence.
Personally, I left the theater wanting more, immediately planning to watch it again in a day or two and I convinced a few friends to come with me. The music is really outstanding. It's about as absolutely crazy as you'd expect from a story told from Harley Quinn's POV.
The acting is phenomenal, the action scenes are freaking fantastic, and I'm excitedly awaiting the next time I get to see Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. She was made for the role!After a stressful first month of the year, this movie was exactly what I needed to shrug off the bad, and get ready to fight whatever life throws at me.

I loved the fight scenes and the fact that they weren't hyper-sexualized.

Even though it can be hard to understand sometimes, that seems like the point. The black mask is a good villain and the costumes are amazing. One of the main bad reviews i keep finding is the the costumes aren't sexy enough. This is a feminist comic book movie so it makes sense that the male gaze and the booty shorts aren't used. If you hate this movie because it isn't sexy enough, you aren't the demographic it was made for.

Sure, the main cast are all chicks who kick ass, but at no point does the movie ever preach to you. It never talks down to you, and it's unfair to compare this to other movies in this day and age that do.

I thought there would be more of the Birds of Prey as a group than just the final act of the movie.
However, if there is a reason to see this movie it's the action/fight scenes. They are incredible. Very well done and some unexpected humor. Serious kudos to the fight choreographer and all the stunt people involved.

Giving it the benefit of the doubt, being a comic book guy and all, my assumptions were right.......It is nearly two hours of awfulness you surely could spare yourself from.Where to start, that is tough. First of all, Quinn is annoying and unoriginal. Her lines are stale and it felt watching a 60s sitcom today as you knew what lines were going to come out of her mouth next. Robbie did her best but I had the feeling that she was not really acting but just being obnoxious on screen and if that is how you portray Harley Quinn...please spare me. When it came to the other characters, they were as uninspiring as the lead and no one stood out. They all looked out of place. Nearly all of the actors were poorly chosen for their roles. Rosie as Montoya was like watching your old relative cheerlead. Were we supposed to feel sorry for her or was it a poor attempt at slapping both sides of ageism with support and cynicism? Winstead as Huntress was as flavorless as eating ramen without spices. Jurnee Smollett looked like she was looking for her identity for the whole 2 hours of the movie. Ella Jay Basco as a young Cassandra Cain...oh my where to start with that....wasn't she supposed to be Caucasian????? I know it is a Woke film but I think every ethnicity was very well represented in this flick and they could have been faithful to the future Bat woman's original inception for old times' sake. As for the Black Mask and Ewan Mc Gregor ..wow what a big mess and how mediocre did they make this villain in this movie.When it came to the rest, the action was like watching a predictable B class movie. Not only it was incredulous, it did not make sense for even a senseless movie. It did not look authentic nor did it propose something groundbreaking. Instead it gave you that Power Rangers type action that you know would satisfy high school girls who never watched tv before and could be amazed by anything ""girl power"". Pile the ungratifying ending and voila, by the end of this flick you are going why oh why did I indulge into this one?????Overall, this movie was a great miss and if you don't see it, you are surely missing nothing.

The bad: the story and character development is bad. It's a waste of great characters. You have characters with skills and powers, and they are barely used or displayed. Huntress and Black Canary were wasted in this movie and might as well not been used at all. Some characters were so badly written that fans excited to see those characters are now saying, ""That's the right name, but not the same character."" At least Suicide Squad made the effort to exploit their characters attributes and be a team movie.

The rest of the cast was okayish. Ewan McGregor worked with what he was given and even though they butchered Black Mask, I don't care as long as I see General Kenobi on screen. The story, writing, atmosphere, jokes, characters and everything else was bs. The fights would've definitely been terrible if it wasn't for Chad Stahelski.

And that's not a knock against the fine programming on Turner's flagship network.Margo phone'd her performance and her fight choreography in. She was so inconsistent with her signature Harley accent and when she did use it, was vastly watered down.That was NOT Victor Zazas!I was so tired of hearing Joker's name evoked, it got as obnoxious as the directionless plot.Black Mask was the brightest spot of the whole feature, then maybe that charlatan of a Cassandra Cain.I can go on and on but I'll end this by saying, Suicide Squad was better.",Birds of Prey

I was wrong. The jokes were cheap and barely warranted a laugh. The action was passable yet over the top and felt very cheap towards the end of the story. Then there's the characters, they felt disrespectful to the sources and under developed. The hardest one to watch was probably Montoya who should have been casted differently or at least not portrayed as such weak and one dimensional character.

Harley Quinn is literally a villain, she fought a bad guy in the film but it's not like she was doing it for justice. Harley was never made out to be any kind of role model so why did people expect different?
And the whole women good, men bad argument is ridiculous. For one reason is of course because Harley is and has always been a villain!
There's no point in trying to argue with some people who claim their dislike for the movie is not based on sexism despite most of their reviews begin with ""I'm not sexist or anything but""

IN MY OPINION, it's another case of ""The Witcher"" where it was marketed as woke man bashing female power movie. It's average-good movie. If you try to go in and look for the woke stuff, you will notice them but at the same time, you'll also realize that the vast majority of the males in the movie are criminals.

1755,icecubeonfire,Cheesy movie for teenage girls - Comic/Game fans avoid!,1,4 March 2020,"There were people in the theater that got up in the middle of the movie and just left and I don't blame them. We went to watch this movie and we were so bored we just wanted it to end already. First of all, the movie is made for teenage girls and it's all about woman power and beating up men during super loud music making it a complete chick flick. Men are portrayed as such a**holes all the time it gets boring fast. Harley is a badass we get it, but seeing endless waves of men double her size get destroyed so easily, is so unreal it hurts. The movie tries to be serious with some graphic scenes and then it all breaks down when you see ridiculous fights and Harley acting more like an adult who likes to to talk and act like a baby than the Harley we know from comics and games, something a kid would most likely enjoy and not an adult. And there's this misbalance going on about the tone this movie is setting. It's like they added all the ideas of the writers to keep everyone happy and created this mess. Harley is trying to convince us throughout the movie how bad she is as a person without actually being bad or doing anything remotely bad compared to the other villain. The maximum you get is her being mean. It doesn't feel like she is a villain by the way she is acting, but a caring person. Many lines are so cheesy that will make you shake your head. There is a scene which completely loses touch with reality and will make you say ""ok so anything goes in this movie then, got it"" or say ""oh come on!"". If you are a gamer then you will immediately notice how they copied the game pattern of wave of bad guys empty handed, then wave of bad guys with melee weapons then wave of bad guys with guns and then the boss. It's just bad. If you have a terrible taste in movies and you will enjoy ANYTHING then go watch it.",Birds of Prey

1759,maggielovitt-57720,Gotham City's Best Breakfast Sandwich,9,7 February 2020,"At its core, Birds of Prey is a movie about the best breakfast sandwich a girl can get in Gotham City. Margot Robbie gives a spectacular performance in her return to Harley Quinn and, as a comic book fan, she is everything I could have wished for in this infamous role.Director Cathy Yan managed to make the film's nonlinear timeline flow naturally with Harley's creative narration, entertaining stop-frames, and the overall quirky pacing. There were moments where the story lagged, but even in those slower moments, the movie proved to be entertaining.Birds of Prey was a colourful carnival ride of carnage. It had fantastical costumes, a rendition of ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"" featuring Ewan McGreggor (um, yes please!), an abandoned amusement park battle set to Heart's ""Barracuda"", and plenty of ball bashing.Jurnee Smollett-Bell was stunning as the beloved Dinah Lance and I look forward to the day that we meet this Black Canary's Oliver Queen. Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Huntress was a fantastic take on the character. I adored her awkward approach to Helena, in particular the scene where she rehearsed what she planned to say in front of her bathroom mirror. All across the board the characters felt relatable, even in their extremes.How can we not love a movie filled with badass women that was written, direct, and produced by women? This is one girl gang that I'd love to join. There was so much about this film that I loved. It was fun, quirky, and unique. It left me hopeful for the future of these characters in the DCEU.P.S.

1764,jtswaineg,Mixed feelings,5,17 February 2020,"I am of the opinion that modern movies tend to push ideology over a good coherent film, and sometimes it can be a bit jarring. Woke films are being scrutinized for good reason, but I feel that people are complaining about any perceivable flaw in a movie and magnifying it. Right wingers, are now mirroring the incessant whining of leftist ideologies that want to stifle creativity and Movies are not given their breathing room. I am a male that went to see this film despite not being interested in the initial trailer, but I like Harley Quinn and wanted to support a r rated unique take on a dc property. This film had a few positives, but it could've been so much more. I try to put some biases aside from both ways and look at this film from a critical assessment. Im happy to see capable females get their time on the big screen. I expected a female empowerment film so it was easier to take it in stride. With that said, it wasn't on the nose with its female agenda compared to films that are made for a general audience.No real dialogue about how all men are bad, but there was not a kind/competent male in the film, they all let the females down. Within the context of the film, females interacting with villains that do uncomfortable things doesn't feel forced because they are not ethical characters anyway. But it would have been nice to see at least one decent male in the film, the only one being Huntress' adopted father who has no lines doesn't really count, but I'm nitpicking. Harley isn't a character for everyone, but if you like her she behaves like you would expect her to wild and crazy with nods to her career as a psychiatrist, She is the most interesting aspect of the film. The other good parts are the music, and some of the reshot fight scenes using the choreographer from John Wick. These really give the films their high energy. The rest is where the film falls flat, it incorporates a lot of aspects of suicide squad in that it takes you out of the film to tell back stories and to do time jumps and it can become a bit messy. The plot is linear and generic, like very weak plot that has many plot holes in it. The trailer itself combined with the subtitle made the film seem like it was going another direction with black mask and Harley, possibly falling for another crazy and trying to figure out how to get out of his clutches. Instead he's just generically evil and wants to kill her just because he can. He Wants to use a diamond to find huntress' fortune, but he owned the diamond and could've pulled it out years ago without any opposition? Then entrusts a crazy woman to go grab the diamond for him instead of just leaving the task up to his goons. He's already rich and has everything but wants to obtain more, he couldve been an interesting character but he doesn't have a backstory, we learn very little about him other than that he comes from a crime family. The time he spends on screen gets your attention, but there's no gravitas or point to anything he's doing. The other characters are all unrelatable and unlikable, they don't feel like birds of prey, they look like a couple of poor cosplayers. If I don't take them seriously, I kind of liked some of the jokes with huntress, but none of them could really carry a franchise. There wasn't a lot of very good humor or dialogue either. DC also shouldn't slap established characters names on to actors for no reason. The little girl was named Cassandra Cain a future Batman disciple, but was not true to the character, I didn't even recognize that's who she was supposed to be until the credits. She also takes off with Harley Quinn to go pursue a life of crime. I don't mind Harley taking someone under her wing since she's always wanted a child, but this makes no sense in the continuity. The visually imagery was good, like in the amusement park, but the final fight was shot by a different choreographer and it falls flat. Looks like an incoherent mess, there are better group fights in an episode of power rangers. I went in the movie with low expectations and my brain turned off and found it enjoyable enough on first watch, but the movie doesn't really hold up well, and Harley and birds of prey should've been entirely separate movies. DC don't give up on the smaller Characters of your Universe, don't give up on Harley Quinn, and don't give up on the fresh Unique risks you bring to theaters in contrast to the Standard Marvel Fanfare. I applaud your efforts to make something new, and with some fine tuning I'm sure you'll eventually have another critically and commercially successful movie like Joker on your hands.",Birds of Prey

1768,deeptibakshi,Disappointed (but not surprised.),5,6 February 2020,"I'm not going to lie, I went into this movie with very low expectations. And it was still terrible.First of all, this film should have been called ""Harley Quinn, feat. Birds of Prey"". This movie was all about Harley. The title and the premise would make you believe that this movie is the origin of an iconic female superhero team, but nah. I suppose if you followed their promotion it would have been pretty obvious from the start that this would be all about Harley but still. Misleading title if you ask me. The other ladies are barely there, and Harley steals the spotlight for pretty much the whole film. And not just because of Margot's portrayal, no. She gets all the spotlight because that's how this film was written. The other girls get lackluster introductions that fail to catch your attention. And adding to that, they then get barely any screen time, and like NO character development. I'm a fan of the Birds of Prey comics, and of Black Canary. So I already know a lot about these characters. But for a film that was meant to introduce these characters to a larger audience and give them their big screen debut, it was an absolute failure. And the formation of the /team/ itself was rushed and they REALLY try to sell it to you but just no. Teams don't just form at the snap of a finger. Yes, it takes a dire situation like being surrounded by several thugs that forces you to decide that you need to team up to beat them. But like.. they just got along?? just like that?? No actual conflict. They don't show how the team develops trust between one another, how they get to know each other. Nope. We're just meant to believe that they are this amazing team. I'm all for female empowerment but that is just flat out bad writing.The one good thing about this film for me was Roman Sionis, Black Mask. Ewan McGregor killed it. His scenes were striking and always got your attention. You WANTED to see more of him everytime he shows up on screen. I loved it! He was so mesmerizing to me, I have no other way to put it into words. He was the only successful element in this film for me, and even his screentime was less than it should have been, if you ask me. And on top of that, KILLED OFF?? already?? Like guys.. the one good thing that came out of this mess of a film, and he's already just gone? Ewan did a great job with the role and I would have love to see him return in future projects, especially with the Batman pretty much right around the corner. That was a major disappointment for me.Margot as Harley was the same as usual. She's good at portraying Harley. A lot of people say that her role along with Black Mask's is what stuck out. Well, for me, initially in Suicide Squad, I absolutely adored Harley. She's still great, don't get me wrong. I just think her whole /quirky/ thing got old by now? Sure, she develops a little bit by the end of this film due to her relationship with Cass, but I'm kind of over Harley already. I really didn't need another film centred entirely on her. I wish they'd have given some of that screentime to the other ladies.Speaking of Cassandra. Ha. Ha. I am a BIG fan of Batman and the Batfam, as it is called by fans. I had high hopes for a character as complex, with so many layers as Cassandra. and they messed it up. Royally. They turned a badass master assassin, who works under the Dark Knight himself into this child character who in all honesty, wasn't all that interesting. She seemed like a typical kid character who has a rough background and grows into a life of petty thieving blah blah. Just didn't think she was all that great. She just was what she was meant to be. But just another example of wasted potential in the DCEU. Sad, really. Cassandra really could have been something, and this was an underwhelming introduction for an iconic Batman character.As for the plot itself: mediocre and I don't mean to be rude, but I giant, stupid mess. No structure. Does not really engage the audience or steal your attention. The visuals were stunning but that's about the only thing that kept me looking at the screen.TL/DR: movie was a mess. was less about BoP, and literally just Harley feat. /the girls/, but McGregor as Black Mask was a positive that came out of it.",Birds of Prey

1772,bushidoblazex,Honestly entertained,7,19 August 2020,"I went into this movie not expecting much since suicide squad was such a mess but, I heard the action was good an I've always been a fan of Harley (comics and otherwise) so I gave it a shot. Honestly not a bad movie. I didnt get a sense of 'men are bad' the men in this movie happen to be villains...so? The villains in most movies are men whats the problem? I know people are going to complain about the ""men taking credit for womans work"" story line but, really you can think of it as a coworker or boss getting credit for something you do which we all can relate to. So, no I don't think this ""feminist"" aspect was beaten into your skull but yea it is there.The action scenes were some of the best choreographed in these types of movies.Only complaint really is the story can get alil messy but it was trying to do alot in a short period of time and its never messy to the point where you cant follow it or the decisions characters make. I definitely recommend this movie.",Birds of Prey

This movie holds no boundaries with its R Rating and it shows.Special shout out to Ewan who once again delivered in an amazing role, I believed every minute of it, the whole cast as a whole was really well put together, I can't say enough how people should go see this movie.I hope this is a success for Margot, she worked hard for this movie to happen and Warner Bros believed in her vision.

1780,damien-78519,Violent fun and a great time at the movies,8,7 February 2020,"Bird of preyAfter watching suicide squad yesterday I am all fought up ready for pirds of prey
I know it's more of a spin off than I direct sequel to suicide squad but as it's still the same Harley and the same film universe.Hats off to Margot Robbie as Harlequin she is fantastic and although called birds of prey is without a doubt her movie and not really a birds of prey movie
It may aswell he called Harlequin featuring the birds of prey
But by the end that really doesn't matter.
Starting with her breakup from the joker one from then on events unfold in a spectacular violent fashion.
This is the first dc extended universe movie to be rated 15 and it earns it
There's loads of f bombs and plenty of violence.
There's a part where Haley breaks a guys leg 3 times with a bat and it's glorious.
The fights were imaginative and there are plenty of them.
For me it had a Deadpool sort vibe
We start out out movie with Harley narrating her story and even jumping back and forth to explain thing or characters.
Glorious swearing and violence
Not taking itself too seriously and plenty of fourth wall nods and even a joke about lack of weapons before the final showdown.
The cast are great
After Margot Robbie My favourite being Ewan McGregor as Roman sionis aka black mask and he is twisted
He plays basically I violent child who throws a tantrum when somebody takes his things.
He hates mess , He is cold and chilling while also being sadistic,funny and another well done batman villain although not completely comic accurate.
Ewan mcgereggor really puts himself into his role.
Victor Zsasz is his sidekick who isn't too bad as his henchman he is just as sadistic and is romans implied lover.
Only thing that could of made this better is Anthony cardigans Zsasz from Gotham.
Jurnee Smollett-Bell as the black canary she is stunning with a beautiful voice and baddass to go along with it.
Rosie Perez as Renee Montoya plays a cop lifted from 80's action movie and even being referenced so.
And Mary elisebth winstead as Helena bartellin aka the huntress played a somewhat smaller role than the others but just fit right.
And finally Ella jay basco as casandra Cain the thing that brings them all together
The kid who steals the diamond from Sionis and end up being protected by Harley Quinn.I really enjoyed this movie
It's defiantly my sort of film
It was pretty much a blast from opening till the end.
It had a good story,great character bone crunching action,plenty of swearing and some laugh out loud twisted humour and it's the first dc film in this series to really let lose and make a fun movie.",Birds of Prey
1781,hawkenking,Underwhelming but fun,7,17 August 2020,"Despite a lot of backlash reviews here, there is fun to be had with this movie.It's easy to pick apart the scenes that didn't work, but there were some scenes that worked well and don't disappoint. Harley adopts the most ridiculous pet, portrays a strong female lead and grounds the other characters.The Black Mask is genuinely scary at times and his megalomania is communicated well. Indeed most characters are like-able and well rounded enough to work.The lighting and cinematography are pleasant to look at, it looks like a high budget well made movie should look. The story is linear and makes sense with a comfortable payoff at the end. The audio is adequate and nothing to complain of. Continuity is attentive, again nothing sticks out.The rest is a bit vapid. Fun flick for an adult audience-its certainly not for kids-but could have gone further to charm us into it's world.It's hard to know where to improve the movie. So it's worth going in knowing that while this was panned by comic fans, its's still a robust flick.",Birds of Prey
1782,nathantramontana,Its a good movie,8,9 May 2020,It's a good movie. Once's you get passed that is mostly a chick flic. I think that the hole movie was good just didn't like the flash backs that it did have the movie. I know they got to catch us up to speed with who everyone is but they way they did it wasn't the right way to me at least it wasn't. I did enjoy the fight sense at the end and how Harley ended up Betraying the other girls at the end and taking the kid under her wing. I also liked that she did get the Hyena like in the comics. It's more of a comdy they anything but at the end of the day it's a good movie just wish it was done just a tad bit better. I also didn't like how black mask didn't wear his mask into the ending Scene and it wasn't even that long for him wearing. So the ending was kinda Predictable. But if your looking to check this movie out I definitely would it's pretty good,Birds of Prey
1783,markcieplowski,Awful! Really Awful! Save your money and sanity!,1,14 March 2020,"Well a few hours of my life I will never get back!I am seriously worried that the writers/producers/directors felt that this was even worth completing yet alone bringing to the Big Screen! It merits a B'list DVD release at most. I am worried because I fear that others may follow suit.At present I am shocked that this has a 6+ score on here, who are the people out of thousands rating anything above a 2!?!Seriously though, if you have not seen it yet then please save yourself the money and anguish! If desperate to then wait a few more months and stream it or drop the money for a DVD or BluRay but I would advise renting as you will not want to watch it again.The story line is pretty non-existent, the acting mediocre and only saved by the colourful sets and effects but certainly not worth your hard earned money, trust me.It would not surprise me if then eventually ends up with an IMDB Score of less than three in a year or so.Was really looking forward to watching this and now cannot believe i wasted my money! :-(",Birds of Prey

It is all it had to be and better. I find it hard to believe Anyone can not enjoy this. Lots of the bad reviews are saying there was too much feminism in it but I honestly could barley spot much feminism in it at all, it is female led but that doesn't make it a total feminist movie. Even if you thought there was to much feminism in it that's one small part that you didn't like. I'm not saying you have to like it I am just you need to go there and try enjoy it for what it is and not critique the whole movie. I think what many people have forgotten is movie are made to be enjoyed not to be picked to shreds.

1787,externaltestaccount,Is a satire a satire if it doesn't know that it's a satire?,4,9 February 2020,"This was the question rolling in my head about 20 or so minutes into this movie, because I was beginning to see a pattern.I went into this movie completely blind, other than I knew that this was a spin-off to the very average Suicide Squad. I thought I knew what to expect, but sadly nope. It had better action than Suicide Squad and more crazy Margot Robbie, who gets an 'A' for effort here, but the tiresome theme of men being bad because they're men reared its head and never went away. Then they doubled down on it. The men just got more nasty, incompetent, misogynistic, vile, and just plain stupid. The sheer hatred towards men was staggering. I was taken aback. Bear in mind though, I sheltered myself from Ghostbusters 2016, Terminator 6, Charlies Angels, because I saw the trailers and knew what to expect - I knew I was not going to be welcome. But I missed all the advertising for this and Margot Robbie, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ewan McGregor? What could go wrong? Sadly so much.The first 20 or so minutes are fun, pacey and anarchic. Harley Quinn is keeping us up with her split from the Joker, this all goes well, it's her movie and as I said, Margot Robbie really found a way into this character, and she ran with it. But when Detective Renee Montoya is introduced, immediately things take, how to put this, a sexist turn. There is simply no other way to put it. Literally, the male cop she is partnered with is seen as an imbecile who was not worthy of Montoya's presence. 30 seconds later we then learn that actually, she had her promotion stolen from her years ago by her old partner back in the day, who took all the credit for her great work. And he was a man. At least they made him a black man. If you're going to be sexist, better make sure to be inclusive here too. Despite Montoya being very capable at her job, she got no respect - because she was a woman. (seriously, the women writing this has no idea how men think).The stilted character development continued with Black Canary, who was introduced in a haphazard flashback fashion, but zero backstory. We see her sing James Brown's ""It's a Man's World"" (yes really) and then, she happens to save Harley from the evil rapey men she hooked up with by using Kung Fu that Jackie Chan would have been proud of. But, because there was no backstory, we never knew how she was so accomplished at defeating men at least twice her weight.Poor Character development continues, Cassandra Cain, from a broken family. That's it. But she's a genius thief. No idea how though. Ella Jay Basco who plays the greatest thief ever in Gothem is though, uniformly awful. The line delivery is excruciating. She needs acting lessons. Considering the amount of child actors in Hollywood you would think they could hire someone to deliver lines in a convincing fashion? I'll let you decide how she got the role.Then we really - actually - get good character development! The Huntress - We know why she is! We know how she got so good! She'll be amazing!... and ends up with so little screen time that you wonder why they bothered. I actually felt sorry for Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who had to deliver bad jokes/punchlines near the end of the movie, and she looked very uncomfortable doing so. If you want to see what a strong empowered female looks like then check her out in ""Faults"" or ""10 Cloverfield Lane"". This tripe is beneath her.Speaking of being beneath them, Ewan McGregor is in this, and he plays a spoiled smarmy sleazy man to a tee. McGregor can do this in his sleep, the problem here is that someone told him to hoot and holler for no good reason, so his performance looks forced. Again, he puts the effort in, all the cast do to varying success, but they are not helped by a script that even when working brings uneven results.This could be because it's an action comedy. Comedy is infamously tough to pull off, because even the best comedy in the world is rubbish if you don't find it funny. And the only thing that made me laugh was the bail of coke (you'll know it when you see it). That joke worked perfectly, and I laughed and nodded, knowing that even when a movie hates me as much as this does, if you get the jokes right, I don't bloody care. Alas though, it was only one joke. No other punchlines worked or paid off.In fact all but one of the jokes felt forced, much like the performances, so I went back to ruminating on whether this was a satire or not. Can a satire this earnest, this genuine, still be a satire? All of the malice and ill feeling towards men were almost like the movie makers decided to play misandry bingo. Women being prevented from advancement by men? Check. Women humiliated by men for nothing other than being a woman? Check. Men being condescending to women? Check. Men being rapey and creepy? Check and check. And, women are superior not only because they're great but also because men are so dumb? That's a Bingo!I was going to walk out half-way through, because I knew I was not the intended audience, but my girlfriend was with me, and she quite liked it. So it's all OK. I'm not who this movie is for. Girls who need a sense of empowerment at the expense of men, who think nothing of 50 kg women beating up men at least twice their size, that is their audience. The problem here is that you can make a movie for that audience without having to damn the other 50%. Do I really need to say Atomic Blonde? I really enjoyed that movie, and the main character had no love lost for men in that one either. But the action worked, it wasn't agenda driven to the point distraction. All they needed to do was make women talented and succeful without it being at the expense of anyone else. It diminishes the heroes when the antagonists are pathetic.Birds of Prey is best seen as a satire of 2010s feminine empowerment. Spiteful, hateful and wearing its misandry on it's sleeve. Written by women, starring women and mostly directed by a woman. Mostly? Chad Stahelski the director of John Wick 1,2 and 3, had to be drafted in to help Director Cathy Yan with the action scenes... Yep, this is a satire.",Birds of Prey
1788,nanothestrange,"Entertaining, Good performances, unfocused direction.",7,10 May 2020,"Honestly this movie is one of the best ones in the current DC canon probably one below shazam in my opinion. Im glad they decided to.lean into Harley Quinn a bit more and Margot robbies performance of her brings most of the value much like Ryan reynolds performance of deadpool brings value to those films. Even though it has an all female main cast, it doesnt hamfist the ""girl power"" angle while still being able to be interpreted as feminist which is something many films have difficulty doing (captain marvel to name one that failed at this.) The majority of the story until the final act is far more show than tell than many previous dc films. There are set pieces and ideas in this movie that work fairly well. The club scene early in the movie, the two car chase scenes, the jailbreak scene, Harley blissfully or chaotically evading capture from multiple characters to name a few. These concepts play to the strengths of these characters for the most part. The characters: mostly fine. Harley and black canary work really well together and the detectives interactions with Harley for the majority of the movie work.and are entertaining. Hundreds however was very underutilized, she didnt even make contact with the core group of characters until the final act and they used half of her short time interacting with the core characters spouting exposition and backstory. They didnt do a good job setting up her role in the story. Thematically, this film feels like it doesnt really know what its trying to be and at times feels like it was directed by 3 different people. It feels like one person wrote a handful of very well crafted scenes and someone else was left to write what was in between. There are other problems that i havent explained but these were the main issues i have with the story. That being said it isnt a bad movie. It is leagues better than suicide squad and the writing does get you to care about these characters.",Birds of Prey
1789,Lesewut,All users with ratings of 1...,7,8 February 2020,"Please delete your accounts. You are not able to think differentiated and therefore not able to write a factual review. Hardly any movie deserves a rating of 1. This is disrespectful to the people who invested a lot of energy and passion into this film. You are disappointed because the movie didn't deliver what the trailer promised you? Why do you watch trailers of movies you want to see? What can a trailer show you that the film can't? That doesn't make any sense to me.
I don't even want to start with the white, old men who feel threatened in their masculinity by the film.
Anyway.
If I'm watching a Harley Quinn movie, I want to watch exactly a movie like that. Very cartoony, totally over the top, high pacing, high gag level and visual fireworks.

1792,ke7in,A bit to much...,2,9 February 2020,"Much like other people who have reviews for this movie I'm going to talk about the Fempower aspects in this movie first so it can just be done and over with. Yes, this movie goes ""woke"". Yes it is annoying. Not a single male character is shown to be ""good"". From the borderline laughable portrait of Misogyne that is Black Mask, to the credit stealing police captain, and even a spoiler but still you'll know it when you see it. It almost makes it hard to enjoy anything when theirs not a single character that's a person unless they happen to be female, and even then all they really feel like is shells for female impowerment. Now, that's out of the way. The voice over is used WAY TO MUCH and the flashbacks are used in order to be ""different"" but shows how little of a story they have. Is their good?
Yes, actually their a few good things. The editing isn't the worst DC films have had and the action fits the over the top nature of the movie which makes it fun to watch. The set desing lends itself well to having what amounts to a cool acid trip which I enjoy. The acting is....ok. All the actors are fine and you can tell they are having fun. which makes you feel like you're having fun.
Is this movie good? Not even close but their is a sense of enjoyment to be had. Maybe, if u got drunk or high you could enjoy the amount of colors that go on the screen. If u want a movie that actually gives these characters any amount of depth that they should get (both men and women) go watch Assault on Arkham.",Birds of Prey

Thirdly, I gave a score of 7, because I have divided the overall score.Back to the movie review. And I think it have spoiler.The battle scenes that were shown were not very good. from what was shown, it was very apparent that the battle was made up. I was very impressed for the acrobatic action of Ms. Margot, and also the stuntman. but that doesn't make the battle look good. from a group of men who fall easily because of a woman's punch, to a woman who can fend off the punch of a man who wants to kill her.the story is too straight, looks like if birds of prey is a superman movie. which, it's very easy to bring down enemies. and once again I say, the action looks contrived.and the jokes made by Harley, are very lacking. he used the break the 4th wall technique, but it wasn't as good as deadpool in making his punchline.
I laughed, but only grinned. not LOL. But in the end in post credit scene, I LOL.",Birds of Prey

Rest of the characters were kinda thrown aside yo focus more on Harley even tho some of them had interesting backgrounds.

It certainly is coherent in maintaining narrative pressure over Harley Quinn and exploring colors and aesthetics of what they guessed as main interests to her. Some bad aspects of it are poor fighting scenes, which seem hard to believe due to sound attributions and choreography. The pitoresque tone of the movie also can be a bit annoying at times.
In comparison with Suicide Squad, this is way better and makes more sense. This may be overlooked to one who is sufficiently impressed by the ""empowering"" tone of the movie. This, I believe, shouldn't be an aspect to be criticised. Also, the fact that critiques that rely on external aspects such as fidelity to sources compromise many of the reviews. If such a critique were valid, we shouldn't have films like Joker (2019). These movies aren't targeted to this niche anyway. So the movie is ok. Not bad nor good, just ok.",Birds of Prey

The movie is general better than Suicide Squad, especially regarding the story. The humor is really good and funny and the actors did a really good job at portraying their characters. This includes the protagonists and the antagonists. For people who know DC a little, this movie introduces some characters from other shows and movies nicely.

1837,laurensdubuisson,All hail Harleen Quinzel,10,6 February 2020,"Saw Birds of Prey yesterday and absolutely LOVED it. Cathy Yan's team-up with 87Eleven resulted in beautifully choreographed fighting scenes with catastrophic consequences for the poor unfortunate souls who dared take on Harley Quinn and her band of merry women.Had my doubts about Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress in the beginning, but seeing her practice her introduction in front of the mirror to sound like a true menacing vigilante only for it to come to a wonderfully anticlimactic and utterly satisfying reveal in the movie's third act convinced me of her prowess as Huntress.Jurnee Smollet-Bell is completely beguiling and sexy as hell as Canary. The way her powers are constantly alluded to, yet never quite revealed until the third act really cemented my love for her as an accomplished fighter first and meta human second. Sidenote - and I fully agree with Huntress's comment - the way she can kick ass in those skin tight jeans... Mamma mia.Detective ""I shaved my balls for this?"" Montoya is another delightful addition to this cast of misfit women. Not only am I crazy about her accent, but her gun-toting, whisky-slamming ways have found their way into my heart.Last but not least, Margot Robbie. What an absolute champion. From her undying love of Bruce - after that hunky Wayne guy - to the literal frenzy she gets into for that eggs and bacon sandwich from Sal... She is the new Clown Queen of Gotham if you ask me, come to rightfully claim her throne from her ex-boyfriend.In conclusion: do NOT sit on this movie. I can't remember the last time I laughed this hard out loud in the theatre or felt such empathy whenever a guy was brutally beaten up by a girl (Harley has a proclivity for cracking balls and smashing kneecaps' beware).",Birds of Prey
1838,alfiemetcalfe-85374,Trying to hard to be different. Really cheesy and plot line predictable,3,18 February 2020,"I really thought this filmed tried to hard to be different from the other dc/ Marvel films. In a way it was different but the whole time I was left with the same feeling of it trying to be something it's not. With obvious nods towards the godfather in many scenes: e.g restaurant scene, family execution scene and the fact that a little girl went to hide out in Sicily exactly as Michael did! Anyway I think that dc looked at how well joker did at box office and tried to replicate the same elements of it with the use of dark humour. The plot line started to fall apart towards the end and I was forever checking my watch to leave. I think it all came together to well and the humour missed its element of being clever and ended up just being really cheesy. I think for women however there is a huge sense of empowerment that comes with this movie and that is the only reason I'm not giving it a 1/10. However to many viewers this could come across as too forced and maybe even a bit. Throughout the film a woman wasn't killed once but hundreds of men where. Anyway I don't think it's a big deal but others think it is. All in all you'll never create a good film of all your doing is trying to make it be something it's not.",Birds of Prey

The only basis that argument has is that the main villain is a man and our main character doesn't like her EX. Now enough complaining about other people's opinions.This movie is pretty good and is very enjoyable. The R rating really helps that. It is able to be as graphic as we all really want movies to be. This movie is told by Harley and very often it feels like DC tried to replicate what Deadpool did. Ewan McGregor's character sometimes feels super unbelievable.

Each character had a character, fighting style, and reason for being there all their own, and no one seemed just thrown in for the heck of it. The choreography was beautiful and contained fighting styles and artistic choices that felt fresh and nor something I've seen before in the superhero genre. The diversity in on-screen characters felt natural, with casual references to characters being lgbtq+ which was lovely. Marvel take notes.The human moments in this movie were especially touching. There were so many little moments between characters that brought so much more meaning in such a short time (being vague to avoid spoilers). The villain was creepy, with some excellent acting from Ewan Mcgreggor.The costuming and set design was colourful and crazy and just precisely Gotham. The comic characters would be right at home in this version of Gotham in my mind. Women wore outfits that were revealing but felt fun and wearable, without the oggling slow-pans up their bodies that I've gotten so used to in movies. Female characters looked human, with visible facial blemishes and messed makeup after fights.Ella Jay Basco's Cassandra Cain was a stand-out for me. Despite having a different backstory from Cass in the comics, I felt that this alternate version of her had a lot of spirit and sass and her Utter Bafflement at What Her Life Had Become was hilarious and expertly acted.This movie made me laugh in the theatre more than any other I've seen in the past year.

Ewan (and his minion) is equally amazing, at first I didn't recognize him as I remember him best from Moulin Rouge. He has a very scary character that he portrays extremely well.

The film's intent is to empower, thrill and make you laugh, at it certainly succeeds in all of those. The titular Birds of Prey are not only cast perfectly, but all of them get well written back stories and conflicts that are resolved by the end of the flick, and hopefully in the sequel we'll see more of the fully realized team of vigilantes kicking together.

The ufff action scenes are deserving of Oscars. The great performances, perhaps the biggest problem is the fact that it does not look very much like comics, but I do not see anything wrong with that, since this film is an adaptation, it should not be a calque to the comics.

Please, stop believing all the negative comments about the movie, there are always haters trying to discredit good movies for the simple fact that it was not what they wanted.

I like how the movie has no time span, Harley's ""oh wait I forgot"" is a perfect example of her chaotic psyche. I do like the other characters as well, but they do not have as good chemistry as expected. But, it does make sense, because this is the forming of birds of prey and they had not known one another as well. The story is not accurate in Cassandra's character, I believe this was because it makes Harley more likeable. I do think this movie is centered around Harley Quinn, but they should try to keep it somewhat accurate. Similar to the movie, Amanda was a girl in the comics Harley exchanged for money, but this girl had the bank account codes in her eyes and if one were to look at them, Amanda would become blind. Also, Cassandra is like the fourth batgirl, so the movies way different than the comics. I believe this was a lighthearted action movie through the eyes of Harley Quinn, but I do think there should be more homage to the comics. Specifically, in character backstories. But, I like all the characters they were thoroughly played by each actor. I do not think Harley should be portrayed as crazier, she was never crazier than the joker she actually stopped him from doing really bad stuff in comics. She is sadistic, but has morals.",Birds of Prey

The amount of idea is a massive ZERO and if i could set the score lower than 1 i would give -10. The empty movie tells us nothing, showing the lowest behaviour lines ever can imagine, such as vomiting in somebody's bag, or feeding humans to hyaenas and the only positive moment is Ewan McGregor, who sadly had to express soo much of bad language out of his mouth.

I've seen several reviews complaining about the characters but in my opinion most of them were great and I'm glad I didn't have to muster through unnecessary sexualized outfits and scenes, and instead experience girls just kicking and providing lots of fun and action.Though the trailers and title didn't really paint the movie in the best light, giving it a watch is definitely worth it!

6/10That's a generous 6/10The Blu-ray dropped today. I have total mixed views about the movie.
It moves at a pace, which is good. The constant Harley narration grates after a while. Towards the end , which features less narration, the film is better for it. I liked the fine line between serious and cartoony the makers achieved. Blame it on the director, but there was something special about Margot Robbie in Suicide Squad, and that special is absent from Birds of Prey. As cartoony as the humour is, it fails to come close to the might of Deadpool. As you are probably aware, the recent Joker movie was deep. Birds of Prey is the complete opposite, and lacks any form of substance. There appears to be a big hole that runs through Birds of Prey. Deliberate or not, the fighting felt not too dissimilar to the 1960's Batman TV series, but without all the Kapow!The Hyena was excellent. The CGI for the Hyena is 10/10Ewan McGregor is ok. Admittedly i have never been a fan of his. The part he plays in BoP i felt would have suited a Leon era Gary Oldman so much better. I guess Gary is too old now, or is he?I am sure I recall seeing the Joker during an early preview. That moment appears to be missing from the movie. Maybe I blinked and missed it? Admittedly I did fall asleep for about 5 minutes, which is never a good sign.The theme song that plays a few times throughout the movie kept reminding me of the classic Supertramp track The Logical Song (the sort of music my dad listens to).",Birds of Prey

It looks like two different movies stuck together with poor action choreography, screenplay and everything failing badly in the second half. Except Harley every character is poorly written and the acting of kid as Cassandra Cain and actress as Black Canary was very poor.

Harley Quinn/whatever else it's called, should have just been called Harley Quinn. It's a really messy film with no developing plot or characters. Harley and Joker broke up and she wants everybody to know and at first most don't believe her. She runs around beating people up with no combat training other than gymnastics, evading the police and acting crazy. Also some gay guy named Black Mask is a villain but it never gets into his backstory. We know from one scene that's he's violent and so he's the bad guy. Also Something to do with a missing diamond that is the key to something not explained very well. Everybody is looking for it and some child thief has swallowed it after pick pickpocketing it from Gay Mask's idiot henchmen. A hit is put out on said child thief so Harley makes a deal to find the diamond and the girl for Gay Mask so he doesn't kill her. No legit reason is given as to why he wants Quinn dead anyways. No idea why it's called Birds of Prey because the other Birds are barely in it except for Canary who works for Gay Mask as a driver for whatever reason. Rosie Perez plays the sassy black dipshit cop, a character trope that seems to be in every movie and show now. Harley doesn't dress anymore. Runs around beating people up some more and evading detective Sass until they come to an understanding that they aren't enemies, I lost interest. The End",Birds of Prey
1887,femaleantagonist,Fun and filled to the brim with personality,10,23 August 2020,"From Margot's performance, to the visuals, to the fight scenes and to the soundtrack, this movie is such an enjoyable experience.
You can tell how much Margot loves this character and how much effort she went through to do her character justice. She's the perfect Harley and nails the personality traits that made her original character from the Batman animated series special, which was lost to most of her other adaptations where they made her into an oversexualized yandere stereotype. And I think the two brief emotional moments where she tears up were very effective at making the audience feel for Harley. I also adore her voice and her Harley laugh.
This movie is also visually and musically stunning. I adore how colorful everything is while still mantaining its aesthetic. The fight scenes are so engaging and well coreographed, I genuinely enjoyed watching Harley move. Of course theyre not perfect given that in some moments that thing where the bad guys kind of stand still and wait their turn while the protagonists is beating another bad guy instead of everyone attacking the protagonist at once happened but then again i dont think ive ever seen a fight scene that involved one character vs multiple ones that DIDNT do that, so im not gonna hold it against it.
The original soundtrack is also a delight, my personal favorites are Diamonds, Experiment on me, Sway with me and Doja Cat's song (even though it was only in it for a split second).
I think the only valid criticism I've seen towards this movie that isnt just whiny misogynsitic triggered males going ""wahh wamen bad, im opressed because a woman made a movie starring women!! reverse sexism is real😢 gender politics!!😫"" is that this is very much a Harley-centric movie and theres not much about the actual Birds of Prey in it. I respect and agree with Margot's decision of making Harley interact with other characters and making it a fun girl gang movie, but I think it would've been a much better choice to make Harley's sidekicks Catwoman and Poison Ivy and naming it Gotham City Sirens.
Overall, this is a very enjoyable movie where Margot shines as Harley more than ever. The humor is great and its one of those movies where you get to watch a quirky character get herself in and out of trouble while seeing the world through her eyes. Both Cathy Yan and Margot did an amazing job and I hope the progress this movie did with its portrayal of Harley doesnt get completely set back with the upcoming Suicide Squad reboot.",Birds of Prey

There are many comicbook movies coming out and the majority of them won't hold true to the characters or the storyline....

I love Margot and so i had to watch this movie. Went in with my wife with zero expectations. To our surprise the movie was kick-ass and both of us enjoyed the film completely!It was very refreshing to see the female angle, i don't think any other movie does this as convincingly and this is the very thing that makes the movie special! There is one very short scene where a woman is kind of shamed a bit (avoiding any spoilers here), typically this sort of scene is almost always shot in a somewhat arousing way, but here even the slightest bit of glorification of this perversion is completely removed in this movie. This was quite mind-blowing to a seasoned movie buff like me, really, and makes one wonder how almost all movies are tainted by this creeping testosterone influence!They also, to my great relief, didn't do any of the women empowerment/feminism crap as well.This would have been a great let-down if they had gone that way, and thankfully steered clear from shoving any political ideas down our throats. This is simply a movie with all the main characters having a lot of fun, only they are all girls this time. The women mostly look normal, and not overly objectified - this was very refreshing to watch. Ewan McGregor kept us chuckling all the way through - he totally nailed his character! You can basically let out a chuckle at every line he delivers. And of course, Margot, the queen of Hollywood herself, effortlessly carried the film on her shoulders and did an amazing job of it! Harley Quinn in this film is more like a very impulsive,highly distracted and slightly crazy girl! She is bundle of joy throughout the film and has an amazing command of the screen-space.The other actors were good enough, and i wouldn't go so far to say anyone's acting was bad per se.Action scenes could have been better towards the end- this is the only little thing that was slightly lacking, in my opinion. Although, I'm really glad that they didn't overuse CGI.The saving grace of the film is it never took itself too seriously. This is a very well made fun-flick for those with a broad mind and a good sense of humour.The movie is much better than the Avengers-Endgame which i watched last year. I thought that movie was absolutely boring with an overdose of CGI, bad acting, flat dialogues. Birds of Prey, on the other hand, had better acting, was much more fun, funny, colourful(!), and left me leaving the theater with a big smile across my stupid face!After watching the film, we also ordered a Margot's HarleyQuinn poster!

I wont get into too much detail about that as it is more than obvious, but it was tasteless and boring with too much focus of breaking the men's knee caps.I actually stopped watching after the scene that Harley knocks out Renee Montoya by kicking a phone to her head - and she is knocked out cold as if a brick hit her. This was just the cherry on the cake on top of the bad acting. Margot Robbie did the best she could and she saves the movie as much as she can - if it wasn't for her portrayal of the character I would've stopped watching even before 1st act ended.Victor Zsazs' character was butchered as well; and Sionis was a cheap version of the Joker with no depth - just that he is on top of the patriarchal underground society...I only give it 3 stars for the visual effects here and there and MR's performance.",Birds of Prey

Plenty of memorable scenes and set pieces that show you a lot of love and care was put into making this movie, and the performances by the main cast-particularly Robbie-were excellent.",Birds of Prey

1924,johnathondunn,SO MUCH FUN,10,6 February 2020,"Don't be fooled by some of the reviews. ALOT of fragile men have it out for this film.However, I thought it was AMAZING. I love that it isn't the same plot that every other superhero movie has. The world isn't ending in this one and that's a good thing. This movie is much more grounded which allows for a totally different experience. The delivery is a little crazy but makes perfect since for a movie staring Harley Quinn.The cast is phenomenal. Jurnee as Black Canary was my favorite part. The action sequences are really good and DIFFERENT. That's the best thing about this movie. It's not the same superhero movie with different characters. I had a blast and so will you!",Birds of Prey

1926,discocorco,"Well Scripted, Wood characters, Good sound track, Awesome Stunts",9,13 April 2020,"Seriously, the bat throw off the concrete into the guys face was amazing. If you didn't pick up on it, Harley was throwing a bat around as her weapon of choice. In terms of Batman movies, this belongs at either #4-#5 all time behind 1)Lego Batman #2) Tim Burton's Batman in 1989 #3) The Heath Ledger as Joker Batman, and arguably at the same level as the Most Recent Joker Movie. This is by far the definitive Harley Quinn Movie. She is a villain. Don't forget, she is not the protagonist however, she is the narrator. The old adage is the the devil gets his due. Make no mistake, Harley sold her soul to the devil long ago. The road to resurrection is long and perilous. I am sorry, this is the first movie in my recollection where the main character had a pet hyena. I think these other folks reviewing this flick are not seeing this film for what it is-Big Dumb Entertainment. Some awesome dumb female humor, the guy grabbed a tampon out of pocket at one point. She was using a clown hammer to bash dudes over the head while she was on a trampoline. She is evil, yet she still has a conscious.",Birds of Prey
1927,roxalien,Quite enjoyable!,8,14 February 2020,"I don't know what corner of the internet took it as a mission to bomb this reviews page, or what kind of expectations people had when going to see this, because the movie is not that bad how they make it seem! I don't know the original Harley Quinn very well and I was not expecting an Oscar worthy script, so for me the movie was quite fun. I saw no obvious feminist agenda, no suggestion that all men are bad. The only valid bit of criticism I saw in these reviews is that indeed the Black Mask character was worth more attention. And yes the title is not misleading because even if the birds of prey only get together at the end, the movie does show from the start how they each find themselves on the road that brings them together.",Birds of Prey
1928,petetoxxic,2/10 Watch the animated Harley Quinn if you want the real thing.,2,28 March 2020,First of all Harley Quinn is a psycho badass.

The team is formed literally 20 min before the end. Black mask history and the final battle does not make a f...

1931,dancecharlottesuperstar,Super fun movie - ignore the negative reviews,8,28 April 2020,"It's funny how all of the poor reviews of this movie seem to be coming from male accounts. Birds of Prey is an action packed, fun filled adventure with feminist undertones that makes for a brilliant watch.

1934,pricmike,Horrible writing,2,10 July 2020,"The movie is absolutely cringe-inducing to watch and the majority of it is due to how they chose to write Montoya.

1937,mdilorenzo87,Highly Recommend,9,8 February 2020,After reading the reviews I was scared that my ticket purchases were going to be a waste. This movie was really good and would happily go see it again. All the actors in this movie were casted perfectly and the story was very entertaining and keeps you hooked through the whole movie.,Birds of Prey
1938,chomerly,Overall a below average movie that wastes two hours of your life.,4,10 February 2020,"Having watched this movie just last night, and having some time to reflect on it, I can honestly say that this movie is not worth the time to watch. The acting is average for the most part, the story is well below average, the whole movie is just average. Not to mention that it hinges on the appeal of all DC Universe fans while at the same time completely aiming directly at teenagers.I didn't have high hope's that Birds of Prey was going to be anything other than an average movie so set my expectations pretty low. This is a Warner Bros movie after all and when it comes to the DC universe, their movie releases are very much like a Yoyo of good to downright awful. But what we get here is a spinoff movie that does nothing to convince you that it was even set in the world of DCU, let alone the world of Batman. Seriously, if you took away the obvious uniqueness of some of the characters, removed their names and called this anything that infers a crime caper, you would never have know. But to make this as painless as possible for those on the fence as to whether they should watch this or not, I can sum this movie up fairly quickly and easily.***Spoiler time***Harley gets dumped.
Harley gets drunk.
Harley tries to go it alone.
Harley becomes a target without the Joker's protection.
Harley gets caught by Roman Sionis (Black Mask) who is after a diamond.
Said diamond is seemingly a key to ruling the criminal underworld.

The end.***Spoilers end***
I generously gave this a 4/10 purely because some of the visual effects were pretty good, Margot Robbie (Harley), Ewan McGregor (Roman Sionis/Black Mask) and Chris Messina (Victor Zsasz) acting skills were keeping the film alive and some of the action scenes were mildly amusing. Other than that there is nothing really to redeem this movie. Think of Suicide Squad having an (almost) all star cast to keep it mildly entertaining and you will have an idea of the quality, or lack there of, that Birds of Prey has to offer. Which isn't much.",Birds of Prey
1939,willsearle,Had potential and a good cast but ultimately fails,1,1 June 2020,"This was a disappointment. I thought with Margot Robbie reprising her role as Harley Quinn this would be worth watching especially with Mary Elizebeth Winstead cast as The Huntress, I should have been cynical and heeded those who slammed it. I pegged them for being mean-spirited basement-dwellers but this is a total dude and they were right. Ewan McGregor is miscast, it looks horrible and the action is poor.

1943,bookoutandrew,"A female Deadpool, but with too many kicks to the groin.",6,13 February 2020,"This film was generally alright. Nothing too mind-blowing, nor spectacular. It was just a fun violent experience in theaters.I love the idea of Harley Quinn getting her own story, with cutting ties with the Joker and going her own route. However, I've come to notice looking back at this movie, and Harley's character, that this was aiming to be a female rendition of Deadpool.There are very obvious similarities to the Deadpool movies in Birds of Prey. From Harley's constant narrating and sarcastic remarks, to her having to protect a rebellious teenager that the main villain is out to capture. Of course, BOP does go in a different direction, but it becomes painfully obvious if you've seen the Deadpool films.Despite the poster and advertisements promoting the possibility of Harley forming her own group, they don't come together until the final act of the movie. And even then, it's all because the characters were in a dire situation, and that they needed a desperate cooperation to protect the teen and defeat the villain. There definitely was missed potential with the team-up, especially with how the movie ends. While Huntress and Black Canary team up on their own, and Harley goes on her own path with Cass, poor Montoya has a bittersweet ending.There were some very intense fight scenes, but they seem to invoke a feminist message with all the fights consisting of women violently beating up men. I'm not one for these types of politics, but they should've probably toned this message down a bit.Overall, Birds of Prey and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn (that title is too long) is an alright movie. If you love Harley Quinn, you're gonna love this. If you're anti-feminist, then this might not be the movie for you.",Birds of Prey
1944,ianstoianov,Great stuntwork. Meh everything else,3,6 July 2021,"Basic plot, with not much development on any of the characters.Some of the action scenes are very well made though, with some longer takes where you can actually see stuff happening before a cut.

From watching the trailers it gave that kind of vibe but it was just too much. It was funny in some parts but overall it was nothing special especially in comparison to these raving critic reviews. It was an okay one time watch. One bright spot was Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress. Would like to see more of her in future movies or even her own movie,Birds of Prey
1951,ldarroch,Find something better to watch,3,23 August 2020,"This film answers the question of what would happen if the producers of Disney Channel comedy-adventure films were told to add cuss words and lots of punchy-fighty scenes to their work. Everything is generic about this film - soundtrack, incessant unstylized standard fight scenes, flat soundstage cinematography, dull voiceover narration, costumes from a thrift store. It is not fun, edgy, artistic, innovative, gory, exciting... No psychology, no drama, no jeopardy. What a waste of an opportunity to explore a character from a radical feminist graphic novel perspective. Could have been a punk rock Killing Eve meets Watchman/Sin City but no, we have a voice over providing character synopses in the where-are-they-now closing narrative. Don't bother.",Birds of Prey
1952,rosebpos,I wanted to like it,3,15 April 2020,"I wanted to like it, I really did, I really tried, most action movies I can suspend my disbelief, but the action sequences were so fake I actually felt bored during them. The size differences are laughable, the punches are sometimes pro-wrestling bad, and the storyline is ho-hum, there are no surprises, no twists, and other than Harley, the characters feel very flat.I don't know what this movie is missing, but I actually felt sleepy during the fight scene in the boomboom room or whatever that building was called.I kept expecting Harley to use assorted traps or something as it was clear she used to live there. Instead it was just somehow 4 girls beating up over 100 guys, often without weapons. The weapons I cam understand, and Harley's martial arts skills, but the direct strikes from a 100 pound person on a 300 pound person don't feel believable, they don't seem to know martial arts and it shows.The director and entire cast should be required to attend a UFC training camp for a year as punishment and training for this grade C movie.What was this movie missing? A second storyline showing WTF the Joker and the Batman were busy doing this entire time. Even if it was just 20 minutes spliced up here and there.Bottom Line: It feels like a direct made for DVD movie that they only allowed in cinemas because of 'The Agenda' as we're apparently calling it now.",Birds of Prey

1955,sonofnob-826-74430,Best non-serious film I've seen in a while,9,2 October 2020,"I haven't read the comics, so I had no expectations for Birds of Prey, other than that Harley Quinn would be great, given that she was (in my view) the best part of Suicide Squad. In Birds of Prey, most of the boring and cringey parts of Suicide Squad are replaced by more awesome Harley Quinn. Emancipated from gimmicky sidekick role, Margot Robbie revels as Harley Quinn, and it's a joy to watch. Harley Quinn's a celebration of violence, intelligence, humour and unpredictablity, and Margot Robbie is great in the action scenes too, many of which are impressively performed and choreographed, worth rewinding to catch slivers of wtf moments. Apart from a slow section near the end, the film moves fast and entertainingly. Ewan McGregor plays Black Mask well but he and the other actors mostly fill out the background to Margot Robbie and Harley Quinn. That might disappoint fans of the comics but it's perfectly fine with me. Given this liberating upgrade of Harley Quinn and Margot Robbie's action skills, I look forward to more!",Birds of Prey

1965,destop913,"A disappointment, even with modest expectations",5,15 February 2020,"This movie is unfortunately a bag of mixed messages.It's supposed to come off as justice when someone is horrifically injured by Harley Quinn just for yelling an insult at her, yet when a kleptomaniacal kid spends the entire first act casually robbing her own neighbors, we're asked to chuckle and shake our heads as if she's Dennis the Menace.Many a joke is made at the fact that Rosie Perez's Officer Montoya is a walking, talking, hard-boiled cliche, yet that did not stop the writer and director from doing absolutely nothing interesting with her character. I can only assume that they believed lampshade-hanging to be a fair substitute for actual creative writing.One of the selling points of the movie is the group dynamic amongst the titular Birds - one review I read inexplicably and unfoundedly called them a ""sisterhood"" - when in fact the trio only become wholly acquainted about 20 minutes before the credits roll. It comes as no surprise that any ""chemistry"" between them comes across as absolutely wooden.At the start of the film, Ewan MacGregor's Roman Sionis is shown to be a low-level crime boss, trying to make deals out of his dingy, single-room nightclub. Yet it's not long before he's commanding entire armies of thugs just to capture a single diamond. This is more a case of inconsistent writing than mixed messages, but it left me scratching my head.To say that DC's track record is a mixed bag is an understatement, but at this point comic book movies are such a known quantity that competence hardly a lofty expectation to hold. And yet, this movie failed to meet it.",Birds of Prey

1988,edwardias,Could have been a masterpiece,7,7 February 2020,"Okay, so, first things first. As a fan of huntress, I really wish there was more of her in the movie. She is an interesting character, the actress was good and she even had some pretty fun moments, but too little screen time.
The rest of the movie is a fun ride, but fails to be anything other than that.
The feminist theme is very clear in the entire run, which was something I liked. All of the villains are men and they are all mad, no exceptions, and the men are mad, but you get where they were going with that. The problem is that they all become one dimensional. Black Mask, the big bad, is just a violent misogynistic creep, and that's it.
Aside from that, the old trope of one foe attacking at a time instead of banding together and attacking at once makes some of the fight scenes kind of boring, predictable and silly.

Even the side characters are interesting, not bland and bringing in some elements of the comic from which they originated.I'm no film critic, but as an ordinary consumer, this film has started my 2020 off with a blast and I look forward to seeing what DC does next with these characters.",Birds of Prey

The intro is quirky, funny, and seems promising but never truly rises at any point during the movie. The narration bit wasn't confusing, but didn't do anything to help drive the boring plot home. Add that to the fact that there was no real struggle or villain ...I mean...come on, you own the city but apparently no guns? Which leads me to my next point. Ewan McGregor. Fantastic actor, terrible role. I hold this opinion for almost all the characters in the movie. None of their character arcs are meaningful or develop enough for us to care about them. Another issue I had with the movie is the failed attempts at action choreography. I mean, you have dudes standing around and falling back before they're even hit...Honestly. It was a great concept.

2004,ehindependente,Don't listen to these man-babies,8,31 March 2020,"This is a good movie, don't listen to these men babies who rated 1 star to this very fun adaptation. They just can't take girls having fun. It has been said that this movie portrayed all men as bad and girls as good. It's just a misconception based on the fact that lots of men in the crime circle (cops included) are in fact sexists, violent, or plain stupid. It doesn't state that all men are bad. Nor that women are good either. Harley Quinn herself isn't portrayed as a good person, by the contrary. Yeah, she does some good deeds, especially in the end, but she's ultimately a lunatic, shaken after breaking up with Joker, so some soft sides are revealed, through a whole lot of treachery, vanity, alcoholism, bad higiene, yearning for violence and homicidal grit. None of the girls are perfect. The goofy vigilante cop, the badass canary working for a psychopathic crime lord and the huntress as a cold blooded assassin, thirsty for vengeance. That doesn't seem as a statement for women superiority. Also has been said that the script is awful, in spite of some good fight scenes and laughs. Honey, practically all the scenes are fight scenes and laughs. The script is cool, crazy, dark and fun, just as Harley Quinn herself. You'll have a good fun watching, if you're not a stuck up nerd who wants all movies to be perfect exploitations to the original comics, or simply a sexist weirdo, or a wining man-baby. For those who said this is a girly movie, you need to upgrade the term ""girly"", cause this is a cool flick, and ""girly"" isn't supposed to mean all flowers and unicorns. Drugs, violence, nastiness, nothing a kid should watch, for those who said it was a kids movie. Just don't listen to them and watch it, have fun!",Birds of Prey

Anyways, I saw this movie with my girlfriend, and I went in to this movie expecting it to be a feminist-like suicide squad movie. Well, boy was I wrong, this movie was amazing. If you are going into the movie with knowing you enjoyed Harley Quinn, you will love this movie. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was thrilling to watch, she was hilarious and a badass. I really enjoyed it! I do have some critics in the dialogue, but the tone that was given to us at the beginning, stayed with the movie throughout the whole time. It's action packed. It's not going to be artsy, it's not trying too, it's an action packed movie with a character driven story.

2012,lukasragalj,Moderately moderate,7,10 February 2020,"This was not my most highly anticipated comic book movie of 2020, but i was interested in seeing what happened after the Suicide Squad ""incident"". Specifically to see Harley's life after she broke up with the joker. Of course this movie has flaws, a lot of reasons to be criticized, but overall i think it kinda did a good job continuing the story of Suicide Squad. Although there were only minor signs and easter eggs of the previous movie, it felt like its completely own movie. I can't really say Margot Robbie's performance was the best, i mean she was, but i liked Ewan's distressed gay boy (man) performance a bit more. I have to say i felt more sympathy to Roman Sionis, than to any of the ""Birds od Prey"".
Talking about the ""Birds of Prey"", the characters were not interesting. It is just a group of WOMEN, that are STRONG, and POWERFUL, they have a set of skills that they use to fight the so-called ""villains"". and all of them had, still have, or are even going to have a crap life. I did not resonate with anyone in the group except Harley. I just hated the characters. The plot is kinda meh. There is something about a diamond, problems with mafia, revenge, everybody hates everybody... The most confusing, and to me the most annoying thing about the movie were the backtracks where we have to go in time like three times to know whats going on. It seemed really cheap, but hey, it worked i guess. The last and the worst thing about the movie was the death od Roman Sionis. I haven't seen a worse villian death in years. They could have kept him alive, or meaby even fake his death, but they went bloody ruthless on him. So yeah i didnt really care about the Birds of Prey, it was basically Harley Quinn and the Birds of Prey, because it was merely her life, and her movie.",Birds of Prey
2013,chloeex,Engaging and Powerful,10,17 February 2020,"I don't often write reviews for movies but after seeing ""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"" I knew I needed to write one. This movie is funny, action-packed, fun, and has a great soundtrack so I don't know where a lot of the negative reviews are coming from. Margot Robbie plays Harley Quinn to a tee and absolutely kills her performance. The supporting cast--Rosie Perez, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, and Ella Jay Basco-- does a great job at bringing to life their powerful characters. I heard a lot of hesitance about this movie stems from the fact that people are worried that it would teeter on the line of ""man-hating"" but I am here to dispel those rumors and let you all know that it is nothing like that! The movie does not focus on trivial ideals such as ""hating men"" and instead choses to focus on Harley Quinn and how she struggles to move on post Joker.
To be perfectly candid, after coming out of the movie I felt so invigorated and powerful. It's always amazing to see strong and powerful women on the big screen and director Cathy Yan should be proud of this movie.",Birds of Prey

All the birds of prey-rushed backstories, heavy flashback exposition all riddled with ""toxic male"" caricatures and stereotypes. This film was also surprisingly insulting to gay men as well, Ewan McGregor is an over the top gay character who is somehow every ""toxic male"" trope combined into one.

The cast was a mix of charming, mischievous, cynical, and a little psychotic. If you're familiar with Harley Quinn, particularly Margot Robbie's portrayal of Harley Quinn, you should have an idea of what to expect, but I'd like to think the film shattered many expectations. What I enjoyed the most about this film is its departure from DC's trend of dreary superhero movies; the film is bright, upbeat, and has a sense of humor.

This was an action packed film that was fun to watch and is like a lot of other popcorn movies that people sit through all the time, with the one exception being that it is a group of women who take down the antagonist instead of a group of other men.I do feel sorry for all the weak right leaning men who had to rate this film a 1, in order to make themselves feel good about themselves. They must be the same bunch that reacted the same way to the Batwoman TV series (which is also a great action series)truth is that the fight sequences and story here are just as good as a lot of other movies out there that many people enjoy. I especially enjoyed a lot of Harley's fight sequences which had a few interesting twists to it and thought that the locales of the amusement park fight and the final scene On the pier were interesting and the music score was really good.On the down side I think that another 20 minutes to flesh out some of the Birds of Prey characters would have been nice (movie is under 2 hours). Also there is one scene involving Roman feeling as though he was being slighted by a woman in the bar that upset me a bit - I felt it was unnecessary to strip her down and get her to dance on table top, when if he really was upset by her laughing, I would have expected him to have a more psychotic or violent response.

The story might be too simple and really not that complex but it was fun to watch.Plus don't go in there expecting a birds of prey movie, this is basically a Harley Quinn movie with some side characters. I loved the fact that Harley Quinn was the main focus but I could see how some people wont like that.It is weird to me that people see him as a villain but then Harley is not that great of a person either and she does most of what he does too.

What about other part of movie... I had a filling that child write scenario like ""boys(girls) not allowed' on tree house doors. And there wasn't any good women characters except Harley. Men characters is totally blank and empty too. Just another one evil white guy without good history and charisma.

Only down side was no Joker but then the film would have ended up being more about him than Quinn. Ewan MaGregor played a decent baddie Black Mask.!

That you have to literally make it all about men vs women? Its so damn in your face and so pretentious that it literally got unbearable to watch within the first 30 mins.You can literally tell the difference between a good director and a bad by comparing the Harley Quin in this movie to the same character in the latest Suicide Squad(2021).

Harley Quinn doesn't take up the whole film, time is actually used very well on each character. The exception to this is Huntress, who is seen only vaguely at the beginning of the film. I personally like how they characterized her, but that's just me. Black Mask is excellent, all the parts in the trailer of him being over the top are pretty much it, he is actually serious and intimidating but with a narcissistic edge, not at all like the joker or any other DCEU villain. The story is told from in fractured time from Harley's perspective wich is either a good or a bad thing depending on your opinion of her accent. The special effects are better than in past films and also very sparingly used. at the moment it is only minuets after seeing the movie i only have one real problem with the movie, wich isn't even really a problem with the film itself and is more of a personal grievance.
Overall, fun enjoyable film.",Birds of Prey

The fight scenes are entertaining and well choreographed (they used the same guy who did John Wicks fight choreo) and each character has a fighting style that is unique to them.Margot Robbie did a fantastic job acting and producing this film and Cathy Yan did a fantastic job directing. The story might be considered a little basic, but it's easy to follow and is an all around great action movie.Ewan McGregordid a great job as Black Mask and is terrifyingly charming and unhinged in the same scenes. And Chris Messina's Zsasz is creepy and well acted.One of my favorite parts of the film were the supporting Birds of Prey. Huntress played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, with arguably the smallest part stole the show with her stilted social skills and rage issues. Jurnee Smollet bell as Black Canary was gorgeous and did a great job portraying the reluctant hero type. And Rosie Perez as Renee Montoya is fantastic as the disenchanted cop.

This is a group independent strong female gang. I really never had this much fun watching a film although I am a film addict and I go to the theaters often.This film basically tells us to quit a toxic relationship with a toxic person.

2060,themarcusbernacci,Best DCEU film!,10,3 April 2020,"'Birds of Prey' is the best DCEU film, next only to 'Wonder Woman' (2017). As far as entertainment value goes, 'Birds of Prey' is by far the best.Right from the beginning credits to the end, it's a strong movie. Really solid screenplay, strong performances, good laughs. This film and 'Wonder Woman' aren't really comparable - 'Wonder Woman' is far more serious - but this film sports a much more creative and satisfying third act.While 'Wonder Woman' follows the typical Zach Snyder CG-fight-in-the-dark-with-explosions, 'Birds of Prey' uses a much more interesting location, fun characters, and a final showdown that feels motivated and compelling.As for complaints about the title - yes, this should've been titled 'Harley Quinn & The Birds of Prey', instead of the other way around. Make no mistake: this is the Harley Quinn movie. For fans of Harley Quinn comics, this is the most faithful adaptation you'll ever get.

And now you have excellent action/comedy with female lead and all i see sticks and stones all over.
Probably all those comments comes from insecure men who feel threatened, so my advice, ignore them and enjoy the movie. Margot Robbie is great and her facial expressions are inimitable. So far, I've watched this movie twice..",Birds of Prey
2065,jethrojulian,Birds of Prey Review,7,6 February 2020,"This movie feels like Warner Bros' attempt to amend the mistakes they did with Suicide Squad. Hell, at some point it felt like the scenes came from a Suicide Squad movie. The question is, does it work? Yes and no.What this movie has and Suicide Squad lacked is that all the casts are great. Margot Robbie is having the time of her life playing Harley Quinn, Rosie Perez was brilliant and funny, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is so good she should have way more screen time, Jurnee Smollet-Bell shuts her critics down with definitive performance of Black Canary (Oh and that scene was great and was so badass), and Ella Jay Basco was the heart of the movie. And don't forget the charismatic Ewan McGregor who is the embodiment of Roman Sionis (at least from what I have seen from the Arkham games and DCAU movies). The interactions between the main characters are the reason why this movie didn't suck. It was the only thing that worked but it worked so well.Other than that, this movie felt like you're watching a Suicide Squad movie for the 2nd time apart from the fact BoP had a decent third act. I don't know why they inserted a song in every scene possible. Probably to make the scenes more badass but it definitely didn't. Why would you do that? It's like you're watching a never-ending musical video at times.All in all, the movie was a good fun but it could and should have been better.",Birds of Prey
2066,Gary Wood,Just awful,2,15 October 2020,"Between the feminist fantasy of how men behave to the overreach of the physical expectation of a slight Margot Robbie, this is a bad, bad film.
Margot Robbie is a great acress, but the biggest failing of this film, despite all of the opportunity for CGI, edititing and every other trick is that she was set up as an equivalent to a powerful, male lead. I don't know why. There's hint that they writers tried to write in her winning through wit, cunning and smarts but so many of the fight scenes are presented like she was a man with the result that the people she is beating, attacking, pummelling appear to spend half their time waiting for her to hit them.
It's a female-led production. How could they have let her down so much? The bits inbetween the action look and feel like a fly on the wall documentary at times as she walks around between weak set-pieces like some talking to the camera reality documentary.
Was this written as a quick to market cash-in? It feels like it.

I didn't feel that it was politically pushy or a ""girl power"" movie.
Yes, the main characters are all women who are struggling with somehow being in the shadow of others, but I felt it was a built on a overall subject that can be applied for both men and women alike.
As we can see in the beginning of the movie, Harley has broken up with the Joker, but is still living her life with all the perks that comes from being his girlfriend. She soon finds out that everyone around here believes she will run back to the Joker as soon as she's faced with the not-so-pleasant reality of being on her own. This makes her realize that she's been living under the belief that her capability to succeed depends on someone else. So she cuts the act and decides to start from scratch which of course is not a dance on roses, considering she's broke and half of the city wants to kill her. Even so, she just goes for it with an optimistic attitude and with confidence.
My point is that where many others would see hardship and obstacles, she sees possibilites and finds solutions. And by that takes back control of her life and makes it just as good, or even better than before!As for the action scenes, I agree they were over the top, but in an entertaining way that was suitable for the movie. Thumbs up for the incredible acrobatics in the fighting scenes!

The pros:
Margot Robbie makes the best out of bad writing and manages to portray a crazy and funny Harley Quinn.
The Cons:
The action scenes literally feel like playing the tutorial of a video game with a level 100 character.
""Emanzipation"" in this Movie literally means that every male character is an complete idiot and/or an a**hole while every female character is the most badass person ever.
The plot is a cliché, the first 30ish minuets set up the story and the rest of the plot is 100% predictable and does not surprise even once.

The fighting isnt realistic so if you prefer making sense, this isn't for you. They're really creative though, with fantastic settings and some good comedic beats. (Though not all hit but find me a movie that does)The characters were great, Ewan McGregor is awesome but you already know that. Harley Quinn was a very interesting character to me and a lot of fun, once you put her in a world of her own. Please do this again DC. Black Canary was awesome. Huntress was good.
The one character I did not like at all for some reason was officer Montoya. Might just be me, but I found her character awkward and almost mood-killing. They all need more depth, especially Huntress, Cassandra, and Black Mask. But DC is providing better characters in my opinion and I like where they're heading.I also though there were times where the pacing felt like a hectic game of red-light green-light, however I didn't feel it hampered the experience too much.All in all. Worth giving it a shot. Like most movies it might not be for everyone, but I think if you're curious about seeing it.

However. The story is all over the place and even kinda messy at times. Even tho I enjoyed Harley Quinn and Black Canary in this. I feel like they should of done more with the other characters.

2113,emmanuelfajobi-61345,AN ENGAGING FEMALE LED ACTION FILM,7,24 March 2020,"MARGOT ROBBIE shines as Harley Quinn. For most of the film she does well solo fighting everything that gets in her way. She has very good tactical skills and also thinks with her mind when she is fighting against her foes. She tries to crack a joke or annoy everyone around her sometimes too much but she really engages the audience.EWAN MCGREGOR is ruthless as Roman Sionis/Black Mask but has a certain charm that you can't miss on screen. At times he seems crazy and could be because of some trauma he might have faced in the past.ELLA JAY BASCO as Cassandra at times seems like a distraction and an annoyance on screen but brings light to some of the scenes in the film especially as she admires Harley Quinn. She makes Quinn seem more human and relatable despite her insanity. She is looked on as bait and at the start is the only reason Quinn wants anything to do with her but overtime their relationship develops and she is acceped by the audience.THe supporting case at times holds their own especially JURNEE SMOLLETT-BELL as Black Canary. She has this badass nature that lures the audience in and you want to see more from her. There is a vulnerable side of her that she only shows to Black Mask which is interesting to see portrayed. She and Quinn have this chemistry that makes her seem more developed on sceen which engages the audience.Other characters that have impacts in the film are assassin Huntress played by MARY ELIZABETH WINSTEAD, detective Renee Montoya played by ROSIE PEREZ and Sionis' henchman Victor Zsasz played by CHRIS MESSINA.When Harley Quinn, Cassandra, Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya worjwed together against Sionis they were unstoppable there was a mixture of intelligence, wit, strength, accuracy and heart when they worked together. It felt like was actually watched a good female focused action film that was enjoyable to watch. I beleive that this is the way DC should be looking to developing films in the future by possibly looking at stories where females are the protagonist and are independent.Overall I think that it was a GREAT action film with great use of music, sound and editing to enhance the story. It was very colourful which is props to the film director and the director of photography. I feel that it did empower women especially as the film was directed by a female, CATHY YAN. It gives a platform for more female-based superhero films to be produced but at the same time is a great standalone film that should be seen as unique and independent from the DCEU.",Birds of Prey

2116,Nia-R,Fun yet Messy Rollercoaster of a Movie,8,15 February 2020,"I'll make this simple. This was overall a fun, quirky, colourful and unique girl-gang movie with a basic plot, enjoyable action, amazing soundtrack and cinematography, and more than enough comedy. A solid introduction to the Birds of Prey. Here are some pros and cons to give you a quick insight:Pros:
Margot Robbie's and Ewan Mcgregor's performance. They truly gave more life to their characters.Everyone gave an overall acceptable performance, acting wise.Huntress', Black Canary's and Renee Montoya's comic accurate 'origin' (wasn't really origin for Black Canary and Renee) story.The films uniqueness. I've never seen a superhero film quite like it.The humour. Wasn't too corny or forced.Harley's outfits. Loved how colourful and different they were. Reflected her personality well.Renee Montoya, Huntress and Black Canary were pretty comic accurate when it came to their personalities, maybe slightly except for Huntress but I'll leave that for my cons. Black Canary's race change wasn't too bad as well, Jurnee Smollett-Bell did the character justice.Renee and Huntress had solid outfits.Loved how they incorporated the top songs of the soundtrack into the movie, gave me goosebumps.I loved how they added a slight twist to Black Mask's personality. He still had his love for torture, but his flamboyant style didn't stray too far from the comics.Again, Harley was amazing. Like the life of the party, which in this case, is the movie.Huntresses outfit at the end.Black Mask's mask.They included Victor Zsasz's scars.They Canary Cry. It was one of the best things in the movie, gave me goosebumps.*SPOILER* Glad Harley ended up leaving the group at the end. Wouldn't of been the Birds of Prey we know and love with her in it. Doesn't suit Harley's character either.Cons:
They way the butchered Cassandra Cain's character was down right humiliating. She was an annoying, talking street thief who shys from battle instead of a brave and fearless mute assassin. Could've just named her something else.Black Canary's blazer outfit. It was so lazy. The others were fine though. Maybe she didn't get her comic one because it's only an introduction movie?Plot was messy. The constant reversing got confusing.CGI was bad at times. Blood looked fake. Sets looked green screen. But I'll accept because of the low budget.The main amusement park scene was so bad. It needed more editing. It looked fake and they way the False Face society members went flying over one kick was just hilariously bad.Again, Black Canary didn't have enough fight scenes and the ones she had weren't that special. It's Canary's fighting skills that make her special (other than the Canary Cry) but they were pretty basic.They made Huntress too edgy and emo. I understand she is sorta edgy in the comics but in the movie she was just all ""yeah sure whatever I don't care"".*SPOILER* Black Mask's death. They wasted his character but if you wanted to really kill him, could've done it in a less stupid way.Overall a fun film. The cons I wrote were things to consider if you're a bit pickier (like me at times).",Birds of Prey

I was hoping for more as Margot Robbie in Suicide Squad was definitely the best part of that film.As for Birds of Prey, it was a bit of a mess really. The plot was dull and rather boring. Ewan McGregor as a bit all over the place either really nasty or comic book villain, but it just felt like they couldn't decide on what best to do with any of the characters. One moment it was comic, next moment really dark.Overall not really sure what I sat down and watched. As most of the characters were shallow and predictable, action shots were so, so.

I gave it a star more because of all the hate. Would give it an overall 7/10. Plot wise the movie ain't to good but its not supposed to be. Its like an action movie, you kind of expect entertainment in the form of how it looks, not the storytelling. It could need some better character development, especially for the antagonist. Gritty, exaggerating humor. I have not read the comic books that some talk about, and I think I wouldn't care anyway how hey didn't stay true to the original birds of prey.

This film really made me LOVE the Harley Quinn character from her ""Suicide Squad stint and comic book take"". I'm a huge fan of the Batman - The animated shoe and Margot killed it. We both felt the same excitement when we watched Ryan Reynolds Deadpool when it came out. Sheer fun and stunning fight choreography. Gotham felt rooted in reality during the day yet became comic booky at night which was really fun. All of the actors brought their A game and we both can not wait until the Blu-Ray drops. I really hope people give this film a chance and appreciate the cinematic joy that it truly is. The soundtrack by the way is OFF THE HOOK and we're getting it. PLEASE Warner - Make a Harley + Birds Of Prey sequel. The director and her team have hit on something FUNTASTIC - Nuff Said ;)",Birds of Prey

If you want to see great action scenes than this movie is for you, if you are looking for a highly complex cerebral storyline then look elsewhere. Birds of Prey is a very simple story that reminds me of television shows that will write an entire episode around the average daily life of one of its characters. Nothing huge or Earth shattering happens but end of the world storylines are so common in super hero, or in this case anti hero, movies that it is nice to see a film where only immediate characters of a story are being affected, rather than an entire city or world. Over all I could have done without the annoyance of Zazz and a slightly more climactic ending but it was a fun romp that even managed a few audible laughs from me.",Birds of Prey

2126,ckane-20814,Two Incomplete Movies Smashed Together,5,18 February 2020,"By having Harley Quinn anchor a Birds of Prey movie, both sides of the story are underdeveloped. Margot Robbie is great again as this character, and has a handful of zany and entertaining scenes during a somewhat slapped together plot. Once the Birds of Prey (sans Batgirl) actually encounter each other in the final half hour, you get the movie's best action sequence (which in true DC film fashion is still a bit disorienting to watch), but none of the three members get enough character development since Harley is the center of the film. It's a shame because you can see glimmers of what could have been done with this film, as all three of the actresses in those roles give their characters personality, especially Mary Elizabeth Winstead who is totally wasted as Huntress. Ewan McGregor kills a rare villain role as a totally unhinged, Burtonesque Batman bad guy, who steals every scene he's in with his chilling and disgusting behavior. None of the effort by the cast can make up for the lack of story though. Once again, it just felt like DC tried to do too much in one movie and came up with something far lesser than what it could have been with more patience and planning. One hopes that these characters don't get tossed aside because of a bad box office and we get to see a real Birds of Prey movie with these actresses down the road (one that actually has Barbara Gordon/Batgirl, the FOUNDER of Birds of Prey).",Birds of Prey

Margot Robbie's character arc for Harley was beautiful and I loved her character in this much more than suicide squad. Cassandra Cain was interesting, I LOVED Black Canary and Huntress. Montoya wasn't my favorite personally but she was still interesting. McGregor was very good as black mask and honestly extremely funny.

2130,topictomislav,"Not Amazing, but does deserve a Chance",7,15 February 2020,"It's open season on Harley Quinn when her explosive breakup with the Joker puts a big fat target on her back. Unprotected and on the run, Quinn faces the wrath of narcissistic crime boss Black Mask, his own right-hand man, Victor Zsasz, and every other thug in the city. But things soon even out for Harley when she becomes unexpected allies with three deadly women -- Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya.Cathy Yan manages to deliver an adrenaline filled, comic-inspired movie to the big screens rather successfully. The film centres around Harley Quinn's breakup with the Joker, which causes her to struggle finding her own identity and independence. The story is told through the eyes of Harley Quinn, which delivers a fun and unique take on the events throughout the movie. Despite a compelling lead performance by Margot Robbie and a good soundtrack, Birds of Prey never manages to grasp onto its true potential due to a mediocre plot and some poorly written supporting characters. The audience is never really convinced to care about most of the supporting characters nearly as much as they should. The film does have a lot of positive factors in it though and is definitively an improvement over Suicide Squad.The films main highlight would have to be the action, it is possibly the best action in a DC movie to date, especially in the DCEU. The choreography of all of the action scenes is immensely well done. The use of slow-motion and a large variety of different camera angles really gives a fun, comic-inspired take on the action which is something that many films fail to successfully bring to the big screens. The film possesses a great soundtrack and uses it very well, this definitely benefits the movie. The loud and upbeat music during the action scenes gives more life to the fight scenes and makes you want more. Another highlight from the film would have to be the attention to small details throughout the film and the comedy that is attached to it throughout the movie.Margot Robbie is yet again simply flawless as Harley Quinn, she really makes the role her own and is undoubtedly the best and most entertaining part of the film. She manages to bring a sense of fun and craziness to her morally questioned anti-heroine. Ewan McGregor also manages to deliver a memorable performance as Black Mask, he displays a strong amount of energy in every scene. Chris Messina manages to deliver one of the stronger supporting character performances in the film with his very accurate take on the very sadistic and psychopathic serial killer Victor Szasz. Mary Elizabeth Winstead really fits the role of Huntress and portrayed her really well, but was given minimal screen time and this caused her to not have that much of an effect on the movie or the audience watching it. Jurnee Smollett-Bell (Black Canary), Rosie Perez (Renee Montoya) and Ella Jay Basco (Cassandra Cain) all deliver decent performances, but unfortunately fail to really shine like Margot Robbie or Ewan McGregor.Overall, Birds of Prey is a movie that people are either going to absolutely love or dislike, either way it is a movie that definitely deserves at least a chance and I would recommend people to watch it. It offers a unique form of storytelling and in a whole it is a unique movie that works really well for the most part. It might not be an amazing blockbuster, but it is a good enjoyable thrill ride that everyone can enjoy.",Birds of Prey
2131,jacobharveyclark,Missed a good opportunity,6,9 February 2020,"The film as a whole was action packed and enjoyable. However, it was a missed opportunity to make a film about female empowerment. The scene when Ewan Mcgregor's character ordered a club goer to stand on a table and publicly take her clothes off because she was laughing at a joke could have easily have been taken out of the film. I think the purpose of this scene was to make you dislike his character but this was already done previously in the film. This made the scene at the end on the pier enjoyable though. Also the ""Birds of prey"" collective was only formed during the ending of the film which meant that the title of the film wasn't really focused on in the film.",Birds of Prey

We don't get enough of the birds which is a shame because Black Canary and Huntress could easily lead their own films.The action is different and really keeps you engaged. It's also hilarious in that dry humor kind of way. I personally loved it! I was a little hesitant because of the costumes but the actresses are so sexy even without sexy fits.

2143,donnatroy-76304,crash and burn,1,7 February 2020,"I will start off this review with the positive aspects first such as: Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was a great casting and continues to be where I think she gives a better performance then her one in Suicide Squad, and Ewan Mcgregor plays a decent version of Black Mask. The use of colours and costumes I thought were great and I found some moments of entertainment through some of its action sequences.
You started well in the beginning but when you lose my interest from the middle of movie then you seem not to care for the movie anymore that you want to see the ending right away.
There is no Birds of prey, at least none recognizable from their source material counterparts. A dud from Warner Bros. Rosie Perez who is a walking cliche' as Renee Montoya (and I know that's what they were going for but it just doesn't work}, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress who gives us some very cringey at times acting, and I think some of this has something to do with the screenplay which I also think is average at best.The action was lacking and uninspired as well. It relied way too much on slow-mo fights or just too much going on to really understand it all. You know you have a poorly made fight sequence when they decide to use slow motion on every punch or hit to make it seem cooler than it is.
They also butchered Victor Zsasz which I found extremely disappointing as I was looking forward to his inclusion in the DCEU. The story is told out of order, which would work if it had an interesting one. The portrayal of the characters was somewhat adequate.
The best thing about suicide squad was Robbie's performance but this vehicle is a disservice to the potential that was there. Robbie does her best but the direction, script and editing are not at the requisite level. An interesting character poorly treated by a very lacklustre script. Disappointing.When a cartoon does better than a multi-million dollar film, you've failed.",Birds of Prey

I love high empowerment movies about women but dam it this is not how u do it. go watch wonder woman again instead of this trash. bvs looks better than this. ruin Cassandra cain origin from the comic book should've been an assassin not a child in this movie to act stupid. huntress was dimwitted idiot. black canary is ok.

I have no idea what some people in the reviews here watched but everyone I know that saw it loved it,me and my family loved it. Go see it for yourself and draw you own conclusions.

Boring overall, nothing stood out besides the blatant attempt to force an image down our throats.I went thinking it would be some empowering, fun spin on things, but what I saw was just mediocre writing, if not, sometimes shameful overly 'feminist' propaganda in the movie. Even as a female I found it off-putting and wrong. Altogether just another SJW type of plug into what should be a movie for everyone. Knock it off, Hollywood. Really. I am a 'nonwhite' female and EVEN I am sick of hearing this rhetoric.The only reason it gets two stars is for the fight scene choreography and what good acting was to be had from them.

The Birds of Prey characters are so boring and disappointing, bad writing, costumes are bad, AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO Cassandra Cain!! Oh God she is like the best Batgirl and you made her like that, so annoying and unlikable. NOPE.

There are thousands of movies where the males are bad guys. My main issue was the story was not very good. I liked the soundtrack. The action scenes were good and the acting was mostly good. 7/10 sounds right to me. And I see no need for a sequel. Once again DC just can't compare to Marvel,Birds of Prey

I wasn't even a Harley Quinn fan going into this movie but now I am. Just go see it.I would honestly say that I enjoyed this movie more than any Marvel movie I've seen in recent years. I honestly don't get the disparity in ratings and reception between Marvel movies and a movie like this, it doesn't make sense to me at all and seems like people are just bandwagoning Marvel and hating on DC for no reason.People who hate on this movie for being all-girl protagonist are ridiculous, the movie was just entertaining period, who cares if it was an all girl cast? I don't think it affected the actual entertainment value of the movie at all.Seeing some of the reviews for this movie makes me discount to a degree the value of reviews on IMDB because honestly this movie deserves higher then its score and what some people are saying.

I just cannot understand how entertaining the Marvel movies can be and how opposite the DC movies are. Dark in color and content, a repetitive disappointment time after time.

Honestly just enjoy the movie and stop being such wimps, seriously just watch the movie it's not a waste of time. Also they say ""why are all the men bad?""

I consider myself a centered individual but, considering that most (not all) female only centered films tend to do portly at the box office gives credence to that new phrase.
I love films, all types and genres and casts but, when you go out of you way to make men look ignorant and women the pillar of human civilization then reality slaps you in the face. If you want to make a film about strong women who kicks and take names then that is GREAT and I would love to watch it! Sadly, that has not happened yet (with the mild exception of WW).
Do we need more diversity in Hollywood? Yes? Do we need more female leads? Yes? Do we have to cram down everyone's throat? No. That only pushes people away and doesn't accomplish anything but galvanize their point about ""get woke, go broke."" Go see the movie. It's worth a watch.",Birds of Prey

Birds of Prey are rebellious, fun, wild, I loved it !!The action scenes don't have CGI and are long, rough, loud, fast and uncut, it's awesome!I freaked out at the police station, from start to finish, it's a funny and electrifying moment, Harley Quinn has an exciting presence and power.And Margot Robbie then ?!
I couldn't see the actress, she is just Harley Quinn !! You can only know that it is Margot, because MY GOD, she is very sexy, cute.
The expressiveness of Harley Quinn is something apart, in the moments when she is sad, just because of Margot Robbie's expressions and her striking eyes, you feel the depth of sadness and disappointment, and these scenes last only minutes, it's incredible , just a very dedicated, passionate and talented actress to do that.And the scene where she smiles with bloody teeth, a demented smile? She is crazy and don't give a damn !!Finally, the roller skating chase was the apex of the film, again congratulations to Margot Robbie for all the passion and the willingness she showed in these scenes, it was so epic and rad !!That's all, this is the first movie with '' real women '' that did not offend me, I thank Cathy Yan, Margot Robbie and everyone who worked for this film to happen.PS * I love you, Harley, marry me !!! *",Birds of Prey

I went into this movie without watching any trailers or reading any reviews and I think that's the way to see this movie. I think this movie is being unfairly torn down. I rated it an 8 because I had a few nitpicky complaints but nothing that caused me to hate the whole movie. It doesn't require you to watch any other DC films in order for you to get context which is nice. Harley does reference Suicide Squad at one point that I noticed but it was so minuscule. It was a team movie, regardless of what other reviews are saying, they work together in the end. Harley is in the subtitle, the story is from her point of view, so yes, she's going to be in the entire thing. She tells the stories of all the other ladies in the group and they all have moments where they shine but ultimately it is from Harley's view. I thought the movie was funny. Some things didn't land but I had a few good laughs.I didn't put enough thought into this movie for it to make me angry. It was just fun.",Birds of Prey

There is no overbearing 'women are better than men', which to be honest, I found more annoying in the Captain Marvel movie. I love that there was a female hero/ anti-hero presence in the movie and in no way was it shoved down anyone's throat. It really is great and I think you should watch it and make up your own mind :) the action scenes were really quite entertaining and I liked the story too.

It wasn't funny in my opinion although they were trying to be, I really cringed at at some of the acting such as the main detective. it was just super cheesy and lame really. I understand how they wanted it to come across but it just wasn't delivered right. I feel like they let Margot Robbie down, she really did well by her character and can't help it that they didn't execute the movie and the script right for her.. it is such as shame for her that the movie is not at all credible. My husband and I really felt like just walking out even at the half way point and lost complete interest towards the end.. it was actually painful and just made us laugh at how bad it was rather then the lame jokes within the film.

Look, the movie wasn't horrible but it wasn't good. Margot Robbie was the only palatable character, and the pacing languished most of the time. The 6/10 rating - which is probably a point on the generous side - supports this. I got a free movie pass so at least the price was right, Bob. Is it worth seeing?

I do wish they had actually put some characters with super powers in (apart from one), after all it is a DC movie.
The villain has no powers either and is just basically another gangster.
This movie is ideal if you just want to pass couple of hours without taxing your brain, and you accept it as a franchise attempt to make a quick movie for the huge non-male audience out there.

Which is sad how can the Joker who risked his life turn on Harley like this? I had always hoped they'd make a sequel to Suicide Squad but, I guess this is where the story is going.

Yes, every man in the movie let the main character down so it was a bit anti male. However that is what made it interesting- it was from Harleys perspective, she had just broken up with the love of her life, obviously she is going to not love the male race. The sets and costumes were amazing! Someone had written in one of these reviews that Harleys outfits were ugly. Harley is no longer dressing to please/ impress a man.

Let's get this out of the way. This is a girl power film even more than wonder woman, the villains are men the heroes are women, but thats not a bad thing. There are lead characters who are men, and they are great. The show-stealer, considering this is more of a Harley Quinn film is Margot Robbie as the woman of the hours. She lights up every scene she's in, and pulls off impressive stunts. An unlikely favorite is Mary Elizabeth Winstead as The Crossbow Killer (if you've seen it you get it). Every line that comes out of her mouth is hilarious and I laughed out loud far too many times. The other 'heroes' are all great as well especially Rosie Perez as Renee Montoya. My only gripes about this film are the comic inaccuracies and the pingpong pace of the first 30 minutes. It launches between a harley/canary scene then to a roman/renee scene a lot in the first act of the film. Cassandra cane seems to be a totally different person from the comics, but Ella Jay Basco is polarizing in the role. The main male presence, Ewan Mcgregor as Black Mask (though he only wears it in like one scene) has the high ground in dceu villains. (Get it?) he really has a blast with the 'I'm just such an irredeemable terrible person' character. The action is amazing, being in part shot by John Wick director Chad Stahelski. Every scene pops with color and every hit pushes its R-rated gore. Overall a fun ride, for anyone over the age of 12.",Birds of Prey

2201,JamRosco,Fun as hell but it didn't really earn the R rating.,8,20 February 2020,"I'm not going to say that this movie was a masterpiece of cinema but it was fun as all hell to watch to watch. You could tell that everyone involved with it from script to production design had a great time. I would not recommend this movie to anyone searching for a hardcore action film or even super dirty comedy. This movie could have easily been PG-13 with only minor changes. Birds of Prey is primarily a charter study on Harley Quinn and so If you where annoyed by her in Suicide Squad I would recommend skipping this one. I would also not recommend seeing it if you don't like absurdity as a comedic tool because thats the crux of a lot of the jokes.Overall a lot of the backlash from this movie comes from an alleged political agenda that I didn't really see much of. It was somewhat there but it was not really intrusive and was really just a natural part of the story. I went into this film ready to cringe but really it wasn't that bad. It's a story about a group of women told from a female perspective but it doesn't really linger on the ""Girl Power"" theme and message like some more poorly written movies. It's just kinda about them. There are a couple of scenes that depict guys being predatory but if you've existed .5 seconds on this earth as a women you know these scenes really aren't all that out there. Also, they both serve a purpose (one to progress the plot the other to establish a villain as being paranoid and unhinged).I think this movie is more suited to 15-25 year old women than its promotional material made it out to be but I think its still worth seeing if you can stand to turn your brain off a bit and just go along for the bombastic ride. It's colorful and really unique in its presentation at times (although it's still a corporate film so it's not to to out there). Also, the dialogue was this interesting mix of completely wild and more realistic than i'm used to seeing. Women in super hero movies or even just tough coded women are almost always portrayed as snarky and abrasive this movie just doesn't do that and its really refreshing. A lot of the conversations sound like real things that real live women would say to each other just in the context of crazy situations.Overall, this movie was a blast.",Birds of Prey

The movie is literally a crap from start to finish, and is unable to stay on track. The villain is an annoying manbaby for the sake of having a weirdly sexist character, the dialogue is cringey, and none of us laughed a single time throughout. You can literally tell which fights were done by the John Wick guy they brought in last minute, the level is worlds apart between scenes. If this movie was supposed to empower females, as a woman I am absolutely disgusted and outraged. Not only did they feel the need to ruin comic book characters, but punched fans in the face as well and had the audacity to call this mess a movie.

This one's for the rest of us.If you want to watch a hilarious and truly messed-up hero mess up and then try to put it right- if you want to see an ensemble of characters where they have actual arcs and aren't action figures being bashed together by little boys- if you want to see some of the darkest humor (villian exploding out of nowhere, anyone?), This movie is for you.Birds of Prey was one of the most tightly-choreographed, non-stop action comedies I've ever seen. I saw it three times so far. I recommend you go see it, particularly if you are not a dude, and/or if you have ever enjoyed Harley Quinn when she wasn't hovering around the Joker.If you need some more manpain, I bet there's something playing right next door that will soothe you.

Ewan McGregor is phenomenal as always, and Victor Zsasz definitely does not disappoint.

2217,clairesellwood,Feminism Overload,1,7 March 2020,"Margot Robbie is as always fabulous as Harley Quinn and there were some funny moments but that's where the compliments end.
Every male figure in this movie has been highlighted in a bad way, even down to the poor egg sandwich maker who only ever purchases out of date cheese!
Seems like the use of a movie to ostracise men. It would have been nice to have had at least one good male hero / icon in this movie to give the message that the whole population of men are not all terrible. In this day and age equality is paramount.
I am a women and I did not once feel empowered by this movie - no high fives, no cheering were to be had.
The 'fight' scenes are reminiscent of 1990s version Power Rangers, you could actually see where the actors were moving out of the way and not being hit.
Even though this movie is clearly on a feminist tangent, it's quite strange that the female director contradicts this message by repeatedly explaining the back story of Harley Quinn, therefore patronising every women by automatically presuming that they would not know or have even read the comics!
Watchable but entirely forgettable - next!",Birds of Prey

2220,thomas_nezhad,"Ignore the Wannabe Fanboys, this is a good film",8,9 March 2020,"Just to offset some of the other reviews, most of the reviews on here are trash, either ""hating on a female story and cast"", or some reason people actually thought this was a Birds of Prey movie with harley quinn, not the other way round. Granted, the studio shortened the title that way, but that's your own fault for being too lazy to read the extra words.The big give away is the narration by Harley Quinn, that would be a big old giveaway as to who's story and which comic books the film are based on.Harley Quinn is the main character, that is pretty clear from the trailers and what I was expecting going into it.
It is also clear this is the story after just breaking up with the Joker.
Put simply, this is a Harley Quinn story with the Birds of prey, not the other way round. That's pretty much what you would expect from the full title.
Which means this should be like a Harley Quinn comic, where heroes are present in the story, sort of like the Harley Quinn and Power Girl story.
It also means that the story is centered largely around her current hatred of Joker and men in general.It subsequently means (and if you like the Harley Comics, then you would know) that Character Development of Villains really isn't what it is about, and the Villains themselves are not supposed to be taken seriously, nor is any other character in it. Either that, or the characters take everything overly seriously compared to the rest of the content.My only gripes were the Lack of Beaver jokes and Harley's self control when something happens in a certain part of the film, but other than that, its pretty much on the nose, and along with other recent DC films, Shazam, Wonder Woman and Aquaman, one of the better DC films.It is definitely better than suicide squad, J league, dawn of justice.",Birds of Prey
2221,jacksilvernagel,"Stunning, Campy Fun",10,10 March 2020,"This film is amazing: an unreliable and trippy romp through Gotham following a deranged yet likable woman who just wants some breakfast. Seeing all the hate reviews here, it's clear so many people just didn't ""get"" it. This movie was made to serve the people, a brutally funny queer- and PoC-centric entry into the Camp/Cult canon, I left the theater feeling empowered and hungry both times I saw it. The stylizing, the pacing, the motifs, the soundtrack, everything in this film is perfection, and I think Cathy Yan is a genius. No, this is not another boring and terrible DC film, and it wasn't meant to be. This film is, truly, ""fantabulous.""",Birds of Prey
2222,eotoq,Very Well played by Margot,10,11 March 2020,Margot Robbie was really superb for the role of Harley Quinn. Loved the fantabulous emancipation. The characters were really very well made. The best thing about DC is their characters along with their origin and their connection to the comic world which is inconsistent along with time and different universe as well. The characters are really well connected in different universes as well. Such as in Smallville and Arrow you can their origin and then here as well. That's just amazing.

--
Awesome! & Acrobatic scenes from the movie the parts of the movie was really funny tho, because the joker broke up with her and she was depressed, she hung up his picture and threw knives at it, she joined an underground skating ring sport so she could beat up people to get her stress out. Also some guys tried to take advantage of her by getting her drunk first. It just reminded me a lot of how people are to girls. Idk, it's just a lot of funny scenes from the movie that this video doesn't show, but you can see some of the fighting scenes atleast here. There was one villain in the movie who was very sadistic, and he would peel people's face off with a knife. He was pretty freaky I liked how he died in the movie. They made him have a really good death scene. But before they did they showed how evil he was, he scarred his chest for each woman he would kill. Etc. The Death scene assigned to him was very fitting for him. Some of the movie is goofy, but most of it was good and funny tho. I don't mind the goofy scenes, since it kinda fitted in with her make-believe style super hero character. She had a pet Hyena, and she named it ""Bruce Wayne"" after Batman. I thought that part was funny as well.
Most modern movies, I haven't really liked the fight choregraphy, but this one reminded me a lot of 90s movies. It's not super super realistic, but lots of twirling of weapons and the flashy moves/weapon tosses made it entertaining to watch. Reminded me of stick twirling when she got her Base-ball Bat in the movie.
It was funny she had a Hyena named ""Bruce Wayne"" Which is actually Batman's name, so that's an easter egg for the fans of the batman universe etc. Since she named it after her enemies etc. Me & My Friend enjoyed the movie as well, and thought parts of it was funny. He rated 4/5, I rated 5/5 although there were a few scenes that was boring, which almost made me rate it 4/5, but I liked the character/ the movie a lot so I'll plan to get it when it comes out on DVD l8ter..",Birds of Prey
2225,Jonathan_Ryder,A thrill ride to enjoy for every type of moviegoer,9,13 March 2020,"Birds of Prey puts a lot of effort into its Female Independence background. I believe that the movie has a little something for everyone. It has comedy, drama, thriller, and more. Though I believe that the movie could have had a more put together story line, there was always something happening on the screen.I believe that the movie had a bad wrap following its predecessor (Suicide Squad) and some viewers are basing their opinions on how that movie did. A strong issue that I believe the movie had was the title. There length of the title and the viewed title of Birds of Prey, didnt tell most users what the movie was really about. When speaking to friends that arent strongly in the comic book world, they didn't even realize this movie was about Harley Quinn which lead the astray from seeing the film.Though some people may be judging the film from biased views, I believe that this film will be remembered and is a good step in the right direction for DC.",Birds of Prey
2226,paulgitler,This is a good movie,9,13 March 2020,"Adding my first ever review to offset the vast majority of incredibly unfair and mean-spirited reviews and low ratings. This movie is now my favorite ""chick flick"" replacing Crazy Rich Asians (which was the first such movie that I have ever liked). I did not like Suicide Squad at all and did not think that Margot Robbie's role was either well-written or performed in that one. And I was surprised when this project was announced based on my aforementioned opinion. But to my pleasant surprise, this film is just a whole lot of fun that is more entertaining than the Deadpool movies, especially since Margot Robbie is exponentially more talented than Ryan Reynolds. Birds of Prey should be taken at face value, which is to say that I am not acquainted with the ""Birds of Prey"" from comics or television so I was not making comparisons while watching it. I thought the entire cast was splendid and the four female leads along with the younger girl handled their roles well. I am less concerned about where this film fits into the ""universe"" of DC movies, but it does drop enough familiar references to DC things and includes two heroine superheroes to find a place there. I hope that they make another movie with Margot Robbie playing Harley Quinn because she is much more developed as a character here than in the first film and I think that warrants a return.",Birds of Prey

I hate when kids swear... it's like wathing your parents use FB, and signing their name ""Love mom/Janet"" next to the comment they just left on your picture. It just doesn't work.2.) She does alot of it. Plus she ends up being HQ's ""sidekick"" at the end, even though (I am deeply sorry for this) it shes not that cute. The attention shouldn't be on her.3.) THE KID AGAIN... She's the niece of Rufio (you know, from Hook) so she's desperate for the spotlight like her uncle. I don't like either of them so I'm a bit bitter.It's directed by a woman, so I automatically wanted to see it - But all & all, the artistic direction needs the spotlight.

Margot Robbie plays Harley Quinn incredibly well giving us a glimpse of Quinn's insanity. Birds of Prey: and the fabulous emancipation of Harley Quinn puts women's power under the spotlight in a strong convincing way.
There's one scene in the movie I'd replace with something a little bit more real in a way the spectator could stay and believe more in the proposed story.
As for the colors and lighting, I think that the concept and chosen tones and color palette really suits the movie and make it very bright, and lighten the dark part of the story. The special effects (vfx) are cool and I really like the part Quinn's enters a police station as seen in the trailer.
There's a 2D animation recap in the first few minutes of the film that is really nice and well done in my opinion. Animation is a good way to start such movie.

Back when we could go to the theatres before COVID-19 I went with two of my friends (girls by the way) and we had so much fun! The movie is quick-paced, keeps you on your toes and gives you chills. Overall super entertaining but we gotta admit the plot is not great and leaves us wanting more and also feeling like we lost time we could've spent elsewhere but in retrospect I absolutely loved the movie and I am still listening to the soundtrack on repeat (we watched it in February and now we're in July 2020).",Birds of Prey

I actually just looked up her age while writing this review. I just realized she had to be 50, i questioned her age and reason for being in the movie every scene that she was in.

2275,zdncwtjk,A Testament to Female Lead Films,8,1 September 2020,"Birds of Prey is the film Harley Quinn deserved. It captures all her brilliance, and does the comics justice wonderfully. Margot Robbie was truly amazing, and the love and understanding of the character is so evident in her portrayal. Birds of Prey Harley is everything she should have been in Suicide Squad, rude, funny, excitable and crazy in a way that isn't edgy and pretentious (""normal is just a setting on the dryer"" is a line that will haunt me for all the wrong reasons). She is sexy without being over-sexualised and I am so eternally grateful to the costume department for ditching the suicide squad booty shorts.
Harley Quinn aside the other actors are wonderful and their characters feel like real, actualised people (something that often gets lost in comic book based movies). This film, much like Wonder Woman is a true testament to women lead filmmaking and I hope it leads to more in the future. Easily one of the top films DC has produced in recent years it is truly criminal that it has been so poorly received, and I have to wonder how much of that is a result of either overt or subconscious sexism (how on Earth is this film rated lower than Batman vs. Superman and Justice League?)",Birds of Prey
2276,bekkijohnson-70149,Great film.,10,6 September 2020,"After reading other reviews on here I am shocked by the amount of negativity, and felt compelled to create an account purely to leave a review.This film breaks female stereotypes and smashed prejudice out of the window, breaking norms for these type of film. Current, relevant, funny and relatable. The female leading cast may be too much for the general viewer of these types of films, however for 2020, it's exact what this subculture needs and in my opinion is long awaited.
Margot Robbie was outstanding and cast were great, a funny and great performance
Colourful, comedic and cartoonic.A heavily female dominated cast which proved that there is more than just a ""pretty face"" to films like this, and strongly represents that females can kick ass without barring all.
Great and realistic choreography.
Pays great homage to tank girl (I think Margot would be a great Tank Girl)

2282,rheablurb,Incredible ride - probably the best DC movie in years,10,26 December 2020,"Here's the thing - I've put off watching this movie for months because of the incredibly resentful comments online, which I now realise are barely-veiled troll attacks. This is a genuinely good movie, hands down the best movie DC has put out since Nolan's trilogy. The soundtrack is epic, the movie has some ridiculously cool action scenes (there's legit action here, as opposed to the larger-than-life punches that superman has to handle, which don't really affect the story in any way). Margot and the rest of the cast did a great job, and the villains were nuanced, insidious creeps- which made for an excellent movie experience. The best parts were the quietly thoughtful scenes (e.g. where Harley offers Canary a hair tie bang in the middle of a fight sequence!). Movie never gets cheesy (ahem unlike most other DC movies), and there are only 4 protagonists besides harley (so it's nowhere near as cluttered as suicide squad was). It's a gritty, fun movie, and the closest parallel I can get to the MCU is Deadpool (both gory/hilarious).",Birds of Prey

This movie is visually excellent, hilarious, entertainingly strung together, and has wonderful, but not in your face, examinations of gender and the treatment of women both in film and in life.My only, minor, complaint about the movie is the way Cass was characterised. If you're a fan of comic book Cassandra Cain, then don't go in expecting much in that regard, they change her a lot. Still an excellent character, just one they should have made a new character rather than using Cass' name.",Birds of Prey
2284,channagreen,Outright unwatchable,1,3 January 2021,This movie was so terrible I had to turn it off 15 minutes in. It constantly demonizes men in scene after scene of the introduction.

Just do yourself a favor and skip out on this movie.,Birds of Prey
2285,hansiep,A great movie that isn't appreciated enough,10,26 March 2021,"This was a superhero movie, the world desperately needs more of. People complain that the villain wasn't evil enough. They should go back and watch the scene where he forces a woman to undress at gunpoint. That was truly horrifying and dreadful to watch. And those are the kind of men who are the villains in real life. They are not cool, they're not something you can aspire to be. They're pathetic and immature and narcissistic. And that was whole point. Humiliating women is not cool and he wasn't glorified for it. Apart from that, Harley Quinn is an unreliable narrator. That was established pretty early in the film. And it was great to watch. It wasn't a straight narrative and the film was much more better for that. All the outfits were so colorful and amazing. It's feminism wasn't forced. And I could actually empathise with the characters. Which is very rare in a superhero movie.",Birds of Prey
2286,notmebuttheotherone,I don't get the hate- I found it fun and entertaining,10,4 February 2021,"The movie was colourful, fun and entertaining, it certainly lacked a bit of depth but what superhero movie doesn't. I feel like a lot of the people who left reviews might have not whatched the movie or simply stoped early as there are a lot of outright mistakes abou the story. I really don't see the politicised argument since there are two blink and you miss it vague refrences to feminism. Harley is fun and the story concise, I particularly love Huntress and how she is simoultaniously a cold blooded killer but is unabel to comunicate her chosen name accuratly to the world which results in her being called with complelty different one. It also portrays a more human Harley and starts showing hints of being a deeper character. FInally I loved the relationship between Harley and Cassandra Cain reminding me of two sisters. This movie doesn't take itself too seriously, has comedy that works and is over all a fun ride.",Birds of Prey

I think this is the source of most of the hate this movie got because a lot of the negative reviews I have seen bout this movie are complaining about how the men didn't play a bigger role, or they claimed that it was a movie made to hate on men. Both of these claims do not apply to this movie because the men in the movie were not the main characters, so why would they need to play as big of a role as the women, and all because the men weren't front an center doesn't mean that this movie was meant to bash men. This is why I think everyone should watch the movie for themselves, and make their own opinions. Especially, since the negative reviews seem to have a lot of bias due to the mainly female cast. It is kind of like the people who left overly negative reviews wanted to hate the movie before they even watched, so they nitpicked every little thing.",Birds of Prey
2298,jenonthemoon,So much fun!,9,10 July 2021,"This movie is enjoyable and entertaining for anyone who enjoys watching empowered women have some kick ass fun. Margot Robbie is spectacular as Harley Quinn, a cross between Villanelle from Killing Eve, Tank Girl, Betty Boop, and Elliot Page's character in Whip It. I loved watching her hijinks from getting drunk to her wacky, acrobatic fight sequences. Rosie Perez is a dorky, unappreciated cop, Jurnee Smollett is a sultry singer who can fight in tight pants, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is like a funny, self-aware Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and not but not least, Ella Jay Basco manages to be utterly adorable and super annoying at the same time - like most children I know. Ewan MacGregor is basically the same character as in the Halston series on Netflix.Loved the colorful, comic-inspired cinematography, which is not as dark and ominous as in the Joker movie. The plot and character development were thin, but that's not really the point of the movie. I appreciated how Harley Quinn is allowed to be all torn up about Joker but it's ultimately not the focus of the movie, a good framework for girls and young women learning about developing their identities aside from romantic relationships.",Birds of Prey

This movie isn't even about the the birds of prey, as they don't get together until the end of the movie, and they have almost no backstory. This movie doesn't make them interesting at all. It's a Harley Quinn movie that's not fully a Harley Quinn movie.Quinn is supposed to be excellent in her fighting skills, and in some scenes, she takes down 7 guys all at once in hand to hand combat, but then when she fights a woman it's a fair match? When she goes hand to hand with a DRUNK detective female, they're equals, but against men she destroys them. It's honestly cringe worthy. They brought in an action directior from John wick 3 to redo some scenes, and you can CLEARLY see which ones they are.They set this movie up at the end for a sequel, but I hope they don't make one. This has a horrible story, it's hard to follow, the action scenes are cringe worthy. The pickpocket preteen has more screen time than what should be main characters, and black mask isn't a scary or respectable villain.

But Harley Quinn is so much fun so seeing it from her mind means bouncing around like a terrier after a ball. And you don't have to have seen SS because everything is covered, a few times.
And I think some people have misunderstood the title and thought this was a team movie with Harley joining the team, it isn't. Harley makes the Birds of Prey team happen, setting up future movies the way Batman VS Superman introduce Wonder Woman and her 2nd movie is now (FINALLY) coming out. DC Entertainment isn't run by stupid people and movies like this are meant to help push a story along as well and tell it's own story and the thing it does best, Entertain. I expect to see the Birds of Prey heroes in future movies even if Harley isn't in them.
There are a lot of Justice League stories, I'm a fan of the Dark Magic heroes myself and I'm hoping to see their story with all the other Justice League stories in the future.

2341,lifeisamazing-co-uk,"This is a really unusual movie, full of laughs and brutal violence. Excellent.",10,16 February 2020,"Just watched Birds of Prey again. The elegant violence of the fight scenes, and the sheer Tom and Jerry comedy of them is fabulous to behold. This is a really good, joyous, dark unconventional superhero movie, with an oddball anti-heroine and some really excellent direction. The script is also hilarious. So, I would say, worth a look.I had to go twice, because the first time I didn't realise it was going to be quite so much of a comedy, and it took me ten minutes to tune in. I was expecting something more like Suicide Squad than Shazam!, and this is very much a fun movie in the Deadpool vein. Dark and hilarious, it also has something of the 1960s Batman in it, especially with one fight scene.Joyously oddball. Margot Robbie is outstanding, but so are the other women in it. The guys are baddies, mainly, or feckless and the women have to work together to win. There is a message there, and I'd say it's probably worth knowing. If I had a daughter, I would be pleased for her to be given this piece of advice in film, rather than she learn to be bit of eye candy draped on the set to furnish it.A really fun visit to the cinema.",Birds of Prey

2343,ibiwagirl,I dont know HOW someone could dislike this movie,10,29 July 2021,"This was seriously just such a fun, lighthearted action flick with sweet female friendships and an eyecatchingly dope color scheme!! What's not to like? Seriously, whats not to like- why are there so many negative reviews on here?I'm a fan of the comics and though I'm sad that the actual Birds of Prey weren't highlighted enough, I'm honestly just appreciative that they made it to the screen AT ALL given DC's favoritism towards male characters :eyeroll:.Plus it makes sense why the film was set up this way- Harley is basically guaranteed to bring in new viewers, but DC prob didn't wanna put all their chips on a new team like with Suicide Squad to potentially have ppl not like them and hate the movie. I see this as a nice intro to the BoP (hence why its subtitle is the Fantabulous somethinsomethin Harley Quinn) and since it OBVIOUSLY set itself up for a sequel, we'll get to see more of our girls in action next time around!!But fr this movie is genuinely cool af- the fighting choreography is absolutely my FAVE, its so fresh and exciting! That and the costuming... and sets.... okay Im a huge sucker for the visuals. But the jokes land perfectly too!I think most of the negative reviews are coming from lame fanboys that would never comment this stuff if the main character was a guy (oh yeah I'm playing that card! Bc there are stupidly high expectations for ALL female-led comic book films to be absolutely perfect in EVERY way. Also, ppl keep crying ""wah this is just female Deadpool"" as if Deadpool created the snarky vigilante trope or smth?? Yall didnt complain when Star-Lord was just Tony Stark in space or when Dr. Strange was just Tony Stark with a cape, so drop it.)IN CONCLUSION this movie is a bop and a HALF and I def recommend watching it :) its also a reeeeally fun sleepover/girls night movie!",Birds of Prey

The music was brilliant and I even believe the cast played it well. However there was too much irrelevant sub-plot. The disjointed time framing of the film I enjoyed from an artistic point of view, because it was narrated by Harley Quinn which solidified her thought process and her madness. But unfortunately that was all the music to her madness. She wasn't erratic enough. While Margot Robbie certainly looks like Harley, theres a complete lack of substance there that I feel the director fell short on.",Birds of Prey
2347,cc-chaitnya,"A colorful, enjoyable romp",7,30 August 2020,"Birds of Prey is an colorful, enjoyable comic book book that takes you for a ride. Does not have anything new to offer and is kinda childish in parts, but on the whole keeps you entertained enough.
The movie on the whole has some laugh out loud moments, some gorgeous action set pieces. The movie is decent in the edit with how manages to juggle screen time between different characters without becoming jarring or losing focus on the plot. In this sense, it is what suicide squad wanted to achieve, only if it had a central vision.
Talking about the characters and the plot. The charaters are given some decent arc which just functional and not enough to make you feel for them. Some of the arcs are so stereotypical that the movie itslef acknowledges that to play it out for jokes. While starts of on an interesting note, where harley and joker are broken up so every single person in the city who was wronged by harley is coming for her life. But the end of first half, it just becomes about a mystical device that some char are trying to steal while others are trying to hide.
On the whole, this is Margot robbies movie. She brings so much to the table. Age is effortless and endearing in a way keeps the movie alfoat even in its lowest moments. Even though this movie was being promoted as a female-hero team up, I was glad they chose to focus most of the movie on Quinn instead. Narrating the story from her whacky perspective is what keeps the story fresh.
On the whole, I think birds doesn't break any new grounds in terms of comic book or female led genre movies. However, it is breezy and fun enough to be enjoyed once in the theatre and then later when it comes on a streaming platform.",Birds of Prey
2348,chrisschiro,"Don't take this too seriously, it's a DAMN GOOD time.",10,10 February 2020,"First off, I've never been a comic reader so I don't have the knowledge of the comics like a lot of these reviewers on here. However, just as a movie on its own this was a great time! No, I wasn't a fan of suicide squad particularly for the fact that a PG-13 villain flick just fell flat.
Birds of prey isn't a perfect movie by any means , but it checks off a few important boxes (in my opinion) when it comes to films of this genre.1. First off Margot Robbie does a great job of really living in the character the whole movie
2. well choreographed fight scenes that make the film deserving of its R rating
3. visually appealing in the colors, weapons, costumes, and set locations used for a lot of the film
4. this is a kick ass movie- one of the few (all) female action films that really holds up to these male dominated films , also for all the reviewers saying the message is ""men are bad"" I must've missed something because no where in the film did I get those ""in your face"" feminist vibes. It's really just a bunch of people kicking ass- that happen to be female.All in all, is the movie perfect? No. Is it an airtight plot and story? No. However, it was one of the best times I've had watching a movie in a long time, it brings to the table what suicide squad failed to.",Birds of Prey

Similar to how the Joker movie is it's own stand alone take on the character this movie is a fun standalone movie where it doesnt need to fit into any other DC movie tropes. It also definitely reminded me of the more recent standalone Harley Quinn comics. The plot is more loose and fun with Harley going off on her own adventures finding herself without the Joker. I could see how some people may not like the new Harley but I think it keeps well within the spirit of her character.,Birds of Prey
2364,emilydubos,It was a lot of fun,7,22 February 2020,"Robbie plays a FANTASTIC Harley. She's quirky and quick on her feet. I like how this movie only served as an introduction to the birds of prey. Some scenes had that goofy animated series type of feeling to them. While yes, all of the enemies are men, I never got the vibe that this film was meant to put males down. It simply felt like a fun action movie with a few kickass leads. I had a great time. I'm giving it a 7 because it's definitely only meant to be a fun comic book movie. There's not a lot of depth and a few plot holes that are expected going in. I felt it was worth the money and time. I'm not sure why people hated it so much.

Anyway I can't stand watching a film, which by design as I have understood is about equality and empowerment of women, use the most stereotypical of feminine traits to portray them as badass and effective in a cruel world. This is the result of trying to make a b role from a character that was stereotypicaly created at its time as a second fiddle. Stop the madness!!!!

Loved the exemplary level of althetisism from all actors. Takes an immense amount of work to get that awesome at kicking a$$ and look that great doing it. Sort of reminded me of well-choreographed Jackie Chan fights, effortless and super stylized.
Visually: very pretty and if you're actually paying attention, you also will see many disturbing images around Dark Mask (in the club: mini statues of women being silenced, blindfolded, etc, and around his hide-out house, it gets a lot darker. ) To me, this signifies attention to detail, which I applaud.
Plot: a bit messy. Takes a bit too long to get the main ladies together, and at that point, you do wonder about the magic of the feminine collective, and how quickly everyone untied over a common cause. At the same time, I still cheered for all of them, despite the lack of a consistent story line.
Physics: very questionable :) Then again, we're in the DC universe.
Bottom line: it was fun. I laughed, I cringed everytime Harley broke someone's ankle with a bat, and I genuinely had a great time. Kudos to those who made this happen.

However, it was dragged on a little too long, characters were not fully developed and the parts that were supposed to be funny fell flat. I also thought the young asian girl (being asian myself and love seeing asian representation, I don't say this lightly) was just not skilled enough in acting yet to hold her own in this movie. Most of the scenes with her didn't feel realistic enough and reminded me that I was watching a movie rather then helping me get immersed in the story with believable acting. I think in time she would be a great actress. A lot of scenes where Margot Robbie would talk directly to the audience gave me Deadpool vibes, but did not come close to the humor. By the end, I was waiting for the movie to be over. DC movies continue to disappoint me.Also, this has no impact on the actual movie, but can we talk about how Ewan McGregor and the actress who plays huntress met on another set and he basically left his wife of 20 years for her. Didn't sit well with me seeing them both in this movie, but that's just my own personal opinion.

2380,anderstoft,I expected nothing and was still disapointed,2,15 May 2020,"I didn't watch this one in the cinema, as I couldn't really get it coordinated with my friends. And then corona happened and I thought I'd just rent it digitally, as that was the immediate solution. So I did - for around 7-8$ (in my local currency).I watch all superhero movies when they release as that is my hobby.I had 0 expectations because it's a spin-off of Suicide Squad which was a huge disapointment in so many ways - but that's a different story.Harley Quinn was a good character in Suicide Squad and was one of the few positives, but the other characters were relatively unknown from a mainstream point-of-view. As such, DC took a risk in releasing this film and prioritizing it before other more well-established titles.The trailer and the marketing certainly didn't get my hype up for this one - but I'd give it a shot regardless. How bad could it be, right?Long story short; I only finished watching it because I paid for it. Had it been available for streaming on e.g. Netflix, I'd turned it off about halfway in.Plot - non-existent. Harley narrates everything (why? and to who? the actual viewer?).
Characters - flat, boring, bad acting. Black Mask wasnt menacing and didn't seem like a gangster boss. His motivations are being explained in a sentence and we are supposed to believe that for the rest of the movie. I end up not caring about him at all. Victor Szazsszszzssz (?) was interesting but it still didn't hit the real character for me. Harley was Harley but she was overdoing the acting. Rest of the BoP were all boring and endlessly uninteresting - as were their motivations.
Action - Oh my.... all combat scenes are so poorly choreografed that you can actually see the opponent is literally waiting for Harley to make her punch, in order to make her win the fight. This applies to every combat scene.I give this two starts because 1) minimum is 1 star and 2) the scene in the police hall early on in the movie was good and in the spirit of Harley.Also, it is unclear to me why this movie was prioritized from DCEU. I understand other commitments from actors can affect a schedule - but why this movie?
My only assumption is the boost Suicide Squad gave the DC universe in terms of marketing and merchandise, since everyone - and I mean everyone - cosplayed Harley.Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll go poke my eyes out hoping I'll never see something as horrible as this.",Birds of Prey

2385,jmlenard,"We have a while to go, but this is an extremely entertaining step in the right direction",8,20 September 2020,"After watching the movie and reviewing the reviews, I would argue that the average is a bit too low in my eyes.
I think to properly review the movie, you must take into consideration your own personal biases as well as make yourself knowledgeable on the facts of the film. It's pretty obvious: this is a movie created by women for women, and I fall into that target category. I am also a lover of Harley Quinn.
To me, this movie lived up to what I though it would. I think it's a pretty good Harley Quinn movie, and definitely surpasses some of her past iterations. Something that stuck out to me especially was the approach to costumes in the movie. Harley Quinn is eccentric, and they really ran with it. Some of the reviewers complained about them looking like a crazed fashion designer was let loose, but I think that's the point? Especially compared to Margot Robbie's costumes in Suicide Squad, these are absolutely miles better. Also, pertaining to Suicide Squad, the depiction of how women actually look and act in relation to their clothes and makeup in this movie I thought was spectacular. Ponytails aren't in perfectly coiled tresses automatically. It just seems so Hollywood when it's like that. Harley Quinn seems more like a real person who behaves like a person in this. (Of course she's still absolutely unhinged; she wouldn't be Harley without it!)
Another thing I noticed was people complaining about hyper-feminism and the theme being ""men are bad."" I think that the latter is completely false. To me, the them was more along the lines of, ""You are your own person. You don't need to rely on someone to hold you up, and you shouldn't."" In this movie, yes, it was referring to the male presences in Harley Quinn's life (and all the characters' lives), but that's because so many women can relate to that. We've been told it should be like that for thousands of years, ever since we acquired goods to defend c. 12,000 years ago. This is where I think personal bias comes in. Being raised male or female has a serious impact on both how you're treated and how you perceive the world.
This is not to say the movie had faults. While it was still enjoyable, it did seem to be a slightly worse homage to Deadpool's style of narrating. Personally, though, I still enjoyed it, but I understand where people are coming from. Also, the middle was a little lacking, and some of the dialogue was a bit.... eh. it didn't distract me too much, and I'm a playwright, but, again, that's just my experience.
Lastly, I would like to commend the ending. I think it was very Harley Quinn, and I was rather overjoyed to both see a funhouse set (props to the actors and stunt-people for working there; as an amateur fight choreographer, I can tell how much work went into that scene) and Harley on rollerskates. Rollerskating and roller derby especially are a big thing for women, so it's really cool to see it on the ""big screen."" (Also, it's very Harley and I'm glad they incorporated it!)
To conclude, if you are a woman, I think you'll likely enjoy this movie. It's funny and entertaining. It's a fun watch. I can't say ""if you're a man, the opposite will be true,"" because I am not a man, so how would I know?

But I'm afraid to say, I couldn't even finish this one. Compared to the Suicide Squad, this was just one big cringe-fest.
Everything about it was so poor, from the lame attempt to jump forward and backwards in the timeline. The dreadfully linked together events and even for this genre, walking into a Police Station out of nowhere with a tinsel gun and making grown Policemen run for their lives.

2390,rnicholls94,A Fun and Enjoyable Ride,8,29 February 2020,"Birds of Prey isn't a movie that is going to impress everyone, but guess what? I don't care. This movie was fun from start to finish and it was clear the cast had an absolute blast during filming. It's jam packed with colour, whether it be the costumes, set pieces or effects. This helps it stand apart from the rest of the DCU which normally employs a more dreary colour pallet. The costumes in themselves deserve more praise because they were so well done. Everyone looked comfortable and relaxed with their wardrobe (especially Margot) which was nice to see after the blatant hyper  of Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad. I can't tell you this right now, nobody feels comfortable in shorts that ride that far up.The action scenes are engaging, well choreographed and easy to follow. The film is backed by an amazing soundtrack that meshes well with the screenplay and re-introduces some old favourites.This film is great because it doesn't take its self too seriously, it definitely has its tongue in cheek moments. It's an enjoyable little romp that employs intelligent humour, a vibrant colour patent and an overall sense of fun.If you don't like it? That's fair enough, to each their own. I'm not going to try and convince you otherwise.But if your looking for a movie that's easy to follow, has a well put together cast and an amusing premise? Give Birds of Prey a shot.",Birds of Prey

The incels on here are also calling it a chick flick, because there's a woman in it I guess. The thing is, most people on IMDB just really hate main female characters, so I would take these reviews with a pinch of salt.At the end of the day, it's a good and entertaining movie. Is it perfect?

Kurnee Smollett-Bell gave a believable performance and became a likeable character for me. Ewan McGregor was a little over the top, as would be expected for a DC villain. There were some humorous moments, mainly slapstick with a small amount of witty banter.
Character development seemed like an afterthought. The story arc was confusing. Rosie Perez's character was extremely clichéd, but this almost seemed like a tongue in cheek, self aware gag.

Aside from a couple of decent jokes and instances, it really wasnt that funny. In my theater, there was some basement dweller 30+ year old burst out laughing hysterically just because Huntress said ""Do you know who I am?"" as if she was trying to appear serious or something. None of their characters have their comic book looks through-out the movie, and Black Mask, and Victor Zsasz are really not that intimidating.Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman were honestly better. Dunno about Justice League though, we'd best not talk about that one.The soundtrack songs were good but there was too many of them and it felt like they were just crammed in there.Aside from all the negative, the choreography was really good.

I loved the two characters together so much in Suicide Squad & wanted to at the very least see him be horrible to her so you could really grasp the feelings of dislike towards Mista J.They were clearly going for female empowerment / heavy anti-man theme by showing that EVERY SINGLE MAN in Harley's life leaves or betrays her. That's not really the type of message I agree with.I also felt the poor, pitiful, drunk, terrible dancing imaging they used to set the scene was god awful to watch. It was a pathetic woman in the worst (most basic) way.

They entire film summarized ""men are perverts and women are all powerful"". Don't take this as women are worse than men or they don't deserve equality or respect or something like that at all I believe they deserve all of those things, but this movie literally has no redeeming men at all, every guy is a perv and makes you want to punch them in the face, it drops the movie down because no one enjoys so many scenes that make you grossed and pissed at every dude in the movie. There are so so many underlying messages and lines about feminism and whatnot, which is not bad in real life OK, but dang it I just want a good dc movie about comics and super hero's.

Not only that but if you've been watching Harley Quinn's new animated show it was like a live action version of this. Stylish, funny, quirky, witty and of course crazy. Originally when the teaser came out for Birds Of Prey I wasn't as obsessed with Harley Quinn or comics as I used to be and I didn't care as much. Let's just say with each new trailer i slowly got back into Harley and comics and I was very excited for this movie. However through marketing I felt like it's the perfect movie for Harley Quinn stans but disappointing for Birds Of Prey stans. This is because the movie only has 2 actual members of Birds Of Prey members. Harley was never related to Birds Of Prey yet is the main character of this movie. I thought it would be the perfect movie for me as a Harley stan but the bop stan in me had mixed feelings. Seeing the movie now i don't really care about this now and I think they work well together and I think all aspects are perfectly well done as well as the Birds. A lot of people say they wish Huntress had more screen time and I think I can agree with this I just didn't really notice. This movie is very stylistic and fun, with the editing, pop up text, camera work, soundtrack, everything is just so amazing. The action is always so fun in every scene. Margot really embodied Harley in this movie to the max and it made me so happy to see her truly shine! I also have to say I loved Black Mask and Victor Zsasz being the main villains as they are lesser known which I always enjoy more than popular characters. This is a new campy funny take on Black Mask while still being dark and twisted and Ewan McGregor may be the DCEU's best villain. I really hope the movie does well so we can get Gotham City Sirens next. Not only is this my fave DC movie but will become one of my fave movies ever and I'm already eager to rewatch it. I might even go see it in cinema again! Which I never do! I would honestly rate it 10/10 because I found ZERO flaws in the movie genuinely.

2458,ivesy-24633,Misguided,5,11 February 2020,"Having enjoyed Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad I was looking forward to seeing Birds of Prey. I am also a comic book/super hero fan so I was interested to see how they would portray the Birds of Prey.
Whilst Margot Robbie was entertaining I think her character missed out on having some male counterparts to bounce off during the movie. She just became irritating after a while and you wanted more from Huntress and Black Canary.
The character development was poor due to the plot and direction of the story. To suggest that these super heroes were joining together to save the girl was completely misleading.
I live in Australia which is in the middle of a PC frenzy and left wing attitudes rule the airwaves and social media. This film is hailed as an achievement as it has female everything from production to cast. As a person who loves movies from Rom Coms to War I don't care whether the movie is all female, male or somewhere in between. I just want a great story that entertains. Unfortunately this movie didn't quite get there.",Birds of Prey

It doesn't take itself too seriously, it's fun, bubblegum and violent and was clearly made by people who love the source material.Super movies try too hard to be gritty and realistic nowadays but the tone, humour and the way Gotham was portrayed makes the universe feel more three dimensional than most batman adaptations. I always asked myself why people continued to live in Gotham with all the crime and villainy happening but this actually seemed like a real place and showed that just because it's crime ridden doesn't mean everything has to be grey and depressing all the time.Perfect casting. Especially Robbie, who you can feel absolutely adores Quinn. McGregor is unexpected and funny and I enjoyed the parallels of his character and
Messina's Zsasz to the Joker and Harley.Clothing and set design were so fashionable and non... Halloween costume feeling. They felt true to Harley whilst being modern and fun.I genuinely do not understand the bad reviews for this",Birds of Prey

SS was an enormous mess even its star power, but that's a whole other review to be made about its script, its pacing, its tone, its editing, everything. Birds of Prey in contrast was vibrant and refreshing, with a lot of momentum despite a less star-studded cast. One of the most solid DC movies in recent years. With less of a gimmicky feel in its self awareness, BoP didn't take itself too seriously the way SS did (which ended up stifling a lot of its characters' potential), so it felt miles more authentic. It's hard to make anything truly novel and un-cliche in this current era of reboots and sequels, but BoP kept me engaged and wishing for more beyond the end credits. Unfortunate that it didn't get the marketing it deserved and instead was brought down by anti-feminists afraid of more than one or two women in a superhero movie. Even more unfortunate that there's rumors about replacing the side characters and little possibility of a sequel because of the marketing ""flop."" It's a good movie, well worth the watch, and pretty unfairly evaluated as a ploy or pushing an agenda when it's just women characters written and directed by women. Nothing controversial about actually developed female characters. 🤷🏻",Birds of Prey

They could have used that to have Harley maybe get a boy toy to play with, more over the top extreme fighting. Was it Deadpool? HELL NO! Was it a snooze fest with no action? NO! The sandwich scene was funny. Harley was a LOL riot and insane. I don't think half of you people saw this film saying its a 1 star rating. Was it a 10 star?

The archetypal girlfriends and secretaries - in this case cops and short order cooks, and a couple of over the top bad guys who may or may not be a couple.It is sad that so many male viewers and critics are so totally unselfaware that they don't seem to understand why they don't like the movie. They do not see themselves, or the selves they wish they were, represented anywhere. Well, suck it up, boys, and get used to it.

Harley quinn herself is well adapted, same happens with black canary (What really surprised me), but all the other characters seem wrong. Why?, well Cassandra cain is a the big answer to that, they made a dark and mute assasin become a random problematic kid that ends up loving harley. Black mask is just a random villain that cant decide if he is just a gay mad villain or a mafia boss, because it seems that he cant be both at the same time. Zsas is just a minion and has 0 development, he is there just to fill a space. Finally Huntress, god i hated how they made Huntress, i love the actress but im sure this character wasnt for her and at the same time the script sucks, all the things huntress says in the movie are completly irrelevant and even her story feels kind of weak.Now, when talking about the movie itself, begining with the script, it is really basic, the story has been seen 1000 times and thats not the problem, the problem is that it brings nothing new to a story like that, i dont really understand how someone saw this and said YEAH LETS MAKE THIS.
At the same time, the style is never clear, as probably most of the things in the movie, it never defines if it wants to be acomedy like deadpool or a serious story, or a parody, or if it wants to be suicide squad 2 (By literally copying the visuals of it)Finally i have to say that something i find really anoying was how al the time the characters took every chance they have to say how independent and powerful they were, like, go watch a ghibli movie and learn a little about how to make and inspiring independent female character because harley quinn saying im independent and strong every 10 minutes feels ridiculous",Birds of Prey

It's exaggerated and violent (like every good action picture) but with incredible use of color and style and spot-on incorporation of tunes. The stunts are fantastic and done really well. Margot Robbie continues to improve her star power by amping up the wattage here; Ewan McGregor has a boat-load of fun with his Black Mask character; and the rest of the posse of girls has just enough to do to keep them in the picture, although I don't think they were as fleshed-out as they could have been. I loved this picture as did the vast majority of the audience in the theatre when I saw it. I don't think the marketing did the movie justice, unfortunately, and the title is ridiculously long when it doesn't need to be.

I don't understand why people are complaining (understandable from the comic fans) about it being ""man-hating"". This movie has the typical beat down of men that you would see in any action movie, the only difference is that there were awesome fight scenes involving ladies (especially when it was lady against lady!) and that for once, a team of all women won collectively against the evil henchmen through a silly but heartwarming alliance. Yay! If you don't like the ""political agenda"" of this movie, there are plenty of Seth Rogen movies to remind you of how awesome your manhood is. As for the arc and overall plot, it is definitely not the best and it's not trying to be. If you want a cinematic masterpiece, go watch Parasite. This is a movie for good laughs and a big F U to typical helpless bimbo eye candy tropes that female characters are subjected to.

Being absolutely honest, I was getting tired of watching superhero movies which are showy, cliche with nonsensical plotlines (looking at you, ""Endgame"").""Birds of Prey"" is not a revolutionary movie because it's something new in terms of visual effects nor the plot; I'd even say that the latter it is quite simple. It's revolutionary because it's fun and fresh and portrays characters in a natural, relatable way. It was a pleasure to watch the anti-heroes team up and actually help each other.Additionally, I'd like to thank the director for not making it a comic book movie ""for men""; female characters weren't oversexualized, even the scenes which in any other movie would be made as ""sexy"" or ""seductive"" ones were just... normal. I loved it.In my opinion, ""Birds of Prey"" proves that the comeback of DC is actually happening right now. Crossing my fingers for Cathy Yan and Christina Hodson to create more movies like this one.",Birds of Prey

2513,hunain-55255,Margot Robbie shines as Harley Quinn but the movie doesn't.,6,15 April 2020,Margot Robbie has owned the role of Harley Quinn and she outperforms the entire cast.

2524,matthewsoall-92672,Aggressively Ok👍,6,14 February 2020,"Like some of my fellow reviewers have had to state I also have ACTUALLY seen the film. This movie is a solid watch. It won't blow your mind. It dosent remake the genre it's just standard superhero fair like Thor Ragnarok or Shazam. What the film does well is it's fight choreography and actors.Margo Robbie blows it out of the park as Harley Quinn and I can definitely see Jurnee Smollett-Bell in a stand alone Black Canary/Green Arrow film. Ewan McGregor plays a standout villain with a delightfully devilish persona.Another item worth mentioning is the biased right wing reviwers pushing the narative that this film is all ""girl power ra ra ra.""The poltical stance, if you could even call it that, is a small presence in the film. It's subtle like Black Canary needing a hair tie while shes fighting baddies. If you can't handle that then, your not really going to be able to handle any film with a woman in it. From a critical standpoint the film needed a tighter script to for it to go from enjoyable to memorable. All they really needed was Harley, Huntress and Black Canary. Ditch Renee Montoya or at least retool her to a rookie cop out to make it as a detective. Rosie Perez is a fine actor but shes feels very out of place next to a group of badasses like those mentioned above. Cassandra Cain is also a pointless addition to the film. Kids are hard work for me in films, especially the way Cain is written. She has a very interesting back story in the comics. One that is far superior to this adaptation. In closing I'd recomend the movie. It won't blow your mind but its also not a bad way to spend an afternoon.",Birds of Prey

2530,russeldonahue,Bird of Prey...A Harley Quinn Film,7,24 February 2020,"Margot Robbie IS Harley Quinn as Robert Downey Jr. is Iron Man. Her portrayal of a psychotic, unhinged ""Bird of prey"" is none other than fantastic! One issue though, is that this film feels more like a Harley Quinn movie rather than what it is assumed to be, a movie about ""Birds of Prey"". The concept of having it be a Harley Quinn movie isn't the problem but the ""team-up"" doesn't happen until the end, which begs the question throughout this film, who are these women? And do we care? Yes, each one of them has a bit of an intro but not enough to care about them. Ewan McGregor as Black Mask is a bit excessive. We understand he is a THE bad guy and that these less bad people have to stop him from getting the diamond...but that's about it. The characterization of this supporting cast is overshadowed by the lackluster plot. It isn't anything special, someone steals a diamond and (more) bad guy wants it back. This concept is quite overused and being a plot-driven film can lead to a boring outcome. A fix for this though, is if the cast of heroes aren't actually heroes and we are siding with criminals, then they have to be developed enough so we care more about their outcome as well. That being said, the action sequences are top-notch as the use of wide shots during these sequences allows the audience to see everything going on. The impressive stunt work and choreography also set the tone in the action scenes for a wonderful performance. The cinematography is beautiful as well as the color palette is used to make this a visually stunning film (especially in the police station scene). 7/10",Birds of Prey
2531,reesehaugh,Doesn't live up to her hype!!,1,9 April 2020,"Harley Quinn was so amazing and bad ass in suicide squad that we all expected her to be the same way in this movie, she was not and it was very disappointing.

Action packed, funny, violent, and the soundtrack is bad. Yes it stars women, was directed and written by women, yes black mask is a different interpretation and all that is fine. Only thing I would like is if Huntress was more fleshed out as a character and the broken up timeline in the beginning was a little gimmicky for my taste.

2535,timhottois,Made me angry,1,15 May 2020,"This is my first review. Normally what other people think of a movie is irrelevant to me, and I expect more often than not the reverse is true. Movies are a subjective form of entertainment. Not this movie. It is bad. The plot is lazy. The fight choreography is amateurish. It seems like they shot the rehearsal footage and called it a day. The jokes were middle school level, but in an R-rated movie, and why R-rated? So they could curse. Unnecessary. I didn't expect much from this girl powe extravaganza, but wow was it bad. This is the first movie I can remember watching that made me angrier and angrier as I watched it. It's like Deadpool if your only experience with Deadpool was having it described to you by your 12 year old nephew, and with a girl as the lead. Nothing against women action heroes, but damn this was bad. Not one character that wasn't super annoying. How does a company make Suicide Squad, and then learn nothing and throw a 100+ million dollars at this. I could have watched a Nicolas Cage VOD movie and found more entertainment. By the way, normally I am sympathetic to filmmakers based on budget and resources, bu Warner Brothers has the money and ability to hire top notch talent and this is what they did instead.",Birds of Prey

The only thing that let's the film down in my view is Ewan McGregor, but I'm not a fan anyway.
I like the fact that this film pushes a few boundaries and is not afraid to do something different. It's also great to see a film that does not revolve around men. I'm a man and I'm bored of it. I really hope that there is another film and that the producers continue to be brave.",Birds of Prey

I loved the characters but I do feel like black canary was the least fleshed out and could have used some more development. Ewan Mcgegor is amazing as always and Margot brings tons of energy.

2541,joshuakoonts,Skip it,1,16 February 2020,"Too much exposition. The film was constantly telling a story of why they were doing something instead of just doing the thing. Seemed rushed and the characters were never really fleshed out. The action scenes were a little too silly, bad guys with guns running right up to the heros before discharging their weapons only to be thwarted in the last second by a melee counter measure.

Sure, it may not be a film that appeases a mans idea of a superhero/anti-hero/villain movie, but what this film has is a subtlety that all other female DC films lack. It's about women and female empowerment without forcing it down your throat. It doesn't mansplain feminism. It's cool and entertaining just because. The action scenes are amazing. It's humorous, and bloody and coming back to what DC are good at. Long gone are the days of them trying to balance PG family friendliness with grit (aka suicide squad and the entire batman v superman franchise). This film is straight up great-time gold. If you don't take it so seriously with so much emphasis on it being true to scripture then it will not disappoint. Let's all chill out a bit hey?",Birds of Prey

2553,maddireddy,Spectacular and amazing as the characters are.,10,7 February 2020,"I liked the movie because it was creative, the story was told in different ways. We start we comics. Harley acts as the narrator and tells us the story, sometimes going back. There are a few funny dialogs and scenes. We see a development of character as Harley is single now and must learn to be on her own. The Birds of Prey, Harley and Cass are a strong, diverse group of women. There is a lot of diversity in the whole movie. The fact that it was written and directed by women also made me curious. Margot Robbie as Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn is especially incredible if you consider that she's Australian playing a crazy psychiatrist with a thick American accent. Ewan McGregor was convincing as a bad guy, especially in one scene. Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress, Jurnee Smollett-Bell as Black Canary, Rosie Perez as Montoya, Chris Messina as Zsasz, Ella Jay Basco as Cass were also good. The music helped frame the shots as well. Go check out the movie yourself.",Birds of Prey

It's a DC movie and as most newer dc movies it has a excellent soundtrack every song being catchy and every song fits with the tone of the movie. The movie dosn't take itself to serously witch is good because it's a comic book movie and shouldn't take itself to seriously.

2565,averagelucio,"Disappointing - not from messaging, but from a filmmaking standpoint",4,15 February 2020,"Let's make one thing clear - this movie is not some ""man-hating"", ""woke"", misandrist film. Anyone pretending it is either hasn't seen the movie or completely misinterpreted its messages. The fact that people are giving this thing 1 star based on its apparent ""SJW politics"" is laughable. This is a superhero movie with female protagonists who kill people - sometimes men - because those people, shocker, also happen to be trying to kill them. Apparently that's enough to be ""man-hating"" these days. We have Deadpool, Joker, etc; god forbid the girls also get an antihero character.That being said, I wished I enjoyed this movie more than I did. Despite its fair share of legitimately fun and brutal action scenes, I found myself bored for most of the runtime of Birds of Prey. This mostly stems from the movie's script, and consequently its pacing, specifically the choice to tell the story out of order. Whenever the movie feels like it's getting good, Harley Quinn resumes her narration, bringing us back in the movie's timeline to explain something that hasn't been explained yet and wouldn't have made sense otherwise. This means that certain plot threads get left hanging for upwards of 20 minutes at a time, all the while we're treated to the backstory of yet another new character with whom we have no prior attachment to.The overarching plot, villain, and Macguffin also leave a lot to be desired. Even Suicide Squad, despite being ultimately a worse movie, had a more engaging central conflict than this movie. The writers behind this film had the stories of the whole DC comics universe at their disposal, and they ended up settling on a simple crime story about a goose chase for a diamond that some crime lord wants.The acting is a mixed bag as well. Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor do their best with what the script requires, but everyone else seems to be running on low energy, which is exactly what you don't want for a film that presents itself under an aesthetic of whimsy and hyperactivity.Overall, if you're interested in seeing Birds of Prey, by all means, go ahead. Don't let the prevailing online depiction of this movie as ""feminist propaganda"" - whatever that means - sway your decision. Maybe you'll have a great time with it - there certainly are fun moments. I just wish that energy had carried throughout the rest of the film.",Birds of Prey

No. But it's still a fun, crazy romp with some awesome performances.",8,18 May 2020,"First of all, Margot Robbie still proves that she was the perfect choice for Harley Quinn. Badass and hysterical, but with moments of genuine heart. Jurnee Smolett-Bell was an unexpected surprise. I love the TV show Black Canary so I was skeptical, but she was fantastic. One complaint I do have is that the movie felt like it was moving a little too fast at times. Another 30 minutes for character development and a few action scenes would have really improved things. And good lord, Ewan McGregor is just a treat. He hams it up in every scene and it's pretty clear he's having an absolute blast. He's intimidating and unpredictable but he never feels like he's trying to fit another villain's shoes.
Lastly, I think anyone who thinks this is a ""man-hating"" movie needs to seriously check their privilege. Women are the focus of the movie. That's the point. When was the last time you called a movie ""woman-hating"" because it had some mean female characters but cool and badass men? Maybe examine the double standard before you try criticizing, and just enjoy the movie!",Birds of Prey
2579,bangel144,Best of 2020 so far,10,5 March 2020,"Objectively speaking it's more like a 9, but damn it I'm gonna give this is a 10. The visuals, the cast assembled, the messiness. The most fun I've had in a theater in a long time. BRAVO!!",Birds of Prey
2580,matt-00285,Great fun to watch,9,14 February 2020,"I heard very mixed reviews about this film. My crush for harley quinn overrode my Co cerns and boy am I glad. What a great movie. Dark, funny great action scenes and well directed. Go. See this movie",Birds of Prey
2581,pukypower,"Harleen, Canary and the crap",3,26 February 2020,"If they make a feminist movie atleast use great actors. Only the Harleen and Canary roles where played well... the makers should have remade every shot with that Hunteress.... SO BAD.Conclusion bad acting, bad script, bad political agenda comic unworth movie. Where her puddings movie was like epicly good this was epicly bad.",Birds of Prey
2582,guangyan-86036,Full of Women Power and Entertainment!!,10,8 February 2020,"This is NOT another Suicide Squad!
Exciting action scenes, awesome musics, hilarious lines and interactions between those ladies.
STOP giving 1 or 2 without even watching it or just because its cast is mainly female!!!",Birds of Prey
2583,vitoraugsoares,Accomplishes anything,2,7 February 2020,"So the plot is very lazy and preditcble, but that's something we can forget if we just want to see a 2 hour action film, it should at least be entertaining, but this film is just boring, since it's started de second half all i wish it ended soon. Don't bother about this people that only because a film shows women empowering it's instatly bad, it has nothing to do with that. This film is just bad because is just lazy teen entertainment.",Birds of Prey
2584,imhanseron,A Sleeper Hit!,10,6 February 2020,"Given the early predictions, many have been questioning whether this movie will live up to its expectations or not. Many have also said that in their reviews and comments, the trailer is bad, and that the clips of the movie shown are also bad.The Birds of Prey follows Harley Quinn's journey after a recent breakup with the Joker along with Renee Montoya, The Huntress, Black Canary, and Cassandra Cain. Harley finds herself a target by everyone that She and the Joker targeted whether its just for fun, unintentional and intentional.Roman Sionis or Black Mask is known to be one of the top mercenary in Gotham, and also the one who hate Harley the most, after a series of events that Harley and Joker had done to him. But given that Harley was still under the protection of the Joker, no one else dared to mess with her. But after the breakup Harley finds herself on the top of Ronan's kill list.I'll give you guys the points of the film which I like..The Soundtrack, every single track on this film made me gag, it complements the film's action scenes like Halsey's ""Experiment on Me.""And speaking of the Action Scenes, you may think that they look sloppy and less energetic because of the comments and reviews, but once you watch the film its definitely has something else in its reportoire. As for the R-Rated category, yes its somewhat gory (like the torture scene) andThe Creativity and Aesthetic, instead of simply using a gun shot blast they thought of a creative way, with glitters and paints. I personally love the scene where Harley fights the Prisoners inside the cell with the sprinklers set off.The Humor, Not only can this film serve looks and action, but it can also serve you the humor.Bad reviews or not, I stand by my own opinion, and for me its definitely WORTH THE MONEY.",Birds of Prey
2585,thomas1989,Just Go See It,9,1 March 2020,"I personally loved the movie. I don't think it was perfect, but it was unlike any other ""super-hero"" action movie I have seen before. It's hard to read all of the 1/10 star comments complaining about a ""man-hating"" and ""too-feminist"" movie. I even read a comment calling it a ""chick flick"". Did we watch different movies? Do you call this feminist propaganda because it had female leads? Are you too easily offended to enjoy any movie outside of a male lead? (Sorry you had to look at a beautiful woman for 106 minutes.)The movie was messy, yes. Harley Quinn is messy. It is not often you come across an unspoken, respectable ""girl gang"" in action movies (not like the God awful and trite scene in Infinity War).So, my conclusion: it was a good movie. Funny, entertaining, and great fight scenes and effects. It genuinely surprised me, too - choosing to watch this movie was by chance and I had seen every other movie at the theater at the time. It is not perfect, but it addresses a different crowd in a non-condescending and purely enjoyable way. If you can't enjoy this movie because you think they ""made Margot Robbie ugly"" or because its main group of protagonists are women and ""too diverse""... You might want to do some reflection on how sensitive you are.(PS: How could you call Margot ugly... Again, did we watch the same movie?)",Birds of Prey
2586,jeroakley,Ohhhhkkkkkkay,1,30 May 2020,"I'm going to have try to sit through a second viewing given that I fell asleep during the first, BORING, HORRIBLE and just plain STUPID but I have to at try to push through the whole waste of film, call me a glutton for punishment.",Birds of Prey
2587,adamfeltoon,Looks great ! Watch w/ the volume off,2,30 August 2020,The dialogue and plot/story aren't even worth paying attention to. This movie would be best enjoyed playing in the background with the volume off. and w/ music. Trust me.,Birds of Prey
2588,anfion,A lame wanna be Tarantino,1,24 March 2020,"Horrible movie, director tried to copy all Tarantino ideas without any success.",Birds of Prey
2589,brajosue,Just Boring,4,21 April 2020,"It's not bad, but it's just really really boring. I just saw it and I can barely remember what happened.
Takes too many time introducing the characters and the problems, just to have a fight scene 20 minutes before the movie ends, kill the bad guy in a dumb way (Not that they could do anything better in a super hero movie without super powers) and them just say that they found the money and that she sold the diamond in like the last 2 minutes of the movie.
The jokes where mostly bad, only a couple that were funny, but most of them are lame jokes or just Harley being annoying as hell.
So it's just that, better that Suicide Squad, but overall just another lame DC movie.",Birds of Prey
2590,aaronbamford-39224,Awesome movie,10,29 March 2020,"If you're a boy with small balls and a fragile ego then this ain't for you if you love violence, comedy and an amazing cinematic movie that stays true to its origins this is for you! #DC #ALLTHEWAY",Birds of Prey
2591,johnson-42268,Birds of prey is average at best!,3,10 February 2020,"The movie was unforgettable, thought it would get better it just got stale. The script is terrible, every aspect of the movie failed to deliver. If it was not for Margot Robbie doing a good job playing Harley Quinn. I would of walked out of the theater. Don't believe the hype skip this one!",Birds of Prey
