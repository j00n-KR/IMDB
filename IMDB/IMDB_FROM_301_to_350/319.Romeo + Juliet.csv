0,TheLittleSongbird,"Visually stunning, but this could have been better",5,14 April 2010,"Now I like Baz Luhrmann, I loved Moulin Rouge! and Australia was a much better film than people give credit for. However, I was disappointed with this version of Romeo and Juliet. I really liked the 1968 film with Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey though that did have one or two problems.Starting with the redeeming qualities, the film does look amazing. The cinematography is beautiful and the scenery is gorgeous. I also liked how the Capulet party was staged, all grand and lavish and Claire Danes's white swan dress was stunning. Harold Perrineau was perfect as Mercutio yes the singing wasn't great but it was for comedy, and Pete Postlethwaite was a noble and sympathetic Friar Lawrence. Miriam Margoyles is a fine actress and brought a real sense of maternal instinct to the role of Juliet's nurse. Regarding the character though, she could have been developed more, seeing as she was the main source of motherly affection in the play I would have liked to have seen that come across more. Also I would have liked to have seen more of Paris, a smaller role but a significant one. And Leonardo Di Caprio does have a boyish charm that compensates for any thoughts of whether he was too young. I liked how fast it moved too, it was almost exhilarating in pace, and I think the film makers did that purposefully to empathise how rushed Romeo and Juliet's relationship was. Plus the ending is very tragic as it should be.However, there are other aspects that didn't quite work. I have no problem with a film that is updated, it worked in West Side Story, it worked in Carmen Jones, but it does feel jarring when the script is not modernised, with a poetic and archaic sounding script mixed by exhilarating non-stop action merging on screen it doesn't quite work. Plus when Benvolio says ""Put up your swords"" I personally felt ""put down your guns""(as they were guns not swords here) would have been better. Baz Luhrmann's direction was also a disappointment, sometimes in the early scenes it was so over the top that I forgot I was watching a version of Romeo and Juliet and thought I was watching a flash cartoon. (I love animation don't get me wrong but that feel to this film doesn't bode well with me). The soundtrack I had mixed feelings about. I liked the music at the beginning and in the balcony scene, I liked the use of Mozart's Symphony Number 25 and I liked the use of Liebestod from Wagner's Tristan and Isolde sung brilliantly by Leontyne Price, however some of the more contemporary songs felt somewhat intrusive. Claire Danes looked gorgeous, but her acting was rather unconvincing in places, her crying for instance felt very melodramatic and (please don't take this the wrong way) reminded me of a spoilt rich girl who cried when she didn't get her way. Finally, I have nothing personal against John Leguizamo though I am not fond of him either, but I thought he badly overdid the character of Tybalt, too much of the tough guy attitude and not enough of the grace and coolness of the Tybalt of the play and the 1968 version.Overall, watchable but disappointing. It could be worse though, you could be watching that animated film with seals taking the roles of the Shakespearean characters, that did a much worse job at respecting(more like disrespecting) the material. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Romeo + Juliet
1,SnoopyStyle,overwhelming Baz Luhrmann style,6,26 December 2014,Baz Luhrmann injects his brash style into Shakespeare's famous play. It's the modern world in a place called Verona. The two families of Capulets and Montagues are powerful corporate giants with gun totting thugs. Claire Danes plays Juliet Capulet and Leonardo DiCaprio plays Romeo Montague. There is no doubt that this is one of the more unique interpretations. Luhrmann throws every visual flashiness at the audience. He's pumped up the material with so many bells and whistles that the story feels overwhelmed. The music choice sometimes grades on my nerves. The leads are an adorable pairing. I wish Luhrmann has some more faith in the actors to allow them some peace and quiet to do their work. They do good work in the balconey scene but Luhrmann can't stop moving. The flash and glitz becomes more of a distraction.,Romeo + Juliet
2,classicsoncall,"""These times of woe afford no time to woo.""",8,12 July 2018,"The passage of time has not been kind to this film as far as IMDb's rating system goes. But can you picture the love struck couples who went to see this in the theater when it was originally released? I can just imagine the weeping that occurred at the end of the story, teenage girls clutching their boyfriends' arms in shocked and swollen grief. Ah yes, the saga of Romeo and Juliet.I actually had a pretty good time with this flick and I'm not really a Shakespeare buff. The modern day updating has a weird sensibility to it, pitting two warring families against each other - the Montagues and the Capulets. The only thing is, it's never really mentioned what started the feud off in the first place. It seemed kind of senseless, and appeared to be almost ethnic in nature, something I don't think will ever be overcome by people who see others as different from themselves. Shakespearean dialog in the hands of these hip-hop oriented thespians sounds oddly anachronistic, but serves well, especially during the comedic moments. I got the biggest kick out of the Montagues 'biting their thumbs' at the Capulets. I don't know if that was in the original play but I thought that scene was hilarious. Leonardo DiCaprio is far from a favorite of mine but he did a decent job here as Romeo, as did Claire Danes as Juliet. I'm pretty sure Shakespeare would not have envisioned Romeo in a shootout with the cops near the story's finale, nor would he have envisioned much of what else goes on in this latter day tale set in Verona Beach, with players attired in Hawaiian shirts and gang-banger threads coming at each other. But the essence of Romeo and Juliet is there, and if you've been predisposed to ignore the famous bard, a picture like this might just have you picking up a copy of Shakespeare.",Romeo + Juliet
3,gavin6942,Baz Luhrmann is the Master of Interpretation,9,22 October 2006,"Prior to watching ""Romeo and Juliet"", I had seen ""Moulin Rouge"" a few times and loved it. Luhrmann took an opera by Puccini (""La Boheme"") and made a great tale of it, with music and visuals that will blow your mind. (""Rent"" is also based on ""La Boheme"", but is trite and caters to an audience I am not a part of.) My expectations for ""Romeo and Juliet"" were fairly high, given my admiration of Luhrmann.As you can guess by my 9 out of 10 rating, I was not disappointed. Luhrmann took the classic Shakespeare and super-imposed it over modern day Verona Beach. Like ""Moulin Rouge"" where he took modern rock songs and placed them in 1900 France, here he takes the language of Shakespeare and places it in the contemporary. Rather than simply changing the dialog to modern usage, he gave the text its due.This works incredibly well, and makes the film so much better than regular language would. The story seems richer, more epic and most importantly timeless. And the story is the story of love, which is just that: rich, epic and timeless.And the visuals were stunning! The colors set a mood (such as the darkness after Mercutio's death) and there was such vibrancy in the clothing. The water theme resonated well, with great effects of seeing a lover for the first time through a fish tank, the rain falling at key moments, and the film focusing on both a beach and near a swimming pool.Luhrmann knows how to direct John Leguizamo, and I would say this is one of his two best roles (the other being ""Moulin Rouge""). Harold Perrineau (Mercutio) shows great range, much more so than in other roles he's had since (""The Matrix"" or TV's ""Lost""). And this is probably the most un-funny Jamie Kennedy you'll ever see, which I mean in the most positive way.Claire Danes is a delightful Juliet, giving a memorable performance (easily the peak of her career). She is physically perfect for the role, young and beautiful without being overly vulnerable or sexed-up. The only other actress I can picture capable of this kind of role is Julia Stiles, but I can't see her being as much of a fit and she would likely over-act... her Shakespeare style and Luhrmann's are not in synchronicity.The role of Romeo, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, was perfect. Nobody could have been better. This isn't the young Leo from before or the rough and rugged Leo that appears in films later on. This is the Leo on the verge of adulthood, but still remaining tender enough to have the youthful idealism of a Romeo. As my co-viewer phrased it, he's a ""babe"" (in more ways than she meant). I know of no other actor who has the acting abilities of Leo, at least not in his age range. He has a long career ahead of him if he can keep up the intensity he has here (as well as in ""The Departed"" and ""Gangs of New York""... though not as much in ""The Beach"").A slight note on the music: As much as I love the Cardigans, I almost think ""Lovefool"" was a poor choice for this film... too poppy. But everything else was great: Butthole Surfers, Everclear, and especially One Inch Punch with the inspired ""Pretty Piece of Flesh"". And Garbage, a vastly under-appreciated band, with one of their better tunes, ""#1 Crush"". A great album for a great film.If you haven't seen this film, your life is not complete. I went eleven years avoiding Romeo and Juliet, but having now broken my vow, I am glad I did. This film doesn't just impress, it inspires.",Romeo + Juliet
4,lee_eisenberg,So what IS in a name?,7,16 May 2006,"Hark! But what film from yonder director breaks? Starring the young man who hath since played Howard Hughes It is east, and Juliet is Claire Danes Wherefore art thou, modern language? (no offense to purists, but Shakespearean talk in the modern world is starting to get old, so I'll cease it).""Romeo + Juliet"" is overall acceptable, and I really liked the first run-in between the Montagues and Capulets. I think that it would be sort of neat to see a space-age version of this story. On second thought, Shakespearean talk and the Jetsons' world wouldn't really mix. But the point is that they did a pretty good job here. It's sort of irking to think that this probably paved the way for Leonardo DiCaprio's role in ""Titanic"".Also starring John Leguizamo, Harold Perrineau, Pete Postlethwaite, Paul Sorvino, Brian Dennehy, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Miriam Margoyles, Jamie Kennedy and M. Emmet Walsh.One more thing: was Verona supposed to be in Brazil?",Romeo + Juliet
5,jboothmillard,William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet,7,11 December 2006,"I first saw bits of this and dismissed it because back then I hated Leonardo DiCaprio and Shakespearean language in the modern world, but now I like both. BAFTA winning director Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge) has brought the famous William Shakespeare love story into the 20th century (not the language of course), e.g. daggers are guns called Dagger. Romeo (DiCaprio) and Juliet (Terminator 3's Claire Danes) are two strong lovers, but they cannot be together as their families are in a battle with each other. The story is no change from the original play story, and in fact, it is almost like a stage performance (particularly with characters not ""looking behind them""). A lovely and tragic film with a doomed romance. Also starring John Leguizamo as Tybalt, Lost's Harold Perrineau as Mercutio, Pete Postlethwaite as Father Laurence, Paul Sorvino as Fulgencio Capulet, Brian Dennehy as Ted Montague, Friends' Paul Rudd as Dave Paris, Miriam Margolyes as The Nurse and Des'ree is in the film singing the film's love song, ""Kissing You"". It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, it won the BAFTAs for Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Nellee Hooper, Best Production Design, Best Adapted Screenplay and the David Lean Award for Direction, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Sound. Very good!",Romeo + Juliet
6,Tweekums,A modern version of the greatest love story,9,4 March 2011,"There isn't much to say about the story of 'Romeo and Juliet' as it is probably the greatest and best love story written. In the city of Verona the Montague and Capulet families are mortal enemies. That is until one day Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet meet and fall in love; knowing that their families won't tolerate their relationship they marry in secret. While no one else knows of the union Romeo intervenes in an argument between his friends and Tybalt, one of the Capulets; he refuses to fight even when Tybalt attacks him. Coming to Romeo's defence his friend Mercutio is killed by Tybalt who in tern is slain by Romeo. For this crime Romeo is banished and Juliet's parents arrange for her to be married to another suitor not knowing she is already wed. To solve the problem the priest gives Juliet a drug that will make her appear dead and writes a letter to Romeo explaining the situation. Romeo does not get this letter and when he hears Juliet is dead he returns to Verona and takes poison himself. Juliet wakens as he is taking it but by then it is too late; he is dying, she then takes his gun and shoots herself.Director Baz Luhrmann has brought a new twist to this old story; setting it in the present day. Surprisingly the Shakespearian language doesn't seem out of place, instead it comes across as the local dialect and references to 'swords' continue to work as we are shown that they are makes of guns. Leonardo diCaprio and Claire Danes are great in the lead roles; there is a real chemistry between their characters. Harold Perrineau is also notable as Mercutio; his opening scene is one that once seen you will never forget he is in drag wearing a silver costume, matching wig and bright red lipstick! Forcing school children to study the scripts often spoils Shakespeare; it was always intended to be watched as it is performed; in his day on the stage but now film brings another way to see it. This version might not be the most traditional but I think it could be one of the best ways of introducing somebody to his works.",Romeo + Juliet
7,Quinoa1984,"it's not a terrible movie, it's just..... huh?",5,14 January 2009,"I remember seeing Romeo + Juliet in a high school English class... or at least I'd like to pretend I did. If anything, I probably remember reading the actual play more, or maybe when they tried to do the comparison with Zeferelli's far superior 1968 version. Bored one day (very bored, though sadly not with the wherewithal to pick up a book like a more sane person), I saw Romeo + Juliet was on cable and stayed tuned to watch it. It's not as bad I've heard from some, which is that it's one of the worst films ever made. It's somehow weirdly watchable in some instances and shots and moments. Baz Lurhmann isn't a hack, that much is completely certain, he's got too much verve and POP in his style to be easily ignored. This is in fact what made Moulin Rouge, for better or worse, the significant achievement it was. But all the technical razzle dazzle in this case can't cover up the biggest problem of all: casting.And I don't mean that in the sense of ""oh, casting these hot young people of the 90s like Di Caprio and Claire Danes and, uh, John Leguizamo I guess"", that notion is a given. Watching the film today, after years of knowing Romeo & Juliet and Shakespeare work in general, the actors with one or two exceptions can't pull off the performances. Lurhmann leaves these kids and other character players like Harold Pirenneau and even a strange walk-on like Paul Sorvino to fend for themselves. And as for the two stars, Di Caprio and Danes, they are pretty to look at, but the performances clearly don't have a kind of focus that's required with the material. Perhaps this is more than anything not so much a fault of the director's in that ""oh, I'll cast them for this look and that"", but of simple things like rehearsal. I can imagine Lurhmann taking so much time to prepare how to make Verona the Verona-on-speed of his world, the Capulets and Montagues in their power games and battles, all super-designed and made out in super 90s sheek with some 80s leftover.So in short, there is a vision here, but its squandered when the human elements are left beside. Some bits are worthwhile, like Pete Posthlethwaie (sic) s the priest, but really the main attraction is to try and lure in mall kids who wouldn't go near the Bard with a ten foot pair of designer jeans under normal circumstances. It's shiny and goes fast and crazy, but there's not a lot of substance much... at all. That being said, it's fun to re-live some of the 90s music, as cheesy as it can get.",Romeo + Juliet
8,sunwarrior13,Modern Shakespeare Original,9,8 January 2012,"William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet is a film adaptation of William Shakespeare's romantic tragedy of the same name. It was directed by Baz Luhrmann and it stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in the leading roles.The film is an abridged modernization of Shakespeare's play. While it retains the original Shakespearean dialogue, the Montagues and the Capulets are represented as warring business empires and swords are replaced by guns.Some of the names were also changed. Lord and Lady Montague and Lord and Lady Capulet were given first names as opposed to the Shakespeare original where their first names are never mentioned, Friar Lawrence became Father Lawrence, and Prince Escalus was renamed Captain Prince.Additionally, a few plot details unimportant to the grand story arc were shifted; most notably, Juliet awakens just as Romeo poisons himself and the two see each other before he dies and she commits suicide.The movie was able to keep the integrity of Shakespeare's text.Credit goes mostly thanks to the actors speaking the very same lines of iambic pentameter as written four centuries ago.Despite a flawed start, Romeo & Juliet proves the story deserves an adjective often attached to it: timeless.The only thing about it is when the filmmakers decide to jazz it up with crazy camera angles and rapid cutting for great visual and when it updates the story for modern times with screaming and shooting, it just gets lost somehow.But still,it remains good for viewing.",Romeo + Juliet
9,preppy-3,MTV meets Shakespeare,8,1 July 2002,"Updating of ""Romeo and Juliet"" for the 1990s. I'm going to skip a synopsis of the plot--everyone knows it. This is basically ""Romeo and Juliet"" in modern day dress full of arresting visuals, gunplay, loud 1990s music, wild dance numbers with all the cast members using Shakespeare's original dialogue! The effect is odd (to say the least). It ALMOST works. The visuals are all incredible (director Buz Luhrmann always knows how to make a film look fantastic) and the movie almost never stops for a breath. That's the problem--at first it's fun, but after 2 hours you're exhausted. Also the actors seem lost. When they're talking Shakespeare they seem to have no idea what they're saying. Most of them just recite the lines with a blank look on their faces. The older actors (Paul Sorvino especially) are much better at it. The casting and acting in this is all over the place.Leonardo DiCaprio (as Romeo) is a good actor, but he's just all wrong for this role. He looks lost and way out of his depth. However, Claire Danes is wonderful as Juliet. Very sweet, likable and seems to have a clear understanding of the dialogue. Also her reactions in her dancing scene with Paris are hilarious. John Leguizamo is way over the top as Tybalt--too much. He quickly becomes annoying. Brian Dennehy and Paul Sorvino are very good as Montague and Capulet but are underused. Even Paul Rudd is very good (and incredibly handsome) as Paris. He seems to be having a whale of a time in his role.Also, there is an incredible party sequence and Romeo's cousin comes in a wig, dress and lipstick and no one bats an eyelash. There's a great musical number on a huge staircase also.Loud, eye-popping, funny and even quite moving. As it stands, I'm giving it an 8. With a better cast I might give it a 10.Best line: ""Check on me tomorrow and you'll find me a grave man.""",Romeo + Juliet
10,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Hip and intense modernization,8,21 October 2006,"I hadn't heard all of this story before watching this film, so please forgive me any misunderstandings that may come as a result of that ignorance. When I heard that this was done by Baz Luhrmann and Craig Pearce, who later went on to create Moulin Rouge together, which is one of my favorite love stories(granted, at the time I first saw it, that was a pretty short list) of all time, as well as just about the only true musical that I've found myself enjoying, naturally I was going to watch it. Plus, it's difficult to challenge the quality of William Shakespeare's writings, and this is said to be one of his best works. The idea is magnificent; take the original story and retell it in modern day suburbia, with the original dialog(though, obviously, unfortunately, not all the dialog could be retained; I was disappointed to find that the brief exchange regarding ""how deep was the cut"" was not in the film). The result works out very well, by changing the setting to one that today's youth can easier relate to, whilst still making the points that the original play did. The plot is very good, and evolves nicely throughout. The pace is *intense*. This thing moves non-stop. Blink and you'll miss something. At times, this speed was almost overwhelming. The running time is two (exactly!) hours, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost all of it. The editing seems to bear traces of this... more often than not, it seems like the scene or certain cuts of it had been trimmed by a few seconds, to ensure the run-time length, and it can be a little confusing(for the quite few times it happens). I will say that Luhrmann kept the pace at an appropriate rate for the dramatic scenes. In fact, they may become even stronger, from the otherwise extreme pace. The line-delivery is fast, but exceptional. The acting is excellent. I can't name a single performance that I found even slightly flawed. The casting is marvelous, as well... the two leads and the supporting players are spot-on(heck, even Jamie Kennedy worked, here). The music is a good mix of hip, new music and a beautiful score. Production values are high. The cinematography causes a confusing moment or two, but it mostly simply serves to keep the intensity up. A well-done modernization of the famous play. I recommend this to any fan of the people involved in making it, and/or William Shakespeare. Do keep in mind that there are various creative decisions made, changing the original tale... including one regarding the famous ending. 8/10",Romeo + Juliet
11,evanston_dad,"Baz Luhrmann, What Have Ye Wrought?",1,17 June 2009,"Horrendous version of the Shakespeare tragedy directed by horrendous hack Baz Luhrmann, up there with Joel Schumacher and Danny Boyle among my five least favorite directors of all time.This is ""Romeo and Juliet"" for the MTV generation, the movie equivalent of a shark, afraid that if it slows down for even a moment it will die. Luhrmann throws a bunch of images up on the screen and maintains a relentlessly ferocious pace, hoping we'll be too distracted to notice the horrible acting and the fact that our young leads don't understand the lines they're speaking. Well, that might work on teenage girls, who are probably the demographic most likely to admire this film, but I can't vouch for anyone else.Baz Luhrmann must be stopped at all costs. Why doesn't anyone else understand that??!!! Grade: F",Romeo + Juliet
12,anaconda-40658,Can He Not Wait?,7,30 December 2015,"Romeo + Juliet (1996): Dir: Baz Luhamann / Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, Brian Dennehy, Pete Postlethwaite, Paul Sorvino: This is perhaps the most modern you can translate the works of Shakespeare and despite the intriguing vision there is much that may or may not translate. The story is as old as mold. Two families are at odds while the romance between a young couple is threatened. Interesting Shakespearean dialogue placed within modern society but we know the tragedy and the violence is more severe and repetitious. Juliet's home is wonderfully Shakespearean thanks to massive art direction that clashes both Shakespearean and modern society. Director Baz Luhamann gives the film a precise visual appeal that will bring a new image to the whole idea of anything associated with William Shakespeare. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes follow the formalities and pull off a modern day romantic Bonnie and Clyde persona until that forever cheap tragedy arrives. Brian Dennehy and Pete Postlethwaite are well cast as their fathers who see confrontation as an only answer. It presents modernization of the play but the violence seems tailored to action fans. Students of Shakespearean literature may disapprove of the modern translation due to its level of violence. It is not entirely successful but merely intriguing in its presentation of classic literature to the bizarre. Score: 7 / 10",Romeo + Juliet
13,Sylviastel,It's not for me! I just hated it!,1,4 May 2006,"After only watching a few minutes of this adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, I couldn't take much more of it. It was something that I could laugh at rather than take seriously. I tried after a few minutes more but it's hard to take Leonardo DiCaprio who I believe is a very talented actor and Clare Dane who is just as talented playing in modern times. We know nobody talks like that. If they had adapted Romeo and Juliet to more modern language, I think I would have bared the film in general. But the language and the modern day scenery do not mix well for me. I'm old fashioned I guess in general. I know the director wanted something different for Romeo and Juliet. Few films can beat the 1968 version with Olivia Hussey and this film would not be very welcome if I was teaching Romeo and Juliet. It's too far fetched and ridiculous. I know it's modernized for the audience. But I like my Shakespeare to be precise and old fashioned. I love Miriam Margolyes as the nurse and Christina Pickles as one of the mothers but it just doesn't feel right. Mercutio's supposed to be a drag queen which I felt was really something that made my stomach turn in general was out of this world. It's not for me and I accept that. If there are others happy with it, so be it but not for me.",Romeo + Juliet
14,Mr-Fusion,Nope,3,19 August 2016,"It's obvious from the start that ""Romeo + Juliet"" is Baz Luhrmann's stab at making the story relevant to the '90s, and I can appreciate that. Hell, if it weren't for 10th grade English class, who knows if I'd ever try my luck at Shakespeare? He's not the most accessible author around.But the execution is way off. Warring families are updated to street gangs and swords are branded as guns (literally), but the dialogue is strictly Elizabethan era. Those words and the contemporary setting do not mix. At all. It's especially jarring in the opening scenes with the spazzed-out gangbangers. This is a movie packaged for the MTV crowd; the direction's cartoonish, the style frenetic and any soul this story had is lost in translation.It's bad.3/10",Romeo + Juliet
15,JamesHitchcock,One of the few Romeos in history to be prettier than his Juliet,6,13 December 2012,"In the nineties films based upon works of literature were commonly given an official title incorporating the name of the author of the work, so this film was at the time often referred to as ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"" rather than simply ""Romeo and Juliet"". There was, apparently, a technical reason for this connected with copyright law, but some viewers and reviewers took this form of title as an indication that the film would be more faithful to the original book than previous attempts to film it had been. This might be true of something like the Kenneth Branagh ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"", but it is certainly not true of this film. Derek Jarman's version of ""The Tempest"" probably remains the most eccentric Shakespearean film adaptation I have seen, but Baz Luhrmann's runs it close. Luhrmann transfers the action to a modern American city, ""Verona Beach"", with the Montagues and Capulets represented as rival criminal gangs masquerading as legitimate businesses. The idea of portraying the two families as feuding gangsters is not an original one. It is copied straight from Leonard Bernstein's musical ""West Side Story"" and the film that was made from it. Like the Jets in the musical, Luhrmann's Montagues are white Anglo-Saxons, whereas his Capulets, like the Sharks, are Hispanic. (Mercutio, who belongs to neither side despite his friendship with Romeo, is black). ""White Anglo-Saxon"" does not, however, in this context equate to ""Protestant""; both families are obviously Catholic, and the film is notable for its use of Catholic religious imagery, with rosaries, religious statues, etc., much to the fore. The difference between the two films is that ""West Side Story"" keeps the basic outline of Shakespeare's story, modernising it and transferring it to 1950s New York, but changes the names of the characters and does not use any of Shakespeare's words. Luhrmann, however, retains Shakespeare's original dialogue (in an abridged form), and only makes minor changes to the plot; for example, the Prince becomes Captain Prince, the local police chief, Friar Lawrence becomes Father Lawrence (a priest rather than a friar) and swords are replaced by guns. (This does not, however, necessitate any change in the dialogue; 'Sword' becomes the name of a gun manufacturer). Luhrmann's film suffers from a problem common to a number of cinematic attempts to modernise Shakespeare. There is a jarring contrast between the modern setting and the sixteenth-century language, and an even more jarring contrast between that setting and the sixteenth century attitudes which that language expresses. These contrasts are not normally an issue in the theatre, which is a very different medium and which does not generally aim for the same degree of realism as the cinema. Filmed Shakespeare generally works better when the director either keeps the traditional setting (as Zeffirelli did with his ""Romeo and Juliet"") or transfers it to a fantasy setting (as Branagh did with his ""Much Ado about Nothing"" or Trevor Nunn with his ""Twelfth Night"", to take two other examples from the nineties). To give an example of what I mean by a ""jarring contrast"", it seems odd to see on screen a late twentieth-century American police officer threatening, in antique language, two warring gang bosses with the death penalty if their followers cause any more trouble. Our instincts are to ask ""But what about their constitutional rights? What about due process?"" To reply that the police officer is supposed to represent a absolute Renaissance Italian ruler is no real answer; it merely invites the further question ""Then why not keep a setting in which rulers do have absolute powers of life and death?"" The film's other main drawback is that neither of the leads are very good. In 1996 Leonardo DiCaprio was still in the pretty-boy, heartthrob stage of his career; indeed, he must be one of the few Romeos in history to be prettier than his Juliet, the pointy-chinned Claire Danes. Serious acting for DiCaprio was something that would not come until some years later, and here he is bland and uninteresting. Natalie Portman was originally cast as Juliet, but Luhrmann sacked her after production began, apparently because he was unhappy with the age difference between her (15 at the time) and DiCaprio (22). As, however, Danes is only two years older than Portman, and plays the role in a very ""adolescent"" way, with a breathy voice and a perpetual expression of wide-eyed innocence, I am not sure that the change in casting made any real difference. I didn't like Harold Perrineau's camp, lisping Mercutio; he appeared to be trying to imply a gay sub-text into the relationship between Mercutio and Romeo, which struck me as inappropriate. Some of the actors playing the Capulets, notably Paul Sorvino as Old Capulet and Miriam Margolyes as the Nurse, affected odd foreign accents, while others, such as Danes, spoke in standard American accents. There were, however, acting performances I liked, such as John Leguizamo, who brought the necessary arrogance and swagger to Tybalt, Pete Postlethwaite's dignified Father Lawrence and Vondie Curtis-Hall's authoritative Prince. Luhrmann's direction is a bit too flashy for my taste, with excessive use of cross-cutting, but he does bring a good deal of pace and excitement to many scenes, especially the fight scenes. Despite my reservations about the basic concept, and some of the acting performances, I have given the film an above-average mark, largely because it is Shakespeare, and you can't go too far wrong with Shakespeare, at least not with a play as great as ""Romeo and Juliet"". (You could probably go very wrong with something like ""Troilus and Cressida"" or ""Titus Andronicus"", but not too many people try to film those plays). ""Romeo + Juliet"" is always watchable, if only as an interesting experiment. It does not, however, compare to the really great Shakespearean films such as the Zeffirelli version of this story. 6/10",Romeo + Juliet
16,StevePulaski,"Where for art thou, entertainment?",3,20 May 2011,"Romeo + Juliet is a failed attempt to modernize Shakespeare's classic play written all the way back in 1591. Its glossy production, awkward mix of old and new, and newer technology added to give it the ""present"" feel completely destroys the love aspect of the film and turns it into a goofy and lame adaptation of one of literature's many classics.Obviously, this was meant for kids who don't like reading, but like action films. The scenes are loaded with primary colors and the action rarely ceases. The acting is beyond over-dramatic, and turns the characters into buffoons who barely represent their respected characters in the play.The nail that seals the coffin is the film's mix of the old and the new style. It can't decide if it wants to fully change Shakespeare's work, or keep some in and some out. We get a messy result. The film hybrids over using pistols instead of swords and car chases to entertain ones who believe the play is ""boring."" To cover up the madness and chaos exploding on screen we get annoying and volume enhanced rock tunes that are out of place and just a complete and total waste of time. I would have never thought Radiohead would've made it in a film titled Romeo + Juliet.The storyline is kept pretty much the same; Romeo and Juliet are star-crossed lovers who desperately want to be together. Romeo coming from the Montague household and Juliet from the Capulets, have known that their parents have had an ongoing rivalry forever but can't help but find solace in each other.Despite its age and overall outdated language, Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet has managed to leach itself into the school curriculum year after year. The book is in no way a bad read. I found some parts hard to understand, but I was caught up within a few minutes. It does involve re-reading and your full attention.The book is very outdated in terms of dialog. Obviously, no body says ""Where for art thou, mother"" in 2011. The most important aspect of a book is being able to read it and comprehend what it is telling you. Sometimes, that can be a task for current readers of the play. But with internet and technology at its peak I'm sure understanding it will be no problem.I'm in no way bashing the book. I found it to be quite enjoyable and quite sad, but sometimes I kind of wish I knew what was happening instead of assuming. Still, the play is the grand-daddy of literature. I can except that, and I'm glad I read it.With actors like Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, and John Leguizamo I can only imagine how this film would've played out if it was made with some level of seriousness. It has been so long since we saw a new R&J adaptation, you'd think one would be remade again to fill the void.What really kills this film, is the dialog. It keeps in place lots of Shakespeare speak. It is not only laughable, but questionable. First you want to completely modernize the film, then you want to keep the dialog. Maybe in someone's head it sounds pretty amusing, on film, it is atrocious and unable to take seriously. Especially when the film pans shots of some unnamed fat guy sitting on a lawnchair with no shirt on. Seriously? Romeo + Juliet is definitely a unique adaptation, but it is absolutely a horrendous turnout. Anyone in school watching this will likely be amused by its quirky take on the play and find it way more entertaining than the play itself because of its more blatant style. Shakespeare fans will be greatly letdown by the film's mockery of the play's tragedy. It is definitely a stain on Leo's filmography, and the rest of the cast's.Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, John Leguizamo, Harold Perrineau, Pete Postlethwaite, Brian Dennehy, Paul Rudd, Christina Pickles, and Jesse Bradford. Directed by: Baz Luhrmann.",Romeo + Juliet
17,Smells_Like_Cheese,A good movie with some minor flaws,7,26 October 2002,"Well, this is the MTV version of Romeo and Juliet. I honestly really can't stand Claire Daine's acting. I think she really sucks. But over all, her and Leonardo do heat up the scenes. There were some things I questioned about. Like the fight scene between Mercutio and Tybolt. Their fight was supposed to be playful like. Not all over dramatic. Not till the end is it supposed to be dramatic. They didn't really get into the Paris's character. And I didn't really feel the effect of the prince, it seemed like he was a father trying to disapline his children more then protecting the law. The Capulet's party, that's something I could go on and on about. But I have to say, it was an interesting approach to an excellent play done by da man, Shakespeare. I saw this in the theater in 1996, and loved it at first. But then I realized it could of been done better. But it's still worth a watch.7/10",Romeo + Juliet
18,MovieAddict2016,Vibrant and cool; also sort of mediocre...,6,2 February 2004,"An entertaining, if seriously flawed, re-telling of Shakespeare's classic tale of young love starring Leonardi DiCaprio and Claire Danes as the infamous duo who sacrificed themselves over true love. Top-notch cast and some crazy modern-day direction by Baz Luhrman (""Moulin Rouge!"") certainly makes for one of the strangest films to ever hit the big screen.3/5 stars.John Ulmer",Romeo + Juliet
19,KineticSeoul,Baz Luhrmann imagery doesn't connect with the story,5,14 August 2013,"""Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes"" is what sort of sums up this tragedy. And in this it shows the quickness in the two lovers decision. This story shows maybe there is love at first sight...Maybe. Now this is a classic romantic tragedy based on one of William Shakespeare's most popular plays. And it does a good job for the most part of staying true to the original. Except this goes in a modern direction in the 90's. With wild, quick, bizarre and zany approach to it all. The visuals are flamboyant and very colorful. But when it comes to Bas Luhrmann's imagery and style in this, I just didn't think it fit into the story very well. Sure adding modern imagery to a old play is a cool idea and may even work sometimes. But just wasn't digging the style when it comes to this story. The soundtrack is awesome like in most Baz Luhrmann films though. I think this movie was mainly a hit, because of Leonardo DiCaprio who is in the early stage of being a young heartthrob for teenage girls as Romeo. And is the movie that boosted Claire Danes career. Just about all the characters are over the top in this, especially John Leguizamo. Which does get a bit annoying after a while. Oh yeah, and Romeo's best friend reminded me of Chris Rock in this. But like I said Baz Luhrmann imagery and style works in his other films, but not in this one. And also seeing it now, his imagery and style just seems way too outdated. Which might be unfair but it kept me from enjoying this movie. I just couldn't get into it. When it comes to the modern setting, it just didn't make much sense when it tries to connect with the story. And I am not talking about how the guns are labeled as swords in this and the small stuff either. Personally I liked the Romeo and Juliet (1968) version better and looking forward to the 2013 version.5.9/10",Romeo + Juliet
20,OllieSuave-007,Neat modern adaptation on Shakespeare's tragedy.,8,12 June 2014,"This is a neat modern adaptation of William Shakespeare's classic and tragic tale, Romeo and Juliet, where the feuding families of the Montagues and the Capulets are foretold in the Italian city of Verona. The lives and affair of star-crossed lovers Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet are complicated by their feuding families.Though set in modern times, this movie still follows Shakespeare's play somewhat to a T, helped by the actors' theatrical delivery of the original dialog, the intense drama and the enchanting story. Director Baz Luhrmann did a great job putting together the movie, placing his own unique style into the play but retaining the original intent of the story. The entire setting and scenery are set in this very wildly multi-colored atmosphere, giving the movie a very hip element. Lastly, the cast of characters were nicely assembled, all pulling off some very bold acting performances.Overall, it's a good combination of classic theater and modern Hollywood cinema.Grade B",Romeo + Juliet
21,FeastMode,my notes,1,22 July 2019,Pretty terrible and laughable. it seemed like a spoof of itself. it's a cool idea. but it just didn't work right. the dialogue did not go with the setting at all. it was so weird and awkward. and also the movie is really weird and awkward. i half-watched most of this. there was some good music (2 viewings),Romeo + Juliet
22,ElMaruecan82,Glittering Carbon-Copy...,6,26 March 2017,"Movies like ""Moulin Rouge!"" (or more recently, ""La La Land"") are so lavishly designed and stylishly directed that the simplicity of their stories is no coincidence, they are well-crafted forms of entertainment meant to arouse emotions rather than thoughts.Indeed, while I'm not a professional on editing or filmmaking, what I gathered from years of cinematic dedication is that complex, multi-layered, character-driven stories generally call for straightforward directing, so that the form doesn't distract from the content. In other words, there's a time for ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and another for ""Chinatown"", and I can't think of a good movie that is both exceedingly directed and written (with the exception of ""Citizen Kane"").Can we take for granted that people know ""Romeo and Juliet"" so well that a few artistic licenses won't hurt, or are actually needed? Is it such an iconic story that it can sustain every narrative form without undermining the emotional bingo of the end? Well, I'm not sure the story is self-sufficient, while watching Leo as Romeo (talk about predestination in that rhyming) challenging Tybalt (John Leguizamo), shouting Shakespeare's lines with such passion I could hardly understood what he said, I was wondering if the movie wouldn't have worked as well or better had they been swords instead of guns, Verona instead of Verona Beach and good old Renaissance as the time setting.And it's precisely because Leonardo Di Caprio was an excellent Romeo, in his pre-""Titanic"" fame years with the youthful charm, the wide-eyed innocence, the eyebrow-raising enthusiasm and penetrating sadness, he was a baby-faced young man who could easily pass as a teenager. The rest of the casting was competent, honorable mention to Leguizamo who looked as passionately angry as his 1968 counterpart Michael York, and to Paul Sorvino and Pete Postlewhaite. Claire Danes paled in comparison but not to the point of ruining the film. What did spoil the film a little was actually its own reason to be, Baz Lhurmann!"" thought that Shakespeare's romance needed a rejuvenation treatment, as if it wasn't modern enough for younger audiences.The problem is that the story has been modernized already, like Kurosawa made adaptations of ""Macbeth"" and ""King Lear"", ""Romeo and Juliet"" inspired good movies like ""West Side Story"" or ""China Girl"", love stories with a gang war as the backdrop. In fact any interesting romance inevitably revolves around star-crossed lovers, any romance owes a bit to ""Romeo and Juliet"" which owed to all the romantic heritage of the past centuries. So you either remake ""Romeo and Juliet"" or you adapt it, there is rarely an in-between solution. Lurhmann took the challenge and it's laudable, but his ""Romeo + Juliet"" couldn't be a total remake or it would have been a second ""West Side Story"", it was doomed to be half-Shakespeare, half-something else.And the problem is that the text didn't match the setting, no matter how hard it tried like replacing the narrator by a TV announcer. It was so busy reminding you that this is the Shakespeare play in its academic version (same lines) that it became unchained to its premise, while in any of the previous adaptations; the romance was the focal point, not its kinship with the original story. It came to the point that the 'Trainspotting'-like editing, the pop music, the opera, the shootouts, the awkward mix between modern settings and Renaissance-expressions becomes a sort of gimmick that overshadowed the story. The form detracted from the story, and the heart of ""Romeo and Juliet"" is the story. If you're not emotionally involved, it's over.And the film could still win the audiences, had it not ruined the very scenes that could create the emotional involvement, through some bizarre experimentation. I didn't care for the 1968 version until the balcony scene; Olivia Hussey's youthful beauty, the purity of Nino Rota's score, the interactions between the young lovers, the film won because of that scene. So, I expected the balcony scene to enhance ""Romeo + Julier"" but Lurhmann had to introduce the novelty of the swimming pool. What was he thinking? If you're going to stick to the play, don't ruin the most iconic part. How can someone be focused on loving while he's also trying to float in the water. Forget what I said, the whole thing just looked awkward and as sincere as the actors were in their intent to play ""Romeo and Juliet"", it's like Lurhmann had another movie in mind.The film was a success but it was out-shined by the Leo's following hit, the one that put him in Hollywood map forever and ever; ""Titanic"" the year after, interestingly, this was a tale of forbidden love that was closer in spirit and in heart to ""Romeo and Juliet"" than ""Lurrhman's jukebox. And Claire Danes, with all due respect, is no Kate Winslet. Leo is a real romantic actor but the real star of Baz Lurhmann's film was Baz Lurhmann. His unique jukebox-styled directing fitted ""Moulin Rouge!"" but as far as ""Romeo + Juliet"" goes, it's still an entertaining little movie, that nostalgic of the 90's will cherish. For me, it's the film of that ""Love Fool"" song and I have it on my playlist.",Romeo + Juliet
23,paul2001sw-1,It's just that the time was... right!,9,18 August 2004,"For all the Shakespeare's greatness, filming the bard's works presents problems, owing to the static staging, the need for the cast to act unsubtly to convey the meaning of outdated language, and subject matter not obviously attuned to modern life.  The last problem is in fact a mirage, as beneath the surface concerns of his works, Shakespeare addresses universal themes, which is why many have tried to update his plays for modern times: but a straightforward modernisation misses the point that it is the language they contain, rather than their generic and contrived plotting, that makes them great in the first place.  Director Baz Luhrmann therefore tried a different strategy: change the style but keep the words.  So his 'Romeo + Juliet' is set in an apocalyptic hybrid of Los Angeles and Rio de Janeiro, and filmed as a cross between 'Dynasty' and a pop video, but retains all the original poetry.  The lurid result is surprisingly fresh, and huge amounts of imaginative fun are had in translation (my favourite details: the depiction of the clans' fathers, one as Ted Kennedy and one as a mafioso; the use of the swimming pool in the famous balcony scenes; and Romeo's exile as a hippy in the desert).  Some of this interpretation is over the top, but there's more hit than miss and even Mercutio (played by Harold Pirreneau as a drag queen) brings real passion to his death. As for the stars, Leonardo di Caprio, an actor of limited range, is well suited to this role, while Claire Danes smiles fluourescently and speaks the centuries-old dialgoue with the saucy naturalness of the contemporary American teenager. The tricksiness fades towards the end as Luhrmann concentrates on the intrinsic drama; but never do you feel like you are watching a play.  In conclusion: Shakespeare still rocks, and Luhrmann does too.",Romeo + Juliet
24,ericstevenson,Pretty much worth it,8,16 August 2017,"This was actually a pretty early attempt to modernize the classic ""Romeo And Juliet"" story by placing it in modern times. I admit that some of the movie does come off as being off key. It's kind of weird to see a version of RAJ that begins with gunfire and explosions, but don't worry. The film gets much better later. Anyway, it's really fascinating to see how 90s this movie is. I mean, it pretty much envisions everything that made the 90s what it was and seeing as how it's an update of a classic story, that makes sense. For the most part, it's certainly good.The original dialogue is kept, but there is one big change near the end. Juliet actually briefly awakes and witnesses Romeo die. It's not that important, but it's still interesting to see something different with such a popular story. We're even told that the families have a rivalry that's implied to go back to the times of when the original story takes place. It even begins by showing us what happens at the very end. Seeing as how everyone knows how it ends, it's a very clever way of setting it up and it makes for a good movie. ***",Romeo + Juliet
25,secondtake,"Dazzling, reverent and audacious at once, and a beautiful telling of a beautiful story",9,5 May 2013,"Romeo + Juliet (1996)Spellbinding. Pushes hard at the limits of a contemporary kind of Shakespeare while still keeping all the intense rivalry and romance. It's sometimes awkward, improbable, and even ridiculous if you don't jump in and just go with it. But if this is at all up your alley in spirit or in a love of the original play forever finding new turf, you might just be blown away.I was. I saw it the first time late at night traveling and a bit bored and restless and from the first scene to the last I forgot the world and was twisted and pushed and amazed. You might be able to say any one actor--like Leonardo DiCaprio as Romeo or Claire Danes as Juliet--is breathtaking, though many certainly are superb. What you find is the movie itself is the star, rapidly conjoining unlikely scenes and making individual contributions flare and sizzle in jarring succession. The filming, too--under veteran Donald McAlpine--is gorgeous and original without being distracting.Shakespeare deserves some credit here, taking a classic problem and turning it into an archetypal drama. The problem is just when two people fall in love from different sides of the tracks. The drama, of course, is the eventual suicides out of pure love. If you don't know the story and I've ruined the ending, I'm sorry. (I won't say who kills themselves.)See this? Yes. Yes. Yes. But be warned--it starts with such a bizarre boundary pushing adaptation of the classic confrontations in modern gang terms you might just say, woah, this is stupid and horrible. You really might. But if you can hang in there until you get the two title characters going, and get them to meet, you'll at least know how deliberate and creative the whole movie's style is.",Romeo + Juliet
26,ironhorse_iv,This is what happen if William Shakespeare lived in the 1990's.,7,14 February 2013,"This is how his plays would look like. Romeo and Juliet is just one revision by director Baz Luhrmann and the MTV Generation, as the 400 year old written text by thee William Shakespeare is put though a grinder, and out comes the meat of the story repacked and sold to the audience. Romeo and Juliet is the story, oops I meant Romeo + Juliet is the story of two young star-crossed lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families. While most people know the plot, this movie just gives you all the highlights clips of the film in prologue. Yes, you don't believe have to bother watching the film, it's just shoot it up there with fast pace zooming and out, with epic background music. Unlike the 1968 Zeffirelli version, this takes place in the fictional modern-day location called Verona Beach, where the two houses of Capulets and Montagues are just giant corporations. What do they sell? Who knows-- all we know is that they hate each other for some odd reason and it's ripping the city apart. The play was set in Italy, but in this film, I have no clue if it's Latin America, America or some country in Spain. Believe me, I love Shakespeare, but it has its place, and doesn't need to be reduced to nausea-inducing jokes like having guns manufactured by Sword, wild car crashes, and over used drug use. That's just stupid and unnecessary. This is an antiquated love story, made for its time and best when set in its time. There is nothing good about making a loud, obnoxious, absurdly anachronistic monstrosity and sometimes this movie go overboard. Everything is modern, but the language of the film. If you don't understand the language, READ and study the story first. The language is early modern English, but has been translated into dozens of modern languages. By modernizing many aspects of the story and using popular, engaging actors to portray the roles, a new generation of fans can appreciate the gift of Shakespeare. Who would've thought to update Shakespeare to a modern setting, keep the original language, replace daggers with gun, and add a kick ass soundtrack? Quite frankly, it's genius and the execution brilliant, but it's a bit annoying. This movie does shows how Shakespeare can transcend time,﻿culture, and age, but not well suite. I've always interpreted the story as a tragedy, not a love story. Romeo and Juliet is hardly a love story. Romeo (Leonardo DiCapiro) and Juliet (Claires Danes) are two love-sick teenagers rushing headlong toward doom. Claire Danes was so well casted. She fits this role as Julia perfectly. So innocent, so pure, so divine. Leo is not just a pretty face. It's his pure talent, his amazingly unique looks, the way he speaks, and laughs, his piercing eyes, the way he adapts into characters, his innocent yet cheeky intriguing personality, and his intelligence. I do love the scene where both of their character meet through a fish tank. It was catchy, but still both of their characters are flawed. Romeo and Juliet may be a satire of a romance story. Romantic love in the basic sense is nothing more or less than physical lust rather than﻿the deep connection between two human beings. This seems to ring thought the characters as much of the theme of the piece is more loin love rather than love. Throughout, we are bombarded by sexual references, most of which are jocular. In the Queen Mab monologue, for example, Mercutio (Harold Perrineau) points his heavy laden and loaded, weapon at his own youthful tangled emotions. A powder keg of hot blood tormented and moved in night straightening. Youth is often lead by it's loins, and often into trouble. The stirring of mad blood leading to a fatal fate. This movie kinda ruins that monologue using Queen Mab as a drug. Harold does a great old as Mercutio, but it felt like Mercutio was just there to be a homosexual cross dresser drug dealer. That's pretty far from the source there, Baz. As the film goes on, a number of great theme comes into play, the bright colors, immaculate hearts, religious symbols like crosses, and stage on the beach makes the film seem surreal and strange. The violence is not so poetic when you take a bullet to the head. Have they actually read the book? We are so in glue as if it's a true love story when it's source really wasn't saying that. The whole play takes place over like four days!﻿How is that true love?!Love is usually the cause of nothing but anguish for the character's in his plays. Love not only consumes their lives, but often ends with them dying, killing someone, or going through a lot of ridiculousness before they can have what they love. It's not based on the subject he wrote in, but how Shakespeare wrote about love that proves the above statement. There's a sonnet he wrote that details his thoughts on love, and it's not flattering. In the play they're supposed to be quite young and don't take time to make good decisions. Both Romeo and Juliet are deluded in their love for each other, and their romance is a product of them wanting to escape their realities. Wouldn't the simplest explanation for their romance﻿ be forbidden fruit tastes the sweetest? I think this modernization of Romeo and Juliet makes it more reliable and entertaining. The supporting actors like Pete Postlethwaite (Father Laurence), John Leguizamo (Tybalt), and Miriam Margolyes (the Nurse) all play their parts great. Kissing you by Des'ree is a great emotional song, but still Romeo and Juliet are so freaking unstable in the modern sense. It's not a happy ever after, but a tragedy that this couldn't live up to the 1968 version.",Romeo + Juliet

Neither can speak the verse brilliantly, although both manage to be effective, perhaps because they have youth and beauty on their side.In support are Miriam Margoyles, Pete Postlethwaite, and others.  All adequate.But the best things in this Romeo and Juliet have nothing to do with Shakepeare.  First, there's the music - a lovely theme for when the lovers first meet, a drag performance for Mercutio with the disco classic Young Hearts Run Free, a church choir singing When Doves Cry - and the gorgeous visuals (the final sequences are in a shining gold palace of kitsch, there's a fishtank with lovely coloured fish, there's a large pool which helps move the balcony scene along ...).Don't expect a straightforward classical adaptation.

30,zkonedog,Chemistry Between Principals Makes This Watchable,5,2 March 2017,"Back in ninth grade English class, our teacher showed us this movie after we read William Shakespeare's famous play. The film made an impression on me back then, and I wanted to see what would happen 15 years later. It isn't an all-time classic, to be sure, but ""Romeo + Juliet"" does manage to render the tale in a bit more of a user-friendly format.For a basic plot summary, this movie uses the exact language of Shakespeare's play...but sets it in a modern, urban environment. Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Juliet (Claire Danes) are the principles, of course, while Harold Perrineau & John Leguizamo have important roles as Mercutio and Tybalt, respectively.What makes this film hold up at least somewhat are the performances by DiCaprio & Danes. They are perfect for their roles and have great on-screen chemistry. Both ended up being fine thespians, so in hindsight this should not have been surprising. Many fans of the Romeo & Juliet story laud the 1968 version as ""top dog"", but IMHO the two principles here, at least, put up performances every bit as good as from the earlier effort.The reason this one isn't an all-time classic? The direction from Baz Luhrmann is just too weird. I don't understand why they couldn't have kept the urban, modern feel without making things so bizarre. The duels between the houses are terribly over-the-top, while I've never once understood why viewers need to see Mercutio prance around in drag for so long. Even the camera work and cinematography is odd/bizarre. Had they toned down that craziness a bit, this could have rocketed higher for me. As it was, like I mentioned earlier, I really only enjoyed the Romeo/Juliet interactions.Overall, ""Romeo + Juliet"" is good for showing reluctant Shakespearean ""scholars"" (e.g. high- schoolers), but other than that it is decidedly average. DiCaprio and Danes give it their all, but all the weird stuff going on around them really detracts from the passion of the story. If only they had played it just slightly more serious...",Romeo + Juliet
31,eddie_baggins,Shakespeare like we've never seen before,6,25 May 2020,"There's been many an adaptation of the Bard's various works, whether it be for screen, stage or other mediums, but it's safe to say there haven't been many adaptations of Shakespeare's works adapted quite like Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet.A colour infused ADHD like incarnation of the famed story of doomed lovers, which sees the action transported from ancient England to a modern day Verona Beach (really an LA set piece), Luhrmann's version of this timeless romance is certainly not for everyone and not as refined narratively as one would like but there's no denying there's an energy and verve to this outing that is rarely found in feature films.Not a director renowned for his restraint, Luhrmann holds nothing back as he wastes little time introducing us to the world of teenager's Romeo and Juliet, members of the Montague and Capulet families respectively, two warring families that would rather see death come upon them than somehow see their bloodline merged into one.From the moment we open the film through a series of whirlwind news stories that lead into an eclectic gas stop run-in between the feuding tribes, Luhrmann stops at nothing on his quest to breathe new life into the 100's year old tale, with a collection of OTT costumes, set-pieces, pop music and vibrant cast to keep things moving along at a breakneck pace.Lucking out by snaring a young and ready for action Leonardo DiCaprio and a never more charismatic Claire Danes to portray the films central couple, a solid chemistry between the two cements Romeo + Juliet as a definitive film of the era for a certain demographic and one of Luhrmann's most hip affairs, that stands above Moulin Rouge and Australia for accessibility for a wider range of viewers, even if it's unlikely those of the boomer variety would find much to love here.It's a shame that all of the films energy, hyperactivity and abundance of pizzazz can't be found in its ability to craft an emotive experience, as the story of these two teenage love birds has lasted centuries due to the ability it had connecting with readers emotionally and that's never really found here in this exercise of style over substance, we as viewers are always wowed by the visual and technical but not so much the beating heart at the core of the story.Final Say -A unique beast that is sure to divide Shakespeare scholars right down the line between love and hatred, Romeo + Juliet is a visually stunning show that never quite manages to mold its craftsmanship with a winning adaptation of its source material.3 fish tanks out of 5",Romeo + Juliet
32,Red-125,The movie that made Claire Danes a star,9,19 June 2014,"Romeo + Juliet (1996) was directed by Baz Luhrmann. Luhrmann is know for his cutting-edge approach to filmmaking, and R + J is no exception. He's updated the setting of Shakespeare's play from Renaissance Verona to contemporary Verona, Florida. However, he's kept Shakespeare's language. Other directors have used the same technique, but I haven't seen a Shakespeare play in a modern setting that is this loud, this noisy, and this filled with primary colors. It's a determinedly modern film, despite the language.To make this concept work, Luhrmann needed the right actors. Leonardo DiCaprio did well enough as Romeo. He was 21 when the film was made, and still had a slender, youthful charm. I think he should keep his day job, though. I'm not eager to watch him play Shakespeare on the stage.By contrast, Claire Danes is the perfect Juliet. From the minute we set eyes on her, we say, ""This is Juliet."" Danes portrays both the strength and vulnerability that define Juliet. (We tend to think of Juliet as a victim, and she is. However, she's not just a victim. She's a tough, tenacious young woman who struggles fiercely against tremendous odds, and almost wins.)Danes was only 16 when R + J was shot, but she was already a seasoned actor. However, it was Luhrmann's film that made her a star. After that, there was no stopping her. I believe she would be extremely successful acting Shakespeare on the stage. Think of her as Lady MacBeth. Danes could goad a husband into killing his king, and she would make everyone in the theater believe that she could do it.The other actors in the film ranged from competent to excellent. I would single out the outstanding work of Harold Perrineaus as Mercutio. When he says, ""A plague on both your houses,"" he makes you understand that he means it.R + J has a modest 6.9 IMDb rating. My guess is that it was too old-fashioned for people who wanted a traditional action film, and too wide a stretch for people who wanted classic Shakespeare. I think the movie deserves more than 6.9, and I recommend it. This is a film that will work much better on a large screen than a small screen. Police helicopters, and views from helicopters, will lose some of their power if not seen on a large screen. On the other hand, the film is noisy and drenched with color. If that's not to your taste, the movie might work better on a small screen, where you are somewhat removed from the immediacy of the action.If you don't like Shakespeare, or if you don't like modern-version Shakespeare, here's my suggestion. See the film, and fast forward through the scenes that don't include Juliet. When Claire Danes is on the screen, watch carefully.",Romeo + Juliet
33,filipemanuelneto,A modern movie with archaic dialogues does not work.,5,9 February 2017,"Changing or using material from Shakespeare always requires courage and maturity. He's just the greatest British playwright of all time. Baz Luhrmann had this courage and much more, in a film that updates the most famous love story ever, bringing it to our time, to a great seaside town. This may displease the purists but its not original. This has happened to other stories by other authors. However, this film has the characteristic of keeping, almost in full, the original dialogues of Shakespeare. I confess that I really enjoyed listening to them, but there is a natural nasty discrepancy between the Renaissance text and the modern environment, they disagree with each other for the most obvious reasons and this damages the film. If the idea was to bring the story to modern times the most natural solution would have been to adapt the dialogues, but if the option were to keep Shakespeare's text untouched, the best would be a period film. Mixing both concepts did not work out.The film features Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in the lead roles. DiCaprio was still enjoying his stage as a ""handsome movie boy"", while Danes was just a beautiful unknown face to a Juliet who wanted to be naive and young. In fact, this actress employed very little in this film beyond her physical beauty, for she always sounded unconvincingly and never really seemed to be in love. The scenarios are quite curious and full of exaggerations. The Capulet house could be the mansion of any new-wealthy businessman, with its tacky décor and kitsch furnishings. These elements are also visible in the family mausoleum, with all the candles and neon crosses. In the middle of all, Danes and DiCaprio stand out for the sobriety of their costumes. Harold Perrineau probably gives us the most controversial performance, turning Mercutio into an African-American transvestite, full of glitter. Pete Postlethwaite did quite well as Father Laurence, as Miriam Margoyles in the maid role. The soundtrack wisely uses some pieces of classical music, but this doesn't harmonize with the modern pieces that were used as well.",Romeo + Juliet

I haven't seen this movie in so long so I decided to rewatch it again.The film (which uses alot of quotes) stars Leonardo Di Caprio and Claire Danes who play the star crossed lovers Romeo(played by Di Caprio from my all time favourite movie Titanic)and Juliet(played by an unrecognizable yet fresh looking Claire Danes from Stardust donning a brown wig)who meet at the Gala and fall in love. But with Juliet's restricted parents will she ever meet her Romeo again?Bottom line this movie is OK I guess if your a fan of Baz Luhrmann's over the top speed up movements. However my main problem is with all the poetic like quotes that the actors use like I mentioned before,I dunno it can be very annoying at times,yet Claire and Leo did a tremendous job as the two cross lovers who marry eventually and of course tragedy strikes.Spoilers aheadRomeo gets poisoned and Juliet(who cannot live without him)grabs his gun and shoots herself and dies in the church with him.Overall it wasn't my cup of tea and the ending was terrible so i'm giving it a 5.9/10. Also keep an eye out for Paul Rudd(yes Ant Man himself)and Jamie Kennedy(sporting pink hair).",Romeo + Juliet

For my ninth grade english class, I am currently studying William Shakespeare's tragic play Romeo + Juliet in both modern and old english versions.  Now I first heard about Romeo + Juliet back in fourth grade when I was 10 years old.I didn't know what it was about at the time, so I asked my cousin (who was in ninth grade, but graduated in 1999) what it was about.  She told me it was about two teenagers from two feuding families who meet and fall in love. They soon enough get married, but all that ends tragically when they commit suicide.  As a result of their deaths, the two feuding families agree to peace.Now I didn't get a chance to see it in the theater, so I patiently waited until it debuted on Cinemax a few months after it was released.  Let me just say it was amazing!  I had never seen a more beautiful film.Baz Luhrmann's updated version of the play is absolutely stunning.  What really surprised me about it was that it was set in present day Verona Beach, California.  They drove around in cars, instead of riding on horses and instead of fighting with swords, they fight with guns.  All of this was good.  One thing surprised me though, it contained it's original dialogue. Now many films that are updates of the play, don't contain the original dialogue.  10/10",Romeo + Juliet

The storyline is a modern day take on the Shakespearean story in Los Angeles where two rival gangs face off and the children of the gang's leader fall in love causing a toxic situation to only get worse. This movie is directed by Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge!) and stars Leonardo DiCaprio (The Departed), Claire Danes (Homeland), John Leguizamo (Spawn), Pete Postlethwaite (The Usual Suspects), Paul Rudd (Ant-man), Brian Dennehy (First Blood), Paul Sorvino (Goodfellas) and M. Emmet Walsh (Bladerunner). The style of this film is magical in itself even outside the storyline. The entire presentation and plot of the legendary tale is very well told and unfolds uniquely and unpredictably even if everyone knows the story. The action scenes and shootouts are awesome as is the dialogue and soundtrack. The film just oozes style and fun. This is a movie you have to watch every time it is on and belongs both in your movie and music collection.

That's not really a knock so much as an observation.It's certainly visually impressive, and an intriguing and fresh spin on one of Shakespeare's most widely adapted works, but the actors deliver the admittedly tricky dialog with all the eloquence of someone speaking Klingon with a mouthful of mashed potatoes.Like the president himself, I don't know that this Clinton-era adaptation still holds up as something ""cool"", but if it has worked as a gateway to Shakespeare for Gen X then I suppose that's not a bad legacy.",Romeo + Juliet

I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I might've on this viewing, but it is still a film I'd recommend for sure - it's very good.I'm yet to see a bad - heck, even a just mildly good - film from Leonardo DiCaprio, which remains the case after this. It's probably the weakest performance I've seen from DiCaprio so far, though that's just through process of elimination as he's still impressive here as Romeo. Claire Danes (Juliet) merits props, also.John Leguizamo (Tybalt) is the pick of the rest of the cast, which also includes the likes of Paul Sorvino, Miriam Margolyes and Paul Rudd. Speaking of the casting, apparently 14-year-old Natalie Portman was originally cast to star alongside DiCaprio (then 21... dodgy!).I love the modern day set up and how they bring this famous tale to life in it, though I do think the choice to use Shakespearean dialogue was perhaps the wrong call. It's not like I didn't appreciate it, but it does feel a bit forced and unnatural at times - still cool that they did it, mind.",Romeo + Juliet

I wasn't expecting the original dialogue and it took a bit to get used to.Leo steals and captivates every scene that he's in though; so young, so cute and so talented, just amazing and it was through him that I eventually got into the movie. It's a very modern MTV-ish sort of retelling set in the violent, hip netherworld of Verona beach where the gun-toting Montague and the Capulet families battle for power and territory. At times this felt like a Quentin Tarentino movie in its visual style, cool music and random bizarreness. Great performances all-round but especially from Harold Perrineau, Romeo's gender bending friend and John Leguizamo as his arch rival. The big battle between these three is when the movie really took off ""a plague on both your houses"" and the last half an hour is captivating as our star-crossed lovers meet their tragic destiny all because of stupid UPS. 9/20/14",Romeo + Juliet
44,MissSimonetta,Visually bold and very 1990s take on R&J,8,13 March 2013,"I'll admit it: the first time I saw this film in high school I despised it. I found it so ridiculous, so over-the-top that I could barely believe that anyone could take it seriously. I wondered how anyone could think this film was even close to touching the greatness of the 1968 Romeo and Juliet, which is one of the most beautiful films ever made. I'm in college now, and for my Shakespeare on Film class, I had to watch this again. And this time I found myself enjoying it! Not that I still don't have issues with it, but it's much more striking and moving than I remember.The film's style is very over-the-top. Scenes such as the Capulet and Montague boys at the gas station or Lady Capulet conversing with Juliet about checking out Paris at the ball are played to almost cartoonish extremes. Every image on screen pops with color. The first time I saw the film I found it all garish and much too 1990s, but now I find there's a strange beauty to it. It's as far from the lush Italian setting of the 1968 film as you could get, but it's cool in its own way and there's a ton of motifs, such as the constant use of religious images which contrast with the violent acts committed by the characters. The music is pretty good too, especially ""Kissing You"".The acting is mostly competent. Claire Danes makes a radiant Juliet, girlish and passionate. Other highlights are Harold Perrineau as Mercutio (the scene where he's performing in drag kills me every time) and Pete Postelthwaite as Friar Laurence. The only actor I had any problem with was our Romeo. Leonardo DiCaprio is handsome and passionate, but the way he delivers a lot of his lines bothers me. His delivery doesn't do the words justice at all.I still think the 1968 version is the superior film, but I'm glad I saw this again. It's a beautiful film, if only a little-- okay, very over-the-top. But still, it's worth checking out.",Romeo + Juliet
45,gcd70,Pure art and infinitely watchable,7,30 May 2008,"Is Baz Luhrmann a master artist? Perhaps so. After his flamboyant, colourful and often riotous debut with ""Strictly Ballroom"", which dazzled many audiences and captured the heart of Australian humour, many would have said yes. Now it seems that goes double after his latest creation, especially for this film lover.I must say ""Strictly Ballroom"" did not exactly floor me when I saw it first, my expectations being higher than my appreciation. In hindsight though I can see what a clever stroke of originality it was. This time Luhrmann has boldly remade ""William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet"", and again my expectations were high. Yet this time they were completely fulfilled.Mr. Luhrmann has fashioned an incredible piece of cinema, modernising the old bard's famous tragedy and proving that it is truly timeless. His flamboyance and flair again shows, and early on in the film our director almost over indulges with his little extravagances. Then again the opening scenes do rather set the mood for what is a fantastic eye-fest of colour and light as we are treated to superlative sets, incredible art direction and magnificent costumes form Kym Barrett. In fact it is ingenious that the poetry of the visual goes hand in hand with the original, virtually unaltered text. of the heart rending play.Renowned editor Jill Bilcock (""Evil Angels"") does a marvellous job, as does cinematographer Donald McAlpine, brilliantly capturing some stunning, innovative shots of Luhrmann's gorgeous action. This is pure art, infinitely watchable.Finally there is the cast, who can make or break a movie in which acting is of paramount import. And they make it! Leonardo Di Caprio is the ideal Romeo, and his dramatic scenes are truly convincing and very strong, making us believe all his anguish and sorrow. Fabulous too is pretty Juliet, the thoroughly charming and captivating Claire Danes who has no trouble making us believe that she would surely die for her beloved Romeo. The support is tops too, with John Leguizamo especially sinister as Tybalt, Juliet's cousin and ""Prince of Cats"". Romeo's good friend Mercutio is played well by Harold Perrineau, with Jesse Bradford as Balthasar (Romeo's aide) and Paul Rudd as the dashing Paris who would woo Juliet if she would have him. Miriam Margoyles is most enjoyable as young Juliet's nurse-maid, as is Pete Postlethwaite as the priest who tries so desperately to help the star-crossed lovers. The heads of each household, played by Brian Dennehy and Christina Pickles (as the Montagues) and Paul Sorvino and Diane Venora (Capulets), have little to do, but they do impress in the few scenes they have.Please go and see this at the cinema.........................now!Wednesday, February 12, 1997 - Waverley Pinewood CinemaLuhrmann's elaborate, colourful, in your face interpretation of Shakespeare's timeless tragedy was bold to say the least. But it comes off! All the visual splendour loses a lot in the transition to the small screen, but as a piece of entertainment it is still quite a work.All technical credits, including cinematography, editing, set design and costumes, are outstanding, and the vibrant pop soundtrack adds aural colour. Acting is the film's strongest suit with DiCaprio and Danes leading the way, both giving emotionally strong showings. The support cast also deliver with special mention to John Leguizamo as the obsessive Tybalt and Pete Postlethwaite as Friar Lawrence.I strongly recommend a trip to the cinema for this or any Baz Luhrmann flick.Saturday, December 27, 1997 - Video",Romeo + Juliet
46,a_chinn,Highly accessible and exuberant Shakespeare adaptation,8,27 May 2017,"Wildly fun adaptation of William Shakespeare's play by writer/director Baz Luhrmann. Changing the setting of Shakespeare's plays for film adaptations isn't a new thing. It had previously been done as musicals, westerns, samurai films, gangster pictures, indie dramas about street hustlers, teen comedies, teen dramas, and so on and so forth, but none of those films brought the exuberance and audacity as this film. Set in a Venice Beach-like setting between two feuding wealthy business family empires, Brian Dennehy as Ted Montague and Paul Sorvino as Fulgencio Capulet, with their star cross lover children, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, in roles that really put their stars on the Hollywood map, at the center of the drama. The film faithfully follows the source material's story and all of the dialogue is taken straight from the play, but the dialogue is amazingly accessible and understandable from the actors speaking the lines in a very naturalistic manner. Laurence Olivier was actually criticized in his day for delivering lines in too naturalistic of a manner and not in the traditional more sing-song of manner, which Kenneth Branagh took even further, but this film puts that on a whole new level. Actors here are gangsters, street punks, and thugs and deliver their lines as such, but their words are accessible in a way I'd never seen before that retained Shakespeare's original words. In some ways, it's kind of like Martin Scorsese's ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" where most all of the characters spoke as if they were off the mean streets of Brooklyn. In both cases it served to connect the characters and stories to modern audiences and crate less of a distance between the two. The film also drips of 1990s cool, with a very hip soundtrack and many fashions of the day (with a hint of Elizabethan). The film features a strong cast that also includes Harold Perrineau, Pete Postlethwaite, Paul Rudd, Vondie Curtis- Hall, M. Emmet Walsh, Jamie Kennedy, and a memorable Vincent Laresca. But the real start is Bad Luhrmann, who's combination of visuals, sound, and editing created a film so full of energy and audacity that it stands apart from any other Shakespearian film adaptation and is something truly unique. My only complaint about the film is that the modernization of the story also makes Romeo and Juliet's drama and romance seem overly trite and self important in a way that I found annoying. To the teens and teen audiences, I'm sure their love and feelings are very real and serious and worthy of live & death, but at the same time these are kids and they really shouldn't be taking themselves all that seriously. Leo and Clair might as well be the self important teens from ""13 Reasons Why"" for how overly serious they take themselves. Still, I don't think middle age men were Luhrmann's target audience here (i.e. me), so my criticism is probably not valid (i.e. I'm just being a cranky old man). Still, this is a wonderfully original film that demands multiple viewings.",Romeo + Juliet

Great casting, great performances-but the movie left me flat.I am not sure ""updating"" this movie was a GREAT idea.

49,Movie-ManDan,The Best Modern Day Shakespeare Adaptation.,10,19 February 2015,"Flamboyant and overly-fashionable director, Baz Luhrmann's breakout film has become a sensation in the world of romance and Shakespeare. He casts some recognizable stars with young upstarts that would dominate the screen for years to come. Luhrmann brings the timeless story to the present in such a way that has some people loving it and others hating it.Taking place in the present, everybody are surfers/punks. It is cool to see Shakespeare being to hip and cool. The guns, cars, music, and costumes really appeal to this generation's teen.Romeo & Juliet is probably the best known Elizabethan play as well as the best known love story ever told. For those that don't know the plot, Romeo Montague's (DiCaprio) and Juliet Capulet's (Danes) families have always had violent feuds in Verona, Italy. As young teenagers, they meet, fall in love, get married, then kill themselves because each think the other is dead after they wake up with convincing evidence--all over a three day period. People that don't like the story hate how young they are, how quickly they get married, and how easily they commit suicide. First of all, the play is 500 years old. Second of all, that is what Shakespeare wanted people to think about. Kids their age and younger always say they are in love and they want to get married. Don't go saying they are too young to fall in love and get married when that thought crossed your mind! As for the suicide, it fits. Dying to be be with the person you love is the most romantic thing of all. I can't help but feel heartbroken when they die. Aside from that, their deaths were the only way for the Montagues and Capulets to restore peace among themselves and all of Verona. When I first read this play and studied it in high school, I was one of the only people that liked the ending because I thought it just ""fit."" I had no idea why for the longest time. Now I know.Romeo is regarded as one of DiCaprio's best known roles, but not one of his best-known performances. I would easily say it is in his top five. Everybody else in this is not quite as well known as Leo, but they shine in this and in their other movies. Most of the criticism I've seen from this are from the performances themselves. They say everybody has no idea how to act Elizabethan or how to deliver Shakespeare lines. Roger Ebert said Pete Postelthwaite was the only exception because he was the one that knew how to deliver the lines. Sure he is a talented actor, but nothing is entirely wrong with the performances. The actors talked as if they were thinking it, not with a rhythm. Sir Laurence Olivier was the first actor to break the rule of Shakespeare being rhythmic and natural. So the acting really isn't bad. People were just unused to seeing these Hollywood giants saying things they can't understand.4/4",Romeo + Juliet

It even made the original look like a masterpiece! But when I continue watching it, it actually gets better and better, but not by a whole lot.First, I probably like this film because of the modern update. I didn't like the play that Shakespeare wrote but this one actually manages the descents for me to recommend it. This film is loud, exaggerated, and bombastic! At first, those were meant to be bad things in the movie but as it progresses, I liked it.The acting in the film is much better in this film than the original (by Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes). I also liked the bizarre set pieces and songs throughout the film. It gives itself a hint of originality to it. I even thought the ending was much better.I'm not a fan of the play.

Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, Harold Perrineau, Pete Postlethwaite, John Leguizamo, Dash Mihok, Miriam Margolyes, Paul Sorvino, Diane Venora, Paul Rudd, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Jesse Bradford. (PG-13)Shakespeare's tale of doomed star-crossed lovers is updated to the modern age, transported to the Miami-esque city of Verona Beach, and given a gaudy MTV-style makeover so it can vulgarly pander to the youth market (coming up just short of giving the couple a crass gossip-rag nickname like ""Rom-liet""). A misguided conceit resulting in a headache-inducing mess that encapsulates the words of the Bard but produces none of the poetry; it may not desecrate the text, but the dialogue rarely comes to life coming out of the mouths of this cast (Postlethwaite being the chief exception, playing Father Laurence instead of Friar Laurence...even though he's still called a friar at one point because, well, that's the sort of care that was put into this ""adaptation""). DiCaprio's star qualities can't be denied and Perrineau's flamboyance is well-suited for Mercutio, but it's all drowned in hyperactive editing, lurid camera filters, sledgehammer symbolism, and tonal whiplash. Does feature a surprisingly effective soundtrack considering the eclectic mishmash of genres--buy the CD, skip the movie. Full title is ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet,"" which is equal parts laughable and depressing, and less suitable than it would have been to release ""Jane Austen's Clueless"" the previous year.

53,dunmore_ego,More Comedy Than Tragedie.,6,13 June 2006,"All I'm saying is: Leonardo DiCaprio should stop being prettier than his female co-stars. In *Romeo and Juliet*, snub-nosed Claire Danes bravely steps up to out-femme Leo's manly prettiness. And fails. Leonardo is Romeo (kinda archly poetic, no?) and Claire is his Juliet. Shakespeare's retelling of Ovid's *Pyramus and Thisbe* is retold with creative conceptualizing and high-voltage visuals by Australian thunderboy, director Baz Luhrmann, as an urban gang battle with a decidedly MTV-ian thrust. Alas, Luhrmann's noble idealism in re-inventing the Bard's most famous play for a generation weaned on music videos and boy bands unfortunately falls on ears deaf to irony, sarcasm, double entendre, punning, words larger than six letters and intelligence. Which pretty much rules out Shakespeare's *oeuvre*. Throwing out major portions of text (""Text? What's that?"" mumbles Generation X), yet elocuting the remainder verbatim, performances are unevenly astounding, for when the actors can stop shouting at each other in the manner of Entertainment Tonight hosts declaring showbiz headlines, their occasional fluidity creates pockets of crystal clarity that move with the rhythms Shakespeare intended. Alas, it is unsustainable for most of them. Thrown into this mix of varying talents, Dash Mihok, Jamie Kennedy (it was all I could do to stop imagining them prefacing everything with ""Yo yo yo"") and DiCaprio stand out like ailing speechaphobics against the menacing fluidity of John Leguizamo, the simple sincerity of Claire Danes and the authoritative Shakespearean veteran, Pete Postlethwaite (still pushing 55, as he was 20 years ago).As Mercutio, cross-dressing Harold Perrineau steals the show in his mini-skirt, bra and command of Shakespearean rhythm. And look at those legs!The precursor to all Chick Flicks, you know the old story: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, girl drinks poison, boy kills himself, girl wakes up, girl kills herself. Ain't love grand?",Romeo + Juliet
54,pyrocitor,Beach boys speaking Shakespeare... how weird is that?,5,7 April 2005,"William Shakespeare's classic play is updated to a modern context, but still using the original, Old English text. It's a bold move on the part of director Baz Luhrmann, who brings a hyperkinetic, choppy editing style to the film, as if to never let the viewers catch their breaths. And for the most part, using the modern day context works, helping to clarify what some of the more tricky lines actually mean by showing it in familiar circumstances which audiences can identify with.Despite the fact that the relationship of the two lovers, who were doomed not to last together is the focus of the movie, neither lover gives a very strong or charismatic performance. DiCaprio makes a good enough Romeo, although he seems to be content to coast along on his looks and fame, and doesn't invest much energy into creating a well developed character. Claire Danes is miscast, and out of place. She makes a dull, uninteresting Juliet, putting next to no energy into the role, as if she would rather not be there at all. She seems to struggle delivering her Shakespearian lines, not to mention giving little sense that she has any idea what she's saying at all. It's sad that the lovers, the center of the film, couldn't find a way to act more enthusiastic and involving. Because so much of the movie focuses on their drab relationship, the film drags in many parts. (although Luhrmann seems determined to throw in a gunfight after every intimate scene just to stop audiences from nodding off in their seats)The supporting characters are where performances improve, letting the scenes with characters other than the two lovers present much more interesting. John Leguizamo makes a wonderfully vicious Tybalt, yet has the insight to occasionally give an uncertain look in the midst of cheap fighting and evil deeds, as if he is unsure what he is doing is morally right. Pete Posthlewaite is a high point of casting; his gruff but kind Friar Lawrence is wonderfully acted, and he manages to make clear what he is saying, even to those who might not understand Shakespearian dialect. Harold Perrineau makes a flamboyant Mercutio, unafraid of dressing in women's clothing to attract attention, or go on a twenty minute long tirade (that's an exaggeration, but only slightly, Mercutio goes on forever!) without actually saying anything of importance.It was an interesting idea, and the modern day context for the most part works, helping audiences to identify with the circumstances, even if it does seem a little odd to see beach boys with pink hair and Hawaiian shirts spouting Shakespearian dialog. But Luhrmann's jumpy, incredibly energetic film style, combined with his seeming determination to turn the classic romance into an action movie, with numerous gunfights, gets tiring, and eventually deters more than complements the film. And with two dull, uninteresting performances from the lovers, the focus of the film, it's no surprise that despite Luhrmann's unquenchable energy, the film drags on and fails to retain interest.-5/10",Romeo + Juliet

57,Stampsfightclub,A powerful idea exploits the dark mind of Shakespeare,9,24 January 2010,"When Romeo Montague (Di Caprio) falls in love with Juliet Capulet (Danes) their families' rivalries escalate in the fair city of Verona.William Shakespeare's tragic love play gets a dramatic current world make over in this vigorous and boisterous film that at 14 years old is still relevant, still powerful and will continue to be used in education to get the points of powerful politics and freestyle love across.At the time of its release we were in a state of film where violence was everything. Pulp Fiction had dazzled and outraged people all over the world a few years previously, True Romance in comparison to this 1996 picture had a brave love at first sight plot with bloody violence that Baz Luhrmann capitalized on to make a brutally fine adaptation.The film opens tremendously, capturing the whole film in essence with a fast montage of shots and an anticipation of what is to come. The TV fading away with a news report is the last thing you would expect from a Shakespeare work but what is more unusual is what is to follow.Pulling up at a gas station members of the Capulet family have a violent confrontation in a shoot out with members from the Montague household. Guns, gas and gross misconduct may be as violent and as the famous playwright intended and to implement his words into this modern telling is a startling contrast and personally, I believe this is such an important technique to making this film so exciting and universally unique.What the director has done is comprehend modern trends. He followed the trend of current cinema so that we could all appreciate the context and by taking the words of Shakespeare has made it easier to comprehend, a startling technique that has been such a beneficiary to school exams and also for pure viewing pleasure. Whilst it has been many years since I have read the play and studied it for my G.C.S.E's I recall watching and being baffled and now more years on I can still appreciate how powerful and how spoken this picture is.The work that has been achieved here is spoken through its various stars with Leonardo Di Caprio made a sex symbol and Claire Danes going on with more romantic roles. Their first meeting in the film through a fish tank is beautifully choreographed, a section that doesn't feel too cheesy thanks to the calm playing of the song 'Kissing You'.The love at first sight ideology has been worked to death in modern cinema in romantic comedy dramas and here it is tackled as in Shakespeare's mind, as pure and as lust that is crossed with startling rivalry.The film boasts a courageous soundtrack revelling in gorgeous settings that do justice to a story so strong, and yet so dark. This is a great film, taking a tragic story and turning into a modern telling of love repression and violence.",Romeo + Juliet
58,Libretio,"Radical, but perhaps not radical enough?",5,28 January 2000,"WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S ROMEO & JULIET Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSWith its contemporary setting and rough, insistent visuals, Baz Luhrmann's reinterpretation of ""Romeo and Juliet"" adds a very 90s spin to the Bard's tale, targeting the youth market (notoriously disenchanted with the works of Shakespeare) with an aggressive, in-yer-face style. As such, the film is hip and sexy, and Old Bill's yarn has much to offer, but while Claire Danes' Juliet is the very picture of grace and innocence, Leonardo di Caprio - undoubtedly a fine young actor - seems out of place as Romeo, and he's upstaged in the good looks department by Paul Rudd as Paris. There's a show-stopping dance number (part of a drug-induced hallucination) at the masked ball where the two lovers first meet, and the second half of the film is powered by a raw emotional intensity, but a truly radical revision of the play might have involved the scrapping of Shakespeare's text altogether and the substitution of 90s dialogue to match the visuals.",Romeo + Juliet
59,rebeljenn,forbidden love revisited,3,23 March 2006,"'Romeo + Juliet' stars Leonardo DiCaprio in an early role as Romeo, before Titanic. This film is an updated version of Shakespeare's play. The good thing about this film is that it brings a classic play into an easy way for our generation to understand the basic theme and story behind it while being as true to the play as it can, giving it a modern face-lift and having it take place in Verona Beach, Florida instead of Italy. Despite using the classic scenario about a forbidden and romantic love in modern times, the original play still appealed to me more, and I also preferred the 1969 film based on the original story. Still, it's not bad, but it is not good either.",Romeo + Juliet
60,perfectbond,Very stylish,7,28 October 2003,"In this modernist interpretation of the Bard's classic, the fine performances of the leads Romeo, Juliet, Tybalt and Friar Laurence, are overshadowed somewhat by the stylized update of the classic setting. Still, one must admire the verve and audacity of the director for attempting and executing successfully, for the most part, his vision. However, I'll never forget my elderly Shakespeare professor's expression of indignation when she discussed the film version ""with the cars and guns."" I myself found the film moving to the point of tears so to me it was an unqualified success. Recommended, 8/10.",Romeo + Juliet
61,Hayden-86055,Well shot but lacking modern take,6,29 December 2020,"Starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Romeo, Claire Danes as Juliet and Harold Perrineau as Mercutio. To my knowledge none of them were classically trained Shakespearean actors but it's a modern take and they handle the almost all Shakespearian dialogue to a fair standard as well as having good body language.The plot sticks fairly closely to the original play with a few differences: Swords being swapped for guns to exist within the modern setting, some Capulets are changed into Montagues and vice versa, the character of Friar John is removed and Paris' death is omitted. Minor changes that don't effect the story too much. Personally I didn't enjoy the film too much, although I'm not a huge fan of Shakespeare in general but I at least recognised it as a well made film.6/10: Good",Romeo + Juliet
62,Darkside-Reviewer,I defy you rating stars,7,12 October 2019,I first saw this movie in highschool while studying Shakespeare in English literature and I was blown away by it's modernised visuals without compromising the original text such as switching swords for guns and having each one inscribed with the name of the blade in the text Tybalts gun is inscribed with Rapier on it Mercutios is inscribed with dagger so when they put up there swords to fight no text or dialogue is changed just the visuals while the movies modern theme's give this classic story a different interpretation while not changing the original text.There are a few scenes that are a bit weird such as Mercutio cross dressing for the party at the Capulet mansion and Romeo dropping acid and having bad trip at the party but honestly they don't take away from the movies seriousness they just add a bit of comedy and weirdness to an otherwise great movie.The story is pretty much the same as in the book word for word only a few minor differences and having visuals to illustrate the scenes and bring it to life like on stage in a play with a much bigger budget and the advantage of movie editing for the best performances and even when you know how the movie is going to play out and how it will end it still surprises you.The cast do an amazing job of bringing the characters to life breathing new life into them Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes have great chemistry on screen and really bring the star crossed lovers story of true love to a modern audience also notably John Leguizamo plays Tybalt and really he does a great job at bringing this classic villain to life with a cunning and evil voice and stylish movements worthy of the name prince of cats.I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys this classic story of love and loss or just as a romantic love movie.,Romeo + Juliet
63,rossrobinson,fantastic,10,19 November 2003,"Romeo and Juliet has got to be one of the romatic movies ever. This movie was made in 1996, starring Leonardo Di Caprio and Claire Danes. This movie is based on one of William Shakespeare's stories. i give this movie 10 out of 10.",Romeo + Juliet
64,OriginalMovieBuff21,"Come on now, make some dialogue that's worth understanding",5,30 April 2006,"Romeo and Juliet is based on Shakespeare's famous tragedy about two lovers torn between their two families vicious hatred towards each other based in present day Verona. The movie was pretty boring to me actually. I'm glad the movie followed the play really well, but still it was annoying hearing the dialogue that was used 400 years ago. If you wanted to make a better film, you could've made it like the film ""O"" based on Othello. O didn't have that dialogue and it still was quite an enjoyable film. Overall, Leonardo's great looks and the big cast didn't make this an entertaining film and that goes along with the dialogue too! Hedeen's Outlook: 5/10 *+ D",Romeo + Juliet
65,phenomynouss,A surprisingly original idea,8,4 October 2006,"In my personal opinion, I believe Shakespeare's writing is way too obscure and out there, and think those people who say ""Shakespeare wrote for the common people"" and such are either blatantly lying to us schoolchildren, or I can only cringe in terror at what plays written for educated people must have sounded like.This movie doesn't change the dialect or dialog of the movie, and gives it a weird sort of artistic modern setting, which makes it not only a surprising and original twist, but makes it much more watchable to see a timeless tale truly tested with its claim to timelessness. Even if it took place in the year 3010 AD, it'd still be the same.I love the way the adults on the newscasts and police speak, and the way the police officer at the end of the movie scolds the Capulets and Montagues, and the beginning scene, with the Montague nerds biting their thumbs at the Capulets was amusing.The guy who plays Mercutio (I think he also plays Link in the Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions) is spellbinding, and John Leguizamo is equally spectacular in this movie.What keeps this movie from a 9 or a 10 in my opinion is the two lead characters played abysmally by Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. DiCaprio, normally a great actor, sounds like he's just memorized the lines and is reciting them like a schoolchild forced to read them aloud in class--lifeless, with little to no emotion, and an apparent lack of understanding as to what he is saying.Claire Danes is even worse, delivering lines in such an awkward manner as to make me cringe. It sounds literally like a giggly, bubbly school girl reading from a script for the first time while distracted by something else.Another thing which surprisingly irritated me was the SCREAMING. In many scenes, there was mindless screaming at the hands of Juliet's mother and maid, especially that scene where Romeo is at Juliet's window, and the maid calls for her, and Danes (awkwardly) says ""By and by I come"", the maid's line is literally *takes deep breath*:JULIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET!for at the very least, 5-10 seconds longThere's a lot more screaming at the maid's hand and Juliet's mother, though thankfully it's limited just to that scene and scarcely any other. But it is SERIOUSLY annoying having her scream like that when Juliet is CLEARLY shouting back ""By and by I come""",Romeo + Juliet
66,Rickting,It doesn't always work but it's a beautiful and interesting take on the play,7,24 September 2011,"Romeo and Juliet set in a modern day urban environment with modern updates to all of the events but still with the original dialogue. OK then. Believe it or not, despite missteps, this adaptation mostly works and will finally interest teenagers in Shakespeare which certainly isn't a bad thing. It's better than Gnomeo and Juliet Thankfully! Baz Luhrmann makes the film visually stunning, and manages to fill it with gripping action scenes and touching romantic moments. A mixture of a music video, teen romance, gritty urban drama and Shakespeare, this will be a bit jarring to many (Myself included) but the ambition of the movie is to be admired. Claire Danes is OK but a bit annoying, while Leonardo DiCaprio owns the movie. The cinematography is stunning, and the film never stops being lovely to look at.It's not perfect though. Elements of the play such as the scene where Lord Capulet is angry with Juliet and Romeo and Mecrutio's friendship are poorly handled, and the endless visual dazzle, beautiful as it is, can send the film into style over substance territory. The presentation of Romeo and Juliet and other things in the play is beautifully updated for modern audiences and while the repeated action scenes can leave drama in the sidelines, the tragic ending still has a lot of emotional punch. It's not the best Shakespeare movie of all time, but I can't dislike an urban drama which still channels Shakespeare so effectively.7/10",Romeo + Juliet

68,PyroSikTh,A Fever Dream of Teenage Intensity,7,1 April 2021,"Like many who saw this as a teenager, this was a movie that felt like the most sophisticated thing I'd ever seen, while also being accessible enough to my immature brain. And that's pretty much how I'm going to judge it today.This is Shakespeare. It's as much Shakespeare as any other adaptation over the centuries. And yet Baz Luhrmann went in with a very specific approach, not only to modernise it while maintaining the poetic dialogue, but to also make it enticing for a teenage audience; the audience most arguably suited to the tale of Romeo and Juliet. It's chock full of the same hallmarks of modern day teen dramas; beautiful teens from wealthy families, sudden and passionate love affairs, with a dash of violence and murder, capped off with an emotional gut-punch or two. It's a tale quite literally as old as time: Star-crossed lovers finding each other against all odds, fighting to keep what they have against the forces around them, and the near-miss of longevity, like every Rom-Com airport scene. It's the type of story that has endured so long precisely because it appeals to us at the most emotional and vulnerable time of our lives, speaking to how we feel about the world around us. It's a hormonal barrage of narrative cues.So Luhrmann takes this timeless classic, and decides to transplant it into a modern day setting to appeal to modern day teenagers. Or at least, the teenagers of the late 90s. You could probably trace a line from all late-90s fashions back to this movie, either creating the stereotypical aesthetic of the time, or merely doubling down and reinforcing it. This movie is garish. It opens with a newscast acting as the narrator, followed by quick-cuts and flybys of a city centre framed by two imposing skyscrapers, each with the name of a respected mafia-like family conglomerate plastered over the roof. Between them is a giant statue of Jesus himself, almost as tall as these skyscrapers. It's almost cartoonish in its aesthetic. We're then introduced to the Montague boys, clad in Hawaiian shirts left open to flap in the wind, riding a bright yellow topless jeep. They pull up to a gas station and encounter the rival Capulet boys, clad in dark blues and leather, with clean-cut facial hair and a menacing glare. If the Montagues gave the instant impression of good guys having fun, the Capulets give the immediate impression of brooding and serious antagonists. After an exchange of insults, they break out in a gun fight. The saturation is turned way up, the camera shakes and zooms uncontrollably, the editing cuts every second or two. It's beautiful and ugly all at the same time, as Tybalt, the Prince of Cats falls on his knees dramatically, pulls out his pistols, attaches an excessive sight, and takes aim at the fleeing Montagues. It's big, it's bombastic, it's completely lacking in subtlety. There's bright colours and shouting, and emphasis put on every footstep and gun cocking. It's so bad. It's so 90s.Fortunately this style isn't maintained throughout the movie's runtime, but it never entirely leaves either. We get another frenetic array to the Capulet party, whereby a sexually-ambiguous Mercutio laces Romeo with Ecstasy creating a fever dream of visuals. And then there's that iconic meet-cute. The meet-cute to end all meet-cutes. And the movie slows to a halt. It remembers this isn't a story about the outlandish gang war between two mafia families, but a story about teenage love. Its garish and frenetic nature gives way to something more brooding and enthralling. Things turn serious, characters start dying, the prospect of marriage and a new life become real entities.Judging this movie literally is a recipe for disaster. Literally it's an over-edited series of scenes full of shouting and bad judgment, about a young boy and girl falling in love immediately, getting married the next day, and then committing suicide over one another a mere four days later. Literally this movie makes no sense. It's ridiculous. But the movie knows that. It's painfully self-aware of how ridiculous this story actually is when you boil it down, so it embraces it. And this is why the prose was kept largely intact: It's poetry. The whole movie is poetry. This isn't a movie about plot points and character development. It's a movie about feelings and moments, about capturing that teenage urgency in a glowing, multi-coloured bottle. I know I had these moments as a teenager, where everything felt like the most important thing ever, where I fell in love with pretty girls without even knowing their names, where anger and joy, love and hate were all so painfully intense. Every scene is bathed in this intensity, including that opening of garish colours and overemphasised sound effects. It's a movie so chock full of hormonal energy it's intoxicating.Leo is still a fairly young and inexperienced actor here, and his ego shines through his performance. He delivers his lines which such ferocity, like he too felt he was participating in the most sophisticated thing he'd ever done. But at this level his line delivery loses all emphasis, causing it all to merge into a mumble of Shakespearian vocabulary. That said, he's just about as perfect for Romeo as you could get. Claire Danes doesn't fare much better, seemingly struggling with the emotions of it all. It's like they were both put on auto-pilot while delivering their lines. Honestly I can't really blame them. Shakespeare's dialogue is in poetic verse, written for a different time with different dialects and slangs. We the audience are encouraged to just feel what's going on rather than follow and dissect every single word spoken. That said there are some genuinely fantastic performances her that prove that dialogue as outdated and wordy as this can be engaging and emotive. Harold Perrineau plays Mercutio with a fire in his eyes, like he poured over the script and accurately pinpointed which words needed more emphasis, and where he could embellish with gestures and intonation. John Leguizamo is also electrifying as Tybalt, grasping the over-the-top antagonism of his character and having fun with it, creating a whole new style of gun-fu to portray Tybalt's apparent fancy fighting style.And of course, I couldn't talk about this movie without talking about the soundtrack, which gave us one of the best Radiohead songs ever written (which is a bold claim, I know). It captures the 90s the same way the rest of the movie does, with OK Computer-era Radiohead, Garbage, Des'ree, Butthole Surfers, and The Cardigans. It's rocky, it's ravey, it's as garish and frenetic as the movie's cinematography, and if you're at all a fan of 90s pop music, this soundtrack is a snapshot of that exact taste. Of course this ages the movie horrendously, but hey, we're approaching the time of 90s nostalgia, so now's the time to embrace it.Romeo + Juliet is an interesting movie to judge, because it's a strictly terrible movie. The modern setting and 16th century dialogue goes together as well you'd imagine, despite some imaginative transpositions (like each gun's brand being a type of blade; Sword 9mm, Dagger .45, Rapier 9mm, or in the case of shotguns; a Longsword). It's so intensely bright and colourful, the editing so frenetic and hard to follow, and the story being somewhat nonsensical by modern standards, but its self-awareness makes up for it, making it all feel deliberate and purposeful. We hold Shakespeare up on a pedestal these days, as some form of high art, but in his time he was basically writing the best soap operas, aimed at entertaining the commoners (the exact same trajectory as actual operas, incidentally, which are nowhere near as sophisticated or intelligent as modern high society would have you believe). With that in mind, and Luhrmann's attempt to make what Shakespeare would've made today (in 1996), I think this movie nails every goal it aims for. It's pure visual poetry, encouraging you to feel the story than follow it intently, blasting you with the intense emotional highs and lows of hormonal teenagedom. I give Romeo + Juliet a bizarrely successful 8/10.",Romeo + Juliet

First of all to add a pop atmosphere and music was a big mistake, because it didn't work at all. Second of all the acting was awful, especially DiCaprio who looked like a student reading out of a boring textbook. Paul Sorvino and Brian Dennehy who I think are both great actors were wasted in cameos, as was John Leguiziamo.

It's perfect, I could list everything, but I'll concentrate on what makes it special. Superb designs, very colorful, for all the sets and costumes that are the result of great ideas demonstrating a lot of imagination. That alone is worth the watch. Imagination was also present in large amount in the translation to modern time. Luhrmann used all kind of artifice to enact the scenario for our delight, but also to make us understand that piece of dramatic literature. Excellent music and score, entrancing, irresistible.The actors. I feel like I have to name them all... even the boys from each family performed exceedingly well. I'll try to be brief and go for the gold. The young Leonardo DiCaprio and the young Claire Danes are the dream protagonist, simple, eager, sincere, emotional... Of the others, I'd say the most striking play came from Harold Perrineau as the energetic Mercutio, and John Leguizamo as the vengeful Tybalt. Of the lesser roles, I have to mention Pete Postlethwaite as Father Laurence, Paul Rudd as the suave Dave Paris, Dash Mihok as Romeo's cousin, and M. Emmet Walsh as the apothecary. Of course all four parents were also excellent.The bad. I would only remove the flashbacks just after the final death scene. It's very minor.The ugly. Nothing.The result. A must for all.

Many great aspect to note on this cinematic masterpiece, the angles they shot at in some cases were crazy in a good way, I highly recommend you watch this, even if you dont like love stories, this ones good!

When the seasoned actors speak, you feel their words, but when the younger cast speak, it's the visuals that carry the feel of the plot. The music is clearly placating the MTV-ish audience and goes too far taking all too well known songs and giving them too important of placement. Torn over to include this review, I give the nod for Baz's vision and his guts in carrying it out.

When I tried to read his work, I needed to often refer to a book which translated words and phrases of that time into modern English. I had to refer to it so many times that it made reading any one of his plays a long, slow and tiresome task. I was very pleased when I heard that a modern remake of Romeo and Juliet was being made, so that I would be able to understand it without translation. I was puzzled and very disappointed when I watched it and it was in the original dialogue! It had already been filmed many times in its original dialogue and 16th century setting.

He obviously means to prove he's a serious actor, but that all goes out the window when you consider the fact that he's been in a movie where Mercutio dresses up like Marilyn Monroe.I won't waste any more time groaning over the terrible acting, because Luhrmann's woeful misplacement of Shakespeare's worst work ever in 1990s California is enough to bemoan this filth.

I got stunned by the power of the actors, the music (one of the best soundtracks of the year), the editing and the direction. I left the theatre with my mouth open and went home thinking a lot about it. I saw it again. And again. I went three times to the cinema to see it. And three years ago, I had a wish of experiencing everything the world of Verona Beach and its two star-crossed lovers had to give: fireworks, lights, coreographed gun fights that look more like ballet dances. This movie influenced me like few movies have. Since then, I remember wishing that someday I took part on the creation of such a world. Now, I have good memories of this movie, and still feel the influence it made on me. But the effect was lost on video. And the really good memory comes from the time I saw it on the theatre. But all isn't lost. The day the DVD arrives to our shores, I know I will experience all the same again... Romeo + Juliet is one of the best movies of the decade, and director Luhrmann is a good hope to the future of sharp movies.

Luhrmann's memorable direction, Danes and DiCaprio's dramatic performances, and the excellent visual designs all manage to ship this tale as a very Shakespeare-styled retelling. The snazzy fashion working with the brilliant picture of the sets and costumes, alongside the classy language including loads of ear-striking lines certainly won't appeal to everyone, but every witness who loves Shakespeare will simply adore the story.It's easy to state that plenty of the lines and actions of most characters in this story can grow increasingly dramatic and unreasonable, which is the element that lowers higher ratings. There's also a handful of scenes that won't make the film very engaging. However, how moving Romeo + Juliet is and the fast pacing will drag you through the whole story and leave you impressed.The film is quick and the acting is very noteworthy, but the engaging detail put into the film will grab the attention of most teens and adults. It's an excellent romance story that ends in tragedy. It doesn't deserve the hateful reviews it gets, but most will understandably enjoy the previous Romeo and Juliet classics more than this one.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Romeo + Juliet
81,stills-6,"Intriguing and clever, but maybe too clever",7,4 June 2000,"I like cross-period staging for Shakespeare - like Ian McKellen's Richard III or Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet. It always gives a good perspective on the strength of the underlying story. It can also be said that it gives the director something to do - like a post-WWI staging of Much Ado About Nothing - other than trot out the same costumes as from the last production.I thought this version was very clever, but maybe more clever than it needed to be. The swimming pool scene (in place of the balcony scene), for example, was an inspired choice. The interaction was much more immediate: standing at a balcony is a scene designed for a stage, not for a movie. But the sense of the scene is also lost. By this time in the movie, the two have already fallen in the deepest love they will ever have (whatever that means - lust is more like it), and the action falls from there. But the play implies much more of a process, instead of proof. The balcony scene is that of two lovers parted by circumstance, both literally and figuratively. The meaning is changed, though subtly, and not necessarily for the better.I didn't like many of the start-stop and fast-forward camera tricks, not because they are a bad idea in themselves, but because the style negates the scenes they were intended to augment. I especially did not like the faux dramatic echoing noises. There's no need for these tricks. I also found the second half of the movie to be rather tame in terms of technique. Most of the shots after the swimming pool scene are rather bland and ordinary. It was as if the director had used up all of his tricks and couldn't think of any others.All I can say is thank God that Shakespeare's language was used. Without the language there is no reason for this movie to even be made - it turns the story from a ludicrous mob war to the intriguing version of RJ it is now.",Romeo + Juliet
82,JoshtheGiant,The Best Story Ever,8,22 December 2005,"The chemistry of Leonardo Dicaprio and Claire Danes, is one of the best for years. They seem made to act together, I hope they will do something more. I have to say if it had not all been in Shakespearian, it would have made it make more sense, half the time you had trouble understanding what there saying, except for Dicaprio, he has a knack for Shakespeare, his performance also shows what he feels and you almost don't have to get his dialogue strait, you can just look at his bodie language. Its Claire Danes best performance since The Rainmaker with Matt Damon. The rest of the actings not so great, but because of Dicaprio and Danes, its definitely worth your two hours of time. So rent it, even if your a Leo hater. I have always thought it annoying that some people will not like an actor, like, Leonardo Dicaprio, or Orlando Bloom, just because there the ones all the girls have a crush on. It's no reason to hate them just because there better looking then you. Great Movie.",Romeo + Juliet
83,lyubitelfilmov,Modernized Shakespeare or Baz Luhrmann's Insanely Beautiful Extravaganza,10,7 October 2020,"Melodrama, tragedy. A screen version of the eponymous and immortal tragedy of the great English playwright William Shakespeare (no plus in the title, naturally), directed by the excellent Australian director Baz Luhrmann, who directed my favorite musical ""Moulin Rouge"". In general, this film adaptation is included in the ""Trilogy of the Red Curtain"" created by the director himself, where, in addition to ""Moulin Rouge"", another picture ""Dancing without Rules"" (in another translation - Strictly by the rules) has also been added, perhaps in the future I will write a review on this picture in order to complete the entire trilogy, but today I want to talk about this enchanting adaptation of Shakespeare. I saw this picture many times - and it brings pleasure again and again, and here is my brief opinion - modernized Shakespeare. It should be stated right away that there are no downsides to this picture, for me personally, but there are controversial and annoying moments, which I will talk about in a separate paragraph. In the meantime, let me focus your attention on the expressive and vivid advantages of this picture.
So, here they are:
1. Immortal love story - a picture in crazy colors and new, modern decorations tells the classic and immortal love story of Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet - children of two warring houses, ready to kill each other at any meeting. Little is known about the history of their enmity, but the consequences of the current confrontation are felt by the inhabitants of the entire city. I think it won't be a surprise to anyone
That their story ends sadly
In order to teach a lesson to the living,
And standing at the graves memorial
Whisper their names unconscious!
This is the lot of the warring houses, but we all know this story perfectly well from school. Beautiful, immensely sensual, passionate love that will live forever. All the heroes of the picture speak in imperishable verses from the original source, which was treated as carefully as they could, only in some places they allowed an outright gag (in terms of the script, naturally). We all know this story, but we are simply unable not to empathize with Romeo and Juliet, because it clings to the most precious thing - to our heart, which is loved as our immortal couple.
2. Scenery, costumes, entourage - the action of the tragedy, director and co-writer Baz Luhrmann brought from Renaissance Italy to America at the end of the twentieth century. Swords have been replaced by pistols, Montagues and Capulets have turned from nobles to mafia clans, and references to other works of the immortal Shakespeare are visible from everywhere on posters and signs. A lot of symbolism, such as the image of the Mother of God on weapons and other things and not only. It is necessary to transfer the action of Shakespeare's tragedies to modern times very carefully, otherwise you can ""get it on the hat"" from fans and admirers of the genius. In my lifetime, I have seen only two examples when the transfer turned out to be successful, this is this picture and ""Coriolanus"" of 2011. Baz Luhrmann used large theatrical sets, which is noticeable that in combination with the verses of the original only enhances the immersion in this story and this entourage. Boldly, brightly, defiantly!
3. Music - frank ""pop"" of the eighties and mid-nineties of the last century, combined with church chants, created an amazing mixture, which is not clear how, but works, especially in conjunction with a brightly colorful and theatrical picture. And the transitions between ""pop"" and church chants are made quite smoothly, so that the viewer has time to switch, because the obvious and symbolic turns of the story are known in advance, but this does not make them less emotional.
4. Finale - the famous sad end of lovers. There is no music, we only hear the words of madly in love hearts, the picture is almost static, the viewer's heart hurts. Silence, interrupted only by a shot, which put an end to this performance. Emotions are overwhelming, even after many views. It is physically impossible to hold back. A dark ending for lovers and a lesson to all the inhabitants of Verona, and to all of humanity. Here, look! What hate leads to! What does anger lead to?
A little about the main characters:
1. Romeo Montecchi performed by Leonardo DiCaprio - a son from an influential family, a handsome young man who fell in love with Juliet - the daughter of Capulet's sworn enemy, which caused joyful moments and bitter disappointments with the most famous and sad ending. Young Leo is so suitable for this role that it is difficult to imagine another candidate. Youthful enthusiasm and a loving heart are available. Bravo Leo!
2. Juliet Capulet performed by Claire Day is the daughter of an influential clan who fell in love with Romeo. A young beauty with famous dreams that she gave herself up to her love without a trace. Young Claire has successfully embodied the classic image of Juliet on the big screen. Bravo!
3. Tybalt performed by John Leguizamo - Juliet's brother and the most rabid in the Capulet clan, ready to destroy all representatives of the hostile clan. Impeccably dressed, mannered, the killer played brilliantly by John Leguizamo. I know him from the excellent incarnation of Henri Toulouse-Latrec-Montf from ""Moulin Rouge"", and here he played the impudent and mad Tybalt, for which he gets my applause! Bravo John!
I can not fail to mention Harold Perrino, the Negrito, who played Mercutio, and so played that with his charisma he pushed the most handsome Leo off the pedestal!
When viewing, many viewers will have a slight bewilderment, maybe even hatred, regarding this picture. Modern surroundings and Shakespeare's lines from the lips of the heroes, the difference between the picture and the dialogues, logic in some places, the Negritos Mercutio, Other moments and even whole pieces of the picture. As I said, the picture here is very challenging. The actors overact, even unnecessarily. Inappropriate antics, attempts at pathos - this is all there, and there is no getting away from it. All this does not interfere with my viewing, because this film adaptation is not a film adaptation in the usual sense of the word - this is an experiment of the director, where Shakespeare, modernity for the year the picture was released, and theatricality were mixed, and all this gave what is called the picture ""Romeo + Juliet "".
As a result, we have an excellent adaptation of the immortal tragedy of William Shakespeare with a classic story, excellent dialogues, music, entourage, emotions and simply amazing acting work.",Romeo + Juliet
84,Mike-DD,R&J In A Modern Setting,10,19 August 2000,"I sure enjoyed this adaptation of Romeo & Juliet. It was unsettling at first to see a modern setting and music score (especially since I've seen the traditional version in high school so many times for literature classes), but once I got used to it, it was actually quite innovative and stimulating.It took a bit of getting used to seeing actors in modern garb spout Shakespearean English, but the movie, while taking poetic license with the script, did stick to the basic premise of the play. Claire Danes as Juliet was a perfect casting in my view, what I'd expect a traditional Juliet to look like, although I thought DiCaprio looked just a tad too 'soft' to be Shakespeare Romeo.",Romeo + Juliet
85,yasir619,great and nice.,6,26 November 2018,"It is good movie of leonardo dicaprio.no doubt can't say that leo was not handsome in his youth though he is still the handsome guy till now.
good story but i was maybe expecting more but in the end after i watched movie i can say it is good and fine.leo is much handsome guy and he inspire me a lot through his movies.Acting of leonardo dicaprio as usual awesome at any movie.but story was just nice and good.and the girl claire danes no doubt is beautiful but she is 39 though.",Romeo + Juliet
86,Mickey Knox,amazing,9,29 July 2002,"This is one of the greatest films i have ever seen. The story of Romeo and Juliet, set in the modern age, with guns, drugs and fast cars, but still maintaining the rhymes and texts of the initial Shakesperean story. Bazz Luhrmann's brave concept is surprisingly good. It doesn't fall in  the mistakes made by most classic stories adapted to the modern age. Di Caprio and Danes are perfect together, the filming and editing is also better than in most movies nowadays. Luhrmann has created a masterpiece. Vote: 9.5 out of 10.",Romeo + Juliet
87,blazesnakes9,From Shakespeare to Punk Rock to MTV,2,22 May 2011,"William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is the classic love story about two youths who fall in love. The setting is a city called Verona, where two households families fight each other off. One family is called the Capulets and the other is called Montagues. In this modern day adaption of the classic play, it turns out that wasn't fresh enough. The movie starts out pretty fast, with the camera making fast movements when we are introduce by new characters. What I thought would be a modern day version of Romeo and Juliet turned out to be a punk version, MTV hyped up story. The first few minutes of the films went by fast that I though I was seeing this movie in fast-forward mode. After seeing this movie in my freshman classroom, my English teacher said that this movie isn't accurate as the play. It isn't as accurate as the play. As for the performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, those two are perfect, but sometimes I feel that they had too much love scenes that made Leonardo famous. Romeo and Juliet is not the perfect adaption to date. But, for those who are Leonardo DiCaprio fans, this movie is for you. ★★ 2 stars.",Romeo + Juliet
88,IrisNo11,Shakespeare Goes Modern I See,10,30 July 1999,"William Shakespeare is one of my favorite writers of all time. He was a true master at what he did, and his work featured every element: Romance, drama, comedy, fantasy, you name it! And it's not a big surprise that his work is made into films. I've seen two versions of Romeo and Juliet in film. One was the one starring Oliva Hussey (Juliet)and Leonard Whiting (Romeo) which dates back to 1968, and this one starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Daines.I liked both versions at the same level, because they are both great in their own ways. In this case, this one takes place in modern time. For example, Verona, Italy is now Verona Beach, and the Prince is head of a police squad. The famous balcony scene takes place in a swimming pool, and there are guns rather than swords and daggers.I loved this version of the classic play by Shakespeare, not only because it's more up to date, but because it is creative and besides the modern elements added to this film, not one thing changed compared to the original play (unlike what they did to ""Great Expectations"" starring Ethan Hawke, which is a disappointment)! An excellent piece of work and a true masterpiece!!! :o)",Romeo + Juliet
89,emryse,"Just as Good as the Original, by which I mean not Very Good",6,26 May 2021,"This is one of the corniest films I've ever seen and I can't decide whether that's intentional or not, everything from the editing to the sound design feels like it's some dumb action film and this works brilliantly in the opening scene, a great action set piece. The scene revels in this corniness and it works perfectly to create an atmosphere of care free fun, the film really falls down for me though when it try's to move in a more earnest, heartfelt, direction. The film continues feeling like a dumb action film but has characters spouting long monologues about love and life all in the original old English, this messes up the mood of the film for me and brings it crashing down into what feels like a pretentious mess. The acting is alright though and it is better than some of the versions that stick more diligently to the original story, still it could have been a lot better if they'd strayed further from Shakespeare's original story which I don't think holds up nowadays. 7/10 :)",Romeo + Juliet
90,tmpj,"Worse than ""Plan 9 From Outer Space""....",3,12 September 2010,"I understand the basic motive of the producers of this thing-a-ma-bob, based on the work of Shakespeare, who based his upon other works of the period. It was a grand effort, but it fails miserably. To update this classic story to modern, hip-hop times and still keep the Elizabethan English in the script is a sort of a death warrant in and of itself. It is clumsy, corny, and a bit superfluous. It stumbles over its own two left feet. I suffered through one viewing of it, praying that it would soon be over. After what felt like an eternity, it finally was over. I would never want to sit through this movie again. It lacked character, substance, and credibility. Plus, there is a great deal of otherwise terrific talent wasted along the way. Brian Dennehy and Paul Sorvino would be worth the price of admission alone, were it another, more credible vehicle. But they come off looking like fools in this play in search of an identity for itself. Leonardo does the best he can to make this thing work, but...terrific actor that he is...he simply does not have the depth to pull this one off. The direction was fast paced and intense, and that was one of the problems with it. The actors had no real opportunity to let the characters come to life and to allow the script to breathe. The result...it moves at too quick a pace, it never quite settles in, and the actors sound as if they are reciting their lines, as opposed to allowing the lines to be delivered at a credible, believable pace. The modernization of the story is also a sore point. To bring this story into the age of greed and moral degradation tends to over shadow the point...that this is a story of love and of just plain rivalry between two families that do not see eye to eye. Romeo and Juliet pay the price for the foolish attitudes of their families, a situation that rings as clear to-day as it did way back in the days of old. The producers wanted to take the story a step beyond ""West Side Story"", which was also a variation on the Romeo/Juliet tragedy...but it failed in this modern day translation. ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" was badly done because it had virtually no budget, and dealt with the death of a principal cast member during filming. This one had the budget, but it was still badly done, badly written, and badly executed. Maybe another production company will undertake the mantle and do a more respectable job.",Romeo + Juliet
91,tml_pohlak_13,Congratulations to the (moronic) screenwriters!!!,1,27 May 2008,"NEVER, NEVER, has Shakespeare been butchered more than in ROMEO + JULIET. Don't get me wrong: I was completely open to the idea of an updated version of Shakespeare's classic. I was even looking forward to it. And then, I watched it. Shakespeare's play is a classic for a reason-- this movie was put together as if it was a last minute project for an English class. The setting is completely updated-- Romeo now has a handgun, Friar Lawrence has a cross tattooed on his back, the Capulets and Montagues engage in a gunfight. And yet, they use dialogue from the original play! The setting LOOKS modern, but the speech sounds 16th century. Now, I would not have been bothered by this, but for one other thing. THE ACTORS DO NOT KNOW HOW TO RECITE Shakespeare! When DiCaprio recites his lines, he does so halfheartedly and monotonously-- as if he was saying, ""Yeah, yeah, I get it. I'm in love with this girl now. What a waste of an hour. Can I just poison myself already???"". Only one character recites the Shakesperean dialogue well-- Friar Lawrence. If that was not enough, the screenwriters take delight in butchering a classic. Several key moments were omitted, such as the slaying of Paris. Mercutio, instead of being witty, is now just plain annoying. He, too, does not know how to speak Shakespeare. In short, it is an assault on the eyes, the ears, and the brain. With films like these, no wonder some people dislike Shakespeare! A plague o' all the scriptwriters!",Romeo + Juliet
92,Jimmy-128,"Uneven film, with notable performances",5,7 March 2000,"""R+J"", when it works, works very well.  When it doesn't, it's ludicrous.  It boasts some fine performances, including that of Leonardo DiCaprio (remember when we were all falling over ourselves to praise him?  He hasn't changed; the material he's been offered lately is simply not up to his earlier films), Harold Perrineau Jr., Miriam Margolyes, Pete Postelthwaite, Brian Dennehy, Paul Sorvino (okay, I'm biased in favor of those last two).  Claire Danes, for some reason, doesn't work here; like DiCaprio, she's better than she's usually given credit for, but the usual fire is absent here.  Don't even get me started about John Leguizamo, because he is just plain ludicrous.  Tybalt is supposed to be a badass, and Leguizamo cannot even remotely carry that off.  I kept wondering why Perrineau didn't just stuff him into a locker and be done with it.The movie works best when it underplays and gives the audience a chance to enjoy finely nuanced performances.  When it goes for the usual sensory-overload so prized by Fox, it resembles a bad episode of ""The A-Team"" (if that isn't being redundant).",Romeo + Juliet
93,nmholland,"A Disappointment When Compared to the Play, But Not Too Bad",7,1 March 2016,"Romeo + Juliet is directed by Baz Luhrmann and stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes as the famous star-crossed lovers and title characters, Romeo and Juliet. If you don't know the story, shame on you, but here's a synopsis. Two families, the Montagues and Capulets, are constantly feuding, and Romeo, a Montague, and Juliet, a Capulet, subsequently fall in love. Their love is not allowed, due to their parents' hatred for each other, and so they secretly get married. This entire story is based (literally line by line) off of William Shakespeare's play, The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet.The best thing this film has to offer is, quite obviously, the dialogue. The lines used in this film is the exact lines William Shakespeare wrote in the 16th century. The plot, along with the dialogue, is ingenious. The forbidden love between the two plays off amazingly. The direction in this film also is pretty good. It has a few flaws; some shaky cam, bad close ups, etc. However, it's more good than it is bad. The acting is also really good. This is one of DiCaprio's first roles, besides What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), in which he received his first Oscar nomination. He is super young here, but still does a great job. Claire Danes does great as well. She's not in many movies (thanks to Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)), but she really should be. She does fantastic in this film. The first negative in this film is the ""gangster"" vibe of it. The original story takes place in the 14th century in Verona, Italy. This film takes place in 1996 in Verona Beach, California. Nobody uses swords; they all use engraved, golden guns. This movie would've been near perfect if the director kept to the formula that Shakespeare wrote. The nowaday feel of the movie makes for a complete mess, with too much unnecessary drama at the wrong times, and confusing dialogue that makes no sense when a character says the word ""sword"" or especially old English, using words like ""doth"" and ""thou.""Overall, Romeo + Juliet wasn't too bad. I expected better than the utterly stupid theme of the slums, and the occasional bad direction, most abundant during fight scenes. I'm going to give Romeo + Juliet a C+, or a 7 out of 10.",Romeo + Juliet
94,Funky A,Surprisingly good.,8,30 December 2001,"The fact that I loved Moulin Rouge convinced me to see Romeo + Juliet, Baz Luhrmann's previous movie but I was a bit worried. First of all, Romeo and Juliet has never been my favorite Shakespeare tragedy. And the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio had the role of Romeo did not convince me either. He is not a terrible actor, but he is certainly not a great one. Well, luckily Luhrmann's name convinced me to see this very good version of the classic play. His directing is impressive. The actors also do a great job. Danes and Dicaprio are a great couple, and John Leguizamo is perfect as Tybalt. His performance convinced me, along with his role in the incredible Summer of Sam, that Leguizamo is an excellent actor, someone with the potential to be remembered as one of the great actors of his generation. The rest of the cast is also very good. Sure, there might be a bit too much screaming from time to time but the energy with which Luhrmann films everything makes it seem normal. As for the story, it is told with enough passion to make me forget about everything I dont like about it. All in all, this movie is worth your time, although if you are in the mood for Shakespeare at his best, watch Kenneth Branagh's 1996 version of Hamlet. But if you dont have time for this wonderful 4 hour epic, Romeo + Juliet is a dynamic version of a classic story.78%",Romeo + Juliet

I've never exactly decided whether or not I think it's good, but I do enjoy it. The love between Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio is quite nice, although it lacks the wild passion (particularly on Claire's part) that distinguishes this tale, and Pete Postlethwaite seems to be the only actor involves who seems as though he can truly handle the Bard. Nevertheless, I think it can only be a compliment to Shakespeare that his work continues to be interpreted in so many diverse ways hundreds of years after he wrote it. On that note, this is a brave experiment that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. It is a study in style, with a unique, acid-art burn.",Romeo + Juliet
98,Tetsel,MTV does Shakespeare,4,30 November 1999,"What a sad day it is when the Capulets destroy gas stations and Romeo smokes cigarettes. This new version, in a poor imitation of the 'MTV cross-cutting' style, makes a terrible mess of Shakespeare's classic.

99,neon47,Moderized Without Losing the Shakespeare,9,7 June 2005,"I'm a sucker for William Shakespeare even though I like it done better in the theatre. This one however, kept my attention and seemed to do a great job with modernizing the whole quarreling families thing. The movie kicks off with a street brawl between the Montegues and Capulets. The Prince forewarns them that if they ever disturb the peace again their ""lives will pay the forfeit of the peace."" We are then introduced to the character Romeo who is played by Leonardo DeCaprio. Leo does a great job as Romeo, but that's because Leo is a good actor in this film. Soon after that we are introduced to Juliet who is played by the beautiful Claire Danes, someone I haven't seen in too many movies. Danes does a great job playing the flirty Juliet. The movie follows the original script very accurately. The symbolism is also used very well throughout the movie. If you look at the guns you'll notice that some say sword, some say rapier, and I believe some say dagger. The Montegues always wear a Hawaiian style shirt. The Capulets dress more like mobsters or thugs even though both sides could be viewed as thugs in some sort or another. In either case each family wears a certain kind of clothing that makes it easy to tell who's who. One great part I absolutely love is the party. Juliet wears angel wings and Romeo wears a knight outfit. Romeo's best friend (and I wish I could spell his name but I'd rather not butcher it) dresses up as a women. So to explain this form of symbolics, for those who aren't getting it, it's Romeo is the ""knight in shinning armor,"" Juliet is the angel of Romeo's dreams, and Romeo's best friend is the comic relief. There's other things you'll notice at the party also, like Tybalt wears devil horns(i.e. he's a villain). Both families you'll also notice are rich, which also follows the script accurately. Overall, if you're a Shakespeare fan, a fan of romantic movies, a fan of tragic movies, or a fan of artistic movies then make sure to look into this one. It'll sweep you off you're feet, make you laugh, make you cry, and make you fall in love.",Romeo + Juliet

The dialogue is obviously a challenge for any inexperienced viewer but the story is familiar and each scene makes sense even if you're struggling to understand what each actor says. That being said, it's nothing special. Each time I finish watching this movie I just feel like it's ok. There is no gut wrenching impact it has left on me and I can probably affirmatively confirm this now after the third viewing.

105,Sam_Gray,a retarded reinterpretation,3,23 February 2000,"Sigh.  I generally dislike movies that attempt to set classics in modern times, and this is no exception.  Not only is this version of the play difficult to take seriously, it's paced badly, and most of the acting is terrible.  What Luhrmann has attempted to do is splice hyperactivity together with intellect - and the two don't mix well.  Furthermore, setting Romeo and Juliet in modern times necessarily takes the play entirely out of context, especially when using the original dialogue.  Romeo and Mercutio are particularly misrepresented here.There are only two things that keep this ""film"" from getting a one or a two from me.  First, the soundtrack is cool (I'm a huge Radiohead fan).  Second, Shakespeare's writing is still genius, even in a misrepresentation like this.  But otherwise, there's little to like about this movie.  It's a blatant and gross exploitation of art for the sake of trendiness. 3/10",Romeo + Juliet
106,filmbuff-05706,A Weird But Fantastic Adaptation Of Shakespeare's Classic Play.,10,12 July 2021,"William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is both an accurate title and a misnomer. It has the language of Shakespeare's play, and yet the setting is moved from 1500s Italy to 1996 Verona Beach. However, that is the delight and uniqueness of Baz Luhrmann's vision.The plot is known to most people. There are 2 feuding families, the Montagues and the Capulets. One day, a child of both families, Romeo(Leonardo DiCaprio) and Juliet(Claire Danes), fall in love and marry in secret to unite their families.The movie sticks to speaking in Old English, but the setting is modern. The clothes are suburbia, people drive fancy cars, carry guns, and places like gas stations are available. (I guess so if there's cars....),The result is weird, but also something special. When Romeo and Juliet meet(and Romeo has been fretting over rejected love), they are at a costume party, him as a knight and her as a fairy. When they must part, Romeo still looks at her from a distance and says: ""Did my heart love 'til now? Forswear it sight. For I never saw true beauty 'til this night.""As a result, those who want to see a faithful rendition of the play from this standpoint will surely not be disappointed.Baz Luhrmann shows his talent as a director here. The cinematography is on point, very glamorous and always a pleasure to look at.Leonardo DiCaprio gives what I will controversially say is his best romantic role, and yes I say that with Titanic being a film that was released a year later. R and J is simply a standard in romantic storytelling, so I have no shame in my statement. (Though I will say that The Departed remains my favorite role of his.)Claire Danes makes for a gorgeous Juliet, and I can imagine no other actress taking her place, not even Kate Winslet, who was doing Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet the same year. This is my favorite role of hers, despite seeing her in movies like Temple Grandin and Me and Orson Welles.As long as you can accept the modernization, Romeo and Juliet is a must for anyone who loves classics, romance or classic literature. William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is one of the most romantic stories ever told, re-invented into one of the strangest yet most powerful adaptations ever made.",Romeo + Juliet
107,said-buet10,Its crazy and its cool,8,5 October 2017,I've never seen a movie like this and probably will never see one again. This whole thing is flashy and colorful and poetic at the same time. It's a very interesting take on perhaps the most famous love stories of all time.The acting in super good. Leo and Claire were young but their acting were very very good. Some of the supporting actors were too awesome to forget.The director did something unique with this story. Its brave and new and in the end gave us a movie which the audience will probably never forget watching. The way he merged modern time with this classic story is weird yet interesting.This is crazy and fun at the same time. Most of the viewers knows what is going to happen still will sit through this just because its very entertaining to watch.,Romeo + Juliet
108,MSusimetsa,"Attempted, but failed",4,6 May 2003,"Perhaps I saw this film a few years too late, but it did not really affect me that much. I found the chance in the time and place that the story takes place rather boring and it did nothing for the movie as an experience. I got the feeling that it was just an attempt to draw interest from the media and public, rather than to bring something new to the story. Acting is rather nice, but it was hard to see diCaprio as Romeo - again, a rising, if not famous, boy-actor was used just to draw attention to the flick. I'd recommend some older version of the story, if not the original written story, for those who find the story interesting... 4/10",Romeo + Juliet
109,escoles,"Fun, but not very good",6,15 December 2000,"While a much bigger-budget and more ""serious"" work, this isn't really nearly as good as Luhrmann's earlier _Strictly Ballroom_.This wildly experimental movie is, overall, a dismal (albeit instructive) failure. The plot narrative arc runs parallel to _Strictly Ballroom_, beginning in a much wilder, freer, more experimental style early in the picture, shifting gradually over to a more conventional mode of storytelling about a quarter of the way in. As with the earlier picture, I wonder if the real reason for the switch is not that Luhrmann simply ran out of steam and energy for the frenetic editing.The biggest failing is in the casting. While both exceptionally pretty, neither Danes nor diCaprio ever come to grips with the meaning in their lines -- falling victim to the most common failing when doing Shakespeare, they never manage to forget that the lines are supposed to be POETRY. Several supporting players, most notably Harold Perrineau as Mercutio and John Leguizamo as Tybalt, overcome this problem with ease. Perrineau in particular is flatly amazing, easily stealing every scene; that's not hard with material like Mercutio, but as so often happens with this play, a good Mercutio serves no end so much as to show up the weaknesses of the story in general (to wit, these are all a bunch of witless adolescents that most of us wouldn't give a thought to outside of The Theatre).Good eye candy, and some really fine performances (although none from the principles).",Romeo + Juliet
110,tommyson,my pick for the all time worst,1,27 January 1999,"This movie should have never been made. The idea to modernize ""Romeo & Juliet"" isn't that bad, but the idea to give the Shakespeare style laungue is, so bad in fact, it made me laugh. The classic scenes are re-done and the music is punk crap. If you want a good adaption rent the 1968 version and skip this junk.",Romeo + Juliet
111,nutz4n64,"Leo does Shakespeare. Oh, goody.",1,28 January 2000,"I was first introduced to Shakespeare freshman year at high school.  Sure, it was a bit tough at first, but I got used to it.  Romeo and Juliet was a terrific play.  Then came the time in class when we would watch the video adaptations of this play.  We spent half the period on the '68 version, then half on this one, which went on for a few days.  The '68 version was very well done, and most of the class liked it.  Then we watched the ""new"" one. I didn't know what to expect, but I thought it might be good.  Then I see the Montagues cruising the expressway in an open top convertable.  OK, so it's in modern times.  It might be good.  Then I heard them speak.  Dear God, what were they thinking?!I see this fight at a gas station where everyone looks like they're on speed and they shout these Shakespearean lines like they're normal for the time. I should've seen it coming when, instead of a narrator, a news caster does the prologue.  Great job.  Tip to the writers: if you're going to put Shakespeare in modern times, don't include the original lines.  ""Draw the sword!""  What ""sword?""  I saw no sword in the movie.  I saw some guns.  Is this what Shakepeare would call guns nowadays?  And do I see news reports and beach parties where people actually speak in blank verse?  And let's not forget Leonardo DeCaprio.  How much more pathetic can his acting get?  I hardly saw any good actors in this movie.  I don't know why people would see this as ""good"" entertainment.  Rarely do I ever give a 1 out of 10 to any movie, but this was just plain garbage.  If you want to see the real Romeo and Juliet, watch the '68 adaptation.  It is much more worthy to be called a work of Shakespeare's.",Romeo + Juliet
112,TheyKilledTheGiggler,ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I'VER EVER SEEN!!!!,1,10 June 2002,"I hated this movie not just because it was based on shakespeare's  play but because the acting and the camera direction was so stupid. This movie is so dumb it make ""Leprechaun In the Hood""  seem like an oscar caliber film. I would not watch this movie again if someone paid me.

113,burgan6203,"Well, I liked it.",7,4 April 2004,"Baz Lurhmann's ""Romeo + Juliet"" doesn't even come close to ""Moulin Rouge""(a truly beautiful, artistic film IMO);it is uneven in numerous instances and the editing usually is a bit too wild. Having said this however, I would like to admit that I enjoy this movie. Baz is wonderfully creative, and even if the results aren't entirely successful, there's still more imagination here than in many other mainstream films. And what about the scene at the party, where Romeo and Juliet regard each other through the fish tank? That is a genuinely lovely, tender moment, as is the balcony(or pool)scene. But for those who find this version too iconoclastic, try the Zeffirelli version; I like them both.",Romeo + Juliet
114,benturkalj,The way Shakespeare should be viewed,10,31 October 2005,"When Baz Lurman decided to make a Shakespeare movie, he wanted to recreate the experience as it was in it's day, or in other words make it fun again. And that's just what he achieved with this well conceived drama.Set in Venice beach instead of the original Venice, Italy, all of the dialog is kept with some clever referencing used to help thread some of the problems into the story.Using a great sense of style, the film generally moves at a thrilling pace, with sometimes bizarre use of the camera making for an exceptional visual experience. All of the acting is well above standard, with kudos to Leonardo Decaprio and Clare Danes, though everyone does a top class job.The score is also top notch, taking some of the best bands and using them effectively to help create the right mood. If your a purist, you may dislike this quirky film, but if you want to see Shakespeare in an exciting portrayal, then this is well worth seeing.",Romeo + Juliet
115,celestialbaby23,Favorite version!,10,11 July 2018,"I've seen both versions of this movie and I have to say that this one is BY FAR thee BEST one!

116,ad2020,"Why did Baz call this ""William Shakespeare's Romeo+Juliet""?",6,23 November 2000,"Using this title in it's own right thumbs it's nose at the Bard!! Not that I'm a true member or anything, but pretension is going to have reaction's, most of which are going to be negative!!!! I haven't seen this flick for a while, but I do remember that everybody I associated with at the time absolutely despised it. I can see why, Shakespeare was a poet before a playwrite to my knowledge (don't hold me to it, I prefer his works to his life story!) so any well crafted dialogue of his is butchered for physical and visual effect in this movie, it's just wrong! Not to mention I find the acting to be thrown out for speed,and you can't just do what you please w/ the physical aspects of the original play, so many scenes that made the play a fatalistical tragedy are overwrought!! I have to give this movie it's due, though, it shows a great use of visual ability that should be used w/ these types of stories (even though it seems that Baz is trying to do everything that everybody else didn't with this movie) which does justice to the themes of this play. I'm not familiar with any of Baz Luhrmann's other work's, but after graduating to his sappy ""Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)"", I'll be concise enough to say this is his best work (which definitely ain't saying a lot!) and that I'm afraid to meet him for fear of laughing at him or puking on him!

117,mercybell,"William Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet""? No, Baz's ""Romeo + Juliet"".",10,2 November 2002,"I remember when this movie came out, all my classmates were seeing it and talking about it, my school got free book covers with Leonardo and Clare until I could hardly stand their faces any more, and I was greatly surprised to hear my chorus teacher give it rave reviews, it was after all, a teen flick, right? But even though I had a great curiosity regarding such a strange movie, I didn't see it. It wasn't till after I had seen Moulin Rouge that I took the initiative to see this film. I find it fairly amusing that the ""official"" title of this film is ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"", everyone and their uncle knows who wrote it. Everyone and their uncle knows the story. Quite frankly, when I saw it, I was expecting to be bored. I knew how it went, I had read it twice, I had been hearing the story in every vessel of artistic interpretation all my life, from Zeffirelli to Bernstein (well, I love West Side Story). It had been played out, there's only so much mileage you can get. And to me it wasn't Hamlet or King Lear or Much Ado about Nothing which still could hold you enthralled just by a reading. ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet""? What else is new? Sure it's genius, but now, quite simply, it was boring. But this isn't simply Shakespeare's movie, it's Baz Luhrmann's. It made me weep. Where you might think a hip and slick take on a timeless story has been played out, it has elsewhere, but not here. Luhrmann infuses something into it. The film is at times bizarre and sinister, it's intense, it's rough and awkward, it's colorful and crazy and over the top, it's muted, it's passion frenzy, it's dry, it's slick and sophisticated. It's meticulous and strange and cold and white hot all at once. He shoves it all into Venice Beach and actors and those so very famous beautiful poetic lines and mixed with a complete and total disregard for convention. Like Moulin Rouge, there's an obsession with details. But these are strange details. Guns with names, palaces and servants for these mafialike characters, beaches and highways and gas stations as playgrounds for the characters. It's a deformed and crazy Verona for '96. The background is filled to the brim with every sort of lavish and extravagant window or bookshelf dressing or religious icon, flowers, car wheel caps, clothing styles, the way hedges are trimmed, and billboards. Nothing is left out. Luhrmann immerses you into another world, it's 1996, but it's not where we're living. Thus we can relate to these people yet still accept this insanity. And that's fitting, the world Shakespeare was evoking wasn't his own secular society either, he was trying to strip it down to the human qualities of a story. That's why a modern American plain accented actor speaking this complicated dialogue works. We're allowed to believe that these people would talk like this. And the actors give it life and a palpability. It's excellently casted. They give every line with emotion, they act it out, using themselves, but realistically. Danes and Dicaprio are excellent. The various supports do great justice to their roles. It was a joy and a wonder to watch, to see what Shakespeare had intended, with good actors performing well on such a colorful and wacky stage. Above all the emotional power of the story, which can be beaten out during mandatory reading periods or a repeated session with a bland and average version again and again, remains firm. Especially during the last part of the film. There are no superfluous motions or gestures on the actors' part. They act it to a tee. Baz leaves no emotion or possibility unturned. The blocking and directing gets the best out of the story. For example: Romeo walks through a dazzling and dark candlelit and flower and statue strewn chapel to find Juliet, and he weeps and weeps while saying his lines. This is the imagery and interpretation that flows throughout the movie.
This is a movie that had a lot of effort and thought and heart and honesty put into it. It has a character and a charisma that I think is lacking in many films today. No one has ever seen the version Shakespeare envisioned, he doesn't give staging or actor's notes, he didn't provide a cliffsnotes version. No one alive can pass down the directions to a performance Shakespeare was present at. Taking this into consideration, Luhrmann created a respectful yet completely unique and enlightening spin on a story that no matter how brilliant, can still get botched by poor translation. I think he extracted the essence of a timeless and beautiful story, and made something incredible. At least he finally made me appreciate it.",Romeo + Juliet

Further, I can say that by watching this movie I understood what I've been missing... Danes and DiCaprio is such a great couple in this movie... This is such a truths worthy and realistic movie, all authentic to the Shakespeare story except from that fact that the story is moved from Verona in the 16th century to present time in Verona Beach and some changed lines, some changed scenes and a bit modernized story. Beautiful scenes, beautiful cinematography, sad story, fine person chemistry between Danes and DiCaprio.

I had seen the movie way back in 1996 but being naive couldn't understand anything and thought that it was a waste of good money. But this time around, I was left astounded and have been thinking about the movie all morning.The movie moves at a brisk pace and does not drone unnecessarily. But perhaps the play itself is well paced, I'm not aware since I haven't read it yet.It is a courageous attempt on the part of the director and full marks to him and his film makers for their imagination and creativity. Great acting and cinematography too. Highly recommended.I used to hate Shakespeare in school but this movie has developed an interest in me now and I think I will read a little more of him.I must say that watching the film on DVD with subtitles is pretty helpful since the Shakespearean dialogue and poetry takes a few moments to get your head across.",Romeo + Juliet
120,Nahret,An Ode to the Bard!,8,12 April 2002,"There are some spoilers here for those who've never, ever heard about this play. Often used as a blueprint for movies through the decades, never has Shakespeare's play about the true essence of love been brought to life in such spectacular, breathtaking fashion. Baz Luhrman does it again. In this case, he takes the Bard's play and transfers it to our times, our world. Yes, there has been a string of teen-movies based on classic literature recently (Clueless, Cruel Intentions, 10 Things I Hate About You, etc.), but where Luhrman goes further than everyone else is by actually taking Shakespeare's language along for the ride. And, surprisingly, it works. He knows how to pick the right lines of the play, to convey meaning understandable beyond its archaic words. And thus, when Mercutio (Romeo's best friend and the only drag queen I've ever seen in a Shakespeare) uses his dying breath to lay ""a plague on both your houses"", the immediate sense of foreboding makes itself powerfully known. More so, Luhrman even dares to play with these very words to add a unique sense of humour to high drama, as when a light in the Capulet's mansion goes on and Romeo says: ""What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun."" But neither the occasional jest nor the almost comic-book like style of the movie's photography ever divert the attention away from the impending tragedy. The sheer force of the emotional build-up is astonishing - and serves as proof that Shakespeare's work transcends space and time.",Romeo + Juliet

I can say with confidence that this is one of my favourite adaptations of one of the best stories ever made.Hats off to Baz Luhrmann's brave, unconventionam, and highly-dramatised methods of directing; hats off to Armstrong's phenomenal musical soundtrack; hats off to every single one of the actors (particularly our main two lovers, and Pete Postlethwaite as the Friar). But above all, hats off to the ability this film has to entice you in by the throat, and make you care about the characters in ways you will never expect.

122,FargoUT,"Positively, the worst film ever made",1,15 November 1998,"As a film critic, I expand my interest into other arts.  Theater is merely one of my interests.  Shakespeare is a God, too.  I've seen many versions of Shakespeare's plays, including Branagh's Henry V, and Much Ado About Nothing.  But boy, nothing really prepared me for this piece of crap.  Take all of the bad movie experiences you've ever had, and put them together. Ready?  Okay, now you still don't have how bad this movie is.  Baz Luhrmann has destroyed Shakespeare in ridiculous form.  Despite the entertaining two minute opening sequence, this film is completely unimportant.  It's a waste of celluloid as we know it.  True pain.  It's the only film I've actually walked out of the theater on.  Those theaters should provide courtesy buckets so you can heave and spew all you want.  Good Shakespeare?  Watch Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet.  Nothing compares.  DiCaprio and Danes are great actors... this just proves how great actors can be very, very bad.  Never see this film.  It's like watching a bad Plan 9 from Outer Space (yes, I realize Plan 9 is bad, but compared to this film, it's Citizen Kane).  It should be wiped off the surface of the earth.

Maybe it's possible to set Shakespeare in the present day, but on this evidence, it just doesn't work. I watched the film on a rented DVD. I don't know the play well, and on occasions lost track of what was happening, so I tried to follow the text in my Complete Works of Shakespeare. It seemed to me that there were lots of passages of INVENTED Shakespearean verse - or did I just imagine this? Apart from the failure to convey the emotion that's vital to this story, there were examples throughout where the modern setting made nonsense of the story. At the crux of it all, I couldn't help asking myself why Pete Postlethwaite didn't tell Claire Danes ""Now shallst thou to thy mobile phone ... Go and inform thy Romeo of our deed""! thus averting the tragedy and saving us from a truly feeble rendition of the climax. To me, the Zeffirelli version was better on every level.",Romeo + Juliet

127,stephen_thanabalan_fans,Set the Trends for the late 1990s and early 2000s,7,1 September 2005,"William Shakespeare's masterpiece definitive romantic tale already had love, passion, tragedy and unbeatable literary genius. What Baz Luhrmann did was to turn up its volume, slap on the sunscreen and yell out (captured essentially through the way Leonardo DiCaprio cried in the murder scene) to the world in the midst of a 1996 drag party at the beach.And what a scream it let out too. Whilst not initially blockbuster fare, it hit the underground and worked itself into the mainstream due to its raw energy- what later became the hallmark of Baz Lurhmann's film signatures when he completed 2001's now celebrated, Moulin Rouge. The film was yelling out to the world way ahead of its time. From the fashion in the film, the stylings of the film all the way to the flair and even hairstyle of the lead characters, this film oozed trend-setter. That it went on to launch Leonardo DiCaprio and his floppy fringe, furrowed brow and a cigarette dressed in a suit without a tie (spanning millions of teenage admirers and copycats the world over), was just the one element of the show's powerful placement as one of the defining pieces of cinema in the 1990s.Till that time, teenage fare (if people even still consider this film to be as such) was considered fluffy - one must remember that the film was launched in 1996 - with only shows like 'My Own Private Idaho', 'Reality Bites' or even 'Clueless' before it, whilst it way ahead of the teenage movie formulaic explosion that took place after 1998/99, and even the better of those never could touch this film's raw energy, angst, stylistics nor emotion. That was how powerfully strong the undertones and reverberations surrounding this teenage culture defining movie of the 1990s was.And yet again, it was not just a teen flick- it had the essence of literary prose still entrenched in within, it had a flair for style unseen in any movie at the time (thereby establishing Baz Lurhmann as a revolutionary), and combined with the editing, musical layout & soundtrack (The Wannadies, etc) and sparklingly romantic scenes like the 'fish tank' wooing sequence, it was pure Shakespeare with a twist, and a delectable shout at the beach to stop the world to take notice.",Romeo + Juliet

Not sure who's bright idea it was to do this pseudo modern day interpretation of Romeo and Juliet, but it was a horrible idea, or at least a horrible implementation. 2 teenagers running around Southern California beaches in the late 1990's while reciting Romeo and Juliet in The King's English, just does NOT work. No surprise that it got decent treatment by movie critics, it has plenty of men singing and dancing around in drag in the party scene, which looked more like your typical San Francisco party than anything else. The movie critics just eat that up with a spoon, all the while calling it avant-garde. Do yourself a favor and just re-read the book, or watch the 1968 adaptation if you want to see a movie.

Yeah, I could read the play, but I never did twenty years ago in high school, so why fool myself? Besides, Juliet's romantic musing about Romeo is soooo much sexier when Claire Danes is saying it.  (Makes me wonder: Leonardo di Caprio is in the just released Catch me if You Can, but what has Claire Danes been up to?

From the moment the movie started you knew it wasn't your typical tale of the two star-crossed lovers. This was action packed and romantic. It showed that Romeo + Juliet were stupid teenager who thought they only had one way out. I felt there was a more human and realistic quality to the acting as well as the setting. It helped teenagers of today relate  to the story and learn from it. Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio are two of my favorite actors. They were even before I saw this film. I have seen it many times since its 1996 release. It is still one of my favorite versions of Romeo + Juliet. I really recommend it ; not just for the acting, but as a thrilling visual as well. The use of color and lighting was amazing too. Props to the director . Good job.",Romeo + Juliet

This movie could not have been made by anyone else. Claire Danes (beautiful angel costume, compliments to Catherine Martin) shines as Juliet. She isn't the traditional Juliet that the play was originally sexist towards her character. She's got emotion and adds more into Juliet than no one ever did. When Juliet committed suicide, that facial expression into the camera was so strong and memerorizing, as is the film. I cried like a baby whilst watching it. Leonardo Di Caprio is perfect as Romeo, being a today teenager and an Elizabethen teenager at the same time. With an amazing kissing scene, Romeo+ Juliet wins in originality. It's well acted, and the deaths are done really well and the suicide scene defines love and the true meaning of it.",Romeo + Juliet
132,juubei-2,"Best film version for Generation X, Y and Z",10,24 January 2006,"When I was in 9th grade, my English class was studying Romeo and Juliet and as luck would have it, this version was in theatres! Unfortunately, my English teacher felt the modern setting and teen dream stars were an affront to Shakespeare's classic play and while the other class got to go see it, we were stuck watching the version from the 70s in a dimly lit library on a 20"" set. She even fast-forwarded through the love scenes. Its that type of person that will likely hate this movie, and while they don't really deserve it, lets all take a moment to pity their lack of adventure and youthful exuberance that this story clearly embodies.OK... now on to the review.Most teenagers when they first learn about Shakespeare will likely begin with Romeo & Juliet. Its a popular and easily digestible tale. And most students will probably have a slightly difficult time with the language, but the meaning of the lines will not be lost on them with this modernized version by celebrated director Baz Luhrman. Carefully chosen images intermingle with the lines and soon you forget about the strangeness of the language and are engrossed in the story, as Shakespeare himself would've intended.Starring in the lead roles are talented stars and character actors, even some super stars like DiCaprio, and with music courtesy of Radiohead, how can you go wrong? While the contemporary setting may turn some people off, they are missing the point.The point is, the time and place are essentially unimportant. Young love can happen anywhere and at anytime, and often does. So what does it matter if you have guns instead of swords? Or a mardi-gras style party instead of a stuffy costumed affair? What is important is that the audience feel connected to the original material, and despite its archaic language, truly FEEL the emotions the way Shakespeare intended.Thats what I love about this version. Even the uninitiated will lose any predisposition about the language, maybe even come to appreciate it! through a cleverly updated depiction they can more easily relate to.I give it a 10/10 because its awesome.",Romeo + Juliet
133,sergicaballeroalsina,Baroque drama in a rave party landscape.,9,11 March 2018,"A movie in which this text is faithfully interpreted should be a pretty movie even with eyes closed. We should agree that theoretically there is no better dramatic text than any classic from the pen of Shakespeare. From this I deduce that at least half of the artistic purpose of the film is satisfactorily resolved.
We could discuss its aesthetics although I think that has to do with personal taste.
A wannabe contemporary drama through the post-modern setting of the rave parties landscapes and an aesthetic halfway between cyber-punk and techno of the second half of the 90s that refers to other movies of the decade. In this way it achieves the task of transferring such an important text to those days.
I think that Baz Luhrmann could not have thought of a better way to recreate a paradigmatically baroque play that also containes his so characteristic aesthetic universe.
The simplicity or complexity of the characters can not be discussed either; Only the performances can be questioned, but they develop favorably through the remarkable work of the actors.
Be careful because if you are willing to contemplate the most famous love story in the world in a truly unprecedented environment, this can become one of your favorite dramas.",Romeo + Juliet
134,André-7,If you were a fourteen year old boy...,6,14 November 1999,"My fourteen year old nephew saw this film and loved it! He bought the soundtrack albums, he bought the video cassette. He bought the play. He then rented the Zeffirelli version and rented West Side Story. He then rented a couple of other movies based on other Shakespearean plays. He is now reading Hamlet.It is so easy to forget that the passions described by Shakespeare are those of teen-agers. It is perhaps equally easy to forget that this is a film adaptation, not the play.Film has its own rules. The filmmaker has a responsibility not to Shakespeare purists (Orson Welles, Olivier and Kurosawa understood this perfectly) but to the medium and the emotions of the text.Sure Baz Luhrman's version of this classic play is loud and often obnoxious. Certainly he uses effects that are considered ludicrous outside of a music video (and even then...)-pixilation, freeze frames, undercranking the camera, jump cuts that haven't been around since Jean-Luc Goddard was a young punk... But the point is exactly that! The kids love it! It is wild!

135,PizzicatoFishCrouch,Shakespeare made sexy for the teen generation.,9,17 August 2006,"Everyone is familiar with William Shakespeare's boy-meets-girl love story, and it has already been interpreted into films, plays, TV adaptations and songs. But Baz Luhrmann gives this world-known love story a modern-day twist, setting it in Verona Beach, and piling on the religious imagery. The result is quite spectacular.Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes play the star-crossed lovers, and, whilst the latter is sadly a little bland, never truly convincing us in her portrayal of Juliet's loss of innocence or torment of feelings towards the foe, DiCaprio completely redeems her performance. He is a revelation. His Romeo is a wonderful mix of sad eloquence, a loving heart and a troubled soul, and all these elements come together beautifully in a performance hotter than a pepper sprout, with more layers than the proverbial onion. He is the very embodiment of sexy in his role. There is an extremely alluring way in which his character is filmed, which only enhances Romeo as a lover. This is epitomized in the opening shot of him, where the Leo is illuminated illustriously against the sunlight, and Radiohead's languid, sexy tune ""Talk Show Host"" plays.The film itself has ""sexy"" written all over it, and, with the Gen X teenagers as his target audience, I don't think Luhrmann would have things any other way. But, unlike with that atrocity Moulin Rouge!, with Romeo + Juliet, the over-stylization is appropriate, making the movie more accessible to teens, for example, through gun warfare rather than swordplay, and the canny symbolisation of Queen Mab as a drug. But perhaps the most ingenious stylistic technique here is the slap-in-face Shakespearean references, which range from a ball called the Merchant of Venice, to 'Such stuff as dreams are made on' from The Tempest, making the film an absolute goldmine for trivia fans.Style aside, there is more than enough substance. Romeo is presented exactly as the play does  at first, the mawkish, gawky, lovesick teenager, then, the fickle boy, and finally, the devoted and caring lover, and much of this loyalty to the play is due to the screenplay from Luhrmann and Craig Pearce, which maintains the original memorable dialogue and descriptions, but also dares to stray from the sidewalk in some of the plot turns, and the film completely benefits from it. The set designs are intricate and beautiful, and suit every frame of the film perfectly, and the icing on the cake is the music. Craig Armstrong's score for the swimming pool scene is as stunning as it is original, and the use of non-original music, from Kym Mazelle to The Cardigans, give the film the added edge of cool, making Romeo + Juliet one of the boldest, sassiest and most unforgettable adaptations to date, and English Lit. GCSE has been made far more digestible for us kids across England. It's what Shakespeare would have wanted. A-.",Romeo + Juliet
136,doc-55,It was a pretty good idea gone sour,5,12 August 1999,"The play has been updated many times into contemporary or historic environments, often successfully as in West Side Story. The setting in southern California and once again conencting it with contemporary conflicts was a legitimate approach to the play. The language should have been updated as well, as has been done by a number of scholars. Using what was essentially Shakespeare's original text, while well-intentioned, created what I saw as the film's downfall. The young actors were just not up to the demands of Shakepearean dialogue. The production values were outstanding. It was a pretty good idea gone sour.",Romeo + Juliet

138,thegreatshonen,"Stylish and Confusing, But still Beautiful",8,15 January 2013,"Alright. This film is something. When I popped it in last week I knew what I was expecting and it surprised even me. This modern, bizarre, beautiful, crazy adaptation of one of Shakespeare's most beloved plays is something of a spectacle. It's a classic romance for MTV's generation X from one of the most electric directors of the last 20 years. And since I'm assuming up you passed a middle school literature/English class ill give slight spoilers.There's a lot for me to talk about in this film. Lets start off with the art style and dialogue. To use Shakespearean English in a modern setting is at 1st kinda off putting. But I grew use to it as the film went on and became immersed in the story. The cinematography is brilliant and gritty like a gang film while having richness and fulfillment of something from renaissance Europe. The acting is pretty good across the board. Leonardo Di Caprio and Claire Danes were pretty great. The said their lines well for young actors and besides a few scenes of over acting were good. ( Romeo pursuing Tybalt to kill him.) Their final scene is powerful and well done. The supporting cast was good to especially,Harold Perrinau (Mercutio), John Leguizamo (Tybalt), and Pete Postlethwaite (""Father Lawrence""). The music was good too and I love Talk Show Host by Radiohead( One of my favorite early songs by them). However film has flaws. Because they use Shakespearean English they are awkward moments in the movie like Romeo's Banishment and the use of guns called swords. The film use of helicopter in the final scene pursuing Romeo proved a tad excessive too. Also the use of News Casters in the beginning and end is also weird. Sometimes u can't take this seriously. And I didn't take this film to seriously. It's one of the most stylized and unique films I've seen. However it kinda fails in comparison to other Shakespearean adaptations, ( See Akira Kurosamwa's Ran) but its a fine film and worthy of being watched. If u hate the 90's or over the top movies, stay away. Everyone else, Enjoy.",Romeo + Juliet
139,davidtkd-25249,"Romeo + Juliet (1996): Even the ""Gnomeo"" version was Better than This Absolute Garbage!",1,31 January 2018,"Romeo + Juliet is a romantic drama film from 1996 starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes as the titular characters. The film was directed, co-written, and co-produced by Baz Luhrmann.The plot of the movie follows the original play released in 1597 by William Shakespeare. Nothing really else to say about the plot. If you've read the play, you know what the movie will be about. There are so many bad things about this movie. First off, the Montagues and Capulets use guns instead of swords as they did in the original play which is absolutely stupid. Why couldn't the cast during filming just get swords and make this movie more like the play they were basing it on? Also, my main problem with the movie is that the whole movie is exact quotations from the book, not normal talking like any normal movie that you've ever seen. I hate this as the movie gets so boring especially with its 2 hour runtime. The acting is terrible, with the exception of Leonardo DiCaprio. He makes an excellent performance as Romeo Montague. Overall, I hate this movie. I give it one star because I loved Leonardo DiCaprio's performance. Only watch this movie if you are a die-hard Romeo and Juliet fan or if you love romance movies. Otherwise, skip this one. Many may like, but not for me. A huge dissapointment and I'll probably never watch this movie again. 1/10.",Romeo + Juliet

141,lionel2,"classic turned absurd, 2/10",2,11 May 2003,"i finished watching the movie on the 4th attempt. during the first three times i found it unwatchable and shut the machine down. now after i finished it , i must say that there are a few moments in this movie that is worth watching but overall it is a failure.to begin with, the borrowed plot no longs stands well. there are two things that could not happen in the 1990s. first, juliet's fake death shouldn't have fooled people around. with death a clearly defined in medical terms, juliet is in a coma , not death. second, the priest could have informed romeo by a variety of means other than a letter about the trick. he could use mobile phone, a pager, a computer or even a person. it is interesting to see that in the whole movie, there is no scene involving using cell phones, maybe to cover up the unconvincing plot? but there is a scene in which a postal service female clerk is using a computer. so the plot is inconsistent with modern times.another issue which crippled the movie is that the romance between romeo and juliet is squeezed into very little time of the movie. there relationship is not seen developed in the movie, but forced forward in huge leaps. the net result is it feels that the thing between those two is nothing but youthful lust, not romantic love. in the other hand, the movie devoted major effort towards  other things. all those things worked as an anti-climax to the story. some commentators say  it is pathetic and i can't agree more. the only two scenes that are aesthetically pleasing are the moment when romeo first meet juliet and the moment when juliet is waking up but romeo has swallowed the real poison. last i want to say something about the cast. the best delivering person in this movie is the priest, who actually feels like shakespears' character. then comes juliet. it is because of her that a fews moments of this movie shine. the maiden and juliet's fiance are also decent but the rest of characters ( including romeo, who smoke and do drugs ) are really annoying, to say the least.i think that is about it, a failed attempt to exploit on shakespears' play. it is interesting to see that females under age of 18 are among the users that give the highest rating to this movie. so, i think i can finish off my comment with a sly smile on my face knowing that even movie as absurd as this one worked for teenagers. lol2 out of 10.",Romeo + Juliet

144,rose-18,surreal but with faults,10,18 July 1999,"While this modern version of Romeo and Juliet does have problems, it succeeds enough to win my recommendation. Set in a world that seems modern but even somewhat out of this world, this visualization is like a Salvador Dali painting, fascinating, new, strange. Some faults include excess modernization or costuming like Pete Posthlewaite's tattoo, Tybalt's ""gangsta"" like slickness and definitely Mercutio's drag outfit! That last scene and also the first are very weak and the film can occasionally be a bit awkward. However, Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio are excellent. Both have done much of their previous and future work in depressing or tragic roles and both are very convincing with their agony and emotions here. Some of the cinematography is beautifully shot, notably the kiss in the elevator and the aquarium scene. This film should also be commended for exposing teenagers or other modern movie watchers to Shakespeare and how his work is completely relevant today.",Romeo + Juliet

This Shakespearean play, made into current situations has been done to the best extent. By using original lines from the play itself, and current location and dress, this version of Romeo and Juliet should appeal to all audiences. It's not made out to be twisted or too thought provoking. It's merely a beautiful story well crafted into a beautiful movie. The use of a large city, and the way it is separated was a nice way to show the conflict, and a TV anchor as the narrator also added a nice 90's touch.",Romeo + Juliet
146,davidgoesboating,Great version of Shakespearian play,9,18 January 2005,"I thought this was a fantastic version of the original Shakespearian play. While, in my opinion, the lead actor Leonardo Di Caprio was good without being brilliant, the others perform magnificently. The soundtrack is possibly the best I've heard. Another credit is that it might actually get kids vaguely interested in Shakespeare (or may not), as at least I have found I can recite some parts of it word for word. Probably the only problems were the title (Romeo and Juliet would have been cool, ""Romeo + Juliet"" sounds really tacky) and some of the slightly strange editing at times. The whole thing of people speaking Shakespearian in a 21st century world seems a bit strange, but in my opinion it works. This film is certainly in my top 10 all time films.",Romeo + Juliet
147,DutchECK,Nice try,6,2 August 2006,"It's a nice idea: putting the original text of Romeo and Juliet into a modern, urbanised, setting. It will appeal to a much younger audience (making it instantly suitable for classroom use) and it will show the world that what Shakespeare wrote is still applicable to modern day. Unfortunately, it did not work out the way it should have. One of the fatal flaws was that the text was not followed as closely as I would have liked it. In fact, things were added that were hideously out of place and two important parts that should have been included have been omitted. However, it is virtually impossible to create an exciting film without playing with the text a little, so the writers have been forgiven as far as I'm concerned.The one thing that I really cannot let pass is the combination the setting makes with the text. Keeping the original text with a modern setting has been done successfully in the past. The director here chose to make the setting and its characters over the top. The way the young Montagues and the young Capulets are portrayed may be clear, but it is also annoying to see that the Montagues are shown as surfer/stoners and the Capulets as Latino gangsters. This, combined with the setting, decors and acting makes for a film that is extremely over the top. This simply does not work with a text that is subtle, where most of the humour and entertainment is to be had from small quips and remarks, not from broad-sweeping statements and grandeur. Especially the love between Romeo and Juliet should be quiet, not playful as it is in this film.Of course there are some good things about this film. In keeping with Shakespeare's love of subtle word jokes, this film has quite a few. There are several 'hidden' hints to other Shakespearean plays. Also, I liked the newscaster as opening chorus. This gave the film an air of modernity while still keeping the goal of the prologue, which is introducing the play. These things made for a two hours that were not completely awful.I am somewhat of a purist when it comes to Shakespeare, although I do like it when people take freedoms with the text or the setting. However, Romeo + Juliet strayed too far from the nest.",Romeo + Juliet

Cinematography and sound track all great a great visual experimente, as in Moulin Rouge.However, the idea of the movie seems weird and a bit outlandish. One thing, you stay absolutely true to the Shakespearan original plot, cenarios, etc. (but obviously it wouldn't appeal to the public it set out to appeal) or you do a modern adaptation and bring the story to a modern context.The idea of reading 16th century baroque dialogues while shootings go on and fast cars roam just seems extremely strange and intriguing. It just feels like an unfortunate mix Shakespeare's undisputed prestige and action movie's undeniable attraction that doesn't really work that well.The two things are simply very different.

There is humour, Drama, fine action and acting and great Direction.  Baz Lurhman is truly a genius.I got it on dvd last year, and got some odd looks from my current girlfriend.

Perhaps I still had in mind the 3 other Shakespearean films that I loved - and understood. That love ended here. While I appreciate what they were going for in this - probably to make high school kids enjoy it more (I'm a Much Ado about Nothing fan myself). However, the attempted mixing of modern day Verona and Shakeespearean language just don't seem to mix. While in any other setting (almost) the language might seem deep, perhaps difficult to follow,yet in this movie it just seemed insincere, and very stiff.

153,Bluegull99,difficult to rate,7,20 February 2020,"Oh well, this one is difficult for me to rate. On the one hand I have a fanatastic memory of this movie, of 1996, me being 18, sitting in the late night smoker cinema (yes, something like that existed back in the 90s, a cinema where the audience could smoke while watching the movie - unimaginable today ;)) with a friend and through all the smoke we watched the really intense pictures this movie offers, the darkness, the many candles, paired with the classic and wonderful poetry of Shakespeare. Then and now I was impressed by DiCaprio and Danes, both gave such a believable and intense show of the doomed romance. And yes, in that last scene in the church it is hard not to cry.Back then, being 18, I was totally impressed and amazed by the movie, coming with the described cinema setting and the fact I was just 18.
Now, almost 25 years later, I watched the movie again last night. Weirdly enogh I got kind of annoyed now by the fact that the wonderful Shakepeare language is a bit, well, stained by the fact it is spoken in slurry American English. I have meanwhile seen English Shakepspeare plays with British native actors, and I guess that's the reason it just bothers me now in the movie as it kind of cheapens the beautiful language and at several times the pronounciation is so bad that it's hard to comprehend.Another thing is, that these over the top party scenes with all that screaming or the screaming and shooting scenes annoyed me now too. I fast forwarded here and there as the pronounciation was so bad and it was all screaming so it didn't matter anyways.
What still really makes the movie worthwile is the scenes with DiCaprio and Danes, they are so lovely and intenses, they alone make it worthwile and still worth seven stars.",Romeo + Juliet

But if you are not, this is a wonderful play very well done, with a very good cast (I particularly don't like di Caprio but here the guy is good). From my point of view, this movie keeps the essence of the drama and puts it on something close to L.A. Hey there are still some people who don't like West Side Story either!

You will notice this from the very first scene (incidentally my personal favourite Shakespeare scene) but I do not think that this distracts from the plot or the quality of the great playwright himself. It has been modernised to best of anyone's ability, and it is to Lurhmann's that this still looks like a Shakespeare, and has most of the dialogue making sense in a modern setting.This is actually one film in which Leonardo DiCaprio acts well, as helped by a great cast, including stellar performances by Harold Perrineau and John Leguizamo. All of the symbols used in he production were effective, if a little obvious, and all in all this film is slick and true to the original, down to even the minutest details. Even though little tributes to the original setting sometimes are a little 'in your face', they are nice, and further add to the sense of respect the film has for the play.I am a great one for conventional, traditional performances of Romeo and Juliet, but I have to say that this is a very good film, and grips to the last, even though everyone knows what happens.",Romeo + Juliet

Many people think that the movie is just a gangbanning play off of the classic 15th century play but it isn't and it especially speaks to the new generation. The sound track is amazing.  I used to have it but my brother broke it in half but if you have a chance to hear it listen to it.  Especially the theme song by Des'rea.  This movie is just so touching.  So many opportunity to stop them from killing them selves but it just went by.  You'll be asking yourself why didn't the deliverer ask for romeo.  Why didn't the Priest stop romeo's friend.

He's just *not* Romeo. Danes on the other hand is doing brilliantly as Juliet, and she's the only one close to making her Shakespearean lines believable in this weird MTV-style chaos of 'modern Verona'. The whole combination is just too absurd - I can't imagine how they decided on which parts of the amazing love story to destroy and revamp, and which parts to preserve - but it just doesn't work.Think someone destroying parts of Colosseum and replacing those random parts with steel, glass, and colourful paints. You just don't do such thing!If you love sparkling visuals like this, see Moulin Rouge instead - there, Luhrmann successfully mixed all his eccentric elements into one stunning musical. If you love Shakespeare, try 1968's Romeo and Juliet instead - it makes much more sense and is less of an insult to this great work of Shakespeare.

Perhaps my hatred for unnecessary modernizations of classics has overtaken my opinions, but there is no reason to place a Shakespeararean play and put it in a modern setting unless it's going to be put in some use or say something different from other adaptations. Shakespeare Retold did so and that was why that series worked, but the only reason this movie seems to exist is to appeal to a more shallow audience without any intellectual value whatsoever. What I especially hate about this adaptation is not only how it pays more attention to the romance than it should do the feud between the families, but none of the actors look like they know what they were saying. Lurhmann certainly doesn't, which is made clear when he twists Mercutio's Queen Mab speech from a monologue about the challenges and temptations of lovers to a speech about drugs. If a director can't understand Shakespeare, or even has the nerve to twist his poetry that way, then he shouldn't take on that play in the first place.The actors are vapid, the direction is awful, the editing is terrible, the setting is tacky beyond belief, it's unnecessary and it's just plain insulting to Shakespeare's text. My only hope is that Baz Lurhmann pays more attention in English class before he takes on another classic. In fact, he should just avoid classics and save him a shred of dignity.",Romeo + Juliet

Seeing it again this time I realized how horrible pretty boy Leonardo di Caprio and Claire Daines sound. Their pronunciation is lousy and they just don't have any sense of enunciation. Just watch Di Caprio's scenes with Pete Postlethwaite's Laurence: day & night. The movie is so well intentioned, the updating ideas are good, the production design excellent; even the frantic editing and the pop music fit this modern adaptation. But everything fails if your two main characters are played by modest actors who can't follow the archaic yet beautiful language of the great bard.A pity.",Romeo + Juliet
167,mccormick632,This Film SUCKS!,1,3 October 2011,"Oh my god, where do I begin with this movie? To put it bluntly, its the worst, most god-awful movie I have ever seen in my entire life! It's boring, its stupid, its everything that is wrong with adapting a play written hundreds of years ago into a modern setting.Romeo + Juliet is a travesty, a mind-blowing awful attempt at legitimate cinema. It fails on every level: costumes, drama, characters, excitement, etc. Swords become guns, yet are still referred to as swords, the Capulets become a clichéd Mexican gang (or was that just Tybalt?) and yet somehow Juliet is not even remotely Hispanic. Romeo plays pool while smoking and uttering words like, ""thee,"" ""thy,"" and ""thou,"" which incidentally is one of the worst scenes I have ever seen in a film. It just bugs the heck out of me and I can't take the film seriously.The story is classic but not here. The film puts the Romeo and Juliet story into a modern day setting, while still retaining the original script. Leading to the infamous scene which I mentioned previously, this also leads to some rather hilarious moments when characters are meant to have a dramatic moment yet still speak in traditional English dialect.I hate this movie, so very, very much. I hate the idea, I hate the execution, I hate the sets, the costumes, everything. I hate it.When writing his review of ""North,"" Roger Ebert finished his review with the now famous saying: ""I hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated hated this movie. Hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it. Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it."" Couldn't have said it better myself.",Romeo + Juliet

There is an uncomfortable clash between the modern setting and the original Shakespearean dialogue. The dialogue is delivered as though it were written by a contemporary writer-as is the point. However as a result the tone of the actors is wrong- for much of the film the cast sound as though they are about to break into laughter. 1990's teenagers reading 15th century literature in this tone simply doesn't work. It is in this that the adaptation loses its power, by diminishing the power of the original story Luhrmann's film has nothing but lots of fancy, overly stylised camera work?oh and Leo, which speaks volumes for the success of the film. Aimed at the teenage (female) audience much of it?s success was surely down to the young heart-throb?s presence.I realise I've gone on about the dialogue quite a bit but considering this is an adaptation of a play i think it is fair criticism.",Romeo + Juliet
170,Manya086,Modern Shakespeare???,2,17 October 2015,"This modern attempt of Shakespeare's famous Romeo & Juliet was a failure. The Shakespearean language in a modern setting do not mix! If director, Baz Luhrmann, wanted to modernize Shakespeare to appeal to a younger generation, he or the writers should have modernized to language too.The performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes were less than average. As the star-crossed lovers they lacked on screen chemistry. Their individual performances were fair, but considering this was early in their respective careers, I am willing to overlook it. Though I must admit, I am a fan of both Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes work, but this was not their best. Furthermore, what pains me is the iconic ending scene; it made no impact on me whatsoever.Overall, Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet is a disgrace to Shakespeare.

Needless to say but the final result was awful. What was wrong with it? Well let me tell you.First, the use of Shakespearean dialogue in a modern setting took me out of the movie. It was very gimmicky and it didn't flow right. Second, the acting is pretty bad. Even Leonardo DiCaprio gives a very bland performance. Third, the direction and editing is really frantic and crazy. The beginning you are just wondering what is going on? This is especially bad because you are supposed to take the story seriously but it's so hard to do so because the way how the film is put together is laughably bad. and finally, the pacing is awful! I don't know how many times I checked my watch during the movie to see if it was going to be over soon or not.The only good thing I can say about this film is the art direction and costume design. It's all very well done but that's nowhere near enough to save this travesty of a film.Please, even if you are a die hard fan of Leonardo DiCaprio like I am and feel the need to see every single one of his movies, avoid this film at all costs.

I agreed and next thing I know, my faith in Leonardo DiCaprio's acting career is restored. This young man did such an amazing job in this film, I'm surprised he didn't get nominated for an Oscar for that role.I've always been a big fan of Shakespeare, especially Romeo and Juliet, and I've never seen such an awesome rendition of the timeless tale of true love and tragedy. Mercutio was portrayed with amazing truthfulness to his real character, as were Paris and Tybalt. I was even impressed with the Nurse's part in the film and I was never a fan of her in the play!! I must say, my favorite character of all was Father Laurence. He's so cliché in the play, the typical priest, however in this film he had true character! Of course, it doesn't hurt that he was played by my ALL TIME FAVORITE actor, Pete Postlethwaite. This part was very reminiscent of his role in Dragonheart.More or less, Romeo and Juliet is the best movie ever and I recommend it to anyone and everyone. :)",Romeo + Juliet
178,Acetylcholine,Shakespeare Worthy,10,17 May 1999,"Very underrated modernization of the classic Shakespeare play.  This movie has been pretty heavily criticized for the directors outlandishness in cinematography, but he understands when to tone down the often frantic pace of the storytelling during the dramatic scenes, and in fact this relationship tends to amplify their potency. Beautifully choreographed and shot, wonderfully acted by both the supporting cast and the main 2 stars, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, and extremely sly modernization techniques to the dialogue.  All the elizabethan dialogue remains intact, yet it all seems coherent in the modern atmosphere. mostly due to good imagery and double meaning in the phrases (ex: their swords being a gun model, or the flash of money while quoting gold.).  One of the best shakespeare adaptations in the multitude of which have entered the cinemas in the past few years.",Romeo + Juliet

Nobody I know speaks conversationally in iambic pentameter. The language begs for a more stylized delivery. I did like many of the sets and the ""rival gang"" flavor however. The helicoptors and car chases were dramatic and something that I could easily accept as something Shakespeare might have included if he had written the play in the current era. I can see why many people enjoyed this film. I just couldn't accept Shakespeare's language in modern conversational tones. It made the acting seem abysmal in places and totally unbelievable throughtout. It often seemed as if the actors had no idea of the meaning of the words they spoke. I'm sure this was not true, but the delivery made it seem so.",Romeo + Juliet
180,bsl05,"excellent job by cast, very good movie",9,20 April 2004,"I actually saw this movie in the theater and wasn't much interested going into it (read: my girlfriend, now wife, chose the movie that night).  As I watched, the movie was lacking very much until the scene where DiCaprio and Danes meet with ""Kissing You"" being sung in the background.  That part changed the whole movie for me because of the easily recognized chemistry between the two of them - all without saying a word.  Since then I have come to appreciate this movie even more, and watch anytime it's on TV.The acting is excellent.  So good in fact, that the ending everyone knows will happen seems illogical - you believe they deserve so much better, that it will work out.  Leo showed why he was one of the best actors in Hollywood, pre-Titanic.  And I don't mean ""best under 25 or 30 years old,"" I mean overall.  Before the Titanic backlash, he was as solid as anyone. Also, Perrineau was unbelievable, stealing every seen he was in.  And Leguizamo again shows why is such a highly underrated actor.  I believe Danes was perfect casting for Juliet, nailing the role.The style may turn a lot of people off, but Baz Luhrmann made it worked very well as he always does.  Overall, this is a very good movie carried by the exceptional performances of the mentioned actors and even Pete Postlethwaite in a small role being his usual solid self.9/10",Romeo + Juliet

This good-for-nothing film is Shakespeare material presented in a pretty bad way. For example, it would have been a whole lot better if they could manage saying the same stuff in Shakespearian, but only in plain English. That, and the environment. If you ask me, it's in a poor setting for this movie. Verona BEACH, California has never been somewhere where anyone talks like this and it totally falls out of place for the dialogue. For a Shakepeare film, the setting has the following:1. Masquarades where everybody is dressed like idiots and nothing really recklessly matters in their case 2. Cars 3. A pool instead of a balcony 4. Guns 5. Other stuff that is needlessly exaggeratedThe only good things about it are the soundtrack and the 1968 version which is much closer to the way it is suppose to be for the dialogue AND the setting. See that instead and skip this. Not recommended.1/10 stars.",Romeo + Juliet

Whereas the likes of O and 10 Things I Hate About You are updated in both style/look and dialogue, the fact is this made them seem less relevant and watered-down.Keeping the dialogue in Romeo + Juliet means that you focus on what is said AND THE EXPRESSIONS and keeps the story powerful whilst updating the setting to modern-day Verona Beach (gangs, guns and narcotic-induced partying) make it feel real. An excellent movie with one of the best intros I've ever seen (nice little news cast and introduction of the gang fighting/rivalry).(Pity about Moulin Rouge though!!!)

186,Nootered,"Thou may enjoy thy film, but I won't.",6,23 March 2017,"Based on the original screenplay by William Shakespeare, Romeo + Juliet attempts to take more of a modern approach to the film, but in my opinion fails to deliver. Don't get me wrong, some aspects of the film were at most ""meh"", but I found the film bizarre and also scrappily put together. Don't get me wrong people will still find enjoyment out of this film depending on their taste, but I just found this to be a somewhat weak comedy with a few scenes of romance.The plot: very similar if not just an adaptation of the original screenplay. There isn't much to say here, apart from the fact that they more or less used all the original lines from Shakespeare's classic. This is very interesting and it's nice that they experimented with this, despite making the film even more confusing as I constantly try to decide whether this film is based in the past or the present. The characters seem to be relatively corny and while they have their dialog to characterize them which actually lets them stand out from the minor characters, they also have a sort of comedic twist to them (seriously how is this not a comedy?). A good example of this is Mercutio. At the start of the film, he was wearing bizarre clothes, and I'm not joking when I say that I thought his character was supposed to be a reference to how women didn't act in Shakespearian times, as it was thought to be ""unladylike"". The characters themselves were executed relatively fine; nothing more, nothing less.The music used a blend of classic songs with more late 90s songs. While this was an interesting mix, this somehow worked. With the tone of the film being fairly light hearted and cheesier then dark and edgy on some scenes, the songs worked to make it feel like a parody of Romeo and Juliet. I still don't know if it is a parody or not, but I can't be bothered to research it.Overall, this film was decent at most and also bizarre and annoying at most. At the end I kept screaming ""JUST LOOK DOWN ROMEO OH MY GOD"", before Romeo was about to poison himself. I found this moment unrealistic, as if you're going to show the character die, don't make them start to wake up in that moment and instead wake up as Romeo is dying, unless this was intentional of course, so good job on that. Overall, I found this film at most funny and at least corny. I'd give this film a 6/10.",Romeo + Juliet
187,Grifter84,Good concept ruined by talentless leads,4,26 July 1999,"This film has the makings of greatness, but falls so short after the first scene. The vibrant visual style and art direction is brilliant and the director handles the updating of the classic 16th century love story almost seamlessly. On top of that, the supporting cast, especially Postlethwaite, Sorvino and Leguizamo are well suited to the roles.It all falls apart, however, when we are introduced to our leads. Leonardo Dicaprio has proved himself to be a talented actor in such films as ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" and ""This Boy's Life,"" but his just isn't him at his best. He tries hard, but he's inexperienced with Shakespeare and can't get himself around the unnatural language and rhythm. Those lines he doesn't mangle he shouts unintelligibly.Clare Danes gave us a good performance in ""The Rainmaker,"" but is totally uninspired in this role. Her style is flat, and she delivers the lines with as much talent as the average highschooler would in a school production.The director had what could have been a very powerful and entertaining movie, but undermines it with the casting of two singularly unsuited actors in the title roles for the sake of drawing more of the MTV teenage crowd to the box office.For a better rendition of Juliet, I suggest Olivia Hussey in the 1968 Zeffirelli version.  For a better Romeo, try Gwyneth Paltrow's transgender performance in ""Shakespeare in Love.""",Romeo + Juliet
188,Lia-74937rs,It's What Shakespeare Would Have Wanted.,10,15 May 2020,"I understand why people might not like this movie, but I must respectfully disagree. The script is very loyal to the original play, and the modernized aesthetics are, in my opinion, very loyal to the ever too often overlooked spirit of so much of Shakespeare's work. Basically, it was pop-culture, and it was not drama but melodrama, every production was filled with innuendo and over the top characters. Because of the language and aesthetics of the time, Shakespeare can often feel somewhat boring or stuffy, so a version where those visual aesthetics have been updated to something we today (and at the time the firm was made) understand as over-the-top is somewhat genius, to be honest, it captures the essence of Shakespeare that is so often lost in modernity.Beyond the (surely annoying) lit analysis, the casting is also great - not even just because of Paul Rudd, this movie also has my absolute favourite version of Mercutio!All in all I think this movie gets a bad rap sometimes because its a bit more fun and indulgent than most adaptations, but that's what makes it so great!",Romeo + Juliet

This movie has the plot of Romeo and Juliet (young man falls in love with the rival family's daughter).This movie was very stylish, the visuals were great and the actors were also pretty good(especially the one who played the priest I can't remember his name).Luhrmann succeeded in creating a world almost like our own but with some touch of surreality which was strenghtened by the shakespearian dialogue. In only few points did the dialogue bother me and that was when there wasn't great deal to say.In the end, the movie was really entertaining with a touch of magic in it(especially in the water tank sequence).

We all know about the *plot spoiler* ending with Romeo finding Juliet seemingly dead, killing himself before she wakes up and then kills herself, but did Baz Luhrman have to do it in such a silly way? The first example, is the set, which looks very dangerous. In fact it looks stupidly dangerous with all those candles around. No church would have that many candles lit and left unattended. If they had wanted to cremate her, why did they not have it done properly?! Next comes Romeo perched on the side of the bed. It's obvious that she's waking up. Her fingers move on his hand. She opens her eyes and she's grinning at him with a smile that is so white it could blind. Yet he drinks the poison and she tries to suck it off of his lips. She might have well stuck her tongue down his throat for all the good that it did. Then she eventually spots his gun and as calm as anything puts it to her head and fires. They end up just lying there dead together, with just a few splatters of blood. There would have been much more blood (and brain) than that. It just really annoyed me that what could have been a very emotional scene was so long drawn out and done in a way that shows that perhaps the star cross'd lovers only have a brain cells between them. I'm annoyed with that. (And Mercutio dying because he was just lovely).",Romeo + Juliet

The biggest problem comes back to the fact that it's modern day, because it isn't relatable to how Romeo and Juliet's lives were like, instead its more like a insulting joke that isn't funny by the way from the bad costumes to Juliet dressed like an angel and Romeo in cheap shining armor to the pathetic performances from otherwise very talented actors even Leonardo Dicaprio's performance was embarrassing to watch.

If you didn't, that's too bad. It's like going on a roller-coaster and then complaining you got the heevy-jeevys. What did you expect, I ask you with tears in my cotton pickin' eyes? And it's not as though the brave, original Mr. Lurhmann butchered Shakespeare's text - he didn't. Sure, he edited it where he felt he needed to, and changed the ending (which I disagreed with) but every word you hear was written by the Bard himself - hence the title W.S.'s R&J.Enough people enjoyed this movie to warrant its worthy place in the canon of Shakespeare on Film - and those (purists) that didn't should have know beforehand that it would not be their cup of tea. That's why we have the wonderful, definitive Zefferelli R&J - which this movie sure didn't attempt to compete with.Personally, I thought this movie was a blast. That newscast opening scene (prologue) was wonderful. I rubbed my hands in imaginary glee when I saw it, because I knew I was in for a treat - and sure was.

If Leonardo DiCaprio had declaimed and emoted and tried to chew up the scenery, he would have fallen flat. Instead, he just read the lines; and it worked. The same applies to the rest of the cast. They all just read the lines (convincingly, but not Shakespearean-ly) and got on with the play. I especially liked Miriam Margolyes playing The Nurse as a Mexican maid.

199,andrew_zito,Contemporized not Modernized,10,31 March 2014,Contemporized not ModernizedSome many reviews of this tasty film misuse the English in saying this production modernized Shakespeare's Romeo Juliet so patiently I resist beating down such verbalizations and those that present such limited misrepresentations. This film is deeper than a mere modernization it not only makes Shakespeare's Romeo Juliet understandable to a modern audience but liberates them from reactionary nostalgic beliefs for these are the contemporary wise guys dames thugs dudes and others so often marginalized by a society that demonizes humanity for all its wrongs characterized wrongly in what the government appoints itself the arbiter of in monopoly of what it sells and dictates but denies in others as it is all right just and proper.A fine production fine acting fine writing fine set designs in an eternal romance as such will never die as a story that lives forever in that it is told so as to be brought to each generation a new in what is so well felt and inspires human beings where before there was none. In hopes of a better world that is prepared in the old world being seeded with new thoughts for new blood for new life in films by which we find life and meaning to our own miserable existence.,Romeo + Juliet

It was my first movie that showed the character introduction in a movie. It felt more like a TV show rather than a movie. I really didn't like this movie because the style is very different from other movies and it is very overacted.I really don't like the story style where this director put Shakespeare's work into a modern world. I think it's special, unique and nice try but I feel like it was way too much. Putting Shakespeare's work into modern society made the whole movie so awkward. Also, having the same script as the original wasn't a great idea, because it all seemed so awkward and foolish.Also the actors are kind of very overacting. I feel that their acting should be less overacting because in modern days, overacting isn't something that is normal. Because of the overacting, I feel like the whole movie became so awkward and crazy. I really didn't like it and it is not my type. However, some of the actors were Good, such as Decaprio, so I think...I gave 6. For it's uniqueness and some good actors.",Romeo + Juliet

203,johnno74,Shakespeare messed up!,1,19 October 2010,"The film is based on one of William Shakespeare's plays about two rival families and one from each family falling in love and their relationship basically causes controversy between the groups. Baz Luhrmann's film is a basic modern version of the Shakespearean play, but the film itself does not work. Luhrmann uses modern clothes and weapons etc, but he has kept the Shakespearean dialogue. The dialogue and the modern elements do not mix together well. The acting is dreadful and immature and the fight scenes are badly choreographed. Nice try for a modern version Luhrmann, but West Side Story is better than this one. Message; Luhrmann shouldn't touch Shakespeare.",Romeo + Juliet
204,savagehouseparty,Poor,4,9 January 2012,"We studied this movie last year in English and I have to say, I did not find it as interesting, as well done or as breathtaking as many others who I know that have watched it. If you loved this movie, please hear me out before accusing me of being a hater or anything like that. 1. The action scenes were overdone. Luhrmann tries much too hard to make the action scenes that of a blockbuster, using over the top acting and unnecessary high angle shots. 2. I am the first to say that Shakespeare was a genius, but I thought that the inclusion of the original text did not go hand in hand with the modern day style of the film very well. 3. Claire Danes is far from impressive in the role of Juliet. 4. I found the almost incestuous relationship between Tybalt and Juliet's mother a little weird and stupid, really. However, there were some redeeming factors to this otherwise poor film 1. Leonardo DiCaprio acts well. 2. The costume design is done tastefully 3. Radiohead is in the soundtrack. All up, I found the film a poor representation of William Shakespeare's iconic classic.",Romeo + Juliet

206,phil1945,"A movie that stands on its own, even in the shadow of a literary masterpiece.",8,18 August 2013,"It's not often, when a director is able to a reinvent an iconic story, and make us look at a well-known piece of literature in a different light. Director Baz Luhrmann does just that. With the help of a superb cast that includes; Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, John Leguizamo among others, Luhrmann retells one of the most popular and tragic love stories of all time.The plot and dialog are authentically Shakespearean. However, Luhrmann dares to make a risky move by transporting the events of the movie into the late 1990's. The horses become flashy cars, the dagger and swords are replaced by uniquely elegant and fearsome pistols and the streets of old Verona look more like the concrete jungles of Los Angeles, in this place called Verona Beach. This move by the director is bold to say the least, but the risk sure pays off, creating one of the more original movies in the full sense of the word.This movie is fast, but does not race to the end, giving the viewer an opportunity to enjoy every scene. It is flashy and colorful, yet not overbearing or pretentiously grandiose. It is fun and tragically sad at the same time. The two most important aspects of this movie for me, were; precise attention to details, (costumes, sets, cars, weaponry,) and the fact that the movie, although being a serious one, does not take itself too seriously.The characters of the movie are vibrant and extravagant. Romeo and Juliet are young, naive, passionate and madly in love, just as they are in the play. Tybalt and Mercutio steal the movie in my opinion. They are eccentric, flashy, arrogant and aggressive yet graceful. They are the kind of characters that you want to know more about, even after their roles have expired.Not everyone will be able to appreciate this movie, just like not everyone will be excited about listening to Shakespearean style language for 2 hours (I recommend watching this movie with subtitles.) But those who do, will truly enjoy this original film, which manages to do what most movies only wish they could.It stands on its own.",Romeo + Juliet
207,iron_jawed_angel91,Horrendous!!,1,27 June 2005,"Firstly, the story of Romeo and Juliet has been done too many times, and contains no real substance. Second, this modern angle makes it worse than ever before. DiCaprio is a terrible actor, they should have cast someone who can show emotion and speak properly. Danes annoys me because she is always emotionless and appears to be high. The soundtrack had nothing to do with the movie, and was irritating. The only amusing part was when Mercutio dressed up as a transvestite. Bad movie, poorly made, overrated, and painful to watch. Did I mention that the story is insulting to women? If you're looking for a good Shakespearean romance flick, check out ""Shakespeare In Love"", instead.",Romeo + Juliet
208,sicparvismagna,It's a Shame,1,4 September 2006,"I find it a shame that most people rated this movie highly just because it consists of many stars.I do not see any other possible reason to why anyone would even consider rating this movie a 10. That is not a very good reason, either. The actors/actresses do not just make movies great because they are in them, it's their performance (which, in this particular movie, was decent), but it's also about the MOVIE, itself.I highly dislike this movie, which is a shame because I like many people that star in it, discluding Leonardo DiCaprio.I like the fact that they had decided to make a modern day Romeo and Juliet, but this one sucked. I hated the way they talked, and the nicknames that they had made for certain items. Tsk.Just watch the movie and find out for yourself.",Romeo + Juliet

The story is old and well known to most. The actors seem like hotties with experienced actors, and on paper this would have been hard to argue against, but solid acting all around with great innovation (guns for swords, set in modern day) it holds up well and creates reputations for actors otherwise considered 'eye candy'. Two people come off very well in my opinion, Leonardo Dicaprio (as Romeo) and John Leguizamo (as Tybalt). With Leo playing the part of someone who thinks he's is in love to actually falling in love and Leguizamo as the relative with hatred and anger which is channeled greatly towards his foe. Well thought through and some times cool, Baz Luhrmann (director) pulls out all the stops and defies expectation, truly spectacular!",Romeo + Juliet

212,CanadianBeaver,READ THE PLAY!,3,11 September 1999,"This is my message to director Baz Lhurman.  Shakespeare's text is studied in high school english for good reason...there is DEPTH!  I don't think the director knows what a tragic flaw is, and even if he did, did he make any effort to present that?  Advertisements for this movie always spoke to the 'star crossed lovers' aspect.  Once again I wonder does Baz know what FATE is?I won't say something subjective like: DeCaprio was great or DeCaprio stank. I say objectively that his raw emotion that he brought to the screen was excellent, but this emotion does not replace understanding for the lines he's saying (i.e. he had no understanding of the lines he was saying).  The director is the one responsible for this lack of comprehension... if you're going to do shakespeare, you have to know what it is you're talking about.To be blunt this movie was the worst interpretation of shakepeare's play that I have ever witnessed.  Shame on Baz that he botched it so badly.  My advice to him is READ THE PLAY!",Romeo + Juliet
213,Kane-C,Modern Shakespeare,6,28 June 1999,"The most popular love story in history, William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, converted to modern day sets. The director and writer of the movie decided to handle the conflicts between modern day sets and Shakespeare's original texts with the means of comedy. This was not necessarily a bad idea, since Shakespeare may be somewhat boring at times, and small humorous bits make the movie..well, less boring. But the result was, that Luhrmann almost turned the love story of all times into the comedy of the year. The movie is by no means bad, but it does not have the spirit of Shakespeare's texts. This movie is a disgrace to the original play, but if one is able to ignore this fact, one can see this movie as a brilliant love story. Well, of course it is, it's Shakespeare after all, so the story is exceptional. Leonardo DiCaprio shows yet again that he is not just a pretty boy, but he can act, too! His performance is brilliant, and Clare Danes' is amazing, also. So a movie with wonderful acting performances and an exceptional script can't be bad, but there's just a tad too much humor involved, this story does not need that. I can't help myself, I am comparing the movie to the original play, so I think the movie is not that great.",Romeo + Juliet

The art direction and cinematography alone is enough to captivate the audience. Brilliant film editing as well.Performances from Harold Perrineau (Mercutio)and Leonardo Dicaprio (Romeo) definitely stole the film. Harold Perrineau, not only giving a brilliant dramatic performance, but also injecting some comedy into the film. Leonardo DiCaprio also gives an incredible performance as Romeo, showing him to be very loving and caring, but also a tortured character, searching for happiness. Although Claire Danes plays Juliet's innocence and youthfulness quite well, I think she makes Juliet unlikable, and I didn't feel like I could warm to her as much as Romeo.The tragic ending comes as no surprise, as we've all known the story for so long. But Leo and Claire made it believable and very moving.A modern, teenage themed phenomenon. Beautifully shot, with great performances. Highly Recommended.",Romeo + Juliet
215,afreimann,Shakespeare that ANYONE can enjoy!,10,26 September 2004,"I highly recommend this for those who find the reading of Shakespearean text difficult but have a desire to explore his masterful works. The modern-day setting and the brilliant dramatic interpretations rendered by the actors (all wonderfully cast, incidentally) transform Shakespeare's tragic masterpiece into a modern-day cinematic tour de force. DiCaprio and Danes are believably cast together (although Danes' natural conservatism is occasionally apparent, though not to any detrimental affect). Sorvino as Capulet is forceful, powerful,and immovable (just what this viewer believes Shakespeare probably had in mind as he penned the classic). Mercutio (Harold Perrineau Jr.) is powerfully moving in the entirety of his portrayal. This movie is visually mesmerizing. I HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind and appreciation for excellent theatre.",Romeo + Juliet
216,emee4real,Oh Please!! The 1968 version is a whole lot better than this crap!,1,30 November 2007,"I can't believe there are people who actually like this version of Shakespeare's play. Or those who prefer it to the 1968 version. The producers who wished to make a ""modern-day"" Romeo & Juliet just failed woefully. Only Leonardo DiCaprio seemed to stand out with his portrayal of Romeo (and that's because he's such good actor); isn't it a surprise that his 1968 predecessor is also named Leonard (Whiting)? But let's face it: Claire Danes was so damned unconvincing as Juliet and very plain too. She is nowhere near the beautiful, talented Olivia Hussey, who wowed the audience with her performance as Juliet in 1968. No matter how you look at it, the part of Juliet doesn't fit her at all!Also, in the 1968 adaptation, Michael York made me admire the Tybalt character, as he portrayed him with a cool and calm grace that nearly made Tybalt a likable character (even though we know he isn't). Unfortunately, John Leguizamo's Tybalt was so downright irritating and annoying that he made him a whole lot more unpleasant than Shakespeare himself did. There are several issues I find appalling in this flick. In the first place, who says that Tybalt beats up Romeo when Romeo initially declines to fight him? Because Shakespeare definitely didn't. Secondly, when the bloke who plays Benvolio says ""Part, fools! Put up your swords; you know not what you do"", I'm like ""Swords? What swords? They are using GUNS, not swords"". Why doesn't he say: ""Hey! Put your guns down!""? That would have been more realistic.Thirdly, Harold Perrineau's Mercutio, unlike that of John McEnery, is simply brash. He doesn't have the wit. And the idea of dressing him up like a drag queen is simply disgusting.And finally, 4 crying out loud, who said Juliet woke up just before Romeo's death. Didn't the director read the story? I believe if Shakespeare got up from his grave and seen what they had done with his play, he'd call down GOD's curse on the script writers. In short, I was so disgusted with the movie that I wished I hadn't seen it at all. My brother who was watching it with me said he preferred it to the other one because it was ""modern"". He is one of those who believe that the movies made from the 80s backwards (i. e. movies of the 80s, 70s, 60s, etc) are rubbish, but that's his opinion, not mine.Call me old-fashioned or whatever u like, but here's my verdict: If u are looking for a Romeo & Juliet movie, LOOK FOR THE 1968 ADAPTATION! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE, IT'S BLOODY TERRIBLE!!!",Romeo + Juliet

218,exousir,Colourful neo-modern adaptation,8,3 November 2001,"Much better than the standard retrofit of classic stories. Instead of following the Hollywood norm and creating a new story around Romeo and Juliet, Baz has taken the original and restaged it. The result is an edgy and sometimes powerful movie.Whilst some references (such as weapons) were skilfully modernised, it was sometimes over the top and verged on cheesy. For example, the longsword was somewhat blatant.My main criticism is that the movie still managed to feel slightly Hollywood sanitised. Gore and violence was deliberately toned down to nearly the level of James Bond movies. The inclusion of the graphic display of violence would have made the tragedy much more powerful.8 out of 10.",Romeo + Juliet
219,Brest,Surprisingly underrated: almost a masterpiece. (possible little spoilers?),9,30 May 2000,"Is it possible to re-tell the most renowned love story of the Western culture in a new and modern way? Buz Luhrmann demonstrates that it is possible, even nowadays: also, he shows how great the Bard was: using His literal verses with modern fast MTV clip style, the director put together a piece of cinema which is both highly original and dazzlingly baroque. A parallel and multi-dimensional universe is built: parallel not only to the classic literature, of which the film constitutes a blasting update, but also to the Hollywood industry, with the great choice of Mexico City as major outdoor location. Using the Di Caprio - icon when it was not yet overworked by the Titanic phenomenon, the film maker casts the best possible Romeo Montague in the Nineties, matching him with a baby faced but strongly hearted Clare Danes; with her, Di Caprio plays the best scene of the year (by the aquarium), a touching and subtle metaphor of the discovery of the ""other"", both surrounded with the mellifluous chant which is the main film song. All in all: original, with a striking incipit, a fabulous overall casting, and a generous display of great, outrageous visuals (the party, the interior of the church, the aerial shots). Definitely one of 1997 best ones, and a conspicuous 9/10!",Romeo + Juliet

And the modern day twist was great. Not only do Leo and Claire do an awesome job, but so does Jamie Kennedy (he plays the pink haired 'Sampson', a.k.a. 'Randy' in the Scream movies). This is one of my favorite movies, and chances are that you'll love it too. If you think you won't like it, give it a chance..... It's a movie that I'd recommend to everyone to see.Go see it!

222,veranjank,"Some Music, but otherwise, Uncommonly Artificial",1,14 February 2003,"Romeo+Juliet (1996)Some Music, but otherwise, Uncommonly ArtificialIt is rarely that one comes across this kind of joke, and that is a patronizing statement. This film should be branded as a transmogrification of a gem. Now one would be compelled to compare this movie with Moulin Rouge, the director's more recent, much acclaimed, over rated, effort. In that case, too, he brought the 1950's classic tragedy down to a messy soup. I was inclined to put the technique to the surrealist genre, and now I think that I was being too generous.But Romeo+Juliet really hits the rock bottom. The drama, transported some five centuries forward, and the whole drama played out of context (the characters, including the TV newsreader, speaking in the archaic language) was funny, to say the least. And, in the maze of modern gadgetry, Juliet's mansion (or any other mansion or shop for that matter) not to have a simple telephone was definitely going too much. This kind of love that cannot spare a few dollars for a cellular phone (and paying for such miserly conduct with death) is unimaginable. I do not think that anyone who is not mesmerised by DiCaprio could in any manner relate to any of the characters or sympathise with them; they are so artificial.Leaving aside Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet (1968) that was an orthodox version (and quite memorable too), one remembers with much affection The Westside Story, a musical adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. There the modern social elements were interwoven into the setting so that the result was a recreation of the spirit of the original Romeo and Juliet. I believe even Shakespeare would not have found fault with that.The only remarkable aspect of this Romeo+Juliet was music. However, a bad concept has never been resurrected by good music.I only hope that the director would stop desecrating milestones of the past.",Romeo + Juliet

If I can only have swords like these boys do.From beginning to end this movie grips you and breathes new modern (and socially understandable) language into this film. Sure the words are the same, but there is so much of a difference from reading the book and watching this movie. In the book, it is dull and just seems to overflow with so much crud that is going on. I wish I was back in time watching these plays. The movie puts it all into perspective. Because the book is not descriptive 100 per cent, it is all language. Yeah yeah use my imagination to envision it, but I rather experience another's vision. Their vision might be totally something I would not expect, and it was. This movie was beautiful in images as it was in words. Hell it was all the director had to do because he had all the words already beautifully crafted for him. The interaction between characters was wonderfully displayed. The movie literally jumped out and grabbed my attention. come one gun wielding wild men from opposing sides screaming at each other death threats. How is this not entertaining. Hell how many American's watched the war in Iraq on CNN. This interests us. Whoever casted Mercutio was bloody brilliant. The whole before the ball scene, and the body language was just amazing. His death was something that always makes me love. Not because he died, but because of how it all played out. It was just sheer raw emotion.The story itself I just pity. Not because it sucks, but the subject matter. Makes me think about love and if it is even worth it. When you see a timeless movie that does not end your way you think about what you would have done. I myself would not change anything, but I am just sad that an honest and true love died. Does it exist in this world? Who knows.. All I know is, I wanted to be Romeo just to be with Juliet!

Without doubt the leading character Romeo - as yet alone is suggested by his name - is a perfect prototype of a Gothic-Romantic.

Danes is also great as Juliet and plays the part with understated strength.  The one thing which I didn't like was the chemistry between them - it could have been more intense.My favourite things about this film were the little details, like the guns belonging to the Montagues and Capulets which bore inscriptions, like 'long sword' on the shot gun.Finally I loved Pete P. as the vicar - especially that wonderful tattoo, just another aspect which feeds the eyes!!See this film, it will restore your faith in romance!*********/10",Romeo + Juliet

It's wild and unconventional and ridiculous, and that's what makes it so good. The director, Baz Luhrmann, knows that he's going out of the realm of what most people would consider to be a great screen adaptation of this play, and he uses that to its full advantage. This isn't just Shakespeare for a Shakespeare-reading audience, it's easily accessible and enjoyable whether or not you've read the play or can understand the full meaning behind each line. The direction and scenery is raw and unpretentious; the modern setting means it doesn't distract you with elaborate costumes or historical accuracies, just lets the pure emotion of the story come through. It really brings across the point that this type of story resonates through every time period and every generation, and can mean just as much to a modern audience as it did in Shakespeare's time. The performances in this movie are incredible, much more so than in any other version of this play, stage or screen, that I've ever seen. Harold Perrineau plays infamous entertainer Mercutio with both dramatic flair and emotional intensity, and brings the character to life in a way that I believe Shakespeare himself would have appreciated (whether or not he would agree with the fact that he was dressed as a drag queen at a point in the movie), and John Leguizamo's Tybalt is appropriately fiery and sneering while bringing an interesting humanity to this typically villainous character. The leads also turn out stunning performances. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes were perfectly casted as these star-crossed lovers, and they embody their youth and naiveté in a way that, for the teenage audience watching this film, makes it feel fresh and personal. They speak Shakespearan dialogue with a raw, unpracticed ease, bringing to mind the way that these young lovers would have really spoken. Leo's Romeo is every bit as perfectly over-the- top and romantic as one might expect, and he handles both sweet, intense and tragic scenes with a realness that tears at your heart. Claire's Juliet has that same quality, and she lends even iconic lines (""Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?"") a new twist. All in all, don't judge this movie by its cover. A modern version of Romeo + Juliet featuring gunfights and costume parties might not be for everyone, but it stays so true to the genuine, relatable themes of the play that the backdrop can't possibly impair your enjoyment.",Romeo + Juliet
237,arochom,Very beautiful movie if you can get over the anachronistic dialog,10,11 March 2010,"Yes it is Shakespeare, and it is perfect, yet not for now. I have to say I fell in love with the two actors, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. A perfect team. I had tears in my eyes, as Shakespeare would appreciate. I am writing this as a spoiler, but I think we all how it goes, and I was wishing so much for a little artistic curve, but no, of course not, it was a very faithful rendering of the Bard's play despite the contemporary setting. I loved this movie. I can totally get why Leonardo is one of the best actors out there. Anyway, those families have had what is coming to them.

239,DumbBrunette,A Travesty,3,30 March 2006,"There are many kinds of films. There are the few truly magnificent ones that change us while never ceasing to lose our attention. There are also the mediocre, abounding and forgettable.Then there are the films so ridiculous, so contrived, so terribly self-important that it forgets its purpose in the first place, that it forever marks our memories no matter how badly we may wish to forget it. This film just may be the crown jewel of that entire lot.Everyone knows the story. Two star-crossed lovers who despite their passion can not seem to overcome the chains from the family feud that should divide them, and by weaving a web of lies and secrecy end up destroying themselves with it. It remains more or less unchanged in the movie, aside from needed adaptations to suit the new time period, but it simply does not work. The play itself is rather contrived. To expect an audience to see people in modern day falling into the same pitfalls as their Elizabethan counterparts did is insulting to their intelligence. The director and writer does not go to any lengths to attempt to make it seem possible either.Characterizaton is also changed, but whether it was really the writing at fault remains to be seen. The lines are almost always taken directly from the play, but atrocious acting could easily have twisted it. It certainly exists in large amounts. By far and large, the cast is horrible, with extremely overrated and miscast Dicaprio and Danes at the helm. Both resort to overblown and soap operatic acting to convey the emotional turmoil of their characters, and neither do it well enough to merit anything but a laugh.The film is nothing if not imaginative, however. The cinematography is gorgeous, and many shots whimsical, lavish, and inspired choices on the director's part. However, this distracts from the dark, morbid tone of the story, and rather than complement it, it only makes the film lose impact during the important scenes. The director also uses gratuitous shots of Christ and crosses and wide shots to emphasize drama, but only manages to come across as full of himself in a Neon Genesis Evangelion-esquire move.The Breakdown: Cheesy, over-dramatic, with terrible acting to boot. Not even worth a rental unless you're in the mood for a good, long laugh.",Romeo + Juliet
240,graplano,No one even understands their own lines,1,27 May 2014,"Have you ever seen a bad TV actor pretending to be a bad stage actor? Flat, overloud delivery, incorrect emphasis, with a kind of fake British accent, but utterly disconnected from the meaning of what they were saying? Lines declaimed rather than feelingly spoken?That is what we have here. Just an awful raw butchery of the Bard. I have seen a lot of experimental Shakespeare, including a brilliant sarcastic, zoot-suited version of Troilus and Cressida at the Folger, and an Idaho Shakespeare ""sixties Hippy"" version of Midsummer Night's dream, I do like the idea of what they were attempting. Unfortunately, they gathered actors/actresses who were not up to the job. The worst rendition of any Shakespeare I have ever seen outside of awful Merchant of Venice in the local Shakespeare festival in Boise Idaho back in 1999.I truly do not believe that any of the actors understood even half of what they were supposed to be saying.",Romeo + Juliet
241,Liz-66,Just Fabulous,10,17 August 1999,"I honestly think this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  I know it's been panned as being an ""Mtv"" version of Shakespeare, but to that I say, so what?  I mean, yes the movie's done with a fast pace and bright colors that give it a trendy, modern feel, but it also does an amazing job of conveying all the emotions of one of the greatest plays ever written by one of the greatest playwrights who ever lived.  I've seen the much-acclaimed 1960s version, and honestly, I was bored.  I think the choice of which parts of Shakespeare's work to use was MUCH better in the 1996 version.  It seemed to me that the older one left out some of the most beautiful and poetic lines. Claire Danes is insanely talented as Juliet, and Leonardo DiCaprio seems to have been born to play the part of Romeo.  Great supporting cast too, especially Mercutio.  I highly recommend this film, one of my all-time favorites.",Romeo + Juliet
242,indiegirl26,"Garish eye-candy, revamps classic love story with style",10,24 December 1999,"Shakespeare was first and foremost, an entertainer. His job was to hold the interest and attention of the violent, uneducated rabble his all-male cast performed to, and if that meant introducing copious amounts of under-age sex, blood and vengeance, well then, so be it. Sword-fights, murder, betrayal, romance, black magic, secrecy, incest and insanity all frequently featured in his productions, some of which were performed right in front of our very own Virgin Queen Elizabeth I. They were there to grab the spectators attention, and then intoxicate them into the story, dialogue, characters and their lives to create a fantasy atmosphere that would prove to be so gripping, that they could not possibly wish to escape back to ye olde tavern for a pint of warm ale. And so today, Australian director Bazmark Luhrmann, most revered for his humorous and innovative spoof on Ozzie dancers in the independent film Strictly Ballroom' - and most hated for his annoying record, Sunscreen', has taken Shakespeare's sixteenth century storyline and spiked its coke with acid, to inject a clearer message to our Tarantino-worshipping Generation X - whoever they are. This is Shakespeare for the masses.The setting of the film, Verona Beach is presented as a big, dusty, putrid city, filled with big dreams and small salaries. An amazing kitsch, Catholic statue of the Virgin Mary towers above the city alongside the Diet Coke ads, supported by a crude barrage of scaffolding. The ocean breeze whips the sand up to create an outstanding host of gritty effects during some of the latter fight scene, and with its soundtrack containing the Butthole Surfers and Everclear, one cannot escape this imaginary world of garish colours, excessive noise pollution and fairgrounds on the beach. It's like West Side Story for the common people - which is probably why I like it. Just joking.The blur of brash and exciting colour fuels the film, dizzying the audience, enveloping us in its passion, displayed through the star performances of all the members of the cast, as each actor lives their part with true and devout conviction and dedication. The script has been cut drastically, but because of Luhrmann's clever use of imagery, symbolism and innovative direction, the core of the story is never lost or even left to incorrect interpretation. The transformation of the play, from a cliched stage of cod-pieces and tin-foil swords, into a powerful piece of cinema pushes both boundaries and emotions. Mercutio appears as a drug-pushing, African-American drag-queen, with more than a slight crush on Romeo yet despite the stilettos and faux-fur pink bra, still delivers a hugely accurate and captivating portrayal of the hero's best friend. The famous siloquoy where Mercutio describes the dangerous powers of love is intimately linked with the ingestion of some white dove e, and amazingly the two merge seamlessly. The masked ball is announced by the devilishly wicked Lady Capulet via cable television, and the extravagant event itself is a brash and dazzling trip. The two fathers are presented as archetypal Sicilian dons, with a tattooed Tybalt literally stealing every single scene he appears in. There is also a helicopter chase, plenty of shoot-outs, a stall called The Merchant of Venice', a mailing service known as Post. Post Haste', and Romeo's chill-out spot for introspection and smoking, the Sycamore Grove, turns out to be a derelict playhouse. This film is truly imagination working at its finest. The traditional balcony scene is transported beautifully to the Capulet's swimming pool, where Romeo, hiding in the shadows, surprises his crush, and together they hurtle into the water. This scene is fresh and witty, a continuous kiss-or-not-to-kiss. Claire Danes gives a passionate and sweet performance as Juliet, spicing up our heroine with a slice of 90s girl power, while DiCaprio is a strong and determined leading male, romantic with an element of vulnerability and adolescent awkwardness. Both are correctly portrayed as young innocents without voices, only finding themselves in eachother. Infact, Luhrmann fully exploits the sensuality and dramatic effect of water throughout the film. We first met our heroine staring face down in a basin of water, gazing languidly into the camera, stoned and angelic, her incredibly long red hair floating around and framing her pale and placcid face. Romeo is seen plunging his head into a sink of H2O following his dose of drugs, emerging with dripping wet hair, presently spying Juliet through the home of some tropical fish. The best scene provides the forum for Tybalt's murder, shot in a thunder storm, infront of the great Virgin Mary statue, where our victim hurtles back into the fountain, saturated in a heady mixture of water and his own blood. Symbolism litters this film like gold-dust at the bottom of a rainbow. Waking up beside Juliet following their illicit wedding night, scars coating his body, Romeo kisses Juliet and then prepares to leave. As she begs him to stay he grabs the bedsheets which billow over them, creating a protective white tent, before finally whipping the sheets up around them, sheltering them from the harsh daylight and the reality it inevitably brings. In fancy-dress, Romeo appears as a knight in shining armour, Tybalt as Satan, the Capulets as decadent classical characters, and Juliet as a vision-like angel. Needless to say this film is breathtaking to watch, providing a full two hours of unstoppable eye-candy. It has a fail-safe script, obviously, and an amazing soundtrack. Everyone can act in it, which is pretty rare these days, and everything fits together like lycra on an aerobics queen. A resounding full marks for the revamped Romeo and Juliet. Better than the simpering Shakespeare in Love' anyday.",Romeo + Juliet
243,Tarna85,visually captivating...........but,8,29 November 2006,"I can't help but love this film. Maybe because i'm a huge luhrmann fan, i love hes red curtain movies and the distinctive and lavish cinematography of them.The only negative aspect to me in this adaption of the worlds most famous love story was the casting of claire danes and leo DiCaprio. They were good but not brilliant. Shakespeare is about the language and there's no point in portraying a Shakespeare play if you do not deliver the dialoge properly. Claire tended to rush the lines and not let her mouth open up to get it around the words. It sometimes felt like she fully didn't understand the text of what she was saying. I can really see that should would have needed strong direction as some of her gestures, they way she moved and spoke seemed forced. Physically she looked every inch like a juliet with her curious eyes and young features.Leo i think did a better job than danes in the fact that he had a lot of passion but with his characterization, his actions spoke louder than words. The scene where we are introduced to romeo with his voice over made me cringe and because this was the first time in the film we were hearing him speak Shakespeare, it left me in a lot of doubt having to hear him in the rest of the film, not a good start. However the scene where he watches juliet dance with Paris made up for it. In some scenes he over acted in other's not enough. I personally think the love scenes should have been A lot more intense, it was to tender. Romeo and juliet is not suppose to be all prettied-up but brutal and powerful both in violence and romance.I can now sit back and look past those glitches and take in the film because i don't think baz would have been able to find 2 other actors to portray those roles any better than leo and claire. If anything other young actors would have probably given the same performance.Leo and claire do NOT make me dislike the film in the slightest though. I was driven to near tears during the beautiful fish tank scene it was like a fantasy, the whole Capulet ball sequence was like a fantasy. The way they suddenly jumped up and began searching each other with there eyes made you really believe that it was love at first site. That has got to be one of the most stunning pieces on film. Of course the death scene. I liked they they twisted it a bit so that instead of juliet waking to find romeo dead she watches him and looks into his eyes alive for the last time before reuniting in death. For those teenagers that were saying 'why didn't she say something to stop him from killing himself' it's this simple..............you can't re-write history. We all know how it ends but it still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat while watching it unfold.I could go on and on about the film in a lot of ways but at the end of the day, it's entertaining and beautiful and tragic, and thats what romeo and juliet, the story is about. Baz has not let anyone down, he has not killed the play, he ha re-invented it for today's generation.",Romeo + Juliet

They made Mercutio some sort of gay guy. That's what I got from it. And they cast Leonardo DiCaprio as Romeo. They changed Benvolio's name to...Benevelo. And to top things off, they used the original language from the play. I HATE INCONSISTENCY. They watch TV in the middle of a beach. TV. ON A BLOODY BEACH! And Mercutio's death was handled absolutely terribly. And they called Paris ""Dave Paris"". DAVE?

When Baz made this movie he didn't want to make yet another 'boring' drama that would turn people off - more long dresses and men in tights? How many times did we sit through these movies in high school studying for our next English exam? Big yawn!Instead, he took the story and threw it into modern times, cast fresh young actors, gave it a modern soundtrack and directed a masterpiece. The story otherwise remains exactly the same, word for word. Most of the kids who saw this don't even realise they've just had an English lesson by the end of the movie! Hey, knock it if you like but I think anything that might get more people reading or appreciating the written word can't be that bad.Highly entertaining, a heartbreaking romance, and a visual feast, Romeo + Juliet is a movie I've treated myself to at least once a year since I first saw it in '96. After seeing Moulin Rouge this year I watched it twice in a row.

It's not the greatest movie I've ever seen no. But in 2021 I don't care if this movie is gonna change my life or not or if it's a masterpiece or a flop, I wanna watch a movie that I'll be entertained by and moved by.

248,lhj87,Excellent,10,21 February 2002,"Baz Luhrmann is one of the greatest directors I have ever seen.  He goes past what everyone will think and does his own thing.  An example would be his spectacular musical, ""Moulin Rouge!""  He did everything his way and it turned out to be something I truly enjoy.  That's why it's up for the second most amount of Oscars tied with, ""A Beautiful Mind.""  Now with Romeo and Juliet, Baz Luhrmann does an interesting twist.  He exchanges the older setting for a modernized one.  Many, I have heard did not appreciate this and probably did not believe that it should ever be done.  However, Baz kept the language and proved a fact I have recently learned.  My English teacher told my class that, ""Times change, but people don't.""  That is demonstrated here in this film, the time changed, but the people did not.  They shared the same hate, the same love, the same tragedy.  Baz Luhrmann connected with a younger audience because I first saw this when I was 10 years old and somehow followed the story.  I hadn't ever read Romeo and Juliet, but that movie gave me this craving to learn about it.  So I waited to read it in school so I could learn what it meant and now I am.  The movie was different, but it still showed me how Shakespeare's plays have stayed alive through all these years, and it also showed me that times do change, but people do not.  It should not matter what way this was filmed or wasn't. Shakespeare borrowed a story told over time and made it his own.  He made it the way he wanted it, and everyone does the same when they borrow something. They make it their own, just as Baz Luhrmann did.   And people can personally hate it, but they should at least respect it.  I personally believe that this was a great retelling of the classic play and now that I am reading Shakespeare's version, I am understanding more and more of the movie.

250,rivercityrandom,Is this a Glock I see before me?,8,28 February 2002,"It seems so odd and yet so natural that so many people would return to ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"" and comment mightily in its favor only after seeing Baz Luhrmann's more recent masterpiece ""Moulin Rouge.""  When I first saw this film as a teenager in 1996, having been raised on more ""refined"" versions of Shakespeare's plays, I remember being outraged at how Hollywood was raping the words of the immortal Bard, taking them out of context in order to make a buck.  However, viewing this film under the lens of ""Moulin Rouge,"" it all makes sense to me now.Baz Luhrmann, like Shakespeare, is a man of the theater, very bombastic, intense, and infused with showmanship.  The reviewers who panned ""R + J"" for its lack of period costume seem to forget that Shakespeare himself wasn't exactly a stickler for historical accuracy.  Shakespeare's plays bridged the gap between the historical periods they purported to represent and the Elizabethan mores of his day.  You will notice that while the plays are set in places like ancient Rome and medieval Scotland, the actors in Shakespeare's day didn't wear kilts or togas--they are wearing Renaissance-era jerkins and tights.  Luhrmann recognizes this, and sets his ""fair city of Verona"" in a world both modern, ancient and fantastical, where street gangs with ultramodern convertibles wield ornately decorated guns (named ""Sword"" and ""Rapier"" to fit with the 17th-century lyrics) against a backdrop of towering skycrapers and Gothic cathedrals, where TV newscasters compete with numerous images of Mexican-Catholic iconography, and where knights and angels fall in love in a spectacular Victorian mansion complete with tap-dancing butlers and a cross-dressing Mercutio diva. The story itself is told as intensely as the intense love between the star-crossed duo, through a bright mix of radical cinematography, using a mix of rapid cuts, pans, wipes, fades, blurs, and hallucinogenic imagery in a kaleidoscopic style reminiscent of music videos.  The film is also punctuated through a self-conscious choice of color.  Each scene has its own color scheme: scenes between the lovers are shot in a faded pastel color scheme reminiscent of colorized 19th century photographs, the gang battles are displayed in a violent mix of yellows and reds, the death scene... oh, sorry...
*** SPOILER ***yes, Romeo and Juliet both die, as if you didn't know*** END SPOILER ***fades from glorious color to a cinema-noir black and white.  This panoply of architecture, costume design, and film style serve to highlight the timelessness and timeliness of the Shakespearean drama, bringing it down from the pedestal of elite literature and lavishing it onto the ""penny-farthings,"" the ordinary folk, where it belongs.  Baz Luhrmann brings theatrical art to a movie industry lost in its own sense of commercialism and self-importance, and to a genre (Shakespearean film) that often seems to be ""more matter with less art"".In retrospect, it's obvious from the vivid display of the extremes of human emotion and the dramatic conflict between the Elizabethan dialogue and the modern setting that this movie knows that it is a movie, a self-conscious entertainment pop-culture product, rather than displaying the events with a false sense of truthfulness and subliminal emotional manipulation.

If it was meant to appeal to those who know and love the story (myself included) then in my opinion it fails because of the attempt to bring it into the present day. If on the other hand it was meant to appeal to a younger generation and to perhaps introduce Shakespeare to a whole new audience then it surely fails on the grounds that the original script is kept despite the modern day setting. Do both, or do neither. For me, and for both my son and daughter, this was a film that was a real struggle to get through.Short and sweet, but honest.",Romeo + Juliet

Leonardo DiCaprio is an amazing Romeo, and Claire Danes does a very good job as Juliet.

254,aya862001,A failure,1,28 February 2004,"This modern version of Romeo and Juliet was actually the most foolish one I have ever seen. The director depended on choosing popular actors and forgot about everything else. I think that his fatal mistake was choosing the setting of the movie to be in modern times. If he had decided that the script would go unchanged and retain the same events as the original play, then he might as well have preserved the setting. Yet he didn't and at the end everything was messed up. It is quite apparent that the problems that faced Romeo and Juliet cease to exist in modern times. First of all Romeo and Juliet come from extremely rich families, when they realized they were in love, couldn't just go to another Italian city or even buy two two hundred dollars plane tickets to Spain and forget about their families.	The film just doesn't present anything contra that solution. Maybe in the older days, some five hundred years ago, girls in Europe couldn't walk out easily out of their family's house, but I presume that his is not the case nowadays. Even if we made the hypothesis that Romeo and Juliet weren't ""that smart"", or if Juliet's family was the only traditional family in Europe  and the events went on in the same sequence, when Romeo was banished couldn't she just go visit him like his church friend did and tell him about her plan?With all those up to date communication devices was the DHL the only choice to report such vital news? Also this banishment in a desert thing seems so stupid. Europe no longer applies this punishment and if it did, it wouldn't be free from security. They prevent people to walk out from cinemas at the middle of films, don't they have the ability to prevent people form walking out of their exiles. And this herbal 24 hour poison that Juliet had taken to make her seem dead, can it actually fool modern day medicine. Would they just take a person who seems breathless and bury him without carefully examining him. What makes matters worse is that she is presented as the daughter of one of the most powerful families, I mean; she should have been examined properly. As stupid as well was the loud monologue Juliet used to make to herself. Mad people are the only ones who talk to themselves. The director could have just transformed such loud quotations into thoughts. Maybe at the time of Shakespeare they didn't have that option, but now they certainly do. As I formerly mentioned mainly I am against the time setting of the film, because the world has changed a lot. But there are other things that were inappropriate for example the people who screamed at each other while holding guns. All I can say is that it is badly done movie. Too little effort was exerted to make it. It took away two sixteenth century family and put them in the inappropriate time and the result was devastating. Everything seemed freaky. The concept behind the Romeo and Juliet tragedy was not conveyed to me through that movie because everything seemed illogical. It certainly was a failure.",Romeo + Juliet

With Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire DanesTHE PLOT: Two teenagers from feuding families instantly fall madly in love with each other.THE GOOD: Just like Baz Luhrmann's more recent effort Moulin Rouge!, this is another movie you either love or hate. I really enjoyed this version of William Shakespeare's famous play. I thought the acting was very good considering the script is in fact Shakespeare. Not all people will think this, but I thought the modern day, original script combination was brilliant. A lot of good cinematography, particularly in the last couple of scenes. THE BAD: I didn't really enjoy the typical Luhrmann direction in the first half hour of the film, it just didn't seem to fit well with the piece. Like I said before, some people won't like the idea of putting the original Shakespeare script in the present time period. A lot of people are particular about the acting in Shakespeare movies, so it's really up to you to decide whether the acting is good or bad. MY RATING: 7.5/10",Romeo + Juliet
258,rathantara,Modernization of an old Classic,9,13 June 2013,"""Romeo + Juliet"" was virtually perfect in it's transition between time periods while adding some humor and Hollywood fun into it. It exceeded my expectations for a modernization of an old play just by the fact it uses the original text of the play almost the entire way through with very little variation. However, it could have stood using real swords. Real swords would not have fit the time period, but it would have made it slightly more believable as a whole to the audience. Having guns labeled ""Dagger"" or ""Longsword"" made it still fit what was being said, but at the same time distracts from the fact that death by sword was often very bloody and there were often more than just one wound. That aside it was over all the best remake of any Shakespeare play that I have seen in my life.",Romeo + Juliet

260,stemd03,Baz Luhrman deserves great recognition,10,8 May 2005,"Baz Luhrman did the impossible, altered a classic without making it seem horrible. Luhrman's portrayal of a modernized telling of Shakespeare's classic tale, hints a lot at underlying themes. When I was younger I thought this was a great love story, when you are older you understand that it is explaining the carelessness of teenagers and a lack of understanding of love. Leading and supporting actors deserved awards for their performances. But my absolutely favorite thing about Baz Luhrman films is his camera movement. It is just so creative, and holds your interest, your eyes scan the screen for what is happening next. Soundtrack and scenery is amazing.

261,chris_teasdale,There's just no pleasing some people,10,17 March 2018,"This is less of a review and more of a response to others. I will keep it short and sweet. There seems to be a lot of people upset that this movie doesn't stick to the original script exactly. In other words, read the play line for line. And what an absurd waste of time that would be. If I want to see the play, I will go to the theatre and see the actual play. When you go to the movies you expect something different. Not necessarily better. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that a movie version set in the present day will be different. However, I know for a fact that even if the play had been copied line for line, some people would still not be happy about that. As I found out from someone's review of 'much ado about nothing' by joss whedon. Hence the title of my review. Some people just love to complain no matter what. I for one have always liked this movie and I would recommend it to anyone.",Romeo + Juliet

263,acisnotsped86,Creative interpretation of Shakespeare's Great Love story,8,18 November 2005,"I will be the first to admit bias because I am a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio. However, much credit must also be given to the creative team for their modern remake of R&J. The movie, like Moulin Rouge as one example, has put a great deal of time into costume, settings and music. As a side note, the soundtrack for R&J is phenomenal and I still listen to it nearly 10 years later. The story stays very true to the play with Elizabethan English instead of modern English. One big surprise is the portrayal of Mercutio. All I can say is that this definitely was not Shakespeare's intention, but it's quite amusing. The use of Elizabethan English in a modern interpretation of Shakespeare has one evident drawback; seeing people in the modern age speaking in such a fashion can make the movie seem a bit silly at times. Other than that, I loved it and the romantic aspect in the movie was so well done. I simply wish that the DiCaprio and Danes had a better cast working with them. Particularly for the parents. No excuses for not finding older actors who can handle Shakespeare, especially since they found the aforementioned stars who handled it quite well.",Romeo + Juliet

This movie doesn't hold a candle to it. I mean think about it. Guns with this language? No!!! Don't spend your time, money, or effort watching this movie. READ IT WITH NO NOTES IF THAT'S THE CASE!!!

First off the camera zooms in and out so much you can't tell what's going on, and it's enough to give one motion sickness. This ruins the movie by itself. Second, they do a freeze frame of each actor to introduce each character ala The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.  A Sergio Leone movie this is not. Third, the acting is incredibly awful.  Pete Postlethwaite is basically the only competent actor. The cameo by M. Emmet Walsh is blasphemous.  Everyone else deserves to be in this lemon of a movie.  Fourth, there is a music number that made me want to end it all right then and there.  However, this movie has one thing going for it. The script.

268,dosomeeffingscience,Brilliance,10,24 August 2007,"Romeo And Juliet has been examined and appraised for over 400 years, and I have nothing to add to all that discussion. But I do know the play is such a monument that anyone bringing it to stage or screen will either do it justice or screw it up.So, what of Baz Luhrmann's rendition? All I can say is it's wonderful. Just, wonderful.Like any film it has its flaws, but so what? The 'modern' look and sound will please some and annoy others (I didn't like it much); but in a hundred years nobody will care for or against that.This film should be remembered for two scenes: the birth of the love between Romeo and Juliet, and their unhappy end. Forget all the melodrama in-between, good bad or indifferent. The only thing that counts is that both those scenes are done well enough to give the other one its meaning and emotional impact.I can't speak for anyone else of course but, for myself, I have never seen those two scenes done so convincingly as they are in this film. I don't know or care how it was done, whether it was Shakespeare, Luhrmann, or the blinding talent of Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio. What I do know is, it was done damn near to perfection.",Romeo + Juliet
269,hannahpenney-48043,Great modern adaptation,9,6 March 2020,"So I studied this film as part of an English Language course I did where we studied the original Shakespeare first then watched and compared to the flick. I think it's absolutely amazing how Bad has turned something so archaic into a modern update of the play. Yes, it's a little whacky but then isn't that to be expected from a Shakespeare script?
I think it's been severely under rated so far because I think if I didn't know the original, I'd think it was off too.
My advice would be do a little homework... Read the original then watch this version and fall in love",Romeo + Juliet
270,g_tiagem,visual extravaganza,10,25 February 2003,"Leonardo DiCaprio as Romeo?As if. Or so i thought before i went to see this masterpiece. Baz Lurhmanns rendition of this play is contemporary and a work of brilliance. From the frantic action of the initial scene to the beautiful 'fishtank' sequence it never fails in its ability to entertain and had me completely enthralled for the hour and 40 minutes. Leonardo is breathtaking in his depiction of the tormented hero and with juliet (claire danes) suffuses the screen with real emotion.

I saw this movie after I had become a Bard nut, and i thought it to be the most wonderful thing I had ever dreamed of being done with his words. The acting is not to be faulted, and while some complain that the leads did not know the meaning of their lines, I thought the performances by DiCaprio and Danes to be fresh and exciting, and especially well thought out. Watch out for Mercutio and Tybalt, they are the best performances I have ever seen of those characters. This movie is by far superior in my eyes to the 1968 version, in which all performances, save Michaael York, made me want to chop my head off with a blunt ax. All in all, eye popping cinematography included, I love it. Bravo to everyone involved.",Romeo + Juliet
272,RobMontu,Baz Luhrman: the only man in hollywood who understands Shakespeare?,10,23 January 2002,"I was always a fan of Shakespeare. And since 'Moulin Rouge', of Mr. Baz Luhrman. I have seen 'Strictly Ballroom' quite a few times and 'Moulin Rouge' more than any other film ever, most likely.And so, why not see Romeo + Juliet, the one film in which the two combine? Well, maybe because there has never been a good adaptation of the play to film- never.The 1936 one, a bore, the 1968 one, terrible, the others, well, the others most of the people I know of agree- sucks.Except for 'Westside Story', which is, after all, not the play, just the story, and even then, one of the lesser musicals.William Shakespeare is NOT the spectacle Hollywood would want you to believe, in fact, it isn't even the spectacle this film would leave you to believe, but nonetheless it's my honest opinion that this film IS one William Shakespeare- not in the historical context but in the context of the spirit. As Baz continually said during the commentary, track to 'Moulin Rouge', he wasn't interested in creating the real-world Moulin Rouge of 1900, or in this case the real play, on it's opening night, but rather the feel of it, for today's, modern, audience, particularly the young, hip, teens and 20-somethings, who need such aid better than anyone else.
And lets picture what that opening night would've been like. Entering `The Globe Theatre', us- the slimy peasants, with natty hair, dirty skin, smelly armpits, and hair- everywhere, even the ladies. Paying cheap prices for the cheap seats, right down in front. Not only right down in front, but on the dirt, with rats, worms, and other such creatures of the night. Ready to watch a play by one Shakespeare, we'd seen plays of his before, and enjoyed them, and excitement is building. The curtain comes up- the play begins, little scenery, costumes and props, just the words, and the actors to say them. We, such unintelligent low-life's, listen to them closely, understanding every word of poetry, hanging on to every syllable, the words filling our souls, the excitements building, and we're whisked away on and unending dream of hope, love, violence, and hate, as we have never done before, or ever will. The doomed were not kings, not emperors, not generals, or pharos, not even truly aristocrats yet, just young lovers, hopeless dreamers, slight eccentrics, as we all once were, and hoped to be again. And for the hour or two of the play's duration we were, and when they died, when it ended we wept not just for them, but also for ourselves.
This is what a truly good movie does to us, happy or sad, this is what there meant to do. Like 'Citizen Cane',  'Intolerance', 'Greed', or for a lighter fix, 'Singing in the Rain', 'A Hard Days Night', 'Moulin Rouge', and most certainly 'Romeo + Juliet'.We go in, our jobs bugging us, the stress killing us, fear overriding us, to find sticky floors, chewing gum, and crusty popcorn. The lights gently come down, the sound, abruptly comes up, in one of those annoying THX sound blast things, and suddenly, the world changes, specks of light, sound, blacks and whites, all the colors of the rainbow, flash onto the screen in an unendingly magical mesh of sights, sounds, emotions. The story doesn't matter- if it did then this film wouldn't be here, the play would've been forgotten long from now- it's pulp drivel, violence and contrived love for the entertainment of peasants, back long before you were born. But the sights overwhelm you; the sounds fill your ear, the listen to every note, grasp every frame, and are whisked up on a journey of hope, love, violence, and hate. Thanks to the film and to the words, you become a teen-ager once again feeling love for the first time, and when they die, you weep, not just for them, but also for yourself.Baz Luhrman is the only man, woman even, in Hollywood, or the world over, who truly understands William Shakespeare and his work, or at least attempted to bring it to the screen with such a true understanding, with the possible and quite notable exceptions of the cast and crew involved in the making, producing, and writing of this film, (a statement which has a two exceptions of it's own, dear Claire and Leo, who play the leads.)They created a film, which brings to us, today, what the play was to them, yesterday, and those before them, and those before them, all the way to that very first performance.The cinematography, lighting, editing, sets, and what not are some of the best if not the best I have ever seen.The music is absolutely brilliant, even including a few minor musical numbers using modern pop songs, as Baz and his team did later in Moulin Rouge.And then I guess we're forced to move onto the acting which is quite good, but quite a few of the lines are muddled, yelled, are meshed all together- but that is of no importance, for what word was to the peasants, the visuals, score, and sound effects are to us thus placing the word- useless.
Now of course that view might place some out of favor of this review but trust me, the film would be equally poetic with or without the work of the great Shakespeare. But the attitude would not.This film is brilliant in all manners and if you dislike it your probably one of those `Shakespeare Purists' who think that Romeo & Juliet should be paraded in the fashion it was meant for with sets, costumes and stars the Globe would have never afforded, and using true Italian actors, on an English play, but quite frankly, not to be rude, you are quite wrong in your theory, how should Shakespeare play, like any great thing, however it's interpreters wish, but for my money, the only one worth viewing, is this, or maybe Julie Taymor's Titus- especially if you liked this, and even more so if you didn't.A film of wonder, majesty, grace, beauty, elegance, excitement, romance, love, comedy and violence, Romeo + Juliet is truly perfect, in an (admittedly) flawed way, but aren't all greats?AND ALSO OF NOTE- SOMEWHAT OF A ***SPOILER***:  Many people have stated this films gang-war aspects were stolen from 'West-Side Story', but, if you really pay attention, the two houses in Romeo + Juliet are business rivals, their children, and friends of them, merely juvenile delinquents with some need to hate somebody and so the choose each other, due solely, to there families hate, just as in the original, relatively.",Romeo + Juliet
273,mickk-1,A stunning look at a classic story,8,18 March 2002,"Film makers adapting Shakespeare for the screen usually run into two initial problems. Do they stay close to the original, more or less putting a play on film? Or do they update either dialogue or setting, or both? Baz Luhrmann has chosen the latter course, updating the setting while leaving the dialogue pretty much faithful to the original. The look of the picture is stunning. Modern day Verona seems both familiar and yet somehow strange. Ornate weapons and customized cars give it an otherworldly feel, while sweeping visuals and fast cut editing combine with a strong soundtrack that at times breaks into the action on screen, Mercutio's performance at the Capulet party is a prime example of this. The use of the original dialogue could have been more problematic, particularly when combined with a modern setting. Many people find it an effort to follow this type of language but they should make that effort, it can be very worthwhile. Just picking up the rhythm of the words can make you realize why Shakespeare's work has lasted so long. It is not just the stories, but also the way they are told. These two elements, sublime language plus a stunning visual design are well served by an excellent cast. Claire Danes is very good as Juliet, a little shrill at times, but she is playing a fourteen year old. As Romeo Leonardo DiCaprio is also good, but it is the strong performances of the cast as a whole that help make the picture what it is. Inventive, innovative and exciting",Romeo + Juliet
274,C_Hardie,Didn't quite win me over,4,25 January 2007,"During the first half of this movie I was MAD. I seriously thought it was a joke at first- the whole fight scene in the beginning was weird. I couldn't accept all these thugs with guns spouting Shakespeare; I didn't find it believable at all. They took a line, ""thy drugs are quick"" completely out of context, and used it when Romeo gets high at the Capulet's party, which made me really angry. I didn't like what was done with the characters of Benvolio and Mercutio, and Claire Danes didn't always sell her role of Juliet very convincingly. The whole balcony scene where they're jumping into a pool in her backyard was kind of strange.It did have some nice moments, though. The scene where Romeo and Juliet meet was very cute, and the wedding scene was sweet as well. After Act 3, where Romeo kills Tybalt, it got better. The fall out after the murder was fast-paced and interesting. I was really impressed with the last scenes in the church; they were breathtaking and beautifully shot.Even though it redeemed itself in the end, most of it still didn't sit right with me. Too much of it felt like it didn't just fit. Maybe it was that it tried too hard to fit into the 90's atmosphere, or maybe Shakespeare just can't be modernized. Overall, I preferred the classic Romeo and Juliet to this interpretation.",Romeo + Juliet
275,bassocantante,a study in bad acting,2,24 October 2001,"This is the worst reading of Shakespeare I've seen since my high school drama days. Leonardo DiCaprio gets particularly low marks. Actually, I think the cocky teenager who played Romeo in my high school production was better than this. I'm not wild about ""modern"" settings of Shakespeare, but some have been done very well and have been highly effective. This production does not fall into that class.For an outstanding film version of the play, see the 1968 Zeffirelli production.

The actors simply show passion in a great way and develop a personality that you can identify with which increases the enjoyment significantly. The props, setting and environment completely do the film justice. I absolutely love the fact the film still uses the original dialogue this is what makes the film so unique.

279,esshor,"Great movie, classic, needs to be seen",7,13 January 2005,"Romeo and Juliet, helmed by ""Strictly Ballroom""'s director Baz Luhrmann, is the Gen-X-John-Woo-MTV-school-of-film-making interpretation of the Bard's work. From the opening sequence of a television followed by a kinetic in-yer-face staccato of imagery, to the softer ballet-like camera work of the passion scenes between the two protagonists, R&J is definitely cinema of cool.Instead of being a costume drama set in the 15th century, R&J is transposed to modern-day Verona Beach. However, Luhrmann has also thrown in some anachronistic elements from the original setting of R&J: instead of carrying swords, the members of the houses of Montague and Capulet carry 9mm semi-automatics, emblazoned with brand names such as ""Sword"" or ""Rapier"". Dialogue is faithful to the text in most respects (even the newscasters on the televisions in this anachronistic world speak in Elizabethan tongues). The church plays a prominent role in the modern-day Verona Beach, and the film is replete with religious imagery-- the young Juliet, instead of posters of New Edition on her wall, has a Madonna statue and Victorian images of angels; a large statue of Christ stands overlooking the city of Verona Beach; the guns which the Montagues and the Capulets carry are decorated with images of religious icons. Luhrmann also throws in little references that add some humour to the story: the Romeo 'n the boyz hang out at the Globe Theatre, a church choir breaks out into a hymnlike ""When Doves Cry"", and a Coca Cola ad is distorted to fit the Elizabethan atmosphere.If there is anything to complain about, it would be the opening half hour of the film. Luhrmann throws everything but the kitchen sink in terms of film-making techniques, which can be overwhelming. You have Peckinpah-ish use of slow-motion, MTV-inspired rapid-fire editing with odd zoom-ins and outs, almost-slapstick use of speed-up sequences (a la ""The Gods Must be Crazy""), a retro-seventies look in terms of colourful costume design (not unlike the retro-seventies look of ""Strictly Ballroom"") and subtitling, and a retro-eighties feel in terms of the over-acting by the supporting characters. However, once you pass this odd jumble of imagery and get into the story of Romeo and Juliet, the machine-gun barrage slows down to a more manageable pace.In summary, R&J adds value by putting the play into a different context, and through the use of interesting symbolism and imagery, adds a whole new level of interpretation to this timeless classic. Definitely a must-see (and don't mind the teenyboppers sitting around you-- they just have an essay on R&J due next week for Grade 10 English).Great movie, classic, needs to be seen. Great emotion and passion into the actors portrayal and the music used to open up the storyline. Yet one question remains; is 'Romeo and Juliet' the greatest love story ever told?",Romeo + Juliet
280,maggie_wondercat,A Bingeable Movie From The Pre-Binge Days,6,7 November 2019,"The only way this review has spoilers is if you live under a rock. But the button is there so I clicked it. You're welcome.Romeo & Juliet is the play read in every Junior High/High School in America. So much of the language within the play itself has bonded to English colloquialisms and idioms that English would have a gaping void where ""star-crossed lovers"" would be. It is not, however, Shakespeare's best story (see Hamlet, Henry V, The Merchant of Venice, Twelfth Night, need I go on?), but it has  and violence and enough angst to make the most emo of teens put on a polo and khakis and ask the protagonists to grow up and get a life.
Baz Luhrmann has absolutely no problem putting his name in lights first and the movie second. This is 120 minutes of Baz Luhrmann doing that thing that Baz Luhrmann does best: pander. This movie was not meant for adults to roll eyes at. This was meant for the teens of '96 to swoon over their beloved Leo and secretly hate Claire Danes. This movie launched a thousand feathered wing attachments for the last two decades dragged out every Halloween.
If it did have one positive byproduct, it is that teenagers picked up a book to relive the glorious balcony and tragic death scenes.
To the grit of the movie, modernization brings trouble. A sassy Mercutio - Harold Perrineau did his best with this - is delightful, but not when the pacing and the rhythm of the poetry is sacrificed for it. DiCaprio was in his acting infancy during this film and was sullen as cardboard. Paul Rudd was delightfully dopey but Paris' best lines, his raison d'être, were completely cut. Claire Daines has ugly weeps. Seriously ugly weeps. The kind of ugly weeps from when you skinned your knee when you were three and had no idea how to process that information.
There is a spectacular supporting cast. Paul Sorvino as Capulet, Brian Dennehy as Montague, the formidable Diane Venora as Lady Capulet, the hugely underrated M. Emmet Walsh as the apothecary. And gosh darned Peter Postlethwaite, the priest who knows the true identity of Kaiser Soze. Miriam Margolyes as The Nurse, a mainstay of British comedy and acting with a portfolio that should have shamed the other actors sharing a screen with her, except Peter Postelthwaite. John Leguizamo who obviously owed somebody a favor and showed up to this movie. A tremendous amount of talent passing on and off the screen. And it's entirely wasted because Baz Luhrmann had to make a ""cool"" movie.
If 15 year old me were writing this, it would be in big loopy letters with hearts over the ""i""'s pining for my beloved Romeo. 36 year old me says spare me the special effects, ham fisted metaphors(ooh, you know this is where the movie becomes really dark because the sky becomes really dark!), insufferable editing, and give me Paul Rudd. He seems like the adult in the room who's got his life together. I don't think he owned a gun. He probably had a great credit score, job security, and a 401k. Aside from the whole marrying a 14 year old, because that's gross, he seemed like an ok guy. Someone put Paris on a registry please.
However, this movie will sit on my guilty pleasure shelf to remind of the days when all that mattered were hair, makeup, clothes, and zits. Because, despite its flaws, it actually is fun to watch. If you forget that the great bards prose and poetry are being munched and chewed and accept it for the 90's period piece that it is. You can laugh along at the funny moments, recollect at the "" my parents just don't understand"" moments, and sigh at the romantic moments. We were all teenagers once. While that doesn't make this movie good, it redeems it from being unwatchable.
In summary, Romeo + Juliet was basically a great soundtrack your boyfriend had at his house when you went over to do what teenagers did before Netflix and chill. It screams ""love me, love me"". And the rest, to paraphrase another play, is angsty silence.",Romeo + Juliet

Enjoy the performances of the rest of the cast, particularly Pete Postlethwaite and Paul Sorvino.For a fan of Shakespeare, it's interesting to note the way the characters and their voices seamlessly blend into the modern world. The roaming youths of both houses are easily believable as gang bangers, and noble lords easily become wealthy tycoons. The changes in the ages at which we consider marriage does create some dissonance, but so do a number of Shakespeare's plot devices in the modern world.

Shakespeare very much, read R+J before, so I was completely astounded by what the director made of this perfect tragedy. He moved the action from Verona to nowadays America and much of the original texts lost their sense. Many of the personage are cartoons of their selves. Only Leguizamo was trying to act, the others were telling their words without any passion. I like C.Danes and DiCaprio but they don't come up to each other.

285,Spam-4,"Visuals, music & dialogue unparallelled ...",9,23 August 2015,"An excellent production of the play, it captures the energy and frustration of its mostly young protagonists and is visually and musically stunning as others have observed. The original dialogue is slotted into the modern context with skill and humour and the characters of Mercutio & Tybalt are especially well wrought.== spoiler == What disappoints me is the unnecessary lack of cohesion. When the prince says in conclusion that ""all are punished"" we don't understand that the slain Mercutio is his kinsman, as is Paris (whom Romeo kills at the tomb in the text), nor do we get the subtleties of the timing & messaging cock-ups to do with Juliet's arranged marriage and her 'suicide'.",Romeo + Juliet

288,robs-2,Brilliant!,10,12 November 1998,Quite simply brilliant and unmissable - a feast for the eyes and the ears with Di Caprio and Danes being the definitive star crossed lovers. Even the most die hard Shakespeare hater will be won over by this epic. It makes you wonder what director Baz Luhrmann will come up with next!!!! Don't be put off by all the MTV comparisons - I never ever watch MTV and LOVED this.,Romeo + Juliet
289,kasandra,awesome movie,10,16 November 1998,"Well what can I say about the movie Romeo and Juliet,besides that it makes me cry every time that I see it ,and that it has two of the hottest young stars from Hollywood today!I loved it from the first minute that I saw it.I wasn`t sure as to whether or not I would like it when I first heard that it had the old English in it.I thought that I may not be able to understand it but I was wrong.Leo and Clair did a very good job in convincing you that they were the actual characters,they bring the age old story to life before your very eyes and make you feel what they are going through.Not only is it educational in the fact that it helps you understand what it was that William was trying to get across but it makes your very essence ache for the two star crossed lovers",Romeo + Juliet
290,hansi-8,Really thrusthworthy adoption of a classic play,10,2 March 1999,"Some of my fellow commentators are irritated about this movie because it ""looks like MTV"". You have to remember that Shakespeare knew what he was doing, when he wrote these timeless plays, and knew that in 400 years they could fit in to whatever society. I believe that he is rotating in his grave, because of the fear many actors had had adopting and brushing the dust of Shakespeare's works. Branagh's Henry V is brilliant theater, but I do not think it works as a movie.In this film they have kept the respect for the old master in adopting the dialogue to modern american. And I think that Shakespeare in his heaven, is very pleased with that, because I do not think that Shakespeare expected people in 1996 to talk like they did at ""old Lizzys"" court",Romeo + Juliet
291,Cherry-19,"An eye-catching, starkly bold and breathtaking update of Shakespeare's greatest work.",10,30 December 1999,"This film is incredible. Yes, the play is modernized, and for those who panned the film, I suppose originality was too much to take. Luhrmann stays with the original dialogue, which I believe adds much to the film and gives it authenticity. Therefore it cannot be dismissed as a masterpiece dumbed down to appeal to us easy to please teenagers. The camera work at the most dark parts of the film is quick and choppy, adding to the already potent and ever present depressing, tragic atmosphere. All of the leads were strong, with Danes and DiCaprio having amazing chemistry. In this film DiCaprio wasn't popular yet, so again critics can't say Leo was the draw for this film. Danes was emotionally pure and driven, and this is her best work to date aside from the critical darling, ""My So-Called Life."" No, the leads were cast with good reason - there couldn't have been any better. Supporting roles were wonderful, with the roles of Mercutio and Tybalt being exceptional, and the friar, who may be the most important character in the story, is brought to life by Postalwaithe  The dreamy underwater shots are fantastic. Luhrmann's version of this classic tragedy plays to both a younger and older audience, adding touches such as the names of the guns being the names of swords; and he yet updates the setting, bringing the fantastic Verona, Italy to Verona Beach, Florida. A timeless story such as this makes any criticism of this film unnecessary and foolish; view it with an open mind and you will see the story as Shakespeare wrote it and as Luhrmann envisioned it.",Romeo + Juliet
292,Amry,"Ah, What Doth the Producers Think They're Doing?",7,14 February 2000,"Well, first the good things about this movie. First of all, the acting quality is really good. Unlike, say, the Man in Iron Mask, DiCaprio managed to potray himself as a anguished, sensitive rich guy with a tormented heart. Like most other guys, I despise him, but I do appreciate good acting. The same goes to Claire Danes and the rest of the cast. The special effects, music and sound is also top notch. Kudos on that. I've watched the movie over and over again. Now for the bad things. First of all, I would rather have a revised dialog, instead of taking the lines straight out of the book. I mean, how many average-intelligent teenagers know the meaning of ""wherefore"" (it means ""why"") and other old English words? Of course, some of the memorable lines (""a rose by any other name would smell as sweet"") shouldn't be changed. But otherwise, please, not everyone has a degree in English literature. As my linguistically-challenged friend said to me, ""this movie doth sucketh"". Well, that's all.",Romeo + Juliet
293,johnhobson,Shakespeare debased,1,10 March 2000,"I have no problem with updated versions of Shakespeare.  When I was in college, I was in a production of Merchant of Venice set in the 19th century; and I liked what Kenneth Branaugh did with his 19th century Hamlet. I once saw Coriolanus set in the Confederacy during the US Civil war -- which added quite a bit to the political dimensions of the play.However, this one is over the top.  When we see ""Sword"" brand handguns -- obviously so the line ""put up your sword"" would make sense -- and having Mercutio be a drug dealer is simply too much.Nevertheless, I could have lived with it, except for two things: Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes.  Neither one of these two has a clue about how to speak Shakespearian English.  See DiCaprio with Peter Postlethwaite (Friar Laurence) or Danes with Miriam Margolyes (Nurse).  Both Postlethwaite and Margolyes know the music of Shakespeare, and it is almost painful to see DiCaprio and Danes stumbling.  And putting the balcony scene in a swimming pool is simply stupid.Also, some of the secondary characters are badly done.  John Leguizamo is a terrible Tybalt, and the limp-wristed Mercutio is ludicrous.  Bryan Dennehy is simply wasted as Montague.And I would like to inform the script-writer that Juliet wakes up AFTER Romeo dies, not before. If this were my introduction to Shakespeare, I would avoid him like the proverbial plague.",Romeo + Juliet
294,erka_bean,Beautiful portrayal of love,9,22 September 2000,"They did an extremely wonderful job of showing love through this movie. Much better than all the others I've seen.  My only complaint is that it seems that the actors don't really KNOW or feel what their lines meant when Shakespeare wrote them.  It's really hard to understand the writing from that time so no one noticed except us Shakespeare freaks who find it as painful as nails on a chalk board when there's a pause between ""Do with their death"" and ""bury their parents' strife.""  But all in all, wonderfully done for trying to modernize, yet keep the same poetry of a classic tragedy.",Romeo + Juliet
295,stargaser,Emotional rollercoaster,10,4 November 2002,"Shakespeare is one of the most prolific and talented playwrite's in all history.  His work has been translated into countless languages, has been endlessly analyzed and discussed.  There are so many adaptations of his work that it's impossible to name or even remember them all.  So it must take an extraordinary cast, a visionary director and plenty of hard work to achieve a modern adaptation worthy of having Shakespere's name in the title.  Buz Luhrmann and company more than meet the challenge of re-telling this classic story of star-crossed lovers into a modern rendition. I was priveledged enough to see this wonderful movie on the big screen in 1996, and now 6 years 1 VHS cassette, 2 DVD's (original and special edition),  1 book, 2 cassette and 1 CD soundtracks later I find myself just as moved by the movie today as I was 6 years ago.  Buz Luhrmann and the cast take you on an incredible emotional ride.  From the beginning you feel overwhelmed as you try to embrace the visual and audible power of the film, but as the movie progresses you discover that you become intune with the pace of the movie and the characters.  Suddenly you hardly notice that the movie is actually utilizing old english language and that the play is actually 400 years old and you discover that you're relating to the characters and the story as though it was written for our generation.  It is as though Romeo and Juliet were frozen in time until now and are re-living their lives in the modern times for us onscreen. I could go on and on about the movie and how it manages to captivate you for the entire 2 hours.  I could discuss how the film takes you on the emotional rollercoaster from the hate driven rivalry in the opening, to the frolicing atmosphere of the Capulet bash, from the passionalte kisses in the pool, to the tragic and powerful ending that leaves you sobbing.  I could, but I won't because that would take ages.  Instead I'm going to say that this movie is definitely worth your time.  The cast is spectacular and Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes just shine as Romeo and Juliet.  Buz Luhrmann is a true visionary combining a rich character driven classic play with the lavish visionary feast for the eyes.  All that combined with the incredible soundtrack from many talented artists and you have a bonafide winner. Watch it for yourself and you be the judge.  My rating is 10 out of 10.",Romeo + Juliet
296,leighwill,Very surprisingly very good,8,23 January 2001,"It shouldn't work but somehow it manages to. Most people assume the play will survive an update because it is 'timeless' or 'as relevant now as ever' but that is the reason why modernizing it should be doomed to failure. It's not really saying anything that hasn't already been said. It has almost become a cliché that the theme of the play is as relevant today as it was when it was written. What Baz Luhrmann does is bring something a little different to the story it's bold but that's why it's good. Modern elements are blended almost seamlessly in to the original script. The TV Anchorwoman replaces the narrator, gun play replaces sword play, Verona beach replaces the city of Verona, gang violence replaces family rivalries and other elements like the taking of hallucinogenic drugs and the drag act appear convincingly with the original dialogue as if they were always meant to be there.Keeping the original script was essential since it is written poetically (people in Shakspeare's time didn't really talk like that) and no one in there right mind would change the words of a poem since that would defy the whole point of it. If the language of the play puts you off watching this I would seriously recommend reading it first to help your understanding. A little bit more work than your average shallow Hollywood money spinner but infinitely more rewarding.",Romeo + Juliet
297,jason_hille,Rome's and Jule's,8,16 April 2006,"Luhrmann is without a doubt a genius of a man. One of the most tricky things in bring relics into our current reality is keeping it as authentic as the first day it rolled out onto stage. Shakespeare is no easy man to copy and even more difficult to imitate.DiCaprio wasn't the best choice for Romeo as far as the dialog and acting bits are concerned. Don't get me wrong, he's a great actor, but lacks the ability to play tough when the time comes for it. From what I understand, Romeo was a decent swordsman as the play recalls. However, little action came from the guns portrayed as the weapon of choice to match the time period.Harold Perrineau, who played Mercutio, had a crucial role in this film as the best friend of the dear Romeo and more than anything else, protector of Romeo's dreams. It was an outstanding performance because I truly believed that Mr. Perrineau new the emotions and dialog well enough to portray them realistically.Claire Danes is just an outstanding actress with beauty all around and a more honest approach to the Juliet in this film. It's not easy playing a love interest, but in this movie, it's clear that both DiCaprio and Danes played love interest to each other instead of one or the other.John Leguizamo is an accomplished comedian, so portraying the ever serious and straight forward Tybalt just didn't seem the role for him. I think that Leguizamo is trying to approach all angles of his acting career which takes much talent, but once you're a comedian that stands out, it's difficult to get out of that genre.I'd have given this movie better than an 8 if not for the fact that it was relatively uneventful. It's a Tragic Love Story. You can't really expect much more.",Romeo + Juliet

302,MarsBar101,When I see a bad movie in the future...,1,13 May 2009,"...I can at least say that it's not as bad as Romeo and Juliet.Now, I haven't been fortunate (unfortunate?) enough to see the classic bad movies such as ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" and ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", but right now, this is the worst film I've ever seen.My first thought was ""Is this a joke?"". Did somebody I know slap this together in a few hours just to mess with me? Eventually I realized some poor sod was actually insane enough to create this.Basically, the film plays out as though some stupid kid who didn't understand the play decided it had to be cool and flashy to appeal to today's kids. The prologue flashes on-screen in the ridiculously cliché ""Blockbuster film"" title font. From there, the director shoehorns in references to the play as if to prove he actually read it (though I doubt he payed much attention). ""Prince"" the chief of police, Sword Mk 2 pistols, the list goes on. As a result, the film spends too much time saying ""Look! We figured out a way to modernize (blank)!"" and misses out on the important parts of the play, such as the statements on power, violence and money.In summary, avoid.",Romeo + Juliet
303,adedavies,"Great acting, cinematography, soundtrack and story- who could ask for more!",10,18 November 2007,"You would be forgiven for expecting this film to be just a love story best suited to the more feminine viewer. Of course the star crossed lovers story is here but there is enough pace and testosterone to entertain those who want action too.Set in the modern day the swords are guns and the horses, cars but this only adds to an appreciation of the drama of this timeless story. The adaptations of the original play are both creative and witty. Shakespearian language is still used but don't let that put you off, you quickly get used to it.The acting is without fault, particularly for the lead roles. At times it even feels a little uncomfortable to be witnessing such powerful emotions.The cinematography is stylish and dazzling; many scenes are truly unforgettable just for the photography. I think that Donald M. McAlpine adopts a similar vivid approach he did later for Moulin Rouge but I found this to be less flamboyant.The sound track complements the visual feast. The music is varied and powerful- adding to the pace and texture of the storyline.Baz Luhrmann is worthy of huge acclaim in that he directed and produced this great film and also wrote the screenplay with Craig Pearce.I write this comment in 2007 and my appreciation of this classic is no less now then as when I saw it first 9 years ago. 10/10.",Romeo + Juliet

305,cutie_pie_kkk,good movie,9,28 June 2007,this movie is a perfect admission of how good baz luhrman is. when i was in my first year of ncea we studied this movie and it really opened my eyes to how great filmatography this movie is showed in. Leonardo is the main reason that most people watch this movie and i agree he was the main reason i liked this movie originally but after a while you can realize that he makes this movie just so much like Shakespeare that its worth it. Claire Danes as a Juliet is perfrectly casted and makes her seem like a role model to many little girls. she may not be a very good role model what with being in a tragedy and all but its still worth it. Romeo and Juliet is a tearful movie that fits the wishes of being a Chick-flick through and through. the soundtrack on this movie is brilliant to all the changes that comes through. the perfectly shown differences between the Montague's and Capulet's. a 9out of 10 movie and i want to see it again,Romeo + Juliet
306,JenWar74,It grows on you,9,19 April 2007,"I'll admit that I avoided seeing this movie in the theater because it was modernized. When the movie appeared on the premium movie channels, I watched the first 10 minutes and switched channels, turned off by the guns and the ""too modern"" aspects of the film.Then, the next time I saw it on the movie channels, I'd watch a little bit more. Pretty soon I had watched the whole thing, and I came to appreciate it the ways the director had attempted to stay true to Shakespeare while making it more accessible to today's generation.Leonardo seems like an okay choice, although he brings a wimp factor to Romeo's character. Then again, wasn't Romeo kind of a whipped puppy? Although I appreciate the adherence to the original language, sometimes having Romeo speak it with little or no emotion (or what seemed like the way a high school actor would read the lines) lessened the efficacy of the scene. Claire Danes is quite gifted, in my opinion, and I think she played the part well. When she pulls a gun on Friar Laurence and screams, ""Be not long to speak -- I long to die!"", we can feel her anguish. Sometimes she, like Leonardo, would read her lines with little or no emotion, and it cheapened the scene. THen again, this may have been the inevitable of effect of trying to read Shakespeare's lines in a n ""everyday"" situation. There's no crying, no anger, no anything ... therefore, how would you read the lines? Mercutio was brilliantly cast, for this actor seems to reveal the outlandish nature of the Mercutio's character.I like the small details that the director put in there to refer to the original script or to show the division between the two families. The two buildings named after the families, the difference in dress and appearance, and the billboards around town -- the film is full of subtle (and not-so-subtle) allusions. I loved how they named the guns as to stay true to the original text.The director heightened the death scene by having Juliet wake up and touch Romeo's cheek just after he downed the poison, rather than waking up seconds after he died. Same scene, just a minor time difference here.The only thing I greatly disliked about the movie was how the party was turned into drug-fueled chaos. Was that necessary? Couldn't there have been a huge party without Juliet's mom sucking face with every available male, and Romeo acting loopy from whatever pill Mercutio had given him earlier? I show this movie to my high school students to provide a modernized view of the play. I can say that my students seem to ""get"" this version. The 1968 version? Not so much.",Romeo + Juliet
307,ash-032,What a wonderful update! I loved it!,10,20 January 2002,"I was only about 9 years old when this movie had first been released and I hadn't been able to see it until now. I am 14 now, and I read Romeo and Juliet, the play, for English as most freshmen like me have. I had to watch both versions of the movie as well (the 1968 Zeffirelli version and this 1996 version). As you could probably predict, I enjoyed the 1996 version better, mainly because it is a version I can relate to more. I had to watch it in class and then the following weekend, I went out and bought it because I enjoyed it so much.I really don't like Shakespeare at all, and I don't know much about ""how good"" actors are speaking in Old English, but I thought overall, Leo DiCaprio and Claire Danes were good at it. Cut them some slack, they are both 2 very talented young actors and for this being their first time doing a Shakespeare film, they did pretty damn well if you ask me. Their chemistry onscreen was good, but it could've been better. I'd have to say that the parts they performed their best in were when they met across the fishtank (There was no dialogue, but their faces really said it all. I also thought that was very romantic), and the night before Romeo's banishment from Verona, in Juliet's room. The death scene was a surprising twist from the play, and it put me in tears.But, I think they should've spent more time on the wedding scene. It felt like that was only going on for 1 minute. What I also didn't like was the relationship between Romeo and Mercutio. Mercutio... a drug dealer? The two were supposed to play best friends but they only seemed like casual acquaintances and ""drug buddies"" in this movie.The special effects were great, and the music was wonderful. In my opinion, I truly enjoyed this movie a lot. Good acting, and an excellent modern remake on an old classic. This is a movie today's teenagers will enjoy, but if you're older, I would think that you would like the '68 version because it keeps the traditional stuff. (At least my parents liked the 1968 version better). I really think you should go out and rent it. You'll be happy you did.**********/10",Romeo + Juliet

By restraining itself to the original language, the screenplay is horridly absurd and must the modern guns in the play are painfully engraved with the name ""SWORD"" to keep with the ""Draw your swords, etc""The acting was also horrible.

314,lukesmith4887,Luhrmann creates an overly-elaborate slaughtering of Shakespeare's eloquence,3,11 April 2010,"In Romeo+Juliet, director/producer Baz Luhrmann takes the traditional story of ""two star-crossed lovers,"" puts it in Verona Beach in about 1970, adds his own little motif of water, over-dramatises the whole story, chooses substandard performers, and to top it all, ignores half of Shakespeare's original text.In one of the first few scenes, through the chosen costumes, Luhrmann takes what was to some extent implied in the text, and makes Mercutio a transvestite homosexual, Tybalt a devil, and, using blatant stereotypes, Juliet becomes an angel, and Romeo a knight-in-shining- armour. Some might call this ""rather cute,"" I call it lack of imagination.It seems that, however much he tried, Luhrmann could not succeed by himself, and so tried to find people to be successful for him: Leonardo DiCaprio, for example. DiCaprio was one of the small number of cast members who did a half decent job at their role. DiCaprio quite effectually portrayed the romantic, bashful, teenage Romeo, giving the viewer at least some feeling of verisimilitude. Claire Danes, however, removes this feeling by giving Juliet the image of forced emotion. Also, Luhrmann's casting of Miriam Margoyles, using a somewhat Spanish accent, as the Nurse gives a completely different image of the bawdy Nurse that Shakespeare portrayed. Luhrmann avoids the bawdiness by simply skipping over most of those parts of the original text.The Nurse's suggestive monologues are not the only sections of the text that Luhrmann skips; he also takes out many side plots and events that occur throughout, apparently without realising that some of them do have some import in the story. For example, in the film, Romeo never kills Paris, who, in the text, is yet another one of the innocent victims of the family feud. This may not have a huge effect, but when there are a number of similarly small events taken out, the effects add up, making what is an excellently written story into something much less powerful.One might think that, having not done too great a job in other aspects, Luhrmann might have done better on his choice of music. Then one notices that music varying from artists such as Garbage, to One Inch Punch, to the Butthole Surfers, can be summarised, quite simply, as melodramatic rubbish. Quite fitting, considering Luhrmann's apparent love of melodrama, as shown through his choices of casting, costume, setting, and music. And that more or less summarises the whole movie: an over-done butchering of Shakespeare's beautiful writing.",Romeo + Juliet
315,jimmy-stafford00,I Love It,8,19 January 2012,"I really don't like Shakespeare at all, and I don't know much about ""how good"" actors are speaking in Old English, but I thought overall, Leo DiCaprio and Claire Danes were good at it. Cut them some slack, they are both 2 very talented young actors and for this being their first time doing a Shakespeare film, they did pretty damn well if you ask me. Their chemistry on screen was good, but it could've been better. I'd have to say that the parts they performed their best in were when they met across the fish tank (There was no dialogue, but their faces really said it all. I also thought that was very romantic), and the night before Romeo's banishment from Verona, in Juliet's room. The death scene was a surprising twist from the play, and it put me in tears.But, I think they should've spent more time on the wedding scene. It felt like that was only going on for 1 minute. What I also didn't like was the relationship between Romeo and Mercutio. Mercutio... a drug dealer? The two were supposed to play best friends but they only seemed like casual acquaintances and ""drug buddies"" in this movie.",Romeo + Juliet
316,b-kenrick,i give this movie a 9 out of ten. It was great,9,27 January 2012,"This movie was great especially for the younger audience. it brings new life to one of the most well known Shakespeare plays ever written.The way the language was incorporated with modern life allows all groups to appreciate this movie such as: teenagers, Shakespearean,and movie lovers. Weather you watch it for fun or a learning experience entertaining for everyone.In addition to being a great this version of romeo and Juliet explained the book in a new way. the words may be the same but the setting the actions and movements are different. they replaced swords with guns and the close they were are clothing we would probably wear. its a great book.",Romeo + Juliet
317,gabranth415,it was good but......,7,19 January 2012,"The movie is great but, they used guns instead of swords which make no sense to me at all. The guy from titanic is romeo. Juliet was the lady from Stardust. Juliet shot her self in the head when Romeo poisons him self. I really don't like that ending but what can you do you know. what I did like was they up dated it from the 1968 version, that one I thought was good. They put a lot more action in it. Also they better graphical effect then the other. It was was cool when they got married. I still rather have sword fighting . One more thing is, it may not have been the movie for me but it is a good movie for romance lovers. Over all it was good. P.S. Buy this movie or watch it if you are romance fan because you will love it.",Romeo + Juliet

The movie begins and instantly grabs my attention with the conflict between the Montague's and Capulet's. I immediately witness the dislike between the two families and know Romeo and Juliet really ARE star-crossed lovers. Into the movie when Romeo and Juliet first meet there both kinda have a lover's daze in there eyes;they fall in love at first site.(SO ROMANTIC!!!) Anyways later on the couple decides to get married but theirs a big problem, JULIET IS EXPECTED TO MARRY SOMEONE ELSE!!! Learning this Juliet decides that's not what she wants and devises a plan where she doesn't have to marry the man her parents have picked for her.Unaware of Juliet's plan Romeo does something that changes his life forever,Juliet shortly after does what Romeo has done and this is the most tragic part of the movie.(I wanted to cry :( If you want to know what happens in this love filled, thrilling, mind blowing,action filled movie i would seriously suggest taking a look at Romeo and Juliet with Romeo playing as Leonardo DiCaprio and Juliet as Claire Danes.",Romeo + Juliet
319,SilentJoe13,Grand Theft Auto: The Movie......by William Shakespeare,1,26 March 2012,"If you want a Romeo and Juliet film, this is not for you. If you want Grand Theft Auto:The Movie, this is the film for you.Admittedly, the cast is great and boasts superb performances from the young leads Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. Other than that, this is horrible and Shakespeare would probably roll in his grave if he knew his most famous play would lead to THIS!! Shakespeare dialogue in a modern setting just does'nt work. It comes off as corny and cheesy. Any attempt to reinvent Shakespeare falls flat. The violence is excessive and comes off as more of a Grand Theft Auto game than anything Shakespeare could have done. The direction and editing is all over the place and it seems like Baz Luhrman did'nt know what to do with the camera. Visuals are put before the soul of the romance. This film tries so hard to be hip, cool, and badass that it loses grasp of the story and ends up with a disaster.",Romeo + Juliet
320,markrequest,A 6.8 score is unrepresentative.,10,29 June 2012,"I'll admit to have been shocked when I saw this movie scored 6.8. It led me to read many of the reviews, good and bad, and the film seems to have polarised its audience, they either loved it or hated it. I'm most surprised by those who profess to be Shakespeare fans.Shakespeare was not a period dramatist, he was thoroughly modern in his day. His plays tackled (amongst others) the military, comedy, drama and love and romance and he was well feted for his works in his lifetime.If I were a fan, I should be delighted that his original (and now ancient) dialogue could be so well blended with the modern visual. Rather than spinning is his grave, I'd say Shakespeare would celebrate the fact that his play (screenplay here) still holds merit in a sex'n'drugs'n'rock'n'roll twentieth century setting.If you prefer, or can only accept, your Shakespeare with tights, green velvet costumes and feathers in the cap along with cut glass English accents and endless pauses to stare into empty space then don't watch this. If, however, you feel you can overcome the modern visual blended with its ancient dialogue, then this is a must because if you like it then I promise you'll love it and, if you love it, you will be well rewarded.",Romeo + Juliet
321,adri278,This movie is something to be appreciated.,10,12 June 2006,"This best word I can think of to describe this movie is vibrant. The bright colors, vivid scenery and outlandish characterization are trademarks of Luhrmann's style, and I for one think that it is cinematography at its best. He brings us into the world of Shakespeare in a way no one else has. I saw this movie in the theater when I was 11 and it prompted me to buy the play and ever since then I have been in love with it. I appreciate Baz's attempt at aiming the story to a younger audience. You don't find many kids these days (or ten years ago...has it really been that long??) who want to willingly read Shakespeare. The language is complicated and unfamiliar. But the stories are worth knowing, and I think this movie is a step forward in familiarizing Shakespeare to the modern times.There are plenty of people who disagree with the use to Shakespeare's dialogue in the modern setting. I have argued this point over and over and this is what I have to say to them: It seems that someone who appreciates Shakespeare would want his brilliant words to be used. You see the movie and you think: Baz Luhrmann, you hear the dialogue and you think: William Shakespeare. If you are someone who can't understand Shakespeare, the makers of the film dedicated themselves to finding ways, by using imagery, to decode the language and make it more understandable.I've often heard complaints about the acting in this movie as well. I for one don't see anything wrong with the acting, and I thought the cast did very well with the difficult dialogue. I've always been a fan of Leonardo Dicaprio. Back when I first saw this movie, it was just because I thought he was cute. But now, I see an actor who plays his roles with intensity and passion. He is the perfect Romeo to me. He portrays the passionate, lovesick lead incredibly well. We see his heart break on the screen when Mercutio is slain, and again when he learns of Juliet's ""death."" We see his all-consuming rage when he is chasing after Tybalt to avenge his friend's death. We see a boy falling in love with a girl and wanting to be with her for the rest of his life. He goes though all of these emotions seamlessly, and in the end, you really don't want this guy to die.Claire Danes as Juliet impressed me as well. She has a much less flashy role than Leo, but she brings strong character to the innocent, angelic young woman. My favorite parts with her were when she was alone, speaking to herself. I really thought she did the dialogue very well, and she is often who I think of when I read the play. She handles the emotional stuff with experience, and you are left there wishing you could do something for this girl who goes through so much in such a short time.My favorite character in the movie has to be Meructio, played by Harold Perrineau. He's loud, flamboyant, and I can't get enough of him when he is on the screen. He even dresses in drag at the costume party where Romeo and Juliet meet, and lip-syncs to ""Young Hearts Run Free."" He plays the loyal friend with feeling, and it is very disappointing when he meets his end.This movie definitely isn't for everyone. Some people just can't quite grasp what Luhrmann was trying to accomplish with this movie. He wasn't trying to do a replica of the play or the movies made before it. It's different. It's daring. Some parts might just make you laugh out loud. But the tragedy of the story is still very much there.In my opinion, this movie is something to be appreciated. It steps out of the norm and pulls you into a world of love and tragedy with its intense delivery and unique portrayal of a timeless story.",Romeo + Juliet
322,cashhoney2000,Great remake of the most classic lovestory ever told.,9,22 September 2004,"When Baz Luhrman decided to replace the guns for swords and still have the cast speaking just as Shakespeare did, I fell in love with this story all over again. The acting was great, the locations were excellent. The photography in the movie is excellent. There's only one thing I didn't like and that is Romeo and Juliet should have had more on screen time together, just to show more depth to their love. I love this movie though! Its one of the only movies I know ALL the lines to. My favorite part is when Romeo sees Juliet for the first time through the fishtank. I can feel their excitement . This captures the love at first sight theme right on point. Who wouldn't fall in love with Leonardo DiCaprio though? I give this movie two thumbs up!",Romeo + Juliet
323,gsjenkins,this movie was hilarious...for the wrong reasons,1,17 July 2006,"I saw this movie in English class after we just finished reading the play. Instead of saying that was a good movie, I was laughing my head off for ten minutes, and so was the rest of my class. Why? Because the old English lines did not fit the modernized movie. When you put two-and-two together, watching a stand-up comedian will provide you with the same laughs out of this movie. Now let me point out the tings that I thought were ridiculous. The actors don't use swords, which is key to the time that the original play is set. Instead they use guns, security cameras, helicopters and cars. You're looking at this and saying to yourself, ""No way! CARS?!"" Now how is Mercutio going to die? If you read the original play he is stabbed by Tybalt (with a sword). In the movie Tybalt breaks a piece of glass and impales him. The funniest scene is the deaths of Romeo and Juliet. Romeo drinks a vial with Juliet awake for at least two minutes before. Romeo makes this ""Oh crap"" face after seeing Juliet wake up. Juliet then shoots her brains out. And thats the end of the movie.",Romeo + Juliet
324,cbrinkm,A horrible remake of a classic story,1,17 February 2005,"I find it a shame that there is only one peer submitted review of this awful version of a classic play that has withstood the test of time. As such, I wish to give another view, as well as an opposing view to the only one on here.Luhrmann may stay with the original dialog, but he plays fast and loose with the script. Anyone who has actually sat down and read the play as Shakespeare wrote it would know this. Example: Opening scene. In this ""version"" the Capulets are the targets of the Montague's insults. In the real version, this is reversed. A minor yet significant example, since in the original the reader has a small sympathy for the Montagues who are apparently just minding their own business when these idiots harass them. The names of the families on the guns to represent their ""swords"" is just ludicrous, not to mention the ""duel"" between DiCaprio and Tybalt. And yes, DiCaprio wasn't popular when this film was made, but that doesn't mean he did a good job at acting his part. He didn't. Nor did Claire Danes. They sounded like my 9th grade peers reading the text from their English book in total monologue. No emotion, no passion, no reason to listen to them, 'Nuff said.And while we are on the subject of DiCaprio's reaction to Mercutio's death, why don't we talk about a little something known as ""Breaking the Tension,"" something that Luhrmann does better than anyone. During the famous scene where Romeo's best friend dies, we see perhaps the one and only time Leo shows true emotion to convey sorrow of losing his friend. Then we see the rage in his eyes as he swears revenge on his enemy. The pressure builds. We can feel the tension building up.Then out of the blue Danes is singing a song and laying on her bed, leaving us to wonder what the heck just happened.Do you see what has happened? We were all set, ready to see this dramatic scene unfold and climax, knowing its inevitable conclusion, we felt the blood rushing as we leaned forward on the edge of our seats, then we are smacked in the head with a sappy, lovely scene.Anyone who knows anything about filmography knows that this completely breaks the tension that was building up. That is bad. It is bad because now the audience feels like it has been removed from the action, like waking up from a dream suddenly. After doing that, it is impossible to get back into the movie. And sure enough, we see Mr. Leo with a fixed look of anger and determination. We see him take out a scared Tybalt. But you know what? We don't care anymore, because we're still miffed about a moment ago when Luhrmann decided to throw us for a loop. We can't engage the moment anymore because we're now between two opposite feelings: One being the love Danes has for her Leo, and the hatred and anger Leo has for Tybalt. If Luhrmann had done this right, he would have had the entire scene with Romeo from the beginning to end (like Franco Zeffirelli did) and THEN put Danes bedroom scene in, AFTER the ""duel"" between protagonist and villain. This way, we would have felt the way Juliet does when she realizes something is wrong. We would have felt her world fall apart in front of her eyes when we were supposed to have done so: After the fight with Tybalt winds down and Romeo's rage is calmed.And give me a break regarding the ""this movie is above criticism"" line. Even without all of its flaws (which, by the way, I have only touched some of the flaws in slight detail) ANY movie, ANY book, ANY play, ANY song, ANY piece of art that has, is or ever will be made for commercial use is open to criticism. Why? Because the author/artist/writer/etc. wants to be paid for their work. Now, if I am going to pay for something, I want the item in question to be quality. That goes for everything, including movies. I have only seen this movie in passing on the television, so I have not paid a penny for it. Nor will I.And yes it is dumbed down for teenagers. Watching this version is like watching the vast majority of MTV music videos. They look visually pleasing, but that's to cover up the fact that the performers can't write good music. Same concept here.In short, if you want a good Romeo and Juliet movie, this isn't it.",Romeo + Juliet
325,starry-eyed_wanderer,Beautiful Modernization of Shakespeare's Classic Play,9,1 April 2005,"The amazing thing about this movie is that it has managed to re-do Shakespeare's famous tragedy in a modern setting while still retaining its original dialogue. What's even more amazing is it works. I admit that I was a little apprehensive about seeing this movie, fearing that Luhrman had either destroyed the play's beauty and power by setting it in modern times, or had butchered Shakespeare's eloquent words by making them sound more modern. I was wrong. Almost everything about this movie is just incredible.Luhrman brilliantly casted Claire Danes as fourteen-year-old Juliet. The actress certainly looks the part, with her youthful features and innocent eyes. More importantly, she acts the part. Ms. Danes almost flawlessly captures Juliet's distressing journey from childhood to womanhood, beautifully showing her dramatic transition which had taken toll on her during her five day relationship with Romeo. When the story begins, Juliet is a naive girl, having not yet experienced true love, and by the end we can clearly see just how much her love for Romeo has deepened in passion, and how dramatically her character has developed.Leanardo DeCaprio's Romeo was almost equally impressive. Some of his recitations of Shakespeare made me cringe, but for the most part he was perfect. One of Romeo's most important characteristics in the play is the intensity of his emotions, and DeCaprio captures this feature incredibly. Romeo is brash and impulsive, with a tendency to act on the heat of the moment rather than to first consider the situation like the more levelheaded Juliet. This unfortunate characteristic, which played a huge role in leading up to the lovers' tragic fate, is wonderfully mastered by DeCaprio and retained throughout the film. But we also, like with Juliet, get a glimpse of his character's development. At the beginning of the play Romeo is a hopeless romantic who fantasizes of love, and seems to dwell more in his daydreamed world than actually on earth. At this point he has no idea what true love really is, he only thinks he does. It is not until he meets Juliet that he can begin to comprehend the true depth and passion of love. DeCaprio triumphs in this area as well.The other actors are superb, and wonderfully portray their characters as Shakespeare intended. But what really impressed me was, as I stated earlier, the keeping of Shakespeare's original dialogue in Luhrman's modern setting. I know some people criticize this film for destroying the romance and beauty of Shakespeare's words by setting the story in modern day Verona, but I feel that it only made the film more romantic. What Luhrman did was both bold and brilliant, and he succeeded wonderfully.I won't speak any more of the brilliance of this film, I just highly recommend you see it as soon as possible. If you're a fan of Shakespeare like me, I think you will enjoy this hip, yet still lovely, modernization of his most famous play ever.",Romeo + Juliet
326,sciullzlovescoco,Yuck- Shakespeare Would Not Be Pleased,2,22 May 2014,"We're watching this movie in my English class, and to put it lightly, it's pretty horrendous. The idea itself of adapting one of Shakespeare's works is astounding and takes great talent and care, but if done poorly, the results end just like the play- tragic.My first issue is the fact that the characters are speaking in Elizabethan English, which completely boggles my mind. Not only does it make the whole thing utterly confusing and unrealistic, it also heavily damages the point of modernizing the play at all. Another thing that bothered me about the play was how Luhrmann seemed so eager to cleverly adapt the play that he pretty much tried to throw in every ""modern"" thing he could think of- fast cars, gunfights, drugs, cigarettes, alcohol, obnoxious parties, loud punk music and street violence; all taking place in a rundown, scummy tourist attraction by the beach. He pretty much included everything but the kitchen sink, which not only makes the movie cliché, but it also ruins any chance of the movie to be seen as ""edgy"" instead of ridiculous.Asides from that, there's not much else, besides actors who either don't fit their part or can barely speak their lines. Often both. DiCaprio might be in this movie, but that doesn't make it any better, especially with his co-star, whose acting was about was vibrant as a dishcloth. Way too many transition effects in the movie, which make it extremely hard to watch the screen without getting a migraine. The only thing I enjoyed was the beautiful backdrops of the Capulet home, especially by the poolside. I also enjoyed Mercutio and his antics, and that was pretty much the only thing I found entertaining.Overall, watch the 1968 version instead and don't waste your time!",Romeo + Juliet

329,Elanor000,Don't see it,1,26 March 2006,"Romeo and Juliet... a great story, yes? Leonardo DiCaprio as Romeo? Um... no. Overall this is a particularly awful version. First of all, the Elizabethan dialect in the modern setting distracts horribly from the storyline. To see a man with pink hair in a half-open Hawaiian shirt saying thee and thou and other such nonsense is generally not pleasing to the modern audience. In addition, if you didn't know the story, you'd be extremely confused. There are some, well, not plot holes, but very confusing sections. In general the movie shows almost no traces of the fact that the Capulets and the Montagues hate each other. Furthermore several completely unnecessary (and rather disgusting) additions have been made, including a cross-dressing Mercutio. The ""prince of cats"" title attributed to Tybalt is atrociously overdone - he hisses at people. So if you want to see a great version of this classic story, see the 1968 version with Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey - a much more satisfying movie.",Romeo + Juliet
330,venoxben,A nice update on a classic tale,10,8 January 2017,This was a interesting film to watch a mix of new visuals and old English and the use of updating things that allowed to keep the same language like the Swords to the Sword as the name brand of the guns were genius. This telling of a old story with new elements as the fight between the two houses was updated to be a fight between to family companies and the wonderful prince being the police captain. Over all this is one of the most creative movies I have seen in a while a nice retell of a old story that everyone knows to a seemly different story that had lots of little differences that created a wonderfully updated and whimsical story but still had the classic feel of Romeo and Juliet which of course means it's incredibly sad and even though we know the ending it's still a fun ride to the end.,Romeo + Juliet

335,aleen_o-1,"Loved it, but why Claire Danes?",10,23 February 2006,"After reading the first page of the IMDb readers' ""Comments"" filtered in order of ""Best"" Comments, I found myself agreeing with most, and even learning historical tidbits and artistic insights to enhance future viewings. Since other readers said it so well, I have only one question: With all the potential actresses who could have played Juliet, why Claire Danes? Though appropriately young and innocent contrasting against the debauched culture backdrop, throughout the entire movie her northern homeliness seemed improbable to have diverted Romeo's romantic spark from Rosline, ab alluring siren by his friend Mercutio's description, guaranteed to keep an impressionable and romantic young man ensnared.Claire's hair poorly dyed at the roots in a color conflicting with her natural pallor and lacking life and shine was fine for her death scene, but not captivating prior. (Picture Greek actress Jennifer Anniston's shining, moving tresses mutely but eloquently attesting to a pampered upbringing and great south-of-the-equator genetic heritage.) Likewise Claire's pasty skin tone and lack of feature definition requiring makeup she was denied except way too late some too-dark and earthbound brick lipstick clashing not only with her coloring but her angelic costume for the big party. Italian girls' beauty is in curving black eyebrows arching like flying swallows above thickly fringed lashes lowering modestly over shy but alluringly smoldering dark eyes while thick glossy ringlets toss and curve around plump skin warmed by cloudless sunny Mediterranean skies. (Think Latin lovers and salsa dancers.) Does this describe Claire Danes? Not at all!Instead we're served up a pasty pale girl from north of the Equator who looks like the Dane she is named from chilly overcast Denmark, with crudely common peasant features. My neighbors are prettier than this flat-chested, dull-colored, severely-in-need-of-makeup girl who should be cast as a Puritan maid to a rich scion of the estate who falls in love with her because prolonged proximity teaches him maturely to appreciate her grateful sweetness and trustworthy salt-of-the earth soul. A far cry from the instantly captivating, imagination-firing, arrestingly demure but hotly passionate Capulet little rich girl.Claire's best visual trait is easily and quickly identified since she was gifted with so little aesthetically; but she wastes that lively smile prematurely in her scenes so that it feels coyly contrived, like a cute little masked clown instead of the ingenuously spontaneous eruption out of a girlish soul trembling on the threshold of new womanly feelings...shakily unfamiliar but at the same time deliciously tempting to be explored with this suddenly appearing object for her adoration--intense, beautiful, and ardorous young Romeo.I longed for a prior Juliet--innocently sultry and husky-voice Olivia Hussey, a petite little hussy of a princess--opposite Leonardo DiCaprio. Or even Marisa Tomei, who always seems young, hot-headed and vulnerable. Or even the youngest ""Gilmore Girl"" (though not typically Italian), with her big eyes, shiny hair, and lovely young body delicately yielding to new sensuality. We want a girl on her first date and prom, a Snow White awakened by her youthful Prince charming, not a tomboy. This artistic production was such an original piece and so vividly delivered that the colorless Claire was an even bigger disappointment to me here than she would have been in a more pedestrian production of the classic Romeo & Juliet. I'm sure I'll enjoy this actress in future movies better suited, since IMDb readers' comment enthusiastically about her; but she stops me from wanting to own this otherwise artistic and moving rendition of the poetry of Romeo & Juliet.",Romeo + Juliet

337,broadwaystar402,the most ridiculous version I have ever seen,2,12 February 2006,"This is the worst, albeit most hilarious version of any Shakespearean play I have ever seen. It was simply ridiculous, and although it was intended to be a tragedy, this movie is not. Unless you consider bad movies ""tradgedies"".Leonardo DiCaprio was mediocre as Romeo, although Claire Danes was good in the role of Juliet. There were several points in which it moved from tragic and poignant to stupid and absurd. One such time was when Romeo is driving down the street before he kills Tybalt, he is screaming as if possessed. This was a bit over-done. There are others, such as the over-dramatized and misinterpreted scene towards the end, where Romeo is about to drink the poison. Juliet opens her eyes and reaches her hand up towards him, while he continues talking, completely oblivious!!! Where, may I ask, is that in the original play?! I guess I am just another traditionalist, and I acknowledge that Baz Luhrmann has a right to his own interpretation, and that there are those that truly enjoyed this movie. However, I honestly believe that Shakespeare would be appalled at how his brilliant and incredible works have been adapted to the silver screen.",Romeo + Juliet

I was forced to watch it for three days in my Lit class, but after only a few minutes I put my head down and began to cry. Its like shoving a sharpened stick in both eyes while simultaneously pulling a Van Gogh and cutting your ears off. In fact, I would rather do those things than ever watch this piece of crap ever again. My biggest problem was the dialogue. You can't just say things like, ""But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!""In modern times. It sounds stupid. Baz needed to either modernize the dialogue, or not make this movie. Zeffereli's version was amazingly good, compared to this one anyway, and West Side Story, was also good. West Side story was COMPLETELY modernized, and it worked. This version, half modernized, did NOT work. so in short, don't see this movie. I would rather have rabid dogs attack me than ever be attacked by this crappy, movie, with no-talent actors, terrible directing, and stupid ideas.

It brought together many talented actors.  The multi faceted character of Mercutio was portrayed with an OUTSTANDING performance by Harold Perrineau Jr. , Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes also gave excellent performances.

341,starc-2,Pretty Darned Good,6,25 July 2000,"OK, warning.  If you've never seen/read Romeo and Juliet, this will contain spoilers.  Since the play is--oh, I don't know, 400 years old?--I don't think this warning is really necessary, but I don't want to get ""blacklisted"" for not warning you!Baz Luhrmann's updated version of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet seems to be a movie which inspires viewers to extremes--all the reviews I have heard are either ""love it"" reviews or ""hate it"" reviews.  I propose to take the middle road.  I don't think that the film is a piece of trash, as Ye Olde Shakespeare Fans tend to brand it.  I also don't think it's the greatest thing since Zeffirelli.  The main thing here is not to compare Luhrmann's vision to Zeffirelli's--or to any traditional performance of the play.  Take it by itself, and it's actually pretty decent.  There are, however, some places where you can't help but notice that Romeo's murder of Tybalt isn't quite the same when it's done in a car chase, or that the lovers' deaths are more tragic, or that you can't seem to recall the families reconciling in this version...

343,jimkahl,"Modernized Shakespeare? Good Intent, Terrible Movie",1,3 March 2000,"I have long been a fan of Shakespeare.  It has always amazed me that a person could write an entire play as a series of poems.  The man was a genius.  Modernizing Shakespeare for the teens of today is a good idea - but this movie falls terribly short.After seeing this movie (I can't believe I watched the whole thing - I guess I thought it would get better), I was thoroughly disgusted.  There are several reasons.  First, the acting itself was terrible, except for John Leguizamo as Tybalt, who did a magnificent job. Leo and Claire both seemed as though they were reading most of their lines from cue cards - there was little if any emotion involved.  This movie also destroyed the true relationship between Mercutio and Romeo, it turns Romeo into a druggie and Mercutio into nothing more than his dealer.  What kid of today who uses drugs would seek revenge for the death of his dealer? None. They would simply seek out a different one.  I can understand trying to remain true to Shakespeare's words, however, there were many times in the movie that doing so did not make sense.This movie would probably have been much better if it had not used Shakespeare's dialog.  The cast itself isn't bad, but for the most part they did not seem comfortable with the original dialog.  If they would have modernized the dialog along with the visual aspects, I might have enjoyed it more.",Romeo + Juliet
344,lhaney,what a waste of celluloid,1,16 September 2000,"this film takes the bounds of the unwatchable and stretches them to near-mythic proportions. how a director could start with a play of such stature and end up with such a poorly acted, unintelligibly edited piece of filth is beyond my comprehension. the only thing this flick has going for it is the supporting cast. Pete Postlethwaite is excellent, as always, but putting him on screen with leo's befuddled romeo is a true crime. some modernizations are better left unmade. on the whole, i'd rather sit in the treatment chair in ""A Clockwork Orange"" and be forced to watch ""West Side Story"" for three days straight than be forced to endure a second watching of of this beast.",Romeo + Juliet

I was excited to watch this version since I thought it would be good. I'm sorry, but it sucked.This version of Romeo and Juliet kept bugging me. So is Luhrmann trying to say that in modern day Verona, people can just carry guns around and start shooting and the law isn't charged upon them? And the citizens don't care that their local gas station is on fire? Another thing: Hello Romeo and Juliet OPEN your eyes and look around. Oh my gosh, your NOT in Renaissance Italy! Your in modernized-and-updated Verona! There's money! There's cars! There's passports! And airplanes were invented nearly a century ago! Consider those facts.

However when i saw it the second time i was gripped. Even though it used Shakespearean language i found that i could follow the dialogue. Leonardo Dicaprio was fantastic in this film, a very believable character and i found the violence, as brutal as it was, very necessary. I was also really happy that Juliets character wasn't as melodramatic as she always seems to be and also less innocent. As weird as it is i find the opening scene, after the reporter on the t.v, one of my favourite scenes. The way it is presented is astounding, the music, the text and the speech it great. The way they incorporated the story into a modern setting is so clever and even though they use the Shakespearean language i didn't find it out of place.

I am now older and because I understand it more,I find it even better. It is truly a masterpiece, just like Baz's other wonders in the series.Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio are some of the best actors in my opinion, and at such young ages (Leo was 21, Claire was 17, AS FAR AS I KNOW!) it's terrific. They did such a wonderful job, and still to this day I believe they made such an in love couple. I consider them one of the best on screen couples I have ever seen in any movie, in my life.They belong together.

This movie literally take your normal, everyday, Romeo and Juliet and adapts it into a more realistic time-line and setting, This movie also does an amazing job of representing the many emotional concepts covered in the actual play.

(Which this movie DID NOT!) Baz has an amazing visual eye and a real knack for finding music that rips us down to the core. I personally believe one of the most beautiful and moving scenes in this entire film is when Romeo and Juliet first meet each other with fleeting glances through the aquarium glass, to that AMAZING song, ""Kissing You"" by Des'ree.And to everyone that said it wasn't original seeing guys with dyed hair and unbuttoned Hawaiian shirts running around reciting Shakespeare, well...

351,sgtdiscoming,Wonderful (and overlooked) Shakespeare Adaptation,9,20 July 2006,"As a teenager who has had a love affair with film all of his life and who is a great admirer of Shakespeare, I must state that Baz Luhrmann's film version of William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet is one of the most important films of both the 1990s and in Shakespearean culture. It is also a great romance film (think of it as a Titanic for literature enthusiasts). The reason I say that is because it made Shakespeare as entertaining to see in a new generation as it was back in the 1600s. One must admit, that to an average teenager (or person, for that matter), Shakespeare is as boring as reading a tax filing instruction book. With the language and ""iambic pentameter"" (a rhythmic way of speaking with five beats for each line of Shakespeare, which is something conservative Shakespeare scholars hold dear) Shakespeare can sound like clapping with one hand. However, with Baz's creativity and style, R+J is one of the most entertaining adaptations of Shakespeare ever put on film. From the dazzling visuals to the working chemistry between Leo and Claire, Shakespeare is made fun again.A lot of people knock this version for its extreme over-the-top style and the changing of the simplest elements (changing swords to guns, use of rock music), but to make a hit, that's what you have to do to get your point across. Sure, most of the text is cut and some plot elements from the original is left out, but that does not change the true story by much (you think a teenager would want to sit through the WHOLE play on film?). You have to admit, Shakespeare's not easy to translate to the screen, so one must give Baz a lot of credit for trying and succeeding. Sure its bawdy, violent and over the top, but that's his style. You can't blame a director for using his own style to make an entertaining film. And the way he updates the details to match the era is fantastic (usage of cars, gun handling, Mercutio as a drag queen, Queen Mab as a drug, Prince as a cop, etc.). A lot of people knock the simplest changes, most often touched upon being the swords-to-guns controversy. Think about it: your living in the 1990s, who's going to carry a sword? And while there are wonderful qualities, the negative ones must be briefly touched upon. The language is sometimes spoken without any sort of rhythm at all (I'm not knocking it for not using iambic pentameter, but since Shakespeare is poetic, treat it like it is poetry) and is sometimes spoken as if it were slang. Some of the actors handle it very nicely, and some just crash and burn. I must say, that I bet there were many teens in the audience scratching their heads at what everybody was talking about, but I think it's good for people to listen to movies and not just watch them. One thing I was personally annoyed by was the use of that song ""Pretty Piece of Flesh"". It's used once in the first scene, then used again ten minutes later in a scene with the same exact people. Is that all they listen to? Other than that, there are not many negative elements to touch upon.*SPOILER WARNING*Some of the scenes are absolutely spectacular. The gas station scene is wonderfully cartoonish as it mimics a spaghetti-Western shootout, the first encounters between Romeo and Juliet are beautifully done (especially the elevator scene and the pool scene), and the rewritten final scene between Romeo and Juliet is convincing and tragic (and convincingly tragic). I was so into that scene that I was sort of yelling at the screen for Juliet to make a move to Romeo faster in order to show that she's alive. It's little things like those that helps you know how convincing the romance is between the two, and overall it was an extremely powerful and moving scene. The performances from the two are great, as well as Mercutio, Tybalt (who is played by an extremely badass Leguizamo), Friar, Nurse and Prince. This is one of my favorite films, both from the 1990s and of all time, and I hope that in the future, many more people will discover it the way I did.",Romeo + Juliet
352,henryaufdemmond,Modern wonder,9,15 December 2019,"William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, released on November 1, 1996 by 20th Century Fox, is an American romantic crime tragedy directed and co-produced by Baz Luhrmann and Gabriella Martinelli. It is a modernization of William Shakespeare's tragedy Romeo and Juliet. The film includes Hollywood stars such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in the title roles. The story is about Romeo and Juliet who fall in love with each other but cannot publicly show that, because they are members of feuding families. The film shows how blind and addictive love can be and what chaos and tragedy such wonderful feeling can bring. Despite the bad rating on sites like Cinema , this film won prizes such as the Silver Bear for Best Actor. This gives you a first hint about the quality of this production.Romeo and Juliet is not Shakespeare's best play, but it has been his best poetry. It is about language, about the difference between real dilemmas and how they are described through language. This makes it so hard to film. But that's not all; the story itself is one of the most fundamental ones in the history of theatre and filmmaking up to now. It is so strong one can make a film just through the story without even trying to implement the old-fashioned language. In fact, it can be too strong and there is the fear of losing the connection to the language. But Luhrmann accepts the challenge and produces a modernized version of Romeo and Juliet with some unconventional choices, compared to earlier movies such as Zeffirelli's released in 1968. So, I had been worried that Luhrman would either destroy the play's beauty by setting it in modern times, or slaughter Shakespeare's eloquent words by modernizing it. But I was wrong. While watching the movie, I found almost everything about it incredible.Luhrman did an excellent job casting Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio as the title roles. Both shine in their unique way and each character has an individual development throughout the story.Leonardo DiCaprio as Romeo was a brilliant decision. Even though some of his monologues were a bit too dramatically spoken, his performance throughout the film was stunning. DiCaprio's strengths like his huge impulsiveness or his, at that age, strong facial expressions adapt perfectly to the way Shakespeare intended Romeo to act, which leads up to the lover's tragic fate. When the story begins, Romeo is a hopeless romantic who frantically fantasises of love, and seems to linger more in his dreams than in the real world on earth. He is overthinking love without having any real clue what true love is. This changes the moment he gets to meet Juliet and where he begins to understand the true depth and passion of love. DiCaprio is one of the best, if not the best actor, when it comes to tragic romantic scenes. With his acting skills, one can really feel the development Romeo experienced. Leonardo DiCaprio is just the top romantic tragedy actor as he proves one year later in the movie Titanic (1997).Then there is Claire Danes who was equally impressive. She has an innocent face, looks really young and more importantly acts almost flawlessly throughout the entire movie. You can see the depth of this character's development by focusing on behaviour this innocent kid shows off. There is a big contrast between the beginning of the film with her naive mindset and at the end where she brutally suicides herself. She plays a believable naive girl who has not yet experienced true love. Even though she is someone I have not seen in too many movies she proves her quality in this film.
Lastly, there is the Nurse, played by Miriam Margolyes, who does an excellent job. Despite the fact that she plays a flat character without any progression in terms of development, she acts those parts very authentic. You get the impression that she sees Juliet as a daughter, because of the language and the way she performs her role.My favourite scene of the movie is perhaps the most iconic scene in the film, when Romeo opens the door to the church see Juliet's dead body. This scene is filled with lots of details so you have to watch it multiple times to comprehend its depth and beauty. For one there is the atmosphere this scene presents. With the low angle shots and body frames you get the view that you are present in the actual scene. Combined with the crazy number of white candles and blue crosses, it creates a heart-breaking mood without even knowing the plot. After that, the scene continues with the reaction Romeo has on Juliet's death. This reaction proves that this is the best Romeo adaption you can find out there. You can feel the anger and sadness he expresses when kissing and crying to Juliet's ""dead body"". At that time, Juliet wakes up and witnesses Romeo taking the poison. That makes everything even more devastating. After that you see how Juliet changes her mood from loving to sadness in a way, it really goes into your heart as well as under your skin. To end it all perfectly, she notices the gun laying in her coffin and decides to pull the trigger while aiming the gun towards her head. In my eyes this is probably the most affecting death you can get at that point. The decision to swap out the dagger and instead using a gun, to end the story, makes it more relatable and puts the cherry on top. By and large this end has memorable images followed with remarkable language.
The soundtrack of the movie ""Young Hearts Run Free"" and ""Kissing You"", both released on the Capitol Records label, did an excellent job underlining the powerful scenes, and emphasizing the feeling you experience. Though I think it lacked background vocals; in the last scene they could have implemented a choir's vocal style underlining the immortality/mortality contrast dilemma in that scene. Both costumes and special effects, such as the aquarium scene, the TV that introduces and closes the movie, or the gang outfits, create refreshing scenarios so the viewer nonstop enjoys the movie. Also, the camera is restless. There are times when the rapid cuts combined with the soundtrack cause confusion to the viewer, which leads to more attention given. But one critical point with the special effects is the consistent and extreme use of colours, which end up in a negative way. It is easy to lose the common thread in the story when there is too much happening on screen. Some scenes suffer from exactly that, like the ""LSD trip"" the Montagues have. Overall the production value is pretty high standard and well produced, and can compete with films released nowadays!In conclusion Romeo and Juliet (1996) is in my opinion a very underrated modernization of Shakespeare play. What surprised me was that it was set in present day and still matched almost perfectly. It contained its original dialogue which brings the language back and shows how old but still relevant Shakespeare's plays are. I highly recommend you see it as soon as possible. If you are a fan of Shakespeare like me, you are almost guaranteed to enjoy this movie even with the implementation of modern world and society.",Romeo + Juliet
353,Bardcastle,visually stunning but badly acted.,2,1 August 2007,"This is Shakespeare for Dummies. While visually stunning and full of action, the acting is sub par at best. Whther this is the fault of the actors or the director I cannot say, but the lines are delivered melodramatically. Apparently these people do not know how to put emotion into their lines without shouting. Furthermore, the way the lines are delivered when not shouted are given with bizarre inflections and accents on words and syllables that blur the meaning of the speeches. As a teacher of literature, I would not recommend this movie. While I believe that Shakepeare can be made accessible to today's youth, especially urban youth, in doing so, this movie loses the original vision: to tell the story well.",Romeo + Juliet

It's a Red Curtain Movie without a doubt; its drama, love theme, passion, but in some parts its pure quirkyness and 'feel good' moments are all perfected. For instance, it starts off with something similar to an ad for the movie which is entirely unique.When I first saw this movie I was hesitant as it start; you may find that, the Shakespeare language may seem unfitting and unusual, but by seeing this movie you'll get hooked. Make sure you see this movie without the following; the dog barking, people running around and yelling, the lights on. I've seen this movie over 5 times and become more liking it every second. If you think some other movies are sad, get ready to hide the tears at the end of this one; I've never come close to crying in any movie I've seen (and I've seen a lot of movies) but this one was the exception.

357,je_taimealafolie,Indefinite Love,8,22 July 2007,"""I Love Thee."" Love, Amor, Aroha. Love, love, love, love, love. What is this so called love? Baz Luhrman's version of Shakespeare's 'Romeo & Juliet' can answer that question for you. Bursting with many different loves from arranged love to forbidden love, forbidden to doomed love, to name a few, and portrayed in such fine detail along with its amazing cast such as Leonardo Dicaprio as Romeo and Claire Danes as Juliet who both play the love scenes with immense passion and ease, giving its audience a taste of what true love really is. This is truly ""A film that will kick you in the heart.This is a powerful story of chaos, fate and above all, love. Set in a modernized Verona, where daggers, rapiers and swords are used as brand names for guns. A place where you will see guys dressed in Hawaiian shirts, cars with speed and police men with a modern look, who and which are all surprisingly relevant to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet script. But most importantly, it is a story of two young star-crossed lovers who meet at a party and fall deeply in love, but then find out that they belong to families who have been enemies for a period of time. This love the two lovers, Romeo and Juliet have, is then kept a secret which becomes more and more difficult to hold on to leading to the most brutal things.From the scene with the aquarium where Romeo and Juliet first encounter each other to the 'blue' and tragic ending, the love stayed alive and stole my heart. The love in this updated movie was way to powerful to keep anybody's tear drops in place and it definitely was worth the sniffs and the subterfuge of hiding behind the sentence ""I just finished yawning."" An idea in the movie relevant to love, that I LOVED, was the use of water. I see the water is Romeo and Juliet's love world, Romeo and Juliet first meet at a fish tank where they start flirt, Romeo and Juliet fall in pool and start kissing etc. But I also see the water as dangerous in some way, Tybalt dies in water, families drenched in rain, which shows and tells me that you shouldn't get involved with Romeo and Juliet and their love, or you will pay.This film truly is an amazing movie and I could just see all the time, effort and hard work that was put into making this just by watching it. If five stars meant ""Very Very Good"", then the eight stars I give this movie would just show how much love I have for it. ""Did my heart love 'till now?"" (Romantic movies that is), why yes, yes it did, thanks to this version of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. The strongest love story ever told.",Romeo + Juliet

The way they mixed up Shakespeare's work is amazing. Claire Danes is a great Juliet but I wish I was Juliet so I could make out with Leo. I love this movie and you should see it too. The part where Romeo poisons himself and when Juliet kills herself is sad. It's also sad because Romeo and Juliet never got to run away and enjoy life as husband and wife, and be free from their relatives who hated each other so much. They would of lived if the relatives could just get along. I loved how they set it in modern times with Shakespeare's work so he could get credit. This movie is a total twist of the original.

362,dhlinca1,Funnier then hell,10,6 December 2006,"A little while ago, I saw this film during a class where we previously read the play. The play was satisfactory, meaning I understood it and did not hate it. After reading the play, we saw the movie. I loved it. I could not stop laughing. It was just so corny beyond belief. Parts that were not supposed to be humorous, were. For example, the first scene in the gas station was absolutely hilarious with them jumping around shooting.I thought that the old English applied to the modern stuff was not realistic or necessary, but I thought it was funnier then hell. It was hilarious how they all spoke in such ridiculous wordings as they preformed these actions.For those who hated this film, I just have to say that you cannot take these things really seriously. The play is outdated now, and will be in the future. Back then, it was great! In addition, they cannot change the words, because then it wouldn't be true to the play. So, just take this with a grain of salt.I loved when Romeo killed Tybalt. That was so corny and ridiculous I fell on the floor laughing. When the rain cloud burst over head, when he rammed his car into Tybalt's car, it was so hilarious.I have nothing but good memories about this film.WARNING: If you expect a scene for scene regurgitation, then this is not for you. I seriously recommend reading this play before hand, unless it will be so confusing. Oh, and I hated the original film. I couldn't understand it and fell asleep after the first part with the prince.",Romeo + Juliet
363,charlottesmith-79065,Romeo and Juliet - Film Review 🎬,3,29 May 2021,"Baz Luhrmann's dazzling rendition of the ancient love story of Romeo and Juliet gives Shakespeare's most famous play a 'modern' twist and uplift. The California, mafia-ganged, retro theme transports us to the sunny Verona beach, where two 'star crossed lovers', 'destined to be together' meet at the famous 'Capulet party'. The 400 year (plus) romantic fantasy is brought up to date with the bright costumes, guns, cars and glamourous sets paints the perfect backdrop for Romeo and Juliet's tragic tale to take place.The contrast between 'new' and old can sometimes create a confusing reality that Romeo and Juliet find one another in. Leonardo Decaprio (Romeo Montague) and Claire Danes (Juliet Capulet) play the roles of the love sick, passionate children of the Montague and Capulet bloodline, the bloodlines that could never cross! Due to the ancient family feud between them that has been going on for over centuries, with each generation carrying the legacy to despise one another.As the families' hate for each other grew stronger, Romeo and Juliet fell in love behind closed doors and or between a fish tank, away from prying eyes. Juliet's mother had peer pressured Juliet into marrying a man named 'Paris' (Paul Rudd) hand selected by Lady Capulet but Romeo and Juliet's love pushed them into the proposition of marrying, in secret the next day, when they had discussed this after the party, bumping into each other and falling into the pool together. Romeo then met with Friar Lawrence played by; Pete Postlethwaite and persuaded to marry them and to help them with a plan to fake their own death so they could run away together, leaving their families history behind with them. Unfortunately, the plan didn't get to Romeo in time, instead he was involved in a fight with Tybalt (John Leguizamo) , the cousin of Juliet that discovered their secret and was discussed. Romeo's best friend, Mercutio, (the vibrant, upbeat character played by; Harold Perrineau) had unfortunately been killed in the process making Romeo seek vengeance and shot Tybalt after a attention grabbing car chase, this scene was full of pathetic fallacy making their deaths very emotional and dramatic.After the death of Tybalt and Mercutio, Romeo had been exiled but his love for Juliet brought him to the church where he had discovered her 'dead' but what he didn't know is that she had drunk a sleeping potion to fake her death. Romeo, struck by greif, drank poison and died beside the sleeping Juliet. She awakens just seconds later discovering what poor Romeo had done and finding the body of Paris nearby. She begged for there to be some 'poison to be left on his lips' so she could kiss him and be at peace but that never worked out so she unshifted his dagger and plunged it into her chest. After both families were told the news, their feud simply faded.My overall opinion on the 1996 remandition is a star rating of 3. The mashup of new and old didn't work for me. I found it overly dramatic and it didn't really represent Shakespeare's true meaning of the play. I would recommend this film to someone who likes watching the genres; romance, drama, tragedy, comedy.",Romeo + Juliet
364,nitefire-1,Wow...,1,21 November 2007,"This movie was terrible. It's the play that has been around for decades, and could quite possibly be one of the most recognized love stories in the history of man. Having said that, it could also possibly be one of the most Boring films ever made and then, they go and make a modernized version of the film?? I don't know weather they meant for this to be a smash hit, or if their intent was to just bore the audience to death. H'm Let's discuss the plot. The film starts off with a street brawl between the two feuding families Capulet, and Montague. The prince soon breaks this up and declares that ""lives will pay the forfeit of the piece"". The film continues on until Romeo meets Juliet at the Capulet ball. After the two lovers meet, and fall in love they decide to plan a secret marriage. But it's not long before their plans are skewed after Romeo is banished from Verona for killing Tybalt, who killed Mercutio - a close friend of Romeos'. The secret affairs and family conflicts in both films eventually lead to tragedy. In the 1968 film of Romeo and Juliet directed by Franco Zeffirelli, the character of romeo and Juliet are played by Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey along with John McEnery as Mercutio, Michael York as Tybalt and Bruce Robinson as Benvolio. The acting in this film is terrible to say the least. Both Romeo and Juliet seemed superficial and immature, and the acting was always either overdone or underdone. I realize that it is a very dramatic style, but it was just excruciating to watch. I found it hard to respect a Juliet that would hide behind the nurse like a toddler, while lord Capulet yelled at her. While some people enjoy this type of acting (pause, look at James) I found that the drama was overdone to the point where it was unwatchable. Despite the fact that I also despise the modernized film, I would certainly recommend the newer film over this one. I don't think the film worked at all.The end :)",Romeo + Juliet

367,mariolover,Nicely Done,8,8 March 2008,"Just recently, I saw the 1968 version of Shakespeare's classic. And I hated it. Therefore, I was convinced that this adaptation would be no better. However, I heard nice things about it, and decided to rent it.Well. I was pleasantly surprised. What emotions I lacked while viewing the older one, or even reading the play, I felt while watching this movie. I think it takes a lot to make Shakespeare feel relevant to a modern teen, but Baz Luhrman managed to do this.The acting is superb. I love Claire Danes, and it was nice to see what she is capable of. Of course, I already know that Leo can act. And the twist on the ending was brilliant. Throughout the last twenty minutes or so, I found myself hoping against hope that maybe this could have a happy ending. Of course, we all know how it ends, and happy is one thing it isn't.I do have some complaints, though. Parts of this movie were just...well, weird. Don't get me started on Mercutio. But if you can handle the edgy strangeness, you should definitely watch this movie.",Romeo + Juliet

I got quite emotional at some scenes, and it tells an epic story. My complaints include that the gunfights were low-budget by today's standards, and the fact that they were speaking OLD FREAKING English! I know that the original story was told written in Victorian times by Shakespeare and that it added to the atmosphere, but if they decided to tell this story in modern day Verona Beach, they could have updated the dialogue. I feel that another retelling of this with modern language and more action would do very well.",Romeo + Juliet

370,bigmouth774,The worst movie I have ever seen,1,12 May 2009,"It is hard to believe this movie was ever made. I am guessing that Baz Luhrmanns reputation was the reason why, but this movie surely dinged that same reputation. I would shoot myself if I had invested in it. Why would anyone update the time/era of this masterpiece by William Shakespeare yet use 500 year old dialogue? If one has some issue with the work I wouldn't think it wasn't the time frame but rather the archaic language. This piece of trash gets it 100% incorrect. How can anyone be expected to find this combination useful is frankly beyond my ability to reason. Whatever possessed such a fine cast to be involved with this project is the question. Perhaps Claire Danes was too young to have a reputation strong enough to turn down this role, but no other actor in this garbage of a film has that excuse to fall back on. If you enjoy Ms Danes get a hold of her fantastic, and too good for TV, series ""My So Called Life"". I like John Leguizamo as much as anyone I believe, but casting him as an Italian stretches my imagination well past it's ability. In an act of delicious irony he dresses as a Puerto Rican for the ""ball"". Funny! I could only make it through 40 minutes of this film. If the truth were to be spoken.... this film makes Peyton Place(my former worst movie ever) look like a masterpiece. I would be embarrassed to be seen renting this movie. Save your money for a Porky's movie. As bad as they were they were three times the quality of this junk. Perhaps if you can enjoy 2 men playing pool, speaking Old English, in a pool hall where they have to check their 9mm's you could enjoy this. I thought it was ridiculous.",Romeo + Juliet
371,steinbergdavid,review of the film (my rating = 8/10) - may contain spoilers,8,15 May 2003,"There are three types of Shakespeare films. The first are traditional Shakespeare films which remain wholly faithful to the original plays. The second are modernised Shakespeare films which update or contemporise certain aspects of the original plays while retaining Shakespearian language. The third are films which are loosely based on Shakespeare, usually just on the plot of the plays updating everything else including the language. Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet retained the Shakespearian language but cast two unknown and definitely not Shakespearian teenage actors in the two main roles of Romeo and Juliet. The film cut some of the dialogue from the original play which the director felt was unnecessary and would bore the audience, not being vital to the story. The film contained several contemporary flourishes and was ultimately a visual feast of a film rather than a filmed play with theatrical sets and scenery. However, although it succeeded as a film rather than a filmed play, this version of Romeo and Juliet was almost entirely faithful to the original play in comparison to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo+Juliet, which updated everything there is to update, while retaining the Shakespearian language, cutting unnecessary dialogue, updating the setting to Verona Beach, Los Angeles, replacing swords with guns, using cars, casting two very un-Shakepearian actors in the lead roles of Romeo and Juliet and more. You cannot compare this film with Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet simply because you cannot compare a film whose plot is a modernised Shakespeare story and whose language is that of Shakepeare's original text (along with some editing) with a film adaptation of a Shakespeare play that may introduce several contemporary flourishes but nevertheless remains a traditional and faithful film version of the play. Zeffirelli's version is obviously the best adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, but likewise Luhrmann's Romeo+Juliet is the best modernisation of Shakespeare's play. Luhrmann's version is essentially a film while Zefferelli's is essentially a play made into a film. As for the quality of acting, the level of traditional Shakespearian acting is higher in Zeffirelli's than it is in Luhrmann's, which is why Luhrmann's is a true modernisation of the play. This is not Leonardo di Caprio's very best performance, but it ranks among his best, which include 'The Basketball Diaries', 'This Boy's Life' with Robert De Niro and 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' in which he gives his undeniably greatest and easily most amazing performance as a mentally handicapped boy. His acting in the film was so convincing that people thought that the director had cast a real mentally handicapped boy in the role (Leonardo Di Caprio was unknown when he made the film in 1993). Still, in Romeo+Juliet he shows good acting ability in his violence, passion, romance and the characteristic innocence and obsessional love of Romeo. Many people have complained that he speaks his lines as if they are meaningless and that he 'loses' the emphasis of some of the lines that he rapidly delivers. As for myself, I heard every line that he and all of the other actors spoke, and his unconventional rapid delivery of the lines only adds to the fast and furious atmosphere of the entirely unconventional film and emphasises the fact that the text mostly constitutes conversations between people, not soliloquys and speeches, although there are some. Therefore he makes his lines in conjunction with those of other actors in the film sound like part of a conversation, rather than delivering his lines slowly and deliberately, pausing after very important lines. People have also complained that Leonardo di Caprio goes 'way over the top', especially in the scene where he learns of Juliet's supposed death. However, this only adds to the atmosphere of the film, which is meant to be 'over the top'. Also, the fact that the two main characters are played by two non-Shakespearian actors only emphasises the fact that they are ordinary people who have experienced a tragedy in their short lives, rather than Shakespearian actors who deliver their lines with far more pretention and exuding a higher status than those 'below' in the audience, as it would have seemed in theatres in Shakespeare's days and in theatres today. Admittedly, though, the two actors who play Romeo and Juliet in Zeffirelli's version are also non-Shakespearian actors. Luhrmann's film is also an undeniable visual extravaganza, with contemporary flourishes of western-type shoot-outs and other alterations such as the balcony scene, controversially held in Juliet's swimming pool. Modernised versions of Shakespeare should, in my opinion, be accessible to everyone, not just those who love Shakespeare. In retaining the original language (something that is rare in modernized Shakespeare) Luhrmann could have confused the ordinary movie-goer, but instead he fuses action and visual aid with Shakespeare's language so effectively that the audience is never confused as to the trajectory of the plot. In comparison to other modernised Shakespeare films (which update or contemporise certain aspects of the original plays while retaining the Shakespearian language) this surely ranks as one of if not the best. Indeed it is difficult to recall any other films that retain the original language or text while updating certain aspects of the play. The original language is probably the biggest feature of the film that gives it a high rank, for it introduces young and old audiences unfamiliar with Shakespeare to his brilliant language while revealing how thrilling the plots of his plays actually are, by using bright and colourful settings, scenery and action. The two main roles are backed up by a brilliant cast of cameos including experienced Shakespeare actors Pete Postlethwaite and Paul Sorvino, among others. This is a brilliant film which, although not one of the very greatest (The Godfather, The Usual Suspects, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, The Shawshank Redemption etc.) definitely deserves a rating of  8/10.",Romeo + Juliet
372,moller-553-415997,Appalling,1,21 February 2012,"I found this film literally unwatchable--I put up with it for perhaps ten minutes and then could take no more. Shakespeare's play is among the greatest ever written in English, but it was utterly ruined by the action. It was Ode to Joy done by a screamo band; it was Swan Lake done by break dancers.Shakespeare's plays tell a story in moving and powerful ways, one of the reasons they can be read with nearly as much pleasure as may be gotten by seeing them performed on stage. The language tells the story, not the props, not the scenery, not even, particularly, the actors. In this version of the play, the language is lost. The props, scenery, and action overwhelm it. The dialogue, in the mouths of these actors, in the situations in which they deliver it, is utterly malapropos.I've no idea why Mr Luhrmann made this film, but, in doing so, he did no service to either Shakespeare nor to his audiences. It might be a bit much to call it a desecration of Shakespeare's work, but it's not far from it. It's a parody. It's La Gioconda done in crayon.",Romeo + Juliet

Why in the world is Romeo on ecstacy in this movie? Of corse he fell in love with Juliet, he was horny as ol' men in a college. I'm a teenager and not in one way did this help me relate to Romeo & Juliet. It was stupid and half the people that died in the play didn't die in the movie. The enemies didn't end up getting along.. was that not one of the huge lessons to be learned in the play? I don't know what the director was aiming for .. but the second he decided to put them in flowered shirts his movie got REALLY bad.",Romeo + Juliet
374,vier1,my personal favorite,10,5 August 2014,"Romeo and Juliet might be the greatest love story of all times and I do not want to get into detail too much about what it is about in this review - which is my first on IMDb. I would rather like to somewhat share with you the way I experienced it.Back in my teenage years I saw Romeo + Juliet in cinema twice within a week. It is the only movie I went twice to cinema for. Although I knew roughly what the play was about the story kept me in suspense so much I still had a lump in my throat the day after I watched this movie the first time. To that day I had never been as fascinated by anything and really had to think about this tale for days to come. So it was the first time I got to witness the ""whole"" story and in retrospect it probably was the best version for me. It was magic.I could identify myself with Romeo - he was like who i wanted to be - exceptionally played by DiCaprio and I fell in Love with Julia - stunningly beautiful, just everything - brilliantly played by Claire Danes. DiCaprio had already been one of my favorite actors before (and after) what I can not say about Claire Danes in general but in that role she was near perfect to me. Other stand-out performances I would like to mention are the strong characterization of Mercutio played by the best Harold Perrineau I have seen while in the part of Tybalt John Leguizamo excels himself either.The settings and direction of this movie are plain fantastic from my point of view. Along with the contemporary interpretation of Shakespeare's genuine play Baz Luhrmann managed to create a pretty special atmosphere that feels surreal, menacing but at the same time highly appealing. Without the original lyrics used in this adaption I could imagine Romeo + Juliet to be an absolutely intoxicating flick but the dreamlike poetry propel it's atmosphere to another level.I like movies to tell me an interesting story in the first place and showcase it the way it feels right. To this day no other movie could outreach the impact Romeo + Juliet had on me. The first Love usually is the deepest and there is nothing perfect in this world except for true Love..",Romeo + Juliet

376,howlingchaoskitty,Hilarious.... but not supposed to be a satire....,8,19 January 2011,"My rating is based on my enjoyment of the movie and not on it's intended execution. The acting would have been better for a true comedy, the modernization and Las Vegas-ization of certain scenes, not to mention the over-use of the original wording of the play make it thoroughly amusing, but not a drama masterpiece by any means.When I first saw this movie I didn't expect to be in stitches by the end, but I could hardly breathe. This movie has become a favourite rainy-day movie for my friends and I.I would recommend that you gather a few of your most sarcastic friends together for a night in and enjoy!",Romeo + Juliet
377,sp00ge,An brilliant revamp of a classic piece,9,22 October 2003,"Baz Luhrman and Craig Pearce's interpretation of Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet is a brilliant revamp of a classic piece.  Rather than taking the more traditional approach of capturing the story's essence but using a new script, Romeo + Juliet maintains the original Shakespeare script.  However Luhrman goes far beyond simply translating the play into a screenshow as so many filmmakers have done in the past.The film takes place in a somewhat modern-day Verona with a strong flex of his poetic license muscle.  Swords are transformed into guns, horses to cars.  Prior to seeing the film, when I heard about it I was wildly skeptical of how it could be a good film.  I'm very much a Shakespeare fan and appreciate his works in their more ""original"" form.  However Luhrman does an astounding job of the transformations that take place and they actually work very well on screen.  It doesn't take a very big leap of faith on the audience's part to accept a gun for a sword.  It amazes me how well Shakespeare's script works in a modern setting.  On top of the translations, the visuals and filmography are very appealing and do the rest of the film justice.I personally found the acting to be quite good throughout the film, however I'm not usually too nitpicky about acting, I try to see the film on the whole.  My personal favorites are Leguizamo as Tybalt and Danes as Juliet, and Perrineau as Mercutio.Overall I consider the movie to be a fresh new approach to a very old classic.  It is a pleasant departure from the stagnant traditional approach to modernizing, revamping, or transforming plays or older films.b",Romeo + Juliet

379,cctaylor-185-780844,Odd one out,1,9 December 2011,"I am convinced I'm one of the only people who hate this movie. People call it ""innovative"" and ""a work of art"", but i personally don't see how they can. This is a terribly overrated movie that certainly doesn't deserve the praise it's getting. The movie feels like a huge jumbled mess with horrible editing, and some pretty dreadful performances. It seemed more like a satire of Shakespeare then a modernization.First comes the performances. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is very bland at best. Even in the love scenes with Juliet, he had about as much personality as a piece of wood. Claire Danes was fine as Juliet. Nothing bad, but nothing memorable either. John Leguizamo was dreadful as Tybalt. He had a terrible case of overacting that made me cringe at his performance. Harold Perrineau's performance as Mercutio was (much like Leguizamo's) plagued with another case of overacting. The only actor who seemed to do very well in his role was Pete Postlethwaite as Friar Laurence. He had the calm, mellow attitude that was accurate for a modern version of the character. As for the supporting cast, none of them really stood out and even if they did it wasn't for anything good at all.As for the production elements, it was very lack luster. The editing closely resembled that of Luhrmann's future film, Moulin Rouge. This means the editing was sloppy and quick, not allowing us to see some of the visuals created for the film. Everything else about the movie was just so forgettable: the music, the costumes, EVERYTHING.So overall, this movie really didn't do it for me. I still can't believe so many people love it when i (as a Shakespeare fan) couldn't find anything to like about it. I can only imagine the poor Bard is rolling around in his grave at this very moment, knowing that his brilliant work has been adapted into this garbage.",Romeo + Juliet

If anyone has actually read the play or seen the original movie, it seems that the 1996 version is a mockery of the story. It's 1996 and they are using Elizabethan language at a beach? Really? Cause that makes a lot of sense. It's cheesy and pathetic to watch. Also, how can somebody be banished in 1996??? Last time I checked it's called ""arrested"". This was probably the dumbest movie I have ever had to watch in my entire life and I believe William Shakespeare would be embarrassed that this is what came out of his beautiful work. Nothing about this movie fit. I speak for my entire class when I say, I would like to hit Baz in the face and give him a reality check.",Romeo + Juliet

Get your settings straight! last i checked There was no cars or hotels or GUNS in romeo and Juliet! If you are even considering watching this movie. Don't waist your time. I don't even want to get into the ending of the movie. worst one ever! Baz Luhrmann should not make a movie ever again! I don't even know what he was thinking when he made this movie.

It also had a lot of dramatic irony, in which I really don't enjoy.However, i enjoyed the romance and action scenery which kept the movie interesting.

I did not like the movie because i did not really understand the language the characters spoke in. Ithat thought could've used more current language because they updated the weapons to the current time. I liked the scene when Romeo and Juliet first met when they were walking around the party together trying not to get caught by Juilets fiancé. I liked this scene because i thought it was cute while they were kissing. They had love at first sight. Then they got married with out their families consent. Juliet faked her death so that she could leave her family to be with Romeo but he did not know about the plan. Romeo decided he did not want to live with out his wife so he drunk poison. Juliet awaken and saw Romeo drinking the poison but it was to last. Then Juliet killed herself. Both families were punished by the lost of a loved one.,Romeo + Juliet

They fell in love at first sight and was troubled by there names. They went behind there families back and got married. They betrayed there families.

I think that the idea of modernizing every thing excecp for the launguage was the worst part of the movie for me. If you was going to modernize it so that todays age people could understand it, you would think that the lauguage would be the most important part of the whole movie. What i did like about the movie was the addition of different races and the actors and actresses they had to play the characters. I think they did a marvelous job and deserved all and more awards than they actually got. Also the setting was perfect and the way they designed the set and the places that they had the action and the ball really put into perspective how rich and well of the capulets and the montagues really were.",Romeo + Juliet
387,lopez-angelica97,Amazing Movie!,8,18 January 2012,"Watching this movie, was very entertaining. It was a bit different from the book in many parts but overall, the movie was very good. it seems as if the director and producer wanted to make the movie more modern, so they used guns, and everything was more like our day today. The language in Romeo and Juliet, is very unique, and even though we don't use that kind of English now, it seemed like everyone who spoke like that, sounded more professional and mature. for me, this movie was amazing (: for some people this movie might be boring, but that just because they aren't ""into"" the movie like they're supposed to be. the movie wasn't boring so i don't understand how you couldn't be ""into"" it. they picked the PREFECT man to play Romeo.

Like they, match each other.This movie does an excellent job of combining Shakespeare dialogue with modern imageryi.Don't really like the fact that The Capulets dress more like gangsters or thugs even though both sides could be viewed as thugs in some sort or another they made it seem like that was the bad side. There's other things you'll notice at the party also, like Tybalt wears devil horns like he's a villain or the bad guy. i didn't really like the fact that they gave freyer they bad part and hes ah preaist. i liked the part when romeo was happy when juliet said yes she will marry him.",Romeo + Juliet
389,gcarey-334-466776,Romeo Juliet the movie directed by Baz Luhrman,10,2 April 2012,"I had to come back to this movie and this director and give an airing to my opinion on this movie, somehow, from my recollection of it years ago and just seeing a snippet of it again on a TV rerun today.The fist time I saw it, I could not contain myself it was and is a work of genius. A transformation of archaic English phraseology into such a contemporary setting that manifest its power and grace of the human voice across the centuries. The potent content and import of every sentence and action portrayed and powerfully, passionately conveyed and clearly understood even to the uninitiated to Shakespearean voice. The modern settings and beyond clever, really inspired analogs to the Elizabethan moments and characters were absolutely brilliant. I could not believe when I heard it was initially reviewed with criticism at its original debuts. Then I thought so was Disney's Fantasia ... clearly the work was ahead of the critics in both cases.Let me just add a fact or two to buttress the credibility of my review here and my abilities to know a great talent when I see or hear it.Fact 1.) I was a teenager (~17-18) sitting in my family's living room and a movie came on that I started watching ... after a few moments time I was engrossed ... I was sure I was seeing something I had never seen before it was the most exciting, engaging show TV or otherwise I had ever seen ... I began trying to grab siblings passing by pleading with them you have to see this movie, I am telling you I have never seen anything like it before ... though it fell on deaf ears I nonetheless noted that movie and it wasn't till years later in a talk show interview that I found out who the director of that movie was. None other then Steven Spielberg and his master work that he says himself he goes back to review when he wants to remember how to make a movie, titled ""Deul"".Fact 2.) Years later a Texas Cowgirl band was playing at an IBM company outing that I was attending... they were I thought beyond good ... I had to have one of their CDs and went up to purchase one and with complete earnestness said, ""I really think you all will make it big."" The lead singer and bass fiddle player looked at me askance and sarcastically said, ""Oh you do, do ya!"". The other members graciously thanked me and signed the CD for me. They ended up being non-other than the Dixie Chicks ... and Oh by the way the lead singer was replaced before they went big time.Just two examples but I have had many similar occurrences over the years. And Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet is another one of them.Regards, GTC",Romeo + Juliet
390,ti-cat,This movie is a mutt,1,8 August 2004,"If you want to see Romeo and Juliet on film, watch the 1968 version. Olivia Hussey is gorgeous, John McEnery is a great Mercutio and the Nino Rota music is magnificent. You can even see young Michael York, who plays a brilliant Tybalt.This version had me alternating between boredom and anger. I found it pompous and cartoonish. The overall impression was of a sophomore's first attempt at film. Call me old fashioned, but if a director interprets one of the finest theatrical works in the English language, it seems to me that he needs to do a better job than this.Harold Perrineau did a decent job at Mercutio in the context of a film that just doesn't get it done. Too bad that some pretty good acting talent was wasted on this weak project. Rate this a 1.",Romeo + Juliet

392,jjporter-678-219374,A Fascinating Modernization of Romeo and Juliet,10,8 May 2013,"Romeo and Juliet is one of Shakespeare's most common plays. The story discusses themes like love, hatred, and society. In Baz Luhrmann's movie of Romeo + Juliet, he was able to completely capture Shakespeare's themes by expressing the story through preserving the play's original language but also adding modern aspects. Some people may believe that the 1968 Franco Zeffirelli 's Romeo and Juliet is a superior story to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, and that Luhrmann's story was just some cheap modern repeat of the same story. But this new take on Romeo and Juliet made was able to make the story more easily understandable by removing the seriousness from the play. It was also able to offer the younger generation an opportunity to comprehend the significance of this story. This movie is definitely recommendable to anyone who can appreciate Shakespeare's stories no matter what artistic form the story is produced in.",Romeo + Juliet
393,kiyombomununga,Did the movie fail to meet Shakespeare's intentions?,7,7 May 2013,Romeo and Juliet the modern version was quite interesting. Shakespeare wouldn't like Baz Luhrmann version because the setting doesn't fit with his Elizabethan style of writing. He would like it better if the dialogue was more modern to fit the setting. In Romeo and Juliet Shakespeare likes to use a more secretive way of showing love of passion instead of just being intimate unlike Luhrmann's version. In the being of the movie of Luhrmann's version I didn't like it because it was too odd for me and I wish that they would just use modern language to complement each other. Later on in the movie I sort of put that thought to the side because the actions Luhrmann was taking in the movie were very unusual and interesting. Some of the actions in the movie seemed to grab my attention more than the play would. I liked seeing the actors' emotions into each scene and it was very intriguing.,Romeo + Juliet
394,nncarmic,Shakespeare's Views,2,7 May 2013,"Many of you have probably read the original version of Romeo and Juliet, or maybe have even seen the play. How much different was this modern version from the original version? How would Shakespeare react after watching this movie? He wouldn't like it at all. The setting was completely different, and several important scenes from the play were missing. Some of the characters weren't even portrayed correctly. For example, Tybalt never beat up Romeo as it showed in the movie. Also, what is up with the policeman prince? He wasn't really a prince. The characters' overall personalities in this movie were just way too silly. This movie would not meet up to Shakespeare's expectation. He would be highly disappointed in how this movie was made. The fact that the setting was modern but the language was not, just made the movie more awkward. The language should have also been modern to match the overall theme. I do admit though that the romance was very interesting and kept my attention being a girl. Overall, I rate this movie a 2/10.",Romeo + Juliet
395,lemoncakess1209,Exceeding Expectations,10,7 May 2013,"Baz Luhrmann exceeded Shakespeare's expectations for Romeo and Juliet with this film. For example, the cast of actors chosen to portray the characters were perfect for the job. This is shown best in scenes where Romeo (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) is in deep bouts of rage. The emotions expressed by the actors add an extra layer of emotion and depth to the script.Additionally, the movie style in itself is a twist on the popular play. Although the setting is modern, Luhrmann used the exact linguistics from the original play. It is possible that he chose to do that so the true meaning of the script wouldn't be lost. The contrast of Shakespearean English to a modern setting allows for the audience to better understand the language using the interactions with the characters as a guide.Even the slight changes Luhrmann made to the original script of the play enhanced the movie. In Act 5 of the play, Juliet was supposed to wake up after Romeo drank the poison; however, in the film Juliet wakes up while Romeo is taking the poison. This action made the scene all the more poignant. Any modifications made for the sake of the film enhanced the emotions and interactions present in the tragedy.All in all, I give two thumbs up.",Romeo + Juliet
396,ravery-680-231690,Review of Romeo and Juliet,5,8 May 2013,"The 1997 version of Romeo and Juliet is a modern take on Shakespeare's original play. Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Romeo. The film did a good job of recreating the original play, but to a fault. The acting sometimes goes overboard and makes you laugh when the scene is supposed to be sad. In the original play, the focus is more towards Juliet, as she is the one who struggles with her family, Paris, and Romeo. But in the modern film, the focus is mostly centered around Romeo. This might because the director needed the star power of DiCarprio to carry the film. The film also copies the text word for word, which will often leave you wondering what the actors are saying. Overall the movie was OK. If you are shakepaere fan, then you will enjoy it. Overall, it gets a 5/10.",Romeo + Juliet

I don't understand why it only has a rating of 6.7! It was just so brilliantly made. I loved how they made it modern. It was really clever. And all the actors were really good and suited their parts so well. It is a really magical love story. If anyone hasn't seen it, I would completely recommend it, but be aware that it is very likely that you will cry! I just can't write how much I loved it.

400,nuskin,I think I'll throw up now!,1,14 April 2010,"No, they didn't do it right. I've got no problem transporting old stories into a modern setting...sometimes it really works well. Baz didn't make it here. Not once did I ever get the feeling that his cast even understood the old English much less hold a passion for the story or the characters. Even the more mature actors like Sorvino and Dennehy, both of whom I respect deeply, seemed a bit stilted in the delivery of most of their few lines. Anyone who truly knows the meaning of 'wherefore', will absolutely dislike most of the individual performances in this enactment. If you really want to enjoy this story, give up on DiCaprio and Danes and go with Whiting and Hussey in the 1968 Franco Zefferelli version. If you've already tried to give this one a fair shake, watch the other one and really feel the passion!I'd just like to add, Romeo and Juliet was brought into the 20th century in 1961. It didn't use ""olde englishe"" but it did use music. It was directed by Robert Wise (yes he has also directed Star Trek stuff) and Jerome Robbins. This version won 10 Oscars, including Best Picture. It was called, ""West Side Story"". The Wise/Robbins execution was excellent.",Romeo + Juliet
401,smartlittlegirl2000,"Romeo and Juliet, a classic in every form",9,8 May 2005,"I find it incredible how people today cannot appreciate the beauty of speech. In Luhrmann's version of Romeo and Juliet, using Spakespeare's original text help the EDUCATED viewer understand the deep sub-text. Perhaps a person who has not studied Shakespeare will not understand that using a modern day situation, with Shakespeare's text, teaches the audience on cruel fate and how it can affect anyone.Allowing stereotypes to fill the persona of Montague and Capulet helps conceive the viewing of one true love and destiny. Two groups, so different can still hold and give forth love for each other. Seeing this in a mainstream movie may be able to help this new generation that holds true to a split society.To people who have reviewer this movie with negative comments: When writing a piece that that public may view, be sure to use a polite and professional tone.Sincerely, Jade",Romeo + Juliet
402,m-elizabeth-c,Visually fantastic but confused version.,7,12 September 2006,"Baz Lurhman's Romeo + Juliet has both good and bad. the visuals and modernised Verona are spectacular and sumptuous, while DeCaprio and Danes leave some to be desired. The supporting cast is strong and holds together this crazy film though quality Shakespearean acting and a sense of fun that is severely lacking in most Shakespeare films. I personally have a problem with the main portrayals because neither is particularly adept at playing Shakespeare modernly and convincingly. the portrayals of Tybalt, Mercutio, Friar Lawrence and the Prince stand out and are excellent modern interpretations. the use of gun can seem forced at times but is understandable and fits with the visual style. The film is chaotic and is not for everyone ( several of my roommates absolutely despise it) but it can be a refreshing look at Shakespeare. Ultimately, individual taste plays heavily into opinion; while it is definitely worth seeing you may decide never to watch it again after.",Romeo + Juliet
403,milleniumlizy,i shouldn't have wasted my time...,1,30 May 2005,"This film was SUPPOSED to be a modern adaptation of the classic Shakespeare masterpiece, Romeo and Juliet. What I got instead was an utter and complete waste of my time. No, I am not some British Shakespeare fanatic who disregards any modern adaptation of this play as pure garbage-- I am an American teenager who was just hoping to see a good movie. First of all, the opening sonnet which so famously begins with ""Two households, both alike in dignity...etc."" is given to us by some nobody news anchor in a television. It isn't even said by the prince, who traditionally gives the speech. Anyone who says that the dialogue is the same as in the play is clearly mistaken. There are screwed up lines all over the place, different characters give different lines which result in major plot holes. The opening scene couldn't even be understood because of an absurd amount of gunshooting and screaming. I couldn't even understand what was going on, despite the fact that I had just gotten through re-reading that scene from the play. They cut huge amounts of the play out of the movie which were important to set up following scenes. The balcony scene SUCKED. It shouldn't even be called the balcony scene, you know why??? Miss Juliet was not on the balcony...at all! We are expected to believe that our little Romeo (poorly played by Leonardo Dicaprio) is standing five feet behind her and she doesn't notice him. It's complete absurdity that draws any seriousness out of the film. The whole suicide scene was also a bunch of rubbish. Before Romeo has even died, he sees that his love has awaken and he gets to give her his final goodbye and realize the mistake he made. For all of you history buffs out there--that is NOT supposed to happen. And then we find ourselves at the end, at the edge of our seats just DYING for it to be all over. During the last scene the Prince, (who is supposed to read the closing sonnet) screams at the top of his lungs, ""all shall be punished! all shall be punished!"" can you say plot hole? five minutes later in the closing sonnet (read by the annoying news anchor woman) we hear ""some will be pardoned, and others punished."" it basically says that some wont be royally screwed like some other characters. but that line totally contradicts what the prince had said five minutes before. especially considering he was supposed to be the one saying it! i guess what I'm saying is that this movie is TERRIBLE, even if it wasn't an adaptation, it was really just....stupid. and i pity anyone who has to bear watching the entire thing straight through.",Romeo + Juliet
404,ben-206-979423,Excellent,10,7 January 2015,"It's a bit late to be reviewing this movie, but I find it an exceptional reboot. Everything about it is on permanent overdrive, as exemplified by the oversaturated setting and terse cinematography. Some people have reviewed this and expressed distaste at Harold Perinneau's portrayal of Mercutio in favour of the 1968 John McEnery. While ""de gustibus non est disputandum"" certainly applies here, I think it's worth pointing out that McEnery's performance brought a certain boorishness and abrasion to the character that Perrineau did not. Romeo, played by DiCaprio, was excellently cast and acted, striking a healthy balance between stunningly handsome and endearingly clumsy and exuberant. And I don't care what all you phonies say, Claire Danes was gorgeous.Others have derided the film for certain choices made in the staging, combat, and/or nonverbal action, remarking ""Where did Shakespeare write that?"" Well. First, we are already working in a modern setting, so the assumption that historical accuracy in staging and direction should be followed to a T is frankly absurd. Second, the plays are public domain, which is a mixed blessing, as it brought us the 2013 R&J Sparknotes movie adaptation. But with that freedom comes a brilliant opportunity of artistic expression from the director, and each choice of omission or interaction in this production was apparently made with great care to maintain the integrity of the story being told.To touch on comparisons between the 68 and 96 movies: don't try to tell me Leonard Whiting acted like he had any idea what he was saying. Have you people seen the movie? This film is definitely worth your time. I find it to be a well-wrought revamping of one of my favourite plays from the Shakespeare Corpus.",Romeo + Juliet

This might change, as some people have said on the message boards, as I grow older, but that is not the case right now.I think that this presentation was very good. They adapted it well to a more modern setting. However, there were two major things that irked me.The fights, to me, were far too stylized. This kind of thing just annoys me. I felt it should have been more violent, less ... cartoonish.And the biggest thing that I have a problem with is Juliet's death. I love how the director has Romeo dying just as Juliet waking, I feel that was a good choice and a very dramatic one. However, there is significance in Juliet bringing a dagger to her heart. It is not the same when she blows her brains out. The story loses a lot with the way it is in this movie. This should have not been changed, it is far too big symbolically.I also want to mention the music. The music is excellent! It fits the scenes, and is a nice mix of popular music and classical style.

406,awellmon,This version of Romeo and Juliet can be interpreted in different ways.,7,22 March 2015,"I recently watched this version of William Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"". I did like it but there were parts that should have been done differently. I like the actors, I like how it is modernized and I like the original story of ""Romeo and Juliet"". I thought that in the beginning of the movie, there was a lot going on and that the movie would be hard to follow. After a little bit, I started to be able to understand what was going on and the movie got better. I also disliked how everything is modern except for how they are speaking. Some may find it funny but I don't. I would have preferred only certain parts to have the original writing. Although that is my opinion, I understand why it is written the way it is. If William Shakespeare wrote a book instead of a play, the movie would have modern day words, but it was written as a play, so it is spoken the way the play would have been. I would recommend you see this movie. I would also read the play and watch a different version of the movie. I feel like if you do that you get to see what you think things would look like, and what people interpreted everything to look like. I also feel that if you only read the play and watch one version you have nothing to compare to and some people may prefer another version over the other. I prefer the 1960's version of ""Romeo and Juliet"" mainly because that is sort of how I pictured the play to look like.

The classic tale of the two star-cross'd lovers is set in a present-day Verona, with the Montague/Capulet war spanning the entire city.

I have to say they are both good films in their own right, but this one really has brought Shakespeare into the 21st Centuary. I love the way the film is shot and the choice of actors is interesting. Leonardo DiCaprio is an amazing Romeo and Harold Perrineau is astonishing as Mercutio (the best character in the film).I have to say, if you see one version of Romeo and Juliet (bar theatre) you simply must see this, it has a few loop holes but is generally all round good with one or two excellent scenes.",Romeo + Juliet
412,Amusic20,"Definitely worth watching, but upsetting to Shakespearean lovers",9,24 October 2005,"I first fell in love with Shakespeare's story of the most well-known star-crossed lovers my freshman year in high school, whereupon I read the play and acted out the part of Juliet in my Global Cultural Studies class. (And ever since then, I have dreamed of playing Juliet). It's hard to describe why exactly I feel this way, though it's one of (if not, the) my favorites. I received this 1996 version with young DiCaprio and Danes as a present for my 15th birthday in May 2002. Since then, I have watched it several times, and once even in French. In my opinion, this is a wonderful life, and I was surprised by how accurately DiCaprio and Danes played the title roles. And, just as the producer had hoped (which he says on an interview on the DVD), having this play take place in modern times--in California--does help the viewers to understand Shakespeare's complex (yet beautiful) language, although now that I am in a Shakespeare class I would have understood it anyway. However, avid Shakespeareans may be upset with the ending of the play (this is the spoiler): instead of having Juliet wake up at least a couple minutes after Romeo has drunk the poisoned vial and died, Luhrmann decides to have Juliet and Romeo see each other right before his death--but unfortunately, they do not see each other in time to stop this horrible outcome. It has a quite a different effect, if you think about it!! Yet, one cannot help but just love the story nonetheless, and the fact that it's American and starring actors we know may make the film appear to us more.

I don t agree with the theory of staying as faithful to the original text as possible.I believe in completely putting your mark on your work, even if that means changing the entire meaning of the play/script.And amazingly,kitsch never looked so arty like in that film...I don t know what other people look in films,but I like to be taken aback. The same way with books-if I can predict what s going to happen it s not a good book.About this one,I obviously knew the ending but the manner in which the story was delivered-the crazy editing,the amazing image(thank God for a great director of photography!!!),the mind-blowing soundtrack...Even if it may seem a bit chaotic,the film is actually composed in a very organised and clean manner.The first rule of film composition is that everything has a meaning,otherwise it wouldn't be there.The best example is the image of the two buildings belonging to the rival families separated by a statue of Christ...This is a definite must see!",Romeo + Juliet

417,tamminenamanda,Tragic love story,9,26 April 2017,"Movie review: Romeo + JulietRomeo + Juliet is a romantic drama film from 1996. The movie is a modernization and adaption of William Shakespeare's famous play Romeo and Juliet. The movie retained the original dialogue from Shakespeare's play. The film is directed by Baz Luhrmann and stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes as Romeo and Juliet. The film can be best described as a tragic love story, the most famous one of all.The movie takes place in Verona Beach. Romeo and Juliet are entangled in a lifelong feud between their families, the Capulets and the Montagues. They instantly fall in love when Romeo crashes a party the Capulets are having. The pair is soon married in hopes the marriage will ease the tension between the archenemy families. Juliet's parents try to marry their daughter off to another man, but Juliet loves Romeo. Juliet plans to run away with him, but the plan goes horribly wrong.The story of these star crossed lovers is known to all. I think the movie did a good job at bringing it to the modern era. Some details have been changed from the original story to modernize it, like for example swords have been replaced with guns. I think the changes were a good decision. They make the story more believable and relatable for today's people.In my opinion the cast of Romeo + Juliet was well chosen and they did the world-famous characters justice. I also like the soundtrack of the movie because it's so dramatic yet modern in a way and thereby suits the movie and its storyline. It would be very bizarre if this particular movie's soundtrack were any less emotional and powerful. I think keeping the original dialogue worked well. What I don't like about the film is that it's sometimes a bit confusing and disorderly, and I'm also not particularly fond of the character of Juliet's mother. I didn't think she really fit into the film.All in all the movie is very good and I think it did Shakespeare's original play justice. I would recommend it to pretty much everyone. I give Romeo + Juliet 4 stars out of a possible 5.",Romeo + Juliet
418,hollielucas,good,10,20 May 2017,this film is very good I highly recommend this. so good actors and actress'.so good acting. very emotional. :):). I would watch this for the rest of my life. I can relate to Romeo and Juliet because there is a family (or two) that hate me and my family and me and my family hate them. I would recommend this to my friends and I get to watch this at school,Romeo + Juliet
419,greenbay938,Captures the true spirit of Shakespeare's play,9,31 October 2005,"Anyone who truly knows Shakespeare and his works knows that it's all in the tempo, and mood of the performance that makes it great. His plays were made to be fun and entertaining even if you couldn't understand any of the puns, twists or important plot points that Shakespeare is so clever in placing. Those things were in to please the upper-class and the ""critics"". But the Globe had a pit. Where the poor filed in for a good show. While Zeffirelli's version is how the events would have played out in real life, Luhrmann's adaptation is true to how the drama would have been played out on the stage. There's really nothing like hearing the meter of Shakespeare's writing come out in the fast paced dialogs that fills this film. The speech conveys such meaning and is beautifully strung as you would have read it in the original text.",Romeo + Juliet
420,pogomog,Excellent film.,10,4 November 2005,"I thought Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of Romeo was particularly outstanding. Along with the amazing performances by Claire Danes, and the awesome dude who played Mercutio.I was also very impressed that the Director stayed committed to the original language used by Shakespeare - I think if the language had been edited it would have lowered the standard of the film considerably.Along with works like 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' and 'The Basketball Diarys', I really have to give props to DiCaprio, and rate him as a truly excellent young actor. And if I was a chick, I'd totally hit that :PAlso brilliant was the sets, costumes, and pretty much everything! The last thing that made it awesome for me was the soundtrack. Anything with Radiohead is going to be good, but the other music was great to. 'Talkshow Host' by Radiohead takes the cake though! It fit in PERFECTLY with the feeling of this movie.I thought this was outstanding, and I definitely recommend it!",Romeo + Juliet
421,scullyuk-54662,Romeo + Juliet is a very awful and annoying movie that is a pain to sit through.,1,27 August 2017,"The main problems with this movie is the directors style, which is generally a cringe worthy mix of something you would expect to find on MTV combined with a YouTube video where the editor had just discovered all of the effects. Just in the beginning scene alone, there's a scary number of consistent annoying zooms into close ups and the scene consistently interchanging between normal and slow motion. Instead of helping to progress the story, as any good film should, it instead gets in the way of the story, feeling as if the director was more worried about showing of his previously mentioned style and trying to be noticed instead of creating a good film adaptation of Shakespeare's work.The film then plummets to an even more more intolerable level as it reaches its first talking scene. Not only does the pacing of the film majorly slow but you realise that all the dialogue is written in old English. This makes some of the performances seem very flat because it is as if the actors don't actually know what they are talking about. Overall, this film isn't worried about its story but instead, it is constantly distracting you from it with the director trying to say ""Look at me and my style"". This makes the film very hard to sit through due to its cringe worthy style, weak performances and uneven pacing.",Romeo + Juliet
422,twinkle1984,film review compared to Shakespeare's original intent of his play,8,22 November 2005,"In the play Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare, perversion of reason is one of the main motifs. During the Renaissance, reason was a moral concept that allied humans with God and distinguished them from the beasts. The concept implied having right love that is governed by reason and not lustful passions or the worshiping of idolatries. Shakespeare's intent of Romeo and Juliet is to show a right type of love through a love that is lustfully wrong. According to Elizabethan values, true love goes beyond surface appearances, guided by reason and clear-sightedness; more specifically, it accords with Divine law. Wrong love is excessive and idolatress, based solely on appearances. The relationship of Romeo and Juliet portrays wrong love to show that this type of love can only end in tragedy. Consequently, the film, William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet attempts to mimic Shakespeare's intent; however fails to achieve the overall meaning that is expressed in the original play. Baz Luhrmann, the director of the film keeps some element of Shakespeare's original intent in his film. The film appears to take place within three to seven days. Romeo and Juliet are both young, and the hastiness in the film parallels the hastiness in the play through Mercutio. However, these similar elements are not strong enough to argue that the film version of Romeo and Juliet is truly Shakespeare's intent. In reality the Baz Luhrmann film makes the ""lovers"" appear as if they represent right love. The music in the film is a key part of this aspect. Love songs such as # 1 crush, Angel, Kissing You, and You and Me song surround Romeo and Juliet whenever they are together. They are uplifting tunes that trick the viewer into seeing Romeo and Juliet as the epitome of right love. The film also has Romeo and Juliet surrounded in bright sunlight or luminous lit up rooms. Light images gives viewers the impression that Romeo and Juliet's ""love"" is godly, holy, and a right type of love. Clearly, this is not Shakespeare's intent. In his play, Shakespeare has Romeo and Juliet surrounded in dark imagery. The absence of light (Juliet is Romeo's light) symbolizes that their love is doomed.Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.It was the nightingale and not the lark,That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.Believe me, love, it was the nightingale. (Rom 3.5.1-5) Shakespeare uses the darkness imagery for a reasonto show that Romeo and Juliet's love is wrong. A specific difference that shows Shakespeare's intent was not portrayed throughout the film was the scene where Romeo and Juliet first meet. In the play, readers clearly know that Romeo is wearing a mask when he arrives at the Capulet's party. There is no evidence throughout the text that Romeo takes his mask off when he first meets Juliet. This scene is essential to the play and Shakespeare's intent because it symbolizes the blindness and false appearance in Romeo and Juliet's love. Nevertheless, in Luhrman's film, Romeo arrives at the Caplet's party wearing a mask, yet removes it before he met Juliet. Act Three of Romeo and Juliet is a crucial part in Shakespeare's play. The fighting scene between Mercutio, Romeo and Tybalt show the disorderly and uncontrollable passion that runs throughout Shakespeare's play. Bez Luhrman's film version of the scene captures Shakespeare's intended likeness of the play, perfectly. The film portrays the wild, runaway passions of the three extreme characters. Different than the play, a storm is beginning to form that prepares the reader for tragedy, specifically with the wind and thundering. Furthermore, since Shakespeare's work is a play, the actual description of the fight between Tybalt and Mercutio is not stated, the editor only puts in the stage direction: ""They Fight."" With Luhrman's film, viewers are able to see a violent fight taking place that results in Mercutio's inevitable wound.The setting of the film is in a modern society. Shorts and Hawaiian shirt replace Renaissance gowns and men wearing tightsha-ha. In stead of swards, guns are the weapons (yet, they are referred to as swards in the movie). The effect of these modern day attributes is what makes the film worth watching. Viewers of the film can relate and appreciate the film as Elizabethans could have related to the play when it had been performed in the Renaissance. Luhrmann's film adds up to a coherent whole by following through with the director's point of view of the lovers. He sees Romeo and Juliet as a story about the right type of love and is consistent throughout by surrounding the lovers in bright light and love songs. Therefore Baz Fuhrman's William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is a good film for only students of Shakespeare. Students of Shakespeare know the true intent of Romeo and Juliet and the values and concerns that had surrounded Elizabethans. Therefore, students can appreciate Luhrmann's interpretation of the film while also taking into consideration Shakespeare's interpretation of right love and reason. The general public, however, may not know Renaissance background and the concepts of reason, right vs. wrong love, and appearance vs. reality. Thus, the general public could misinterpret the film or not even understand it at all. Works CitedShakespeare, William. The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet. Ed. Sylvan Barnet.

424,marco-falcon,A great modernization,10,29 November 2005,"Romeo and Juliet was a great play written by William Shakespeare. Many of you could think that modernize a classic is that kind of thing which makes you say: ""oh, no!"". But this isn't the case. The tragedy is perfectly modernized, with a great street spirit which represents perfectly the duel spirit of Shakespeare's time: everyone has a gun, just like a sword in the ancient times; clothing is exaggerate, exactly like in Shakespeare time; and many other things. For the screenplay we can see great images like at the beginning, the duel between Montague and Capulet's men is thrilling also thanks to the screenplay; then we see Romeo in front of the sunset: a very beautiful effect. The soundtrack is full of big names like Cardigans, Radiohead: in particular I appreciated Radiohead's one, perfect for its usage. There are also more ""epic"" songs, in old style, used perfectly in their original form and also remixed to create more suspense. There is no doubt, Romeo+Juliet is an excellent movie, a great modernization, a masterpiece.",Romeo + Juliet
425,senakeskin,Splendid,9,29 April 2021,"Very underrated modernization of the classic Shakespeare play. This movie has been pretty heavily criticized for the directors outlandishness in cinematography, but he understands when to tone down the often frantic pace of the storytelling during the dramatic scenes, and in fact this relationship tends to amplify their potency. Beautifully choreographed and shot, wonderfully acted by both the supporting cast and the main 2 stars, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, and extremely sly modernization techniques to the dialogue. All the elizabethan dialogue remains intact, yet it all seems coherent in the modern atmosphere. Mostly due to good imagery and double meaning in the phrases (ex: their swords being a gun model, or the flash of money while quoting gold.). One of the best shakespeare adaptations in the multitude of which have entered the cinemas in the past few years.",Romeo + Juliet
426,colonelmonkey,Hated it,1,12 December 2005,"This movie was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I didn't like how it was only partially modernized, and the actors couldn't act for soup. Basically it reeked of stupidity.With Shakespeare, you either have to modernize the whole thing, or not modernize it at all. The combination of a modern setting and the original text didn't work. It was awkward and hard to follow.The actors didn't seem like the poetic sort. Half the time, Benvolio was shirtless and reciting poetry. None of them had any idea how to read Shakespeare. It was hard to appreciate the text when the actors were completely lacking in realistic feeling. I think that two directors made a bet to see who could make the worst movie with the most highly paid actors. Baz Luhrmann most definitely won.The whole thing reeked of stupidity, to the point where it wasn't funny anymore. I was extremely annoyed with the subtitles explaining who the people were, as if we didn't already know. The frequent freezes on the ""swords"" and ""daggers"" were totally pointless and wasted time.In conclusion, I think you would have been better off watching the Zefferelli version of Romeo and Juliet, which was classy and very accurate to the actual text. I would rather have my fingernails torn out with white hot nail clippers than be subjected again in my life to this horrible mess of badly modernized plot lines, butchered text, and shoddy actors. Out of 5 stars I give it a negative 7.What were they smoking?",Romeo + Juliet
427,cezal198,"I wouldn't say that it was the best representation of Shakespeare ever made, but at least it made 16th century English literature cool again.",6,12 May 2007,"The 1996 film, Romeo + Juliet was quite over the top in many cases. Jeff Millar of the Houston Chronicle puts it well when he says, ""its so overloud and overdirected, and overproduced and so energetic that finally, you can't do anything except smile at it."" The concept is simple, a modern day Romeo and Juliet located in Verona Beach (a fictional place very similar to Miami beach), situated between two warring mob families, but the catch is that every spoken word is directly quoted from Shakespeare. Apparently, the directorial decision on how to fulfill the task of verbatim delivery in a modern setting was to make the visuals, the acting, and tempo of the film extremely eccentric. There is no other way to describe it other than: bright colors, flashing attire, ""in your face"" production design, with overly exaggerated acting in a land, where guns are swords, families are gangs, and paraphrasing is not an option. In most cases in modern film, melodramatic acting is looked down upon, but when quoting Shakespeare, it becomes excusable. Though it seems out of place when a goon flashing a 9mm gun exchanges witty remarks with a cross dresser, it somehow fits into the style of this movie. That is why I think it was a good decision to make the film so over the top. The lines of Shakespeare coming out of anyone's mouth just adds to the overall pageantry of the film. The actor's delivery could have been better, but it is very difficult to act modern, hip, and cool, and at the same time deliver archaic lines of Shakespeare, especially when they are some of the most quoted and overused lines in history. One thing that I felt was very well done, which I think was intended, was making Shakespearian writing very understandable to their target audience whom I assume are not scholars of English literature. The visuals and the overemphatic acting are so self-proclamatory that you could probably watch the movie in a different language and still easily understand what was going on. Almost everything spoken is shown, and if its not then you just have to be smart enough to catch it.One thing about the film that is very hard not to notice is the use of religious icons and imagery littered throughout the film. When I say littered, I mean literally littered: postcards of Mary scattered along the streets and different forms of shrines of Mary and crosses exalted in every household and even police stations. There is such an excess of pious imagery in every situation that it's almost iconoclastic. Romeo and Juliet consecrate their marriage in front of a shrine of the Virgin. Neon blue lighted crosses line the pathway to Juliet's tomb. Statuettes of Mary are seen in the same shots as the cross-dressing Mercutio (did I mention he's a cross dresser in this movie?) parties at the Capulet house. It seems very odd and discomforting to visually mix sexuality and religious icons. I am not sure if the director was just doing this to be cool, or he was making some kind of statement dealing with religion and love. It seemed slightly emphasized when Juliet calls Romeo her God whom she worships. I wonder if the interpretation of Shakespeare was taken to an extreme regarding the love and passion of two human beings. Does it override religion in this film? In the play, Shakespeare obviously followed along with the standard of marriage before sex, and the film also respected that moral statute, but sex in front of the Virgin? What are they trying to say? One can only guess. Romeo + Juliet was a unique and enjoyable experience, and that is about it. I felt like the challenge of the film, being the use of literal Shakespeare, was so pronounced and sought after, that it didn't get much past that. It was an interesting experiment and a bold move from a filmmaker's standpoint. They accomplished what they wanted to achieve, and I applaud them for it. I wouldn't say that it was the best representation of Shakespeare ever made, but at least it made 16th century English literature cool again.",Romeo + Juliet
428,molly-angelica-1,Baz Luhrmann is a Genius,9,1 January 2006,"Baz Luhrmann's superb version of Romeo and Juliet met and surpassed my expectations. When I heard that it would have Leonardo DiCaprio in it I imagined he wouldn't make the cut but he seems surprisingly natural when showing Romeo's emotions in Shakespearian dialogue. The fact that they cast Harold Perrineau (Michael from LOST) as a cross-dressing Mercutio would seem ridiculous but it somehow works well. However, I do feel that Tybalt needed to show more of an understanding of his words and that Romeo's parents were under-used. The pure 90's songs took me back to when I was still in primary school and made me smile as ""You and Me Always"" comes on when Romeo is coming to arrange his marriage. The ending (which I must note changed slightly as Romeo normally dies a while before Juliet wakes up) still makes me cry and want Romeo to see Juliet stirring, and Juliet's sorrow as Romeo dies in her arms is beautifully played by Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio. The fact that they kept in the original text and thus changed the actual swords to gun makes of 'Sword' 'Dagger' and 'Blade' was an excellent transition from Shakespeare's times. The majority of the actors seem comfortable in speaking Elizabethan English and you get a feeling of a new kind of slang to be used by gangs in the lines. All in all, one of my ""top ten movies you must see before you die"".",Romeo + Juliet
429,toransu,Total Crap,1,22 September 2006,"I have many problems with this movie. One, the dialog. Even though it was supposed to make it unique, having Shakespearian dialog during the more serious scenes completely ruins the feel of it, as I was finding myself laughing when they were trying to be serious, but were failing miserably when you had these supposedly 'hip' people speaking as if they were from the 1500's. The producers should have modernized the dialog, and expanded on it, like in the video game industry, when translating from Japanese to English. Add pop culture references, and try to connect with the audiences, don't make what is one of the masterpieces of English literature turn into this pile of Garbage. Secondly, the cinematography was awful. Usually you can see the differences between movies made in the 1960's and 1990's, but when I saw the 60's version, it came out looking as if it was recently made, not made 40 years ago.",Romeo + Juliet
430,jadehottie,A few interesting bits,8,4 May 2006,"Though I did not get to see the ending, this reincarnation of Romeo & Juliet rings truer to the original than I thought it would. Several lines are ""copied and pasted"" to other parts of the film: in the beginning before the Capulet's party, for instance, Romeo takes a pill from Mercutio that resembles Ecstasy. The line, ""The drugs are quick,"" taken from Act 5, completes the image nicely along with hazy, quick-cut scenes from the party. The added clumsiness of Romeo was a sweet touch to the character that Leo D.Caprio conveyed rather well: the man cannot stop falling into the pool during the balcony scene. He also crashes into a candle stand in the church while he's begging Father Laurence to perform his and Juliet's marriage ceremony. Fell on his face... I laughed. Claire Danes was a bit much for me, I must admit... when she screams at Lord Capulet's character it hurt my ears. ""Proud can I never be of what I HATE,"" Ow.... ow... but overall it was a good film. You'd be surprised how sorry you get for Tybalt when J.L. plays him... eh. Peace Out.",Romeo + Juliet

One has to remember that in his day, Shakespearean theater was not ""high society"" entertainment, but was rather looked down upon as ""vulgar"" and as the popular entertainment of the day! Director Baz Luhrmann keeps the original text of Shakespeare intact, but updates the setting to modern-day.

The way this film was made showed a very interesting style that really caught my attention. Although Shakespeare's language is still used in this modernised play, the way the film is directed helps people understand it through the acting and not only the words from the script. Each and every character was a good choice especially John Leguizamo. John is so great at being evil in this movie as Tybalt. I love him!!

Honestly, what is the point of putting in original dialect? It completely clashes with the modern setting and dress. If my guess is correct, the modernization of the play was to appeal to those of a younger generation, yet, when coupled with the original Shakespearean dialect, the viewers have no way of understanding what the actors were saying. This is the entire reason schoolbook versions have definitions of each different phrase or word that might be misleading or confusing.

I'm dragged away from my crushes at school by my friends who always need me, so it's nice to see someone go through what I go through. Romeo likes his best friend, but he just needs to be by himself sometimes. I love all the religious symbols in the movie too. The Capulets like to where gang-like clothes and the Montagues more of a Hawaiin t-shirt collection. My favorite scene is the pool hall. It takes the written words from the book and puts them in a place where people can understand what Romeo is going through. I give the movie an 8 because I hate the ending.

I just watched in again today on HBO, a pleasant surprise to see it again. I can't get over how clever and brilliant this movie was done. Everything from the casting to the cinematography blows me away. John Liuguizama as Tybalt was just insane. He played the hell out of that role. No one could have done a better job than he. He prowled on the screen, like the Prince of Cats that he is and all eyes were on him.I also really dug the fact that both set of kinsmen were totally different from each other. The Capulets were dark haired, Spanish looking men-reminded me of gang members in east L.A. and the Montagues were fair-skinned and kinda punk rock looking. Stark contrasts to each other but equally as deadly with words and weapons.My biggest gripe has always been the casting of Claire Danes as Juliet. I always felt that Juliet should be physically stunning-my choice would have been Keira Knightly. But, she did balance both the innocence and impulsiveness of a lovesick teenager with the heartbreaking realism of true love and romance.So, I guess she was OK. DiCaprio really was the star of this movie. His intensity, passion and tenderness shone brightly from beginning to end. The last scenes in the church between Romeo and his wife at her""wake"" are the most beautiful, sweet, loving shots on film. Especially when he puts the ring back on her finger- so raw and pure. There are so many other things I could say about this movie-but it is kind of hard to put it all in words. I'll just keep those to myself. But I do thank all the people who made it possible for the rest of us to enjoy a truly lovely and heartbreaking movie.

439,alejandrocastrom,Great Modern Adaptation of a Great Script,8,20 November 2018,"Scene 5 of Act 1 is one of the highlights of Baz Luhrmann's film adaptation of William Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"". Not only is the story well portrayed, but it also has great actors such as the stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes to reenact the characters Romeo and Juliet respectively.I am a big fan of Shakespeare which is why I love it when films that are based on his scripts are able to fulfill his original purpose even if there are some differences compared the original version of the play. This was mostly the case for this scene of ""Romeo + Juliet"" since it followed the same story and language from the original script, however it differed in some key aspects. In general, the film kept some of the essential events from the script since all of the language used comes from the original script and the same events are kept. These were: Tybalt and Lord Capulet's argument and Romeo and Juliet meeting and having a ""love at first sight"" moment as well as finding out they are both from opposite rival families. In this film, all main purposes from Shakespeare's original script are kept even though they are sometimes portrayed a bit differently. For example, the film occurs in a modern context where we see people dressed up in costumes and there is alcohol, drugs, electricity, etc. This doesn't affect Shakespeare's purpose since the only thing that changes is how some of the characters act as well as the general look of the party which is changed mostly due to the context of the viewers such as myself since a halloween party might be more common and relatable for our time. The key aspect of the setting from Shakespeare's script is that it's a party made by the Capulet family which is something that is kept for this adaptation. Another part of the scene which I thought followed Shakespeare's original purpose very well was when Romeo and Juliet see each other for the first time and instantly fall in love. This part was quite different to the original script since they stare at each other for a few minutes and don't speak to each other until after Juliet dances with Paris. This change in the script actually enforces Shakespeare's purpose since it adds on to the obstacles that lie between Romeo and Juliet's relationship. The last part I want to mention from scene 5 is the argument between Tybalt and Capulet. In the original script, the scene begins with Tybalt and Capulet arguing over Romeo's presence at their family's party, with Tybalt finally losing the argument and foreshadowing that his anger towards Romeo is not over with the line ""I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall; Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall"". In the film, this argument occurs towards the middle of the scene rather than at the beginning when Tybalt approaches Lord Capulet who is most likely drunk or drugged given his gestures throughout the conversation. Despite the change of the order, this part of the scene does fulfill Shakespeare's purpose which is to increase the tension between these two rival families and show how this affects Romeo and Juliet's relationship.I definitely enjoyed watching this adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"" because despite being different in many key aspects, it still manages to keep the original purposes of Shakespeare and it works. Perhaps it is not the best movie from a filmmaker's perspective, but for anyone who enjoys the works of Shakespeare and this original play, you will not be disappointed by the adaptation.(599 words)",Romeo + Juliet
440,geni12591,This movie is really interesting,10,28 February 2006,"My English class was discussing this movie after having read the play. I love the movie because of the way Baz Lurhman uses modern imagery and contrasts it with the original lines of the play. Though he does use modern imagery like guns, if you look at the guns it says ""9 mm Sword..."" (Lurhman). I found that very ironic and humorous. There was one thing in the movie I didn't like and that was that Baz Lurhman made Mercutio Gay and totally threw off the actual basis of the play. Shakespeare makes it evident in the play that there is something ""more"" between Romeo and Mercutio but I think Lurhman emphasized it just a little to much. Another idea of the movie that I find intriguing about the movie is how at the beginning Lurhman switches the lines of the Capulets and the Montagues. This I believe that Lurhman was trying to manipulate the lines of Act1:Sc1 to direct the audiences into his interpretation of the families. As I said before the movie was awesome, To Lurhman "" try to do another of Shakespeare's play the way you did Romeo and Juliet I would go and see it."" If another one is made like this I go and see it (last few words directed towards Baz Lurhman).Geni12591",Romeo + Juliet
441,jamesolo0,An excellent take on William Shakespeare,9,28 January 2007,"Okay, I will ammit, the first time I saw this film I hated it, I thought it was the worst thing ever created.That\at was up until a few years ago, when in my English class, my teacher decided to show us this production of Shakespeare romeo and Juliet.The first few scence suck, but really getting into the party and getting to now the actors take on the characters, the film begins to make sense.Claire Daines performance in this film is amazing, you can actually feel the love and hatred she has fpr romeo, but it still it speaks to you a little more than the classic romeo and Juliet movie.Lenardo's take on Romeo's pretty solid to, he's an excellent actor and maybe thats why he's been nominated for so many Oscars. The film is fast past, and it hooks you in.If you are the type of person that doesn't get Shakespeare, this is the best film to began to understand it.I highly recommend this film.",Romeo + Juliet

443,momma_mia_fasho,Amazing Actors BUT..,1,19 March 2006,I've seen and done this play so many times and they ruined it for me. Their(Leo and Claire's) wording and pauses were all messed up. It sounded and looked as if they didn't even know what they were saying(most of the time). Very little times did it seem convincing. I think they are both amazing actors but this just wasn't their best.. BY FAR.. I think the supporting roles upstaged the two main actors.. Why out of the whole cast the 2 Main Characters seem the most out of place.. I am younger then most of you BUT I was mostly trained as a Shakespearian actor and my JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL version was much better. Unless it was a scene where they were mad and crying it wasn't very convincing..,Romeo + Juliet
