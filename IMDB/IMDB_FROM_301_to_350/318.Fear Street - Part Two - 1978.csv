0,SnoopyStyle,more camp,6,14 July 2021,"Deena and Josh arrive at C. Berman's house looking for her help with possessed Sam. Berman recounts the events of 1978 massacre at Camp Nightwing.This second installment is more camp. I mean camp as in more B-movie-like. The characters are broader. The Sunnyvale people are almost cartoons in their bullying of their poorer neighbors. This is closer to a cartoon compared to the first one. They do kill some younglings in this one. It's happy with its own splatter-rama. It threatens to spoof the genre. The sisters' sibling rivalry is a bit tiresome and simplistic. I can do without the outhouse. Thankfully, there is no smell-o-vision. This is fine camp but a different tone to the first movie.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
1,nogodnomasters,My sister is in the toilet.,7,22 October 2021,"Deena (Kiana Madeira) consults with another survivor who tells her story of the 1978 camp massacre. This supplies her with another piece of the puzzle in order to stop the unstoppable witch.I was amazed how 300 year old books exposed to the elements have not turned to dust. I think they should have done the killing spree to ""The Runaways"" instead of Kansas. Seriously? Kansas is a slasher song?Guide F-word. Sex. Brief nudity (Chiara Aurelia)",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
2,kosmasp,Camp Fear Lake,8,20 July 2021,"Ok so there is no lake, but how else would I draw the connection with something like Friday 13th? Fear the 13th? Well I guess that was also a possibility. But as you are probably already aware, this is not just an ordinary slasher movie. It has the blood and violence of one (and in this installment it does up the sexy time factor, though do not expect much in the nudity department again), but there are other ingredients in it.So while I reckon some may feel that it should just stick with one thing, I like the fact that this tries to find new ways to tell a slasher story and is adding something to the lore and to the genre, if you call it that. Really well made with an entirely new group of characters ... which is necessary considering what the overall arc is. Now of course that also means suspension of disbelief. You cannot overthink certain things ... like why we see a whole movie and how the one person who supposedly tells it, knows so much ... even the things she was not there for ... again free your mind of that.So sit back and enjoy this second part of Fear Street ... which goes even further back in time than the first one was set into - from the 2021 standpoint. I reckon the movies work as standalone pieces - but are better when you see them as a whole.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
3,Sleepin_Dragon,A worthy follow up.,7,18 July 2021,"I've come to this directly after watching the first, I liked the first, I thought this was the better film.Being a prequel and a continuation, we are able put the pieces together, and there's is a lot of content to digest, plus a few surprises in store.It perhaps lacks some of the scares and thrills of the first film, this has a less obvious horror, the scares here are somehow more subtle. I thought the set of monsters/killers looked great here.Terrific music again, the costumes and sets look terrific, I preferred the 1970's setting, and I think they really did capture the time.A more accomplished film, 7/10.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
4,lee_eisenberg,no era protects you,9,16 July 2021,"Having seen the first segment - portraying a series of murders in 1994 - we now go backwards in time, to a series of similarly grisly events at a summer camp in 1978. As with the first segment, we see the gap between the children from affluent and working-class towns, but neither group is safe from the horror pervading the camp. Sure enough, a lot of stuff gets revealed.Certainly some creepy stuff. I'm pumped to see the third segment.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
5,Tweekums,Part two improves on part one,8,13 July 2021,"These comments are based on the assumption that people have seen the first instalment so don't need too much explanation of what was learnt in that film.This, the second instalment in the 'Fear Street' trilogy opens in 1994 just after the events of the first movie. Deena and her brother, along with the now possessed Samantha, head to C. Berman's house; they want to know how she survived the massacre at Camp Nightwing in 1978. As she starts to tell them what happened the action moves back to 1978.Here we see the summer camp, attended by children from both Shadyside and Sunnyvale and supervised by slightly older teens from the two communities. Among them are the Berman sisters; Ziggy and Cindy; a camper and councillor respectively; also there is Nick Goode; the Sherriff in 1997. There is plenty of conflict between the two towns with Shadysiders, in particular Ziggy, getting blamed when things go wrong. Early on the camp nurse attacks Cindy's boyfriend, Tommy, saying he will die that night. Trying to find out why she did this Cindy and Tommy search her office and find a book containing a map which leads to witch Sarah Fier's house. They head there with two others and suddenly Tommy starts acting violently... he has become possessed by Fier and the massacre described in part one starts to play out.I quite enjoyed the first film but found this to be superior. The setting captures the feel of classic '70s/'80s slasher films; most obviously 'Friday the 13th' with is summer camp and teens in tight shirts and short shorts. If it weren't for the 1997 prologue and epilogue it would work as a self-contained movie. Instead of going for new and imaginative methods of killing people it sticks with the classics... an axe and some knives. Once Tommy becomes possessed he is a suitably frightening villain. I found the main characters to be more likable in this film; one wanted them to survive even though we knew from the start that not all of them would. Others are made deliberately unsympathetic so we are less concerned when they meet their end. The film does use some '70s music but this time it doesn't feel over used. There might not be too many surprises but a couple we do get are really impressive; I won't even hint at them here. The cast does a fine job; I particularly liked Emily Rudd and Sadie Sink as Cindy and Ziggy. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of the genre, I'd also say if you didn't like the first instalment still give this one a go. Now I'm looking forward to 1666.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
6,BA_Harrison,No significant improvement over part one.,4,11 July 2021,"The second part of Netflix's horror trilogy jumps from the '90s to the '70s, skipping past the '80s, most likely to try and avoid too many comparisons with Stranger Things: they needn't have bothered - the similarities are everywhere (the casting of ST star Sadie Sink was NOT a good idea). With its retro approach, the movie is a blatant attempt at mimicking that series' success, but it doesn't work, failing for the very same reasons as the disappointing Fear Street Part One - 1994: the characters aren't convincing, acting more like whiny Gen Z teens than carefree '70s campers, their emotional issues (sibling rivalry and self-harming) taking up more screen time than the killings; moreover, director Leigh Janiak totally fails to capture the '70s slasher vibe - simply loading the soundtrack with classic rock tracks isn't enough (if I ever hear Cherry Bomb on another movie soundtrack, I'll be tempted to go crazy with an axe myself!).Part two sees C. Berman (Gillian Jacobs) recounting her personal tale of horror to the '90s kids of part one. As a teen at Camp Nightwing in the summer of '78, she witnessed counsellor Tommy (McCabe Slye) becoming possessed by witch Sarah Fier and going on a bloody rampage. Following clues in a book that belonged to the mother of a previous possessed teenager, she and a group of friends try to reunite the witch's severed hand with the rest of her body and thus end her centuries old curse.As with part one, the film is at its best when delivering the gore, but there simply aren't enough creative kills to make it a satisfactory homage to classic summer camp slashers. It would be great if they amp up the splatter for the final part, but judging from the The VVitch style preview at the end of this middle chapter, I'm not filled with hope.4/10, although I almost deducted a point for the really dumb moment when a character discovers a giant pulsating heart crawling with flies in the witch's cavern and places her hand on it. Seriously... why?",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
7,paul_haakonsen,More brutal and visceral than the predecessor...,6,11 August 2021,"Well ""Fear Street: 1978"" was definitely a step up from the ""Fear Street: 1994"" movie in terms of visual violence and mayhem, although they both provided about the same level of entertainment, just in different manners.The storyline in ""Fear Street: 1978"" definitely had a lot of similarities to it akin to the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise. Perhaps an homage to those movies? I mean, you have the whole summer camp thing going on with promiscuous teen councilors, and a deranged and unstoppable serial axe-wielding murderer prowling the camp grounds.I will say that the storyline told in ""Fear Street: 1978"" proved to be every bit as entertaining as the storyline in the ""Fear Street: 1994"" movie, despite it being quite different actually.And as I mentioned at the beginning, then ""Fear Street: 1978"" is a visceral and gory movie. And that was something that really appealed to me. The sheer brutality of the murders in this movie totally put the murders in the previous movie to shame. This movie was hard-hitting and brutal, I kid you not.The cast ensemble that they put together for ""Fear Street: 1978"" was good and all actors and actresses in the movie actually put on rather good and convincing performances. So that really added a good layer to the movie.So yeah, ""Fear Street: 1978"" does have that glorious serial killer vibe to it that I grew up with in the movies I watched over and over in the 1980s. You know, the slasher flicks of the golden age.If you enjoyed ""Fear Street: 1994"" then you most certainly have to carry on and watch the sequel titled ""Fear Street: 1978"".I am rating director Leigh Janiak's ""Fear Street: 1978"" a well-deserved six out of ten stars. This movie is quite worth taking the time to sit down and watch.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
8,BandSAboutMovies,Diminishing returns but not bad,6,24 July 2021,"The movie stars where the last one ended - with Deena and Josh Johnson restraining Deena's possessed girlfriend Sam and traveling to meet C. Berman (Gillian Jacobs), the lone survivor of the Camp Nightwing massacre. Her entire house is surrounded by clocks to keep her on schedule and potentially from going mental. She wants our heroes to leave until they convince her to tell the tale of what happened in 1978.The camp was divided between the Shadyside and Sunnyvale kids, even then. Ziggy Berman of Shadyside (Sadie Sink, Stranger Things) has been accused of stealing by several of the Sunnyvale campers who tie her to a tree and nearly burn her. She's saved by several camp counselors just as her sister Cindy (Emily Rudd) and her boyfriend Tommy Slater (McCabe Slye) are attacked by the camp's nurse, who is the mother of Shadyside killer Ruby Lane. She claims that Tommy will die before the end of the night.It's at this point that everyone should just figure out a way to go home. Nothing hammers that home more than when they explore the nurse's house and find a diary which explains how Sarah Fier made a deal with the devil by cutting her hand on Satan's stone, as well as a series of empty graves and a wall that lists who will die that night.Of course, all hell breaks loose, with Tommy becoming possessed and the girls, joined by their friend Alice (Ryan Simpkins), struggling to find a way to return Sarah's hand to her grave before the curse claims them all. That's the same worry that our heroes in the last film faced and things work out just about as well before back in the original timeline, the hand being placed in the grave triggers a flashback that sends Denna back to 1666 and into the body of Sarah Fier.I remain impressed by the script by Zak Olkewicz and Leigh Janiak as well as Janiak's direction. This one may not have moved me as much as the first installment, but it's nice to have a slasher getting seen by a big audience. The final scene between the two sister did impact me more than nearly any ending I've seen in some time, so there's some major emotional heft to this story.This was filmed at both Camp Rutledge - the location for Little Darlings - and Camp Daniel Morgan - where Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives was made.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
9,Calicodreamin,"Decent acting, lacked slasher action",5,10 July 2021,"The best part of this movie was the acting, a far better cast than the first part and more chemistry between the leads. The problem was the lack of slasher action, both in volume and diversity. It takes 40 minutes for the plot to get going and then it's one note til the end.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
10,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Worthy and fun follow-up effort,9,25 July 2021,"Thinking back to her time at camp, a young woman tells other survivors of a brutal massacre about arriving at a summer camp with her sister and other friends years earlier and came into contact with a curse that turned one of the other counselors into a vicious killer and how they stopped his rampage.Overall, there was quite a lot to like with this one. One of the better features to be had here is the way this one leads into the events at the camp involving the treatment they receive there. Seeing how different the two girls are where the differences between the more carefree and adventurous one against the stuck-up and rigid friend cause a wide gap that affects their time at the camp already with how the other kids continually and mercilessly bully her about her being a witch. The incredulity about how they can possibly be that cruel in this type of world amidst the rest of the treatment they dole out to her friend is a rather fun instigation to everything. Once the film moves into the arrival of the witch's curse over the camp and the start of the slayings, there's a lot to like here. The discovery of the shack and noting how the possessed gets infected is quite fun, moving through the chilling scenes out in the woods looking for the hiding spot which leads into the dark confrontation in the ruins of the house where all the supernatural influences acting on them as well as the final revelation that shows the possession will happen starts this one off quite well. When the snap eventually occurs and the initial strike occurs forcing them to escape, the film generates a lot to like with the suddenness of the action and the darkness of the location coming into play rather nicely. The second half here, which is carried out as a fantastic series of slasher scenes that alternate quite effectively between brutal ambushes and chilling stalking. The idea of appearing at various rooms and cabins around the camp laying waste to everyone they come across with the bloodsoaked ax, this comes off incredibly well with the chilling sequences and unaware rampage going on at the same time that keeps this moving along being full of slick, high-energy sequences. Tying it all together with the supernatural aspects of the witch's curse driving the possessed into killing and going through the rampage in the first place, there's so much to like here that it manages to keep the film up quite heavily. There are some small factors holding this one back. The main one that drags this down is the somewhat uneven pacing in the final half that contains way too much going on that it becomes far too dragged out for its own good. The fact that there are several conversations about the status of their lives under the curse is way too late into the film to matter when it's already been established that people have been affected by the curse. As well, the whole finale itself goes on too long with the search for the witch's body and then cutting back to the real-world search that all comes into play with the cross-cutting that's not always handled right as it lets the film go on much longer than it should. Otherwise, though, there's not a whole lot really wrong here.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, and sexual scenes.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
11,trashgang,pure ode to eighties slashers,8,19 August 2021,"The horror franchise of the summer they said, as much as I liked part one I never thought they could do better and they did.Yes, it's all based on some slasher classics. On camp so friday the 13th is never far away. It takes a while before it all goes wrong but when it does it's gore galore again. Completely my cup of tea.Gore 2/5

12,Cineanalyst,Horrors-within-Horrors,4,9 July 2021,"Better than the first ""Fear Street,"" ""1994"" (2021, released on Netflix the week prior), I'll give ""Part Two: 1978"" that. The characters remain terribly written. Although we're nominally dealing with a new cast of teenagers for the most part this round (and why there continue to be so few adults around, I do not know), they're still the same tropes that end up yelling at each other and making cloying confessions while on the run from an axe murderer. I swear if I were ever in such a life-or-death situation and someone tried to talk to me about their feelings other than as concerned being on the run from an axe murderer, I'd slap them because they're obviously being hysterical--and, yes, I realize that's also a movie cliché. My point is, there's a time and a place and pretty much any other time and place would be more appropriate. But, again, yes, I know, poorly written teens in a slasher flick that's also rooted in young adult fiction--so doubly so--shocking, right? So, let's get to the blood and guts of the matter.Well, as with the first one, it's fairly bloody and a bit titillating (including a couple naked male bottoms this time) for a horror movie aimed at a younger audience, but I'm talking about the mechanics of the thing. The first movie did a lot of the boring, heavy lifting as far as plodding exposition. The animosity between the cursed residents of Shadyville and their haughty neighbors in Sunnyvale, which matters a bit more at this camp than it did in the first movie's apparent ghost town. Also, this sequel is afforded the luxury of breezing past establishing the witch stuff and past serial killers, because it was all already established on the first movie's clunky crazy board.What we have here, then, is a story-within-a-story as told by a storyteller character and further nested narratives within those: the nurse and her late daughter, as well as the visions from touching (un)dead stuff. Two timelines and two sisters for a second movie. Plus, the book within what is a movie based on a book series matters this time--a map for an underground maze that reflects the outer narrative--and not just because it goes underneath latrines. It's simply better, more eloquent plotting than ""1994."" Nothing we haven't seen before, of course, as this entire franchise seems to be highly hackneyed--largely rehashing ""Scream"" (1996) last time, ""Friday the 13th"" (1980) here, and whichever witch flick next, but there's a basic competence here. Tune in next week for the conclusion to the trilogy, I guess.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
13,UniqueParticle,Better than part one,9,6 October 2021,I was surprised to hear Brother Love's Travelling Salvation Show by Neil Diamond I know that best from Once upon a time in Hollywood which is glorious! All the stuff with Sadie Sink is is great and the soundtrack is masterful! It's awesome how this one is all about a camp. This makes me glad I'm using Netflix more lately I've missed out a lot although I love Amazon and HBO too. Ryan Simpkins (Alice) is amazing throughout too.,Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
14,Thanos_Alfie,As good as the first...,6,6 October 2021,"""Fear Street: 1978"" is a Mystery - Horror movie and the sequel of ""Fear Street: 1994"", in which the story continues from where the first movie finished but now we are in Shadyside of 1978. A summer full of activities is about to begin but for one more time a Shadysider starts a killing spree.Since I had already watched and enjoyed the first movie I had high expectations from the sequel and I was not disappointed at all. The plot continues to be very interesting and the interpretations of the cast is equally good with those in the first movie. There is plenty of actions, only a few jump-scares and a mystery that needs to be solved for the sake of everyone. For one more time the interpretations of Kiana Madeira who played as Deena, Benjamin Flores Jr. Who played as Josh and Olivia Scott Welch who played as Sam Fraser were very good. Some other very good interpretations that need to be mentioned were Sadie Sink's who played as Ziggy Berman, Emily Rudd's who played as Cindy Berman and Brandon Spink's who played as Young Will Goode. Finally, I have to say that ""Fear Street: 1978"" is a nice movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it especially if you have already watched the first movie.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
15,cruise01,Bloody fun slasher thriller taking on 70s camp.,7,18 September 2021,"3.5 out of 5 stars.Fear Street 2 is a fun teen slasher film which offers bloody kills, sisterhood story, and 70s fun direction. It may not be better than the first film which offered more kills and thrills. The sequel does take a step back down on kills. But it is still entertaining.The plot continues with Ziggy (Sadie Sink) focusing on her story at the camp in 1978. Where someone gets possessed by the witch and goes on a killing spree. While Ziggy and her sister Cindy (Emily Rudd) try to save the rest of the camp and put the witch to rest.The direction tries to have fun with the 70s camp atmosphere. Awesome soundtrack. Tone. Costume design and plays around with the 70s slasher flicks like Friday the 13th. Teens playing pranks. Having sex and making stupid choices. And a killer on the loose causing a bloody body count. Yes it is all there in this film. Ziggy and Cindy are struggling as sisters which they have become distant. Cindy being responsible and a goody good. Ziggy feeling like an outsider and being bullied with everyone calling her a witch.There are some bloody slasher kills. And thrills. The film does suffer with unnecessary dialogue during bad timing in the movie. Characters can be chased and find a hiding spot and decide to have a personal conversations about there family or friendship past. Or having a deep conversation next to the killers deceased body which may get up at any given moment. The film does suffer a lot of those little flaws in this sequel.Saddie Sink did a great job along with the rest of the cast ensemble. The film does another cliffhanger ending for a third movie which would be fun to see.Overall, weaker than the first movie but still a lot of fun with its soundtrack. Slasher thrills. And a middle chapter story.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
16,eddie_baggins,Another fun entry into the Fear Street trilogy,6,18 July 2021,"After a solid Scream inspired first outing in the cursed township of Shadyside during the 1994 calendar year, the second installment of Netflix's Fear Street trilogy takes us all the way back to 1978 at Camp Nightwing, where a bunch of Shadyside teenagers are hunted down by a possessed supervisor hellbent on bloodshed.If the first film in Leigh Janiak's series was a throwback to Scream and those type of less scary more self-referential slashers, 1978 is a Friday the 13th/Sleepaway Camp infused outing that sees Janiak keep the first films bloodlust going with a visceral and carnage laden outing that is more slowly paced and less energized than the 1994 trip.With the stars of the first film here relegated too mere minutes of screen time as they try and uncover the mystery of the Shadyside witch and how they may finally put a stop the curse on their town, 1978 introduces us to Sadie Sink's bullied Ziggy Berman and her older sister Cindy (played by Emily Rudd) as the two struggling teens have to work together if they are to stop an axe wielding maniac from murdering the entire Nightwing contingent.Much like 1994, this second outing is mostly devoid of scares and any horror hound heading into this next installment expecting an uptake in frights and tension will be left disappointed as Janiak is more at home bringing the wince inducing violence that littered her first film with a large collection of scenes that are often shocking and at times totally unexpected in their brutality and no holds barred approach.It does feel like a missed opportunity for the series too still not provide much in the way of genuine chills and while the last film set in 1666 looks set to be a more The Witch inspired affair, both 1994 and 1978 feel as though they would've benefited from some more effort when it comes to keeping their audience on guard rather than just shock them with intense and gruesome violence.Around all this violence this time around though we get more refined character work thanks to Ziggy and Cindy and by allowing a few central characters more room for growth and time in the spotlight, 1978 gets us more invested in the plight of the Berman sisters as they try and fight for their lives on this fateful night and thanks to the solid performances of Sink and Rudd, audiences will be rooting for the duo to make it out alive to fight another day.Final Say -A different setting and tone makes 1978 feel different to its predecessor but really its providing us with more of the same as we now await to be unnerved by the last addition to a series that has shown Netflix a new way to deliver genre content to subscribers.3 severed hands out of 5.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

Below average teenie-horror - don't get fooled by all those fake reviews and rates of 10s and 9s. But maybe, maybe if you are still in your teens and you are still rather new to the art of horror you will appreciate Fear Street: 1978 more than I did.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
19,Fella_shibby,Much better than its predecessor.,7,10 July 2021,This one has a good setting which kinda transports us viewers to the late 70s n early 80s slashers a la the camp ones.This time they showed some brutal slashing via an axe but i am happy that at the same time they restrained the violence towards kids.The only crib is that there is no nudity n the makers tried their level best to hide nudity which kinda looked too forceful.Can someone tell me why there wasnt lottuva poop inside the tunnel underneath the outhouse.Hope they show some good atmosphere n terror in the final chapter.,Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
20,southdavid,Summer Camp Nightmare,6,13 July 2021,"I really enjoyed Part one of this series. I liked how the film captured both the spirit of 90's slashers, as well as the time period itself. I was slightly less enamoured with part two. Though I don't think it was bad, the music wasn't as ""deep cuts"" as the first part and I wanted the film to go further with emulating the 70's Summer Camp classics.Deena (Kiana Maderia) and Josh (Benjamin Flores Jr) arrive at the house of Mrs. Berman (Gillian Jacobs) who was the sole survivor of the 1978 Camp Nightwing slaughter. Desperate to find a way to rescue Sam (Olivia Scott Welch) the pair convince Berman to recount her story for clues about how and why she survived. We flashback to 1978 and see a night that has left her permanently psychologically damaged, the night she lost her sister to an axe wielding maniac and the witch's hold on the town.It's not that I disliked this one. It's a reasonable slasher movie with some gloriously gory moments. Sadie Sink is likeable and an engaging lead and her relationship with her sister played by Emily Rudd and budding romance with Nick (Ted Sutherland) is nicely played. There's no mystery element to it, it's an origin story for Tommy Slater, the axe murderer who appeared in the first film and we see his possession take hold and his spree start. If anything, that leads to the first problem, in that there aren't any real surprises to the film. That might work in a genuine teen/tween horror outing, but in terms of gore and sex it's a bit too explicit for them, but for an adult audience, plot wise it's a touch too basic.I don't think the film did as good as job of feeling like an actual 70's film, as Part One did about feeling like a 90's one. The setting gets it, Camp Nightwing is Crystal Lake in all but name and the various outbuildings, dorm rooms and mess halls make sense. (The science/zoological room perhaps is a bit less justifiable but works into the plot quite a lot.) I just wanted the film to feel more... exploitative maybe, dirtier, less professional though I'm not sure exactly how I wanted that represented, shot on film maybe? Something more akin to a grindhouse style?I don't think it was terrible, and I enjoy how the universe is starting to tessellate, but I was less impressed with this, than I was with the first one.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
21,subxerogravity,"Great follow up, perfectly planned Sequel.",7,10 July 2021,"So far so good with these Fear Street movies. 1978 was pretty good. I think 1994 was better. Despite its overblown use of the 90s music to set it in the place of 1994, despite the fact that a few of the songs came out after 1994. The first Fear Street had characters I started to care about... before they died.1978 is more of a straight up slasher movie. There is no uniqueness to it like 1994. All the characters feel Archetypical. Because they did not have to explain the slasher's motives the slasher just got to do his thing. Plus I'm not old enough to know or care if the music is out of whack (Although its got to be easier tossing in any 70s song when the 70s are almost over).However, all this makes it the best sequel ever. It falls into all the sequel pitfalls with more action and darker deaths and it flourishes on this cause it makes it a far better slasher picture.So far this Fear Street Trilogy is worth the time. Can't wait to see 1666.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
22,Stevieboy666,'78 is better than '94,7,2 August 2021,"Part two of the Netflix Fear Street series goes back to summer camp in 1978. Movies such as Friday the 13th and The Burning spring to mind here, though they were vastly superior. Impossible to capture the feel of a Golden Age Slasher movie (late '70s to mid '80s) but a good effort by the makers. Perhaps a bit too long but there is some good gore, including a very graphic axe in a head, and Sadie Sink is excellent as heroine Ziggy Berman. Also good to see some back story for cop Nick Goode.

The storyline takes place at Camp Nightwing where the school counselors are setting up the camp in preparation for the children to arrive. As they prepare in only ways teenagers can (sex, alcohol, drugs and more sex) a killer emerges threatening to ruin their festivities. This movie is directed by Leigh Janiak (Fear Street Part One & Three) and stars Sadie Sink (Stranger Things), Emily Rudd (House Mother), Ryan Simpkins (A Single Man), McCabe Slye (Destroyer) and Gillian Jacobs (The Box). The storyline for this picture is set in a far superior setting for this storyline than the first film. The kill scenes in both movies are fantastic with great gore. I loved the soundtrack in this and also felt the backstories for the local towns characters were delivered very well. The cast and performances were solid and fit the storyline appropriately. Overall this had a ""Friday the 13th"" feel to it that made it far superior to the first film and I'd actually recommend seeing this (maybe skip the first one ).

It is all backed up by mandatory good blood thirsty effects and scares and a well managed / edited mystery featuring many new faces which under less skilled direction would have been a total mess.

They visit the lone survivor of the 1978 massacre who relates her tale. A story about bullying kids at a Summer Camp who accuse one teen of being a witch; camp counselors of varying commitment (some just want drugs & sex) and the camp nurse is the mother of a child who carried out the previous massacre (in a chain of such killings going back to 1666). The nurse goes crazy and attacks one of the counselors. The fun begins - once again a teen is possessed and runs amok with a hatchet, cleaving heads, decapitating other teens, chopping people to pieces. This is rather dark as many of the characters are in their early to mid teens but the blood runs freely. More of the secrets behind the curse are unveiled in an underground chamber and there are some good subterranean shots of ax attacks and teens lost in the gloom. Once again the rivalry between Shadyside and Sunnyvale is central to the narrative but possessed slashers aren't picky on who they slay.

We flashback to Jacobs' time at summer camp, played by Ryan Simpkins w/her younger sister, played by Stranger Things' Sadie Sink who find themselves in the midst of the battle of colors (an annual tradition demarcated by the obvious frictions between the Sunnyvale & Shadyside kids) w/Sink nearly hanged for a theft she didn't commit (a bit much, huh?) but the meat of the tension between the sisters comes to the fore when we find out Simpkins, a counselor, has started dating outside of her caste, trying to emulate the more upwardly mobile Sunnyvalers when Sink feels she's sold out (an opinion shared by Simpkins' fellow druggie counselors who have a history w/her when she delved in the dark side) but when Simpkins' boyfriend, played by McCabe Slye, becomes the next victim of possession by the vengeful Fier witch, camp kids start to drop off like sleepy kittens. Simpkins & Sink know the jig is up as they try to thwart the carnage (enlisting future Sheriff Goode, played here by Ted Sutherland) but as the bloodbath comes to a close & both sisters come to no good, we see the footprints which will lead to the thrilling finale. Entering into the subgenre of slasher camp w/brio & joy, the blood spurts & spews as much as the barbed profanity being hurled between the conflicted campers w/no one safe as the killer's axe swings through the air like an excited on deck batter. Never overplaying its cards, this series knows what its audiences wants & delivers its goods w/winning performances across the board (especially from newbies as per my eyes).",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
32,aidanratesmovies,Sadie Sink shines,7,9 July 2021,"Improving slightly upon its predecessor- and proving to be even more entertaining- Fear Street Part Two is still a bit uneven, but the sum of its parts manages to bring along a familiar but engaging ride. I was much more impressed with the acting in this one than in the last one. It's nothing incredibly profound, but Sadie Sink is just perfectly cast in the lead role of Ziggy- and the other supporting actors never feel like they are forcing their performances despite their thinner characters. The film is incredibly entertaining and does add a bit more to the potential and worldbuilding that the first one set up, which I think they did a good job on. The issue lies more in the story of this film itself, as it takes the steps it needs to forming its story, without providing anything truly original or memorable. It's beginning, although partially necessary, feels like it's used as nothing but to kill time- and the majority of the film feels rather pointless in the trilogy's plan- as we don't get to anything truly important until the end. Also, just a small thing, we didn't need to hear Cherry Bomb three whole times throughout the course of the film- it's a good song and all- but seriously it just feels forced. Despite all that though, the film is moving with its relationships at hand, and truly allows you to care about the characters on screen even despite their flaws- a great improvement from the melodramatic writing of the characters in the first film. In the end, Fear Street Part Two 1978 is a decent sequel and decent film with decently sized flaws. It's far from the potential it could have had, but like the last one, still manages to be a solidly enjoyable film.My Rating: 7.3/10.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

Introducing Ziggy and the curse of the Sarah Fear all in one horrific go.They do go a weirdly tasteful route where they previous showed high schoolers being killed, but do not show younger children being killed. I honestly didn't expect it given the amount of blood and wounds are shown, but not really gore come to think of it, at least not in this one.Even as a stand alone movie, if you're into camp movies and like slashers, this is well worth the watch.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

Once again, the members of Shadyside have to once agian try & stop the curse & save the rest of the members from being slaughtered.So what Part 1 did for Scream, Part 2 does for Friday The 13th. This film was better than Part 1 easy. The story was more grounded to reality & not wacky & all over the place. The gore was great & the eye candy was pretty good, Emily Rudd though... babe...!The usual down sides were the pace & runtime. The film is 102 minutes too long.

36,arungeorge13,"Not the racy slasher that I'd wished for, but certainly not bad either! [+59%]",6,9 July 2021,"While the middle piece in the trilogy lacks the compelling bite of the first film, it still holds up fairly fine as a camp-based slasher. While it was a lesbian romance that provided for the emotional core in 94, it's dysfunctional sisterhood in 78. Director Leigh Janiak spends a great deal of time (nearly 40 minutes or so) establishing key characters and their uneasy, contradicting relationships before we get to the opening kill. Shadysiders and Sunnyvalers are at Camp Nightwing (camps never fare well in slashers, do they?) - a detailed flashback that the C. Berman character from 94 takes us to. Sarah Fier, the witch who haunts Shadyside, is a less subtle figure this time around, with more mentions here than in the original.Stylistically speaking, 78 is a lot different from 94 - the tone employed here is darker, bleaker. The in-your-face soundtrack slowly turns itself into a tiresome exercise, frequently slapping the sides of our heads and reminding us that it's the '70s. There's no dank humour as in the first either; what we get instead are Stephen King references. The druggy sidekicks here are fleshed out better (especially, one of them) which is a welcome change from them being stereotyped as easy targets. As for the kills themselves, they're pretty gory - they do not discriminate between an innocent kid or a sex-crazed teenager. Then again, a lot of inconsequential characters fall prey to the killer's machete which lessens the emotional impact. To an extent, I thought this film reinstated certain slasher stereotypes: the biggest sinners get sliced and diced in the most gruesome ways.The overlong exposition dumps (on Sarah Fier and the curse itself) leave little in the way of satisfying emotional arcs. The teen romance in 78 never hits the highs of 1994, nor does the warring-sisters dynamic prove interesting enough. Sadie Sink is clearly the film's standout performer, balancing both vulnerability and charisma. The urgency of 94 is terribly amiss here - for a slasher, I prefer my tension levels spiked. 78 is the quintessential middle piece - everything here is set up to get to that blood-curdling finale - as a standalone, it's only fun in parts.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

39,gedikreverdi,It was on par with the first one and even better at times,7,10 July 2021,"The killings were partly off camera as most of them were children but still it was gory enough and I liked Sadie Sink as Ziggy. I thought it was Ziggy who didn't survive all along but she was the survivor. It was as good the as the first one but how on earth did we not see a very painful death of Sheila the bully girl? The junkie couple and Ziggy's sister and tommy went to the witch's house in the forest and Tommy got possessed there because his name was on the wall among the other killers from Shadyside. He killed Arnie the junkie guy and Cindy and Alice followed the pattern of the witch stone drawn in the book of the campsite's nurse who tried to kill tommy because she knew it all along. She was also the sister of the serial killer girl who killed her friends at the party and so she wanted to solve the mystery. They found a connection to the toilets of the campsite from the maze of caves that they entered from under the house of the witch. Cindy found another way because they couldn't lift them up. Alice broke her leg too. Tommy decapitated another man at the toilet and Ziggy was saved the last minute when Cindy found another exit to the campsite from the caves. She cut his head off but other killers revived too from the heart of the cave and Alice found the severed hand bone Down under the toilets buried under the red moss. They had to reunite the body with the hand. Alice was killed too and the sisters run over to the hanging tree. They couldn't find the body as the killers were approaching from all directions. Both were dead but the current sheriff of town Nick revived Ziggy because he was in love with her. He never saw her again after hearing she was taking about the witch. Back in 1994 in the house of Ziggy, Deena and josh found the hanging tree in the middle of the shopping mall. She reunited the body parts and woke up in 1666.

40,IonicBreezeMachine,Fear Street continues with a fun homage to Friday the 13th and Sleepaway Camp that ramps up the body count and builds the mythology.,7,10 July 2021,"Fear Street continues with a fun homage to Friday the 13th and Sleepaway Camp that ramps up the body count and builds the mythology.Following the events of part 1 set at Camp Nightwing during the Summer of 1978, sisters Ziggy (Sadie Sink) and Cindy Berman (Emily Rudd) are polar opposites with Ziggy prone to trouble and Cindy the archetypical ""good girl"", both of whom share the stigma of being Shadysiders. Both of them deal with their issues be it bullies, crushes, or soured friendships, until the curse of Sarah Fier strikes again and a murderer rampages through Camp Nightwing.The 2nd part of the Fear Street trilogy, the movie does a good job continuing off from the first film and serves as both a prequel and a sequel with the cast of part 1 learning of the events along side us. Much like how part 1 was an homage to Kevin Williamson inspired 90s slashers like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, Part 2 goes back to the earlier sources of the genre with inspiration taken from Friday the 13th and Sleepaway Camp. With a larger body count and a larger group of characters to play with, Fear Street improves upon its predecessor while still maintaining its core appeal. The characters have slightly more definition this time around with some good dynamics established between them, and the Camp setting is put to good effect. The mythology is explored even further this time around with some nicely unsettling images that complement the berserk killers and culminates in a tease for the final part that looks quite promising.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
41,hnt_dnl,Exceptional entry of the film trilogy,10,12 July 2021,"While I quite liked Part 1 of the FEAR STREET trilogy, I found this one PART 2: 1978 to be superior in almost every way: better and funnier dialogue, better acting, more fluid storytelling, better pacing, and great cinematography and music worthy of the big screen. In particular, I found Cindy Berman (brilliantly played by Emily Rudd) to easily be the best character of the first 2 films and I doubt my opinion will change after the 3rd one which will be set in 1666. Cindy is now one of my favorite horror movie protagonists. Rudd made Cindy feel completely 3-dimensional and easy to root for as the film progressed. While everyone was hyping up and fawning over Sadie Sink as Ziggy Berman, surprisingly, I found that Cindy was the real main character of this piece. Don't misunderstand, Sink was very good. In fact, I can't stand her character Max on Stranger Things and think her acting on that series is pretty bad and Max is irrelevant, but here, Ziggy is a character with an actual personality that doesn't feel forced into the story the way that Max is on Stranger Things. The 2 sisters Cindy and Ziggy are supported by a uniformly great set of unique characters in Alice, Nick, Tommy, Sheila, and Kurt. I liked the relationships of Cindy-Alice and Ziggy-Nick, and I'd say that Alice is actually the 2nd best character behind Cindy.Fear Street Part 2 manages to do something in 2021 that I thought was impossible and that's to tell what feels like an original slasher story. Even though there is a healthy amount of homage paid to 70s/80s films, the story is told in a refreshing way. The writers avoid cliches and do stuff that makes sense. For example, the Camp Nightwing Killer actually goes in for the kill here. No time wasting toying with or staring down his victims. Also, I thought it was interesting to have the killer's face seen for the bulk of the movie and every single one of his victims actually addressed him before he axed them to death. And the way that he got his mask was cleverly executed. The movie also does a great job with the music choices throughout really immersing the viewer in the time period without overdoing it. Part 2 actually feels like it's 1978 and not some cheap, tacky cosplay of the era (talking to you Wonder Woman 1984).This one really has me hyped in anticipation for Part 3. There are so many stories that the filmmakers could fashion out of the notorious and rich history of Shadyside that I can see this ending up as perhaps an anthology series at some point. But as it stands now, Part 2 is one of my new favorite horror movies.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

You know how the killer(s) look(s). They spell out the ending right at the start. 90% of the film is a giant flashback, and when we jump back into the current timeline, it just...stops. Nothing happens. It's not really a cliffhanger, but rather an indication that you have to watch the third one just to see how it ends. So, basically, it could've been a standalone film, but they stretched it into 3 films, with the second and a third one resembling a flashback and a flash-flashback.I'm sort of ok with this structure. The first one felt adequate (overloaded with lady-to-lady love, though, mostly abandoned in this one), and the ending teaser hyped me for a gory sleazy F13 slasher. But it's really not that. There's a couple of good gory CGI shots, but probably due to rating issues, they don't get as creative with gore, and half of the victims get killed off-screen.I might just as well check the last one, but I know for a fact that I will not revisit this trilogy any time soon.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

The movie started a bit slow setting up characters, but when ax hits the fan, the tension remained high for the rest of the runtime.Potentially there were a lot of gore (get ready for a lot of ax chopping), but some were not shown because the movie can't show kids got killed. Yes, no kids were safe in this movie. The killer was a huge menace, from his look and the ax he carried.The lore also became more interesting.

50,SoumikBanerjee25,A Much Better & Much-Needed Improvisation!,8,18 July 2021,"From this, one could learn just how Writing holds great significance to a film's broader perspective. While the preceding part was mostly clichéd and weighed down by a comparatively trifling narrative, this one fares a whole lot better in pretty much all the aspects. Not to mention, the improved characterization had an important role to play!Besides, there happen to be some underlying Innuendoes about social inequality, supremacist dogmas, economic disparities; all being portrayed through the animosity between the people of Shadyside and Sunnyvale. I do have a propensity for subtleties; especially, when films decide to have matters of social importance in them. Had to admit, I'm quite impressed!The storyline, in general, appears to be much more well-rounded this time. Characters are now considerably more relatable and their goals and motives are solidified than ever. Having Sadie Sink (or Everyone's Beloved 'Max' from Stranger Things) has certainly helped in this regard. Apart from her, Emily Rudd as Cindy Berman is another name worth mentioning! The sisterly dynamic between these two got me so emotional, not gonna lie.""I won't let anything pull us apart again.""At the technical level, it reached a new high; for the second time in a row. Whether it be the creative usage of color gradation or more predominant blood & gore elements (Trust me, they bared it all); this has indisputably surpassed all expectations. And the same remark applies to its fantastic Score as well; highly reminiscent of 80's trademark signature. A great job there too, I guess!My criticism is mainly about its tempo. The mid-act in particular gets overly dialogue-heavy and takes a while to accumulate the much-needed momentum! Really unusual in cases of Slasher Horrors. I wouldn't have minded, had it been negligible; but it wasn't.

However I found the general story a little lacklustre, thanks in part due to being spoiled in the first film. We know who lives and who dies before the flashback even starts, and the failed attempt at concealing which of the sisters survives wasn't enough to keep an air of mystery intact. Purely by the way the film was structured, you could tell which one was the Berman from 1994. The kills were also comparatively lacklustre. As much as I didn't like how 1994 killed off its two best characters, the death by bread slicer takes the cake for best kill in the series so far, and nothing in 1978 even comes close. It's all beheadings and stabbings, and nothing even remotely creative. If I had to choose, I'd say 1978 was slightly better just by being more consistent and more enjoyable, with fewer leaps in logic. I give it a fun but still unremarkable 7/10.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
58,PedroPires90,Better than the 1st,8,10 July 2021,"Like with most summer camp horror films, the critics are wrong and the general public is right about this one.This is a darker film, with a much better construction, with better and more horror and more enjoyable to watch than part 1. Even the directing is better (Dollys, Dutch Angles, etc.) and the cinematography is outstanding. 2/3 too many emotional scenes affected the pace on the 2nd act, but that's it.Fantastic acting by Sadie Sink, she will definitely be a star.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

The acting is better, the pace is better, the characters are a little better and most importantly it doesn't have a 'teen movie' feel to it (the first one felt like it was meant for twelve y/o). Don't get me wrong it's not a huge success but it's definitely an improvement. Lets hope the next one would be even better and explain everything.

The storyline was alright and the execution was better than Part 1.The cast did okay as a whole, however the lead characters are unlikable. Movie didn't have proper horror elements. It was just like a simple slasher movie. Emotional elements were missing, you may not even feel bad for any character when they die or are in difficult situation. One thing that was improved that this movie gives you vibes of 70-80s unlike Part 1, which is set in 90s but it doesn't give you 90s vibes.Overall, movie could have been much better if there would have been little bit better execution but it was an improvement over Part 1.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

Director: Leigh Janiak
Starring: Sadie Sink, Emily Rudd, Ryan Simpkins, McCabe Slye, Gillian Jacobs, Matthew Zuk, Kiana Madeira, Benjamin Flores jr, Brandon Spink, Ted Sutherland etcShadyside, 1978. School's out for summer and the activities at camp Nightwing are about to begin. But when another Shadysider Is possessed with the urge to kill, the fun in the sun becomes a gruesome fight for survival. Wow what a fantastic film and definitely an improvement over the first instalment which I already loved.My first few positives would be the interesting opening and continuation of the plot. The great set up. The fantastic cinematography and sound design as well as the great younger actors. I found the opening to be really interesting, having it be a direct continuation of the first film was a clever idea, I was just expecting it to jump straight into 1978, but establishing the characters goals as well as introducing new characters and a very solid mystery and set up with the background of the Shadyside killers was great. It introduced the audience to the story of the two sisters in an intriguing way that got me invested straight away. I also found it really interesting to have the younger versions of the older characters within the film. It was a clever idea and it established what those characters were like before the first film, giving good character background and details to the characters that were missing from the first film and essential to the final instalment as well. I also thought the cinematography and sound design was excellent here. Having the setting of summer camp made for a very fun slasher experience, the film played with its surroundings and lighting extremely well for great effect, it knew exactly what kind of film it wanted to be with its disturbing imagery and well-crafted shots. The sound design was also excellent, this really built tension well, and is something this trilogy is doing excellently. Hearing the sharpening or slashing of the axe really created a tense atmosphere and also increased the tension with the characters.My next few positives would be the chemistry between the cast, the humour. The fantastic performances, as well as the character depth and explanation to conflict, giving you more time to connect with the characters. The cast here worked brilliantly with each other, they had much more of a believable and fun chemistry than the cast from the first film who were still great. Especially Sadie Sink, Emily Rudd, and Ted Sutherland. I loved the sisterly bond that the film developed on excellently and the cast was equally as good as each other. I also thought that the humour was great. It wasn't overused, but provided that much needed break off the tension and there was a lot of fun scenes involving the camp and the competition between them that were very funny and well executed. The performances here were brilliant, the whole cast did a fantastic job. But the key standouts from this cast were Ted Sutherland, Sadie Sink and Emily Rudd. Who all delivered excellent performances here. They delivered in the emotional and comedic scenes and they made you genuinely feel for and connect with there characters which is the biggest compliment you can give to a performance; they brought the passion and intensity required for this kind of genre. I really liked the character depth and explanation to the conflict to the main two characters. What I loved about this film that was an improvement over the first for me, was that they actually spent more time fleshing out and developing the main characters, I connected with them a lot more and instead of having unexplored conflict they explained it excellently and due to both the sisters troubled relationship with their parents and not being there for each other, it gave an extra needed layer to both of their characters, it just made me more invested in the story and the characters within it.My next few positives would be the fun elements to the film. The building of tension and tone. The excellent Jumpscares and worldbuilding. And the excellent slasher tone and gore. I loved that the film spent some time developing the summer camp and the fun activities involved within it, it just added a fresh and fun quality to it seeing the characters just have fun, and tonally it fitted in with the time period and the summer camp slashers that have been done so well beforehand. I also loved how the film built its tension and gore. It didn't go all in with its slasher tones straight away like the first film, which I actually really appreciated. Instead, it took its time developing the characters and the fun tone. And slowly built its tension and more supernatural horror elements over the first half. This for me created more tension and an extra intensity to the film. The slasher tone and Jumpscares were also excellent. When the film started using its slasher tone to its full potential it went all out, turning the gore up to a 100 with some gruesome and realistic kills that were delightfully grim and the film went full on slasher which I truly appreciated, it felt like the film knew what kind of tone it wanted to be and it went all out which I loved. Finally, I also really appreciated the worldbuilding. Having the younger version of the characters really added to their characters in the present, and the film really built on the world of Sarah Feir and the killers excellently, both serving as an origin to the axe killer but also expanding on world that was so well set up from the first film.I did have a few slight nit-picks with the film, largely within the first half. There was some generic set up of conflict, overreliance on exposition and a generic set up. The first third of the film was slightly generic and had me slightly concerned. The setup of conflict for Ziggy was fairly bland, her character had the formulaic role of the outsider or the troubled kid and this wasn't expanded on for a long time, so it just felt like forced teen drama, this was soon fixed but still was a noticeable issue. I also felt like there was some moments that the film relied too much on exposition to explain conflict with Ziggy and the other campers instead of showing it which irritated me slightly. I also thought the set up for Tommy becoming the axe killer was slightly generic and predictable, it was very much easily set out for the characters to make a certain decision not listen to the cautions and you have the main plot point. It could have just had a little bit more thought put into it.My final few positives would be the separate storylines, development to the plot, the rising of stakes. Fantastic final act and great unexpected twist at the end. I really loved the separate storylines developed for Ziggy and Cindy. It gave room for the film to grow its characters, expand the mythology and to increase the tension and stakes. Cindy developed a lot more as her character with the help of Alice (Ryan Simpkins) who did a fantastic job here. There was a lot of personal scenes between them both which was a great turning point for her character. It provided great development to the plot, as the stakes of the characters relationships as well as how many people were being killed slowly increased as we learned more about how to stop the curse. I also thought the final act was fantastic. The film increased the tension and the stakes and really pushed the characters to their limit, in an intense, gripping, and clever final act that had a surprising twist ending. Going back to the 90's setting of the first film and learning that it was Ziggy that was alive instead of her sister was an excellently executed twist, and what the characters learned about connecting Sarah Feir's hand with her body was a clever and fun set up for the final instalment.Overall, Fear Street part 2: 1978 improves on its predecessor. With an intense, gory, and impactful second instalment. That focuses on its characters much more clearly, and with a stronger cast. A few generic moments within the first third aside, this was excellent and has made me extremely excited for the final film.Overall rating 94/100.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

In part because the characters are less compelling, but also because the horror elements are a little too electric without the right mood. Also, being in this case a kind of ""Friday the 13th"" homage, it gets ridiculously shy in the sex scenes (even though there are a lot of them), with this recent trend of only showing men's asses. Of course, in these double standards the gore it's not a problem, you know?",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
71,zac-04879,"Just Dumb, Disappointing and Super Flat",3,10 July 2021,"Just like the opening part of this dumb film trilogy, Fear Street Part Two: 1978 is a flat, predictable and disappointing teen slasher. It's just a slasher-thriller with a completely flat story and a painfully tedious momentum. The critics are out of their minds whilst rating this highly and classing it as a true horror mystery with epic tension.Firstly, Fear Street: 1978 isn't at all scary or ominous like it believes it is. Based on R. L. Stine's Fear Street novels, without being anything like the Fear Street novels, this second chapter of a gory trilogy isn't scary and contains too much unnecessary adult content. It's another one of those typical horror movies that relies on violence and scary outfits to terrify. Obviously it fails. And to actual real horror fans who have witnessed many slashers, Fear Street 2 is predictable and mostly boring.It also could've been a better part to Fear Street if the characters weren't so dumb and unlikeable. Every single character is literally just a dramatic, irritating teen who just wants to be the hero and save the day.What many people will enjoy about this film is the decent storyline and bloody killings, which aren't as compelling as the first film's brutal, gory slayings. It's just a big let down and a complete disappointment. If you are one of those people who are terrified of tedious gore and like simple slashing and mystery, you just aren't a real horror fan. Fear Street Part Two: 1978 is one of those kinds of horror films.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
72,darkreignn,Much better than the first film,7,20 October 2021,"""Fear Street: 1978"" continues the story started by its predecessor, picking up directly where the first movie left off. As our heroes have a plethora of questions about the horrors they were lucky enough to live through, we take a blast to the past in a search for answers - all the way back to a summer camp in 1978. And unlike the first film, which in my opinion underutilized its 90's setting, this movie actually does make good use of the late 70's backdrop. From the classic tunes to the hilariously ridiculous way the campers are dressed, ""1978"" genuinely feels like if ""Wet Hot American Summer"" got dipped in a vat of teenage horror - and it works!Where the first ""Fear Street"" bored me more often than it entertained me (with its saving grace being the two main performances by Kiana Madeira and Olivia Scott Welch), this sequel kept me consistently entertained based on its pure camp - no pun intended. While they do have their fair share of creepy visuals, these ""Fear Street"" movies obviously aren't going to scare you; with that in mind, they better make up for it with fun factor, and ""1978"" delivers. The setting itself immediately enhances the entertainment value, especially if you already enjoy 70's cinema. The music rocks, the outfits are laugh-out-loud dumb, and when the slaying starts, it's as bloody and visceral as you'd expect from a movie that harkens back to the golden age of slashers. The first film may have had slightly more memorable kills, but, at the risk of sounding too sadistic, it was just a whole hell of a lot more fun to watch a bunch of teens get sliced up with an ax here.This movie continues with the tradition of memorable performances that the first movie set up. Sadie Sink completely steals the show here with a performance that is just too entertaining (and it doesn't hurt that she's completely gorgeous, but I may be biased as I've always found redheads extremely attractive). Sure, her role as a bullied, misunderstood girl may be cliched, but she has a certain energy and tenacity about her that is undeniable. Every other actor in here is just as good; Emily Rudd, Ryan Simpkins, Ted Sutherland - everyone gives a very good performance that doesn't feel as if they're trying too hard to emulate what's already been done before. Everyone brings their own spin to these characters, so as to not have them completely fall into cliched archetypes.The story here is also a lot more engaging than what we got beforehand. Maybe a late 70's summer camp massacre is easier to relate to than an early 90's small town slaying; regardless, I found myself watching diligently, eager to see what new characters, plot developments, and kills would occur next. The highest praise I can give? After my lukewarm reception to the first movie, this sequel actually left me wanting more, and now I can't wait to finish the trilogy. I can feel confident in highly recommending ""Fear Street: 1978"" as a fun throwback horror film, and in saying that struggling through the mediocre first movie is worth it to make it to this one.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

74,gabriel_sanchez,The plot is interesting enough to keep us going. The rest is OK.,8,28 September 2021,"When you start this movie, you are introduced to a prologue of the first movie's events. I suggest you pause this prologue and go watch Fear Street: 1994 (2021) first.In Fear Street: 1978 (2021), we resume the saga on the same night where the events of the first movie took place. Deena and Josh find C. Berman and ask for her help on how to end the curse and save Sam and ultimately Shadyside.By this point, I realize how nonsense is the movie's title. Fear Street... ok, cool, the witch is called Sarah FIER... but, come on, all the plot takes place in the town of Shadyside, not just one street. A better name, even though cliché, would probably be The Curse of Shadyside or The Witch of Shadyside.In this movie, we see the story of the Berman sisters in 1978 when the witch influenced another victim to commit mass murder. Deena's idea, now in the movie's present, is to know what the sisters did that allowed one of the sisters to stay alive for all this time.Like I said in my review of the first movie, this movie is kind of a tribute to the classics of the slasher genre. It is not to say that this movie doesn't add its own spicy to the genre, but the slasher genre is so overdone that is hard to come up with new ideas. The movie is alright.If you are a horror movie fan and get interested in horror stories, you will like this one. The setting is spooky, you get your fair share of jumpscares, the actors do a good job, you get to see all the clichés from this genre in action. I honestly can't add something bad to talk about this movie.As it is custom with many horror movies, I recommend this one only to fans of the genre. If you like slasher movies, watch this series. If you like to watch a horror movie here and there, watch this series. If you are searching for the ultimate best horror movie, watch this series, but you'll get disappointed.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

It still suffers from having annoying characters (but at least the main characters Cindy & Ziggy are likable). It still suffers from overusing music (70s this time of course). The ending is kind of unbelievable. But again there were at least more characters I liked, I found the fate of Tommy to be quite tragic. And I liked that we delved a bit more into the backstory of the witch.

76,dormesher-21565,Fear Street 1978 review,8,19 July 2021,Fear Street 1978. Another solid installment of the Slasher/Horror Trilogy based on the Novels by RL Stine and a Fantastic sequel with a great mix of genres like Slasher and Supernatural Horror just like the first installment.This movie continues brilliantly on from the first installment and tells the backstory of C Burman the survivor of Camp Nightwing which we met at the end of 1994.The movie also gives us more insight and backstory on Sarah Fier and the curse and what they add to the story is brilliant.The characters again for the most part are great especially Ziggy and Cindy Burman who are the main characters of this story and there Sister relationship is handled really well.Its also great seeing younger versions of characters we met in the first film like Nick Goode who was the Cop in 1994.The Kills are great but the ones In 1994 were more creative in my opinion.However i like how this movie has more of a Friday 13th style to it which is awesome and adds to the films nostalgic feel.I also like the interesting new elements that they add to the story like the Witches Mark also being a Map to get out of the Cave that Cindy and Alice are trapped in.We also see Ruby Lanes Mother who is the Nurse at Camp Nightwing and is investigating Sarah Fier and the Curse that turned her Daughter evil which was a great element to add to the story.My only issues with the movie is like the first film the humour doesn't work especially with Alice and Tommy who spent most of the movie getting high.Also like the first film some of the characters outside of the main ones are generic and again they do nothing new with them for this type of movie.Another issue with this installment is there is a pacing issue and the movie slows down alot especially in the first 20 minutes it doesn't ruin the movie as the story is still interesting but the pacing does get a little much.Verdict 8.5/10 a great sequel and another solid installment for Fear Street some great new elements to the story and a good twist on C Burmans backstory.The humour doesn't work and there is a pacing issue and some generic characters but it's a solid sequel.However I enjoyed 1994 a little more.,Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

81,Mivas_Greece,"Definitely an improvement over the 1st film, good splatter and can even be watched as a standalone movie.",6,24 July 2021,"Thriller / splatter Movie. The 2nd film of the Fear Street Trilogy is a direct sequel as the two siblings try to find a way to break the curse of the witch that has now possessed Sam. So they go to ask the only survivor who saw the witch. She will tell them the 1978 slaughter that is the main part of the film and will give us more information about the part of the curse but also for the Witch herself. Although some elements (intense sexism, drugs, etc.) that were present in the first film too, they could have been removed, nevertheless, a more mature darker movie and more suspense than the first. The 1978 slaughter therefore takes place in the camp and its style reminds other splatter films. Altogether it is better than the first as it has fewer silly elements, it does not get boring, while it has more suspense and action. After revealing new elements, it leaves room for sequel, in the 3rd film of the trilogy. Recommended to the fans of the genre even as independent film.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

83,FKDZ,Classic Slasher Fun,7,17 August 2021,"Another F13 movie, but not really, but kind of, Fear street managed to surprise me after a somewhat entertaining but oddly juvenile part one. Where it just felt a bit all over the place.Part Two, does not disappoint, we get the classic school camp scenario and it does not shy away from it. It feels a lot more polished and has a stronger direction than part one.The characters here are great. Overall great acting too with some familiar faces. I also felt that the overall feeling of this movie was a bit more adult. Whereas the first one really felt like a early teenage movie this felt like it was a couple years ahead. Really getting into the more late teenage setting. There's also way less ''wacky kid moments'' and playful music.Thankfully this middle part of the trilogy did have enough substance to not be a filler ''episode''. With enough story development.As again Fear Street does not avoid gore and violence, its full of it here as well and is still the one thing that keeps surprising me here. Whilst the scenes aren't as dramatically acted so there's less punch, the visuals are still there.Having a overarching storyline made this a much more interesting watch than a traditional slasher.Directing, music and everything else was on par with part one.All in all a big improvement over part one.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

The good things are very few and come to be overshadowed by a tired script.Even with its failures this film manages to contribute even a little more explanation of what happens, it manages to make convincing blood scenes, but its resemblance to other successful gender films, makes it less enjoyable.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

A bit more development about the witch but more will follow in the third one..but wait lol.. a major plot hole that I noticed after the movie was done and I was here reading the list of cast members. Sheila, the girl that was locked in with the bugs on her.. remember her? She and ziggy fought and ziggy knocked her out with a punch.. and then the dude, Gary, appeared. Soon after, Alice and Cindy found the hole and started shouting for help.. Tommy arrives and beheads Gary and Ziggy runs... and we never see Sheila again lol.. did she get in the bus? Well, she was kd'ed on the floor, so who knows.. I rewatched that part and before Tommy showing up to behead Gary, Nick finds the kid's bodies and then runs into Kurt outside, telling him to gather everyone in the bus and to leave... so I doubt sheila had time to wake up and get on it lol she could've shown up later to catch up with the group like Alice did after cindy killed tommy.. but anyway, it made no actual difference and it wasn't that bad like the empty hospital and easy to access school at night like in the previous movie plot holes.Let's watch the next one now.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
88,hoernkeem,"Fear Street: Part Two - 1978 (2021, Leigh Janiak) 2nd installment channels a strong 'Stranger Things' vibe and is some fun, nostalgic style horror",7,22 August 2021,"The second part of the Neflix acquired 'Fear Street' trilogy debuted a week after the first installment labeled '1994'. The events of this film are alluded to in the first movie and the Camp Nightwing killer shows up, but here we learn how those events actually unfolded. Leigh Janiak is the director as she was for part one. All of these films were shot back to back. This film returns actors Kiana Madeira and Olivia Scott Welch from the first film, but as most of the primary plot is told in flashback a whole new cast is assembled the most famous of which is Sadie Sink who played Max in the latest season of 'Stranger Things'. The setting combined with Sink's starring role gives this whole project a very strong 'Stranger Things' vibe. A week after the release of '1978' the final installment '1666' was released on the streaming service.At the end of installment one the witch has possessed Sam leaving Deena to figure out how to exorcise her. They learned that there was a survivor from the Camp Nightwing massacre who may be able to help so they go find C. Berman. She is reluctant to help, but eventually lets the kids in and recounts the story of Camp Nightwing which is the balance of the plot of this movie. It was summer of 1978 and Shadysiders and Sunnyvalers alike have gathered at Camp Nightwing for typical camp summer fun culminating in a contest known as Color War that pits Shadyside against Sunnyvale. We meet Ziggy Berman, played by Sadie Sink and her older sister Cindy Berman played by Emily Rudd. The camp nurse seemingly goes crazy and attempts to stab Cindy's boyfriend Tommy Slater. The nurse was the mother of an infamous Shadyside killer Ruby Lane. As fate would have it Tommy becomes possessed and starts stalking around slaughtering everyone at the camp with an axe. The girls stumble across the connection between Sara Fier and her missing hand. One girl is able to find the witch's hand and after supposedly killing Tommy they venture to the Hanging Tree where Fier was buried. Ziggy bleeds on the hand engaging the curse and all the killers are reborn including Tommy. Both Ziggy and her sister Cincy are killed ending the curse. Ziggy is given CPR and saved which is where a slight twist comes into play as we are led to believe Cindy was the C. Berman recounting the story in 1994 but it is really Ziggy who survived. Back in 1994 Deena takes Sam to where the Hanging Tree is at the Shadyside Mall and they succeed in reuniting the witch's body and hand, but as that occurs Sam has a vision of Sarah Fier in 1666. This points toward the third and final installment of the 'Fear Street' trilogy with 'Part 3 - 1666'.I enjoyed this a bit better than the first installment. There is just something about a slasher movie being set at a camp in the late 70's/early 80's. It is great nostalgia plus I love Sadie Sink and we have not seen enough of her since the end of 'Stranger Things'. I thought there was a lot of decent acting by mostly unknowns. Sink was the only actor I recognized in the whole cast. The design and tone of the film is very much in keeping with '1994' which is to be expected as it is the same creative team. While I liked delving the story of Camp Nightwing which was hinted at in the first film, for a series about a witch and her curse I would have thought they would have dug deeper into that, however, with a third film to go and that one set in the witch's time that last installment will probably be almost entirely devoted to Sarah Fier. This was fun and entertaining but a bit on the basic side. That said I am still enjoying this whole 'Fear Street' enterprise and look forward to watching the last film.Eric's Grade: B.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

90,el7,Supernatural slasher flick,8,10 July 2021,"Fear Street Part Two: 1978 picks up where Part One left off, with Deena and Josh tying up a possessed Sam and dragging her out to meet the mysterious C. Berman, who survived the Camp Nightwing massacre of 1978. Berman, whose house is filled with alarm clocks constantly going off to remind her to check her locks and feed her watch dog, tells them the story of what happened to her and the film flashes back to summer camp 1978, where the longstanding rivalry between Shadyside and Sunnyvale continues, and the viewer is even more certain that Shadyside is cursed. More to the point, the Shadyside characters from 1978 also fully believe in the curse, unlike the 1994 characters who thought it was just a story before it started happening to them. Meanwhile Sunnvyale continues living its charmed life while taking it for granted that the teenage Goode brothers will take charge of the town as soon as they are of age, and nobody seems to find this weird at all. The main plot of Part Two is centered around the Berman sisters, Cindy and Ziggy, who are Shadysiders. Cindy is a counselor and is trying to be a good girl in the hopes of haloing her way out of the curse. Ziggy, the younger sister, is a camper and has no interest in haloing her way out of anything. It quickly becomes apparent that Nick Goode has a thing for Ziggy, who seems confused by his attentions and suspicious of his motives. The movie does a good job of letting the viewer get to know these characters and their friends before bringing on the slasher and supernatural elements, and speaking of Supernatural, the winky references to that show are even thicker on the ground here than in the prior installment. All of the elements are on point in this edition, from the acting to the soundtrack to the mythology building. I liked the callbacks to earlier recordings of Sweet Jane and The Man Who Sold the World. There is a bit of misdirection involving who C. Berman really is, and it's a neat surprise, but then you wonder why the actress playing her behaves so differently from the actress playing younger her. People change, and the movie wanted to lead us to believe something different, but still. Berman needed a 'oh yeah, that's her' moment after the reveal, and we didn't get one. Overall though, this is a fun slasher movie which goes even more macabre than the previous film and makes me wonder what's going to happen in the final installment, which I will definitely be watching.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

92,theredsky,Fear Street Part Two: 1978,6,19 July 2021,"Slightly better than the first part but it has some of the same issues. This one however had more interesting characters than part 1. A lot of the characters in part 1 are pretty boring and bland and most of the characters are not that. Ziggy and Nick are really interesting characters that get a lot of screen time to develop. While some of their development is one note, they still have some great scenes and they do feel unique. Some of the other side characters are very bland and are only there to provide exposition. I feel that this film had a better scare factor than the first film. I felt a lot more creeped out by this than the first film especially towards the end. There is a scene at the end that really got me because of how it was shot. I still really enjoyed the use of violence here. It was a little tame at first but became very very brutal around the midpoint. Some of the cinematography was pretty great. It still felt bland most of the time but here and there it looked great. A lot of the lore of this universe is explored more here and while the information is interesting, I wish it was presented in a more visually engaging way. It's a lot of stationary shots and shots of the camera swinging around the characters and it does for almost 90% of the exposition scenes. The end of the film had an interesting twist but if you analyze the film just a little bit, you can see the twist coming from a mile away. If you liked the first part, then you'll probably like this even more than the first.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

There are too many scenes that don't need to be added like the love scenes between the characters which is too much and the killer fake outs where it plays out like somebody is going to be killed but they just get spooked by their stupid friend.

She was good in Stranger things and she's better here. Rest of the cast acted well and we're believable. Background score was decent, soundtrack chosen played their part with character introduction. Visual effects were good and there is ample gore done with practical + effects which make them look better. The twist in the end worked this time, it didn't work in the first part though.There are two problems. The horror value has come down and I am glad there is minimal cheap jump scares. And there is no comedic relief. Every character is a meanie in one or other way.Waiting for 3rd part to release and it looks very promising.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
99,BijeshNagesh,Fearfully Fantastic,9,10 July 2021,"Following in the bloody-good footsteps of its predecessor, ""Fear Street Part Two 1978"" Netflix integrated similar nostalgic hallmarks, in this case from the 70s. The story takes place in a woodland retreat called 'Camp Nightwing'.Part 2 seamlessly connects grisly murders and killers from the ones that showed up in ""Fear Street Part One 1994"". Slasher movie tropes flourished in the plot. They were carefully sprinkled throughout the story so they didn't communicate a sense of deliberate writing or lazy directing.I was genuinely anticipating a quick recap of how Part 1's final events were resolved - after that movie actually ended - and then '78 starts to unfurl in all its cinematic splendour. This second movie in the Fear Street series certainly delivered on my expectation.I enjoyed this movie as much as I did the first one. The storylines are separated by sixteen years - from what the kids in Shadyside experienced in '94 to what the kids in Nightwing went through in '78.Part 2 revealed all the murderous connections that linked Part 1's events to its own. No loose ends.I also liked the 'classic' feel they integrated into this film, and the manner in which they juxtaposed it with a relatively modern colour palette that has now probably come to define this Fear Street trilogy from Netflix.The performances were great. All of the cast, despite being young, seemed to have a flair for recreating 70s-era slasher-style performances and reactions - including the classic 'Scream Queens' effect. Good direction indeed from Leigh Janiak.I particularly believe that Emily Rudd (who played Cindy Berman) truly got into her character - in fact, she out-performed everyone else.The character of Sarah Fier remained a potent presence in this film, especially during the finale. I'm confident that the mystery surrounding her will be solved in the third and last movie in this Fear Street Netflix trilogy. Part 3 promises to take us back to when Fier was still alive and magicking.I cherished the way both Parts 1 and 2 genuinely emulated the 'spirit' of R. L. Stine's writing. It was interesting to watch and recall the times I read the Fear Street books - it has been a while, might need to go back and pick up where I left off. These films are but loose adaptations anyway, so no one book springs to mind.A great big nod of appreciation to the Production Design team who worked on Part 2 of Netflix's Fear Street movies. The film truly exuded a 70s aura, much like Part 1 did the 90s. Some similarities between both films will understandably exist. The 'years' of these movies will provide the clues you need to figure out why. I remember some of the knick-knacks in this film from stuff my grandparents had, so I can definitely tell you it had some powerful 70s elements.Costume Design again came out on top in Part 2. Exquisite attention to late-70s detail.Loved the ""Carrie"" dialogue-reference, by the way. And the part where Ziggy Berman (played by Sadie Sink) and Nick Goode (played by Ted Sutherland) referenced Stephen King in their conversation. Interesting horror-centric add-ons... Sadie's performance was also good throughout this movie, though a bit 'level'.Makeup did great work on this film. The gore was visceral and realistic, especially in combination with the VFX, which was specifically good for the giant beating heart in the 'witch's home' as well as the murderers it summoned from its black blood.Wonderful slasher-movie references too. Tommy Slater's (played by McCabe Slye) pulling a 'berserk killer' from ""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"" (1976) was a nifty choice. What's truly scary is that this horror-movie killer was loosely based on a real life serial murderer who tormented the residents of a town in Texas in the mid-40s. However, Tommy wielding an axe/hatchet while wearing a sackcloth hood makes me think of the killer from the ""Redwood Massacre"", but this film released as recently as 2014. I remain doubly unsure precisely which killer they were trying to reference.There were other prominent horror-movie baddie references too, but I really don't feel this is the right time for me to geek out on them all. What I shared before should suffice to give you an idea about the bloody brilliant attention to detail that Netflix put into the side-villains of ""Fear Street 1978"".Now, I am not sure if this next bit was intentional, but the un-focused areas of the video (minus the characters who were in focus) - during the 1978 sections of the film - held a subtle 'grainy' hint to them. A 70s video quality throwback, perhaps? If so, it was an amazing detail-addition.Speaking of which, the sex was also very much 70s - unrepressed, unashamed, and erotic. Not to sound lecherous, but they could have extended both the raunchy scenes present in the film. In the strictest sense, it would've been reminiscent of 70s era movies when sex was openly showcased on screen, appreciated even. IMDB has an entire list dedicated to filmy erotica from the 70s.The music was also reminiscent of that time. It felt good to imagine how much time the team must have invested during pre-production to choose a world of soundtracks and shortlist a handful from among them.The dog's collar read 'Major Tom'. This was quite interesting. Bowie's song after the same name released in '69, but it holds artistic relevance even today let alone in '78. Plenty of notable names 'sang' one of their popular numbers: Neil Diamond, Captain and Tennille, The Runaways (they cut off their song too soon), Cat Stevens, Blue Oyster Cult, The Buzzcocks, Thelma Houston, and of course David Bowie.Don't assume I didn't notice the 'Ziggy Stardust' reference in Christine ""Ziggy"" Berman's name - Bowie's song plays in the background during her final scenes in the film. Back in the ""1994"" storyline, Gillian Jacobs plays Ziggy's adult version. She's whom the Shadyside kids call for help with their witch-possession problem.The songs from the 70s just kept on coming, and they brought nostalgia with them. As for the score they used for the horror-driven and emotional sequences, those gave me some classic 70s vibes as well. Kudos to Marco Beltrami and Brandon Roberts for their excellence in these regards.""Fear Street Part Two 1978"" was the best blend of clichés you could ask for, and it hit all the right notes. The movie was a treat to watch, and ended on quite the cliff-hanger. This film serves as a sturdy bridge between ""Fear Street Part One 1994"" (already released) and ""Fear Street Part Three 1666"" (releasing on July 16, 2021).Part 2's 'flashback finale' gave me the chills.

This is the best of the trilogy. 1978 manages to be an effective film by itself, with great pacing, a compelling villain, and a far stronger central relationship to keep it going. The characters here fell more fully rounded and developed, with Sadie Sink really stealing the show.This movie was clearly inspired by Friday the 13th and it even gets the camp right. Literally and figuratively.At the end of the day, you make a good Friday the 13th homage, I'll like it.The Bad: Honestly...not much. This is a really solid movie. It can feel a bit YA at times, but even the elements that didn't work in 1994 (i.e. Shadyside vs Sunnyvale) just work better here. I think some of the relationship, particularly with the sister and her ex-friend should hav been a bit more fleshed out, but aside from that...good job.The Ugly: This isn't a complaint per se...but I feel like if you're going to have a prominent sex scene, you might as well go all the way.

I only decided to watch this part for Sadie Sink. The acting was quite stale and the environment did not create that 70's feeling that it should have. The pacing was poor and it had some unnecessary sex scenes which were very disgusting. Seriously can they not make a horror film without any form of nudity or sex these days? And near the end of the movie how does Sadie's character survive after being stabbed for at least 5 times in the stomach? How much more ridiculous can these movies get? In spite of all these flaws I would still consider this part slightly better than part one. None of the characters were likeable and overall the movie was not scary at all.

109,shakedatjunk,I can't believe people like this one better,6,10 July 2021,"This movie is a clear step down from the first one. Pacing is awful kills aren't nearly as creative, the kills are in the dark and the movie is darkly lit way too much, and there was only 1 likable character in this movie. I didn't care about anyone who died in this movie, whereas 1994 the deaths of the friends hit really hard. Part 1 had better pacing, better kills, you could see the gore more, plot made slightly more sense, and better characters.It seems only casual are the ones who seemed to like this movie better. Most true horror YouTubers agree this movie isn't as good as 1994. I think general fans were just disappointed Sadie Sink didn't show up in the first movie so they rated it low and they're happy she's in this one. Her character had no reason to be in the first one so people being mad about that and criticizing the movie for it makes no sense.This movie is still good. Great cinematography at times, some brutal on screen kills albeit a lot of them were in the dark and not as creative, captured the fun camp setting at times. Big problem with this movie is that it isn't nearly as fun as The Burning or Sleepaway Camp or F13 Part 4 or even AHS 1984. Kind of was just a slightly less good version of all of those. If they would've had a kill towards the beginning and shaved off a little time in the middle the pacing would've been better. The one short haired stoner sex girl was so annoying and unlikable and her dramatic scene almost had me fast forward 10 minutes.Still a good movie, but not on the level of 1994.

118,Blazehgehg,Better than Part One? It's complicated.,8,1 August 2021,"The first Fear Street was right up my alley. A little cheesy, not necessarily very scary, but still thrilling and spooky. A few shocks, but not excessively gory. A good time.Part Two is a very different beast. I guess in the short hand you could call it a tribute to 80's slasher movies, what with the camp and such. But it's also a bit less cheesy, and way more bloody than the first movie. It knows you're coming in fresh from Part One, so after some introductions, it hits the ground running and doesn't stop.I suppose, in retrospect, Part One was much more about setting the table. It didn't suffer for that in any way shape or form, but it allows Part Two to take advantage and cover more ground, more quickly. What this means is that not only is this less cheesy and more bloody, but I found it to be more scary, too. We spend a lot more of this movie with a killer being a known threat and there being real consequences for that.The only downside is that despite Fear Street being pitched as a trilogy of movies, this one abides the most by the rules of TV. It opens with a brief ""Last time on Fear Street"" recap, and makes no bones about ending on tons of loose ends. Fear Street Part One could almost be considered self-contained if it weren't for the stinger at the end setting up this movie, but Part Two more charitably feels like the first half of Part Three, if that makes any sense.Is that a complaint? Eh, probably not. But don't expect any sense of closure from Part Two, and be ready to queue directly in to Part Three as soon as you can.A better movie than Part One? That's a tougher answer than you'd think. I'd be inclined to say yes, but you cannot watch this movie in isolation and get the same experience out of it. That's also not a complaint, I'm just wondering out loud if a sequel can be better than the first movie while also being so dependent on that originator. But that's a logic pretzel for my brain to untangle.All you really need to know is that Part Two is also a pretty good movie.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
119,Likeafrisbee,The story is so good!,10,2 August 2021,Wow this was a good movie it got it all. It's rare that a horror movie has a good story. There have not been such good movies since Scream 1. But here you see something that is on the same level as Scream. I love how the viewer of this movie can feel the tension from running away from the killers. Bravo great movie!,Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
120,tiffanytallent1981,Better than the First Part!,8,17 July 2021,"This starts off exactly where the first one ends; Deena and Josh are trying to find a way to save Sam from the witch. They take her to C. Berman for help. After they tie up Sam, Berman tells Deena and Josh what happened in 1978. Almost the entire movie is a flashback of the murders that happened at camp back then. Berman (nickname Ziggy in '78), and her sister are part of the camp and have to fight for their lives, along with the other campers.I liked the characters better in this second part. Everyone was just more interesting. The movie answered questions I had from the first part, like why the sheriff seemed to be so lousy at his job. And how/why C. Berman stayed alive all of these years. The death scenes were even more brutal and sometimes unexpected. And from the last scene, I think I know where the third part is headed. I might have to add this second part to my yearly Halloween watchlist.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
121,petarilic32,Very fun and entertaining - even better than the first one,7,4 October 2021,"I liked the second part way more than the first. It still falls under teen-slasher but it's executed much better with better acting and better plot.Alice is my favorite character throughout the trilogy.

Fear Street part 2 actually works and is quite watchable and engaging. The only real problem I had with it is the horrible acting, especially from Stranger Things alumni Sadie Sinks. She was hardly a star in Stranger Things, but her character played its part and she did good enough as an actress I guess. However in this movie she is intolerable and she is way to dramatic and intense with her role. Perhaps it isn't her fault and the director wanted her to to be an autistic loser, but either way her character is just plan goofy and annoying. I almost wanted to side with the bullies and run her off the camp. None of the other acting is that great either, but at least they aren't Sadie Sinks.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

It's like trying to play a retro video game console on a 4K tv. Isn't necessary right? Anyways it takes about 40 minutes of boring plot development ( are they really developing the plot ) and teen drama until we get into the guts aka the killing.Where are the adults?! There's hardly any adults in this film which logical speaking is absurd. There's some gruesome killing just like the first one, yawn.Verdict

129,benjaminskylerhill,A significant improvement upon the first film.,8,25 July 2021,"This is one of the greatest slasher movies ever made, and it would have been so much better if it were allowed to be its own self-contained story-not bogged down by the lore, characters, and overarching story of part 1.The characters in Part II are surprisingly emotionally rich and very well-developed. The first 40 minutes of the film are dedicated to actually establishing who these people are and what they need in their lives. Once the terror strikes in the second half of the story, their personalities and values are put to the test and their development only deepens.The horror elements of Part II are significantly better than those of Part I-they're more shocking, better-looking, and because the suspense is anchored in strong characters, they're far more impactful.Color me surprised; this is one of the best films I've seen in 2021.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

Again same as part one the horror was great it was scary, it was timed well, it was bloody everything was great.Characters were much more likeable this time around especially the two sisters. In the first the characters were not that intriguing to me they but in this all of the characters I liked.Tone was much better they didn't have this ever changing tone it was consistent.Bad:
Plot in this one wasn't as well executed in my opinion. In the first the group is together and trying to figure out how to stop Sara Fier fairly early on. But this time it took half of the movie before Ziggy and Nick were involved and it took some of the urgency away for me and made it seem not as focused.As someone who has always enjoyed slasher films this was very enjoyable. I am not someone who read the books either so that may be why I enjoy it more then others. 7.5/10.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

132,Aria_Athena,Better than the first one,4,13 July 2021,"Unfortunately for me though, what I enjoyed about the first movie were the bad scenes and unintentionally funny parts which made me laugh. Not many of those here, so I ended up being bored.It's a slasher film which doesn't take itself seriously and to be honest I'm rather disinterested in this combination. I don't like films that are horror yet not thrillers. It's well shot like the first one, the acting is much better, but the writing barely saw an improvement. Also cpr doesn't work when the cause of death is blood loss due to multiple stabbings, just saying.What annoys me the most, is that there is no reason for this to be a trilogy, it could have been a simple prequel. I just wanted to see the ending for the first film, but the plot barely progressed. The whole film is narrated by someone in 1994 and the only pay off is that they now know where to find a thing. I will have to watch a 3rd movie just to see what happens when they use said thing, in order to finally get some resolution. It is a 100 minutes standalone movie with throwbacks to the first part and then 5 minutes of continuation from where the previous one ended. Give me a break.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
133,S_dot_M_dot,Perfect Continuation,8,10 July 2021,"The second installment of the Fear Street trilogy held nothing back with 1978. If you are a fan of camp themed slashers, this is a perfect film for you. Set at Camp Nightwing, 1978 dives deeper into the legend of Sarah Fier and makes you want to know how it all started.This cast was fantastic, specifically sisters Ziggy and Cindy, Sadie Sink and Emily Rudd. The unlucky soul to be transformed into Shadyside's next murderer is brutal and shows no restraint. The pace in this is stepped up a notch and doesn't drag in areas the previous film did.This film is far from perfect, but once you put a cast together you can get behind, you tend to overlook these flaws. It can be dark in some spots but given the setting and era depicted, that is expected.Overall, 1978 surpasses its predecessor and has me ready for the final film. If the final film follows the series's trend, we should all be in for a treat.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

Seeing that the movie is set on an earlier era, PLUS it's a sequel, so I presumed it was gonna be another boring sequel, which is a pretty common trait LOL. But no, it was still as interesting as Part 1. This time the story reveals the background of C.

You just need to expect that they are not going for groundbreaking film making here that are released on Boxing Day at the cinema... If you enjoy these films for what they are you will be happy with your viewing experience.Part 2, is the summer camp setting (1978) and has a different approach/feel to part 1 which I thought was good. Max (from Stranger Things) was the main actor in this and perfectly cast too. The main action takes place as night falls and the campers start a game of capture flag. You get a good progression in the story of the witch and characters that dons out more about this mystery in its place and time, and maybe a way to actually stop the curse. As this is only part 2, we know that we will have to wait for the final instalment to know this...The action is good, there is some gore and suspense in the ""killer"" sequences, and the 70s soundtrack is more subtle and much better for it than in part 1 (90s)...Looking forward to part III and hopefully more of these feature length mini series from Netflix in the future...",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

The vibe and feel for the late 70's was still a bit off, but not as much as Part 1. It was the little details that were missing, for example, where was the iconic BIG hair from the 70's?

141,adotson-98233,This second film may be a little better than the first,8,10 July 2021,"""Fear Street Part Two: 1978"" is a very creepy, and fun slasher that I think is a little better than the original. Starting off with the good is obviously the gore. Now this movie may not have a lot of inventive kills like the first one. But these kills are still very bloody. Also the performances are great. Easily the best performance is from Sadie Sink. She is great and her character is easily the best in the film. The movie also actually kinda creeped me out with the imagery. I actually at times got the chills watching this movie because I think that the simple idea of a psycho killing people at a camp is kinda scary to me. This movie also was just very fun. It's a movie that never got boring I was always interested. Also the movie has a few twists which I really appreciated, because this could've been a typical slasher, but it wasn't.Now I do have very few things that I thought the movie could've done better. The first being the pacing. Like I said this movie is very fun, but the first 40 minutes do kinda drag a little bit. It still helped that the performances were great from everyone, but I do think the pacing could've been better. Also that twist I mentioned. I won't say anything, but I was able to guess one of the twists a little quickly.But still ""Fear Street Part Two: 1978"" is a nice step up from the first one. It's bloody, fun, creepy, and features great performances from almost its entire cast.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

They also continue the trend of trying too hard to make ""strong female characters"", and fail again. Giving a girl an intense angry face in almost every scene doesn't make them seem strong, it makes them seem witchy and unlikeable. The attempt at humour fails again and none of the characters are interesting or likeable. This was better than part 1, but not by much.

150,BornKnight,"Pretty Enjoyable, Better Than The First One",7,11 July 2021,"""Fear Street Part II: 1978"" (USA - Netflix, 2021) is a horror/juvenile slasher film, part of a trilogy directed by Leigh Janiak (Honeymoon), with screenplay and story by director and Zak Olkewicz (feature debut), plus story by Phil Graziadei (Honeymoon, Fear Street), based on RL Stine's 1996 Fear Street book trilogy.The trilogy is a new take on the slasher/comedy style of horror, sort like Scream was, approaching the story with a bit more story development, which is not intended to be complex, but doesn't have a time limitation of 2 hours on the explanations and unfolding of the movie. This second movie itself is kind of a direct homage to the 80s horror classics especially Friday the 13th.Being a direct sequel to the first film (yes, you needed to see the first movie), it deals with the story of the survivor of the 1978 massacre that takes place in a teenagers' holiday camp - again triggered by the curse of the witch Sarah Fier killed on the city in 1666, and a curse that from generation to generation makes a person to become possessed, turning him into a serial killer.On the production, the cinematography is by Caleb Heymann (Stranger Things) who uses a similar technique, with plenty of atmosphere and a really cool use of strong and complementary colors, and in this instance tends to use warm tones during the day and highlights darkness at shots in the night with many shadows, creating a somewhat oppressive atmosphere, in addition to using a little noise in the shots that gives it a gritty, retro feel. The edition is well done and cohesive, work of Rachel Goodlett Katz (Dukes of Hazzard, The Walking Dead) and the original score is by Marco Beltrami (Scream, H20, Snowpiercer, World War Z, Hellboy) is very well constructed, using bass and wind instruments plus sinister choirs - I also highlight also the soundtrack that use classics from the 70s (from The Runaways, Neil Diamond, Blue Oyster Cult, Cat Stevens and Kansas among others).In the cast, Sadie Sink as Ziggy Berman (Eli, Stranger Things), Emily Rudd as Cindy Berman (The Romanoffs), Ryan Simpkins as Alice (Single Man, Revolutionary Road) and McCabe Slye as Tommy Slater (The Miseducation of Cameron Post). So it uses some more experienced actors, but gives a chance to new talents...I found the acting pretty cool, especially in relation to the protagonists.Following the example of the first movie the production is really well done - well developed and detailed scenarios and atmosphere, as well as good recreation of the period clothes, personal style and music. The general editing and scenes of violence are again not toned down - it is quite violent in the murders.Compared to the first movie, I honestly found this one more likeable, with more charismatic characters that this time did generate empathy. Of course there are the clichés, but they are not out of context as the trilogy aims to pay homage to classic ""cliché"" movies.It is really entertaining and fun within a genre somewhat forgotten in recent years - nice and more cohesive story, neat production and good acting. I would give a score of 7.5 / 10.0 (B+), it's totally worth it if you like the genre, but with a more relaxed and fun take on it.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
151,Darvener,Oh boy...,4,21 July 2021,"This was better than Fear Street: Part One but this is still trash. Again poor writing, bad director, Leigh Janiak can stay with 5/10 movies because she has no talent for good writing and directing. But I think -- on this movies are working really high quality people except for Leigh Janiak and second writer and vfx artist. I don't know how the fake blood is made if it's made in post-production or in real life but the fake blood is so cheap. In this movie you can find very good performance of unknown actors.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
152,ulex_stovetop,Nothing New But Still Fun,6,1 August 2021,"The second installment in Netlix's fledgling horror universe is nothing more than a filler episode for the folks who can't handle a little ambiguity. Not only does it not bring anything new to the franchise, but it also does nothing for the horror genre as a whole; leaning too heavily on pre-established slasher tropes including flat characters, an overused setting, and a predictable twist. Luckily, the corny nature of the series works to its advantage in this case, becoming a series not for hardcore horror fanatics but for newbies to the format.This chapter is definitely sloppier than the first in many ways. The characters are far less interesting than in the first, partially because the conflict of both our main characters and the rival schools mimics the first part pretty much to a T. It being a prequel comes at the cost of stakes, as you know exactly who the killer is, who will live, and who will die within the first 30 minutes. The editing and effects also feel more mature. The biggest example being the odd choice to speed up the footage during the first action sequence. Lucky, this is the only time this appears.While competently put together, Fear Street Part 2 is nothing to write home about. It is definitely worth a watch for the one or two important story elements, it can otherwise be tossed to the side.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
153,corneliusroz,I was interested for the 2nd part and it delivered,10,25 August 2021,I went to this not expecting much and it's really a better trilogy from the others. The cinematography and the premise is very beautiful to watch. The color grading according to the late 70s and early 80s really shows here. It's quite accurate depiction of the era.The acting however is not the best from lead cast but sadie sink did a good job not the other. The secondary cast did quite great and the tommy guy was phenomenal villain. Definitely a thrilling experience but a little goofs here and there overall pretty well done and looking forward to the 3rd sequel.,Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

Much like its predecessor, this movie struggles to feel like the decade it's based in. Which is a real shame because I could see these becoming cult classics if they pulled off the retro look. I preferred 1994, but Sadie Sink was a joy to watch on screen, she really carried the movie.

Not only did it have a twist at the end that I didn't see coming but the pace stayed consistent and there wasn't a big chunk of the movie that I felt was unnecessary (which happened with the first one).I also really enjoyed how they tied the two parts together. It was a fresh take on a horror trilogy and it was nice to see an original thought and concept considering our society has become lazy and we just regurgitate what's already been done so we don't have to come up with new ideas.By the end of part two, I was glad I decided to watch the trilogy and I'm counting down the days till part three premieres.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

I hold a special place in my heart for horror films that take place at a summer camp, but this movie doesn't really stray from the formula besides the inclusion of the witch.My biggest complaint is how dark the film is. As soon as the teens went traipsing through the woods to find the witches house, the film went almost completely dark. At times, it's difficult to see what's going on. If I were watching this in a theatre for the first time, I don't think I'd be complaining as much, but watching this at home, even at night with no other light on, was a poor viewing experience.From the trailers, I assumed this series would be movies to just throw on and enjoy, and that's exactly what we are getting. Excited for part three!",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
163,thecanadian-23317,Definitely an improvement over the first,8,17 July 2021,"Most reviews said that this was an improvement, and I completely agree. It's still got issues, but it's a much better movie. The biggest issue that this still shares with the first movie is the over reliance on songs from the time period to try and convey that feeling. A few of the choices work, but for the most part it's just a really shallow way to keep reminding the audience ""hey, this movie takes place in the 70s!!"". The actual orchestrated music for the movie however was very chilling and I liked it a lot.Other than that though, almost everything is an improvement. The actual plot is much simpler with much less logical inconsistencies. The acting is really great (Sadie Sink is genuinely fantastic, and Emily Rudd is good too), and the drama between the characters was a lot more compelling.In my review for the first movie I said that I would not recommend it as a stand alone film, and the only reason I'd recommend it was because I was interested in seeing where the sequels went. This movie, however, definitely stands on its own and I can definitely recommend it by itself. It's not reinventing the wheel and it doesn't do anything particularly new, but I found it to be a really enjoyable watch.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

While, it featured bad dialogue and wasn't very consistent, the plot and acting were very strong.Moreover, the characters were great.

166,ivimikey,I could say I actually wanted to finish watching,5,10 July 2021,"If I could give it a 5.5 I would, I just don't feel entirely right giving it a 6 so a 5 it gets. This Movie was actually better than Part one, Actors were better except for one scene it was kinda ""meh"", Story was better, ending was better, But there was something still lacking that made me loose interest at times, about 2 Scenes that are completely skip worthy for the acting was weird or the writing didn't make sense which explains me being confused during it. Not a bad movie, I really feel like a 5.5 is a sweet spot, where part one got a 2 from me.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
167,patrick-lafont,Am I the only one enjoying this less than part one?,4,11 July 2021,"I didn't watch with my full attention, but then again didn't with part one, but it seemed quite simplistic to me. Like an old school movie. But it just not caught my attention, unlike the part one which wasn't exceptional but at least made me watch the second part.I think the other thing that lost me is the ressemblance with the American Horror Story - I believe it was the last season - that had the same background story. I was just wondering what else this movie could tell.The first one made me laugh because many songs were not released in 1994 but this one had not built any 70's ambiance with the music. Only 'The man who sold the world' repeated over and over, maybe a few others, but it looked like they didn't try. Good thing there is no music to look forward to in 1666.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
168,emanueljicmon,Lacks of logic alot,3,28 July 2021,No logic in this movie and the actors r trying but in real life you won't act or being able to behave like they do in the movie.

169,spidermonkeycoleman,So much better than Part 1 it isn't even funny,9,10 July 2021,"TLDR: A sequel that improves the flaws of its predecessor in every way.One thing I want to say quickly is that these movies aren't necessarily based on the Fear Street books. I would use the word, ""inspired."" It takes stuff from the books and puts them into the movies but they aren't directly based on the story in the books.Going into this I wasn't expecting much given how bad the first one was. However, once I finish watching this I was surprised at how great it was.To start, the acting was much better and Sadie Sink is easily one of the best parts about the movie. Her acting raises any scene she's in to the next level and she manages to act well even when she has some corny lines. For the most part, anyways. Even the surviving actors from the 1st film are better in this which was pleasantly suprising.Something I was suprised about was that I actually cared about the characters. I didn't care about a single one of the characters from the 1st movie, but in Part 2 I found myself feeling upset or disappointed when certain people died. The characters are developed way better in Part 2 and have more depth to them which gets you attached.The plot was stronger as well. This was mostly due to the fact that it wasn't setting up an entire trilogy like Part 1 does. Instead Part 2 gets straight to the point and continues right where Part 1 leaves off. Having the movie switch back and forth from 1996 to 1978 also helped the plot because there was no time for unnecessary scenes. Nothing in this movie happens without reason and the movie is better because of it. Also, there are some tense scenes in this one and I didn't feel that way about the first movie. Plus, the crazy plot twists at the end are great.I'll admit, the scary bits aren't scary, but they're still incredibly enjoyable and much more thrilling than the scary bits in Part 1. That's literally the only weak part I can think of in this movie. Actually, there is a plot hole I am bugged by but I won't mention it here.I'm not sure if I would recommend people to watch Part 1, but Part 2 of the Fear Street trilogy I would recommend to anyone.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
170,JayDeeezy,Just More of the Same,6,18 July 2021,"I don't understand where the supposed step up in quality is in this compared to part one that people are talking about. It's still overall a pretty standard slasher (with some witchcraft thrown in) with good production value and solid acting - just more of the same. I was hoping part 2 would step it up somehow.*spoilers*The ""twist"" is that our narrator was Ziggy? Lol I honestly thought that was assumed from the beginning. As such, I see nothing subversive about it. Overall the only part of the film that advances or adds to the story is the last 10 minutes. Don't get me wrong, these first 2 were decent watches to kill time but are nothing fresh.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

It gets some stars removed from me for having very little diversity. Unlike the first one where so many ""90s"" angry triggered people downvoted it because of their dislike of a diverse real American cast, this one should fit their appetite.The movie cast was majority white/European descent w/ all the old Hollywood issues many of us dislike. That was sad to see. In any case, it was still good but the first one was much better.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
174,michaelvandamme3,Fear Street 1978,7,11 July 2021,"Let's be honest, you've seen part one, you don't need a review to tell you whether or not you'll enjoy part two. The formula for a good slasher film doesn't usually differentiate too much especially when they're shot back-back, although this truly felt like one that was made back in the day (some cliches).Currently part two is rated better than part one, and while I enjoyed both, I did enjoy part one more. The first movie only got an unfavorable rating (spammed with 1's) because people are insecure and afraid that ""woke culture"" is coming for them to ruin their lives because they don't want to live in a world where Deena could be a lesbian in 1994.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

176,katefrichardson,"I agree, this one is a lot better than Part One.",8,9 July 2021,"Part One had such a bizarre tone for me when I watched it... I didn't know who to root for. I kept wondering why all of the characters were so emotional, angry, and annoying... and yes, the constant 90's nostalgia music being shoved down our throats I thought was too overwhelming. Trust me, I noticed it too lol.This one however, I thought kept it pretty lean... by continuing on Part One in the beginning with the C. Berman character starting her part of the story... enough to keep you intrigued for what's to come.And it doesn't disappoint.Sadie Sink did a fabulous job, and the rest of the cast did as well. Not a lot of whiny dialogue, and you got to know each of the characters in a more relaxed way instead of everyone simply yelling at each other all the time like in Part One.I was glad to see that the story in Part Two had mostly to do with what happened to C. Berman, and included none of the characters from the first film (minus in the bits in the beginning and bits in the end, respectfully.)And it's set at a camp right?!? Especially back in 1978... I mean, c'mon man! That camp full of all of those kids back in those days in 1978 would be ripe for the pick in' for a serial killer. And this film doesn't cut back on the slasher flick-type gore either. You'll be satisfied, I assure you.Again, unlike Part One I really didn't find myself rolling my eyes once. Great addition to the story!Overall, looking forward to Part Three after this!!",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

Soundtrack were used better, acting was better and etc. Of course there were still some dialogue were placed unnecessarily and I'm not a fan of its original score throughout the two films yet, there is a definite improvement.But, there is one issue that whoever made the decision behind the cast announcements made a huge mistake. I mean, till the finale, there is an uncertainty over who C. Berman actually is and without even first movie were started streaming Gillian Jacobs' role was titled as Adult Ziggy. This could have been a great twist...Also, the last shot of them lying on the ground was really a great job in terms of cinematography. Can't wait to see 1666.

Crux : Take my Advice; Skip It. Or don't; Watch it. As all the reviewers seem to like. And certainly seems like a colluded effort to do so.Hot Take :
Pros: Cant find any.Cons: Uninteresting unlikeable characters. Choppy editing. Heterogenous scene cutting. Very Dim Lighting. Unnecessary characters arcs for e.g. 'who's screwing who'.Review :
Getting through this movie was not fun. It was a chore. Watching this movie was was like trying to swallow glass marbles. It takes a great deal of effort to stop myself from falling asleep. As it doesn't pull the viewers attention from get go into the plot of the movie. The plot materializes about 40 minutes into the movie. Uptill then what you may ask, transpires in the movie? Nonsense. Unnecessary character arcs which don't contribute at all to the main plot of the movie.**********************

181,tastingthestars,Better than the first,8,13 July 2021,I think what really made this movie pop for me was the acting. Good performances all around.I also like that it focused less on the supernatural aspects of the storyline and more on the kills. Reminded me a bit of Friday the 13th in that aspect?I think it was just less boring than the first and more action packed.Excited for the next movie!,Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
182,averylubocki,A Huge Improvement,7,10 July 2021,"Coming from someone who didn't really like the first film, Part 2 is a huge upgrade. I was entertained throughout the entire movie, where as the first film was making me check my watch. The two leads are very likeable and the performances from the both of them were fantastic. There were plenty of cool kills and wicked amounts of gore. We finally get to learn more about the curse on Shadyside, something I think we should have got in Part 1, and it's very interesting to watch unfold. Overall, Part 2 is a much better movie. If you liked the first one, you'll like this one! If you didn't like the first one, I would still recommend checking it out!",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

Sadie Sink also made this great. I am really taking a liking to having her in all of these different horror ventures. Hopefully she continues on in the film genre.1978 is run of the mill mostly but as I said, executed very well. It ties into the main storyline perfectly and I REALLY loved the way this one ended.

185,kobrakai-1,"It's more of the same, and I'm not sure what else I expected.",4,11 July 2021,"This film shouldn't turn off any fans of the previous movie, but I don't expect it to win over any new ones, either.Like '94, this film just has to cram as many songs from the time period into its first act as possible, but I will say at least it isn't done in quite as obnoxious a manner as it was the last time. This film also does a better job of getting the look of the 70s down, too, but it's still not perfect, as especially when it comes to how characters talk and act. That being said, the characters are the main improvement here overall. There's not much in the way of development, but at least there isn't a main character here that nearly kills their ex.On the downside, for as much as this movie wants to be like Friday the 13th and Sleepaway Camp, the overly polished look to this movie's direction just does not suit it very well. What makes those older films work is that they have a raw and gritty look and feel to them, which this film is sorely lacking. This film also suffers from an unnecessarily bloated running time and pacing problems. There's no reason a movie like this should clock in nearly at two hours.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

I've been missing them for quite a while and every once in a while something comes along that I'm impressed with. This is one of them. The first one I thought was good but I think this one had me on the edge of my seat a bit more. I like everything about it and it is very reminiscent of the slasher films of the '70s and '80s. I actually did think they nailed some of the seventies vibe especially with the hair styles. I look forward to the final installment but I probably will gravitate towards this decade as something about 1666 I can't really relate to lol. I hope they continue to make these as I just love them!,Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

But, overall, there were some things that made me absolutely mad:
1. The children at this camp poop through a hole in the ground DIRECTLY into this cave, and NOBODY ever found that, idk, weird? Well, I certainly did.2. The scene in the mall. Like, okay, the mall was built on the campside. But the hand is buried not even a meter deep there? Are u kidding me?!3. Nobody ever noticed the gigantic cave system underneath the dining hall?

If this was the first installment, I wouldn't have been so interested in watching a part two.First of all, part one had more of a story than the second which was purely out for ""fun"" (gore) to an extent that it became too cliche.Secondly, part one kept me guessing. I'm not the type that usually roots for anyone in a movie moreso,in a horror movie but then I still have what I like to call my favorites and I had more of that with the first part than with the second because like I said,it became too cliche I almost stopped caring about anybody.

196,mlwcsc,"Better than the first one, but...",8,12 July 2021,"I agree with the others that say that this one was better than the first. There was however one thing that really hampered my enjoyment of the movie and that was the fact that it spoiled its own ending. Not only did the first movie pretty much explain the ending of this one in details, but in case anyone had forgotten about that, this movie starts out with one of the first scenes recapping it.It is often pretty obvious which characters are gonna be the ones surviving in these kinds of movies, but it is something entirely different to actually know not only which characters are gonna survive, but also have a pretty good idea of how they're gonna survive and that ultimately the evil is gonna win since it is the same evil as in the first movie, which takes place after this one.To go into more spoiler details, we're told only one of the sisters survive and we're told she survives by dying and then having her heart restarted. We also know that the final attempt at vanquishing the evil is going to fail because we know that the body isn't where they expect it to be because we have seen where it is in the first movie.These things unfortunately means that there aren't really any stakes in the movie, because the outcome is known from the beginning.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

With a year being part of the title, I do think it's important to reflect the time that you're referencing. Where the first movie failed miserably at this, I feel part 2 does significantly as securing its place as a time piece.Reflecting the vibe of the Old Friday the 13th movies, it gives a classic slasher fueled performance that continuously adds to the story that was presented in part 1. It has great definitive moments peppered throughout, and although it doesn't have a ""Standout Kill"" like part 1 does...you're not waiting for an Hour and a Half for fantastic moments to happen.Between the vibe, the kills, and the additions to the story.

I did like the characters and thought they were written much better, and I really did feel sad at some characters deaths (which is more than I can say for the first movie). However, one issue I had with this movie was how confusing it was to be told in reverse. I felt a bit underwhelmed at some of the scenes because I knew what was going to happen.

207,justinleblanc59,Almost as bad as the first film with less gore,5,9 July 2021,"I am not quite sure how to feel about the 2nd one.I did enjoy the camp atmosphere, but felt that I didnt get a full on late 70s-80s vibe aside from the music; which also was stellar in the first one.Just like the first, i wasn't too invested in the characters, aside from the 2 sisters, which got me only liking the good-too shoes sister towards the last 20 minutes.The acting was a bit too cheesy at times. Originally I had thought they were momicking how the acting culture was back then, but I think it boils down to a poor written script.This also includes the moments where certain characters are placed so convenietly at the right place all the time seemed a bit far fetched.The story of of Sarah Fier isn't all that intriguing, as im not a fan of with / salem plots, but at the end im commited to see how the 3rd part plays out.The killings......The killings of the shady siders / sunnyvalers were well done in the first one, which made it manageble to watch, as it had gruesome death scenes with added parts of creativity ( the ham / bread slicer from part one, woah!)Unfortunately the 2nd one fails to add that same entertainment, as these ax killings were mild and lame, some were even comical.I dont know what they were attempting with these films to be honest. I get that the Goosebumps tv series looking back now, weren't as good as when i saw them back then, because well what worked in the 90s, absolutely doesn't work now.This is why i struggle to sense what audiance they were gling for here. If you wanted to capture the 90s era audiances you would have made a more serious film - the gruesomeness in the first one added to this point.However if you were targeting younger teenage kids, they also missed the point, as I imagine teenagers wouldn't put up with the cheesy acting and far fetched story telling.Perhaps i criticised a film too seriously that wasn't meant to be taken seriously. Perhaps the trailer overhyped me and my expectations were set too high.Either way the film is what it is and the story has its originality too it - I just wont be caring 6 months from now - unless the 3rd installment surprizes the hell out of me.These films are a mix between the worst versions of scary stories to tell in the dark ( which wasn't great either ) and a really bad stranger things ( which one of the actors play in here as well.) And you get fear street - some books shouldnt be made into films - apllaud at the effort of seeing an RL Stine novel on the big screen ( or u know the tv in my room) but scratch my head in the thought process of doing so.Part 2 gets a 5/10 or a 2.6 / 5.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

I love how they switched from part one to part two, it was so perfect that there was no plothole like the story was consistent throughtout so everything made complete sense unlike the first where a lot of things happened and we were still trying to understand the story and appreciate the characters. It felt like a true RL Stine work i mean considering the thrill and the adventure and the storytelling style which made it much more entertaining to watch and also enabled viewers to connect more with the characters themselves. These were missing in the part one so i didn't find that one interesting. Part 2 on the other hand blew my mindmSo in conclusion they nailed this one.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

214,odmorales,This one was better,7,12 July 2021,"I'm glad that I gave this one a chance. I was a bit afraid not liking it, especially when the 1994 wasn't good.The premise to 1978 is about the same as the first: teenagers trying to figure out what's going on this town, instead it takes place in Camp Nightwing. What made it interesting is that they didn't give you boring characters, still they had their annoying moments but it was an improvement compared the two leads that kept bickering at each other in part 1. Obviously, the director/writer enjoys adding some homage, especially the resemblance towards The Burning, Sleepaway Camp, and you can't forget, Friday the 13th. It's fun seeing kills, but it wasn't as creative to the first. They definitely held back, but it was fun nonetheless. What they still lack in is trying to build some intensity to their scenes. Friday the 13th franchise is known for the crazy kills, dumb dialogue, nudity, gore; although, they knew how to build suspense. Maybe, the director should start learning how to play with the audience, try, you know, scare the audience. Its possible to terrify the audience even though horror fanatics become desensitized. Because the ""I gotcha"" feeling can be pulled off. Another thing, they need to avoid adding nostalgia music. It's fine to add music here and there, but it becomes tiring when it's one after another. Becomes unnecessary to add a song that doesn't mesh well with the scene. It's understandable that they're being nostalgic, and letting audiences know that they're in a certain decade, but it's annoying and they need to stop. Please.Well, it was fun watching the movie, it totally surprised me. I am self aware that there's another chapter/part, and I can't wait.

The music is toooooo much, it's like those ones added to silent black and white films. Part2 is worse than part1 on that perspective.And it's just basic formulated music for horror...easiest kind of music to make, tons of plugins for this.There're scenes obviously better without music, visually it's just enough and then there's redundant music.Well I know theoretically the purpose of this kind of auditory design is to make things unreal, so I guess this is a horror movie trying not to make audiences horrified-just blood gore swearing drugs for teenagers.But I think I'm still gonna watch part3 lol, that's sad.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

222,NinjaXCV,Grown up version of Goosebumps,1,13 July 2021,"This movie is for those who grew up on Goosebumps movies but aren't ready for real horror movies yet. Its basically a simple Goosebumps plot with the addition of drugs and cuss words. Too racy for kids, too simple for adults. They use every horror cliche in the book. There are never any adults around until after everything has happened, then the adults never believe them. Classic Goosebumps cliche. *SPOILER ALERT* how do you have a conversation with your sister while you're getting bludgeoned in the chest with an ax? And why do the toilets in the outhouse lead to a maze of caves? Who poops into a cave? Is this supposed to be 1978 or 1578? And why are all the floor vents connected to the poopy cave? (I'm sure that makes the whole camp smell nice) Its too convenient of a plot point. The movie is all convenience and cliches. No tension, just quick kills.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

224,yoshinaruto,A slight improvement,7,13 July 2021,"The first entry of the Fear Street trilogy was a mixed bag for me, and for the most part the sequel at least makes for a more consistent watch. This one doesn't have as many standout scenes like the first one (mall and supermarket scenes), but it's better in other areas.The jarring tonal shifts between light/humorous and horror from the first film are mostly fixed here. Once the kills start up they don't really take the time to make out of place jokes. Everything flows a lot better here.The constantly shifting music is also a bit better here. The still play numerous songs from the time period, but there's some room for each one to breathe instead of playing another one every five seconds like the first.I'd say I liked the characters here a bit more as well. Perhaps the supporting cast is weaker, but I liked the sisters more than Deena and Sam. The pacing is improved, and the kills are more frequent (although nothing truly stands out unlike the bread slicer from Part 1).It's not one of my favorite slashers of the last decade, but it's solid.

It is a slasher after all, isn't it ?).But finally a proper as hell horror movie without any propaganda was about time.I can easily see it as a standalone film for myself, because I think it can be watched more than once because of the camp parts.The weakest part of the movie was definitely the scenes of the actors in the previous part, so I had to deduct 1 point unfortunately, but I have to say that the story of 78 was almost perfect.Netfilx didn't push the hard stuff this time and managed to make a good film, and they even chose 2 nice looking girls for the 2 main roles.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

236,LeArgonaut,Equally as bad and nonsensical as the first,2,12 July 2021,"Another failed attempt at a romance/friendship movie. They again tried to make the main focal point the relationship of a bunch of annoying people that you never really have an interest in, and then throw invincible killers in the mix. Didn't work in the first one, and definitely doesn't work here. If they wouldve taken out all the dragged out scenes of people trying to build their relationships and share sob stories whilst be hunted by killers, it might have been okay up until the ending.But then the ending.... I mean I'm okay with throwing some logic out the window in a slasher, but that ending was too much. The girl got stabbed in the stomach like 5-10 times, and then some random kid revives her with CPR??? In what world could that possibly work? She didn't die of a heart attack or drowning. CPR would literally be pumping even more blood out of her. She would have died more. Absolute lunacy.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

239,coeluracat,Fun Little Watch,7,9 July 2021,"Having seen Fear Street Part 1 I did wonder if this one would basically be much of the same, but with a 70's music score. I was pleasantly surprised to find this one was better than Part 1.There is only so much that you can do in a slasher movie, that hasn't already been done. Normally there is minimal story line, lots of screaming and bloodshed and possibly a single survivor at the end - no spoilers there. This 2nd instalment is set in a 'Summer Camp', so quite reminiscent of Friday the 13th, only this time the addition of the kids makes for more blood spillage.The thread of story line woven through the trilogy keeps you hooked, as you learn a little more each time. It's also interesting in the way that the story is in reverse, instead of starting at the beginning.The acting was really quite good, given the ages of those starring. Far better than some I have seen lately where teens have been played by twenty/thirty somethings who are so wooden and stilted they are painful to watch.My one big gripe is that I know filming at night is supposed to make it more frightening and to build up tension but that fails completely when the audience can't see a thing or barely glimpses what is happening.If you are into the old 'slasher' type movies you will probably find it entertaining, for younger viewers, expecting the big production CGI horror, it will no doubt be underwhelming.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

241,gyounce,Much better than Part 1!!,6,20 July 2021,"I cannot tell you how much better 1978 is than 1994. I actually cred about the characters, since they actually had character development. The story itself was way better. It felt like an actual plot and not a quick concept. Things that happened actually made sense and deaths seemed more realistic and freightening. I actually enjoyed watching the story unfold and for once, cared to remember what was said about Sarah and the curse.The bad side is that the movie is a bit more older teeanager/young adult oriented. More violence, more gore, more scenes and nudity comes along (albeit briefly). Even with the added ""mature"" content, this was a way better watch. To be honest, if it had not been for the turn around in this movie, I wouldn't have watched part 3.If part 1 off put you, give part 2 a try, its actually an enjoyable movie on it's own.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

The movie was able to gain some suspense during the shocking scenes, but flat lined after a few of the scenes. The killing was almost repetitive and really worked against the suspense.You actually were able to like some of the characters compared to the first.The ending was still dumb like the first one because the main character was way beyond living or being revived with CPR.They still relied on a bunch of music to show the time period, but was used more creatively than the first.I feel like the movie really improved upon the story and twists which kept me more entertained than the first one.

Also some great kills, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and felt invested in the main characters too. Not like in part 1 with Deena being super annoying. Splitting the story into 3 parts is a very smart choice in my opinion, the built up and lore is tense and meaningful. And one can't wait for part 3, really looking forward to seeing all main characters returning.If you're a fan of the books or slashers in general you must see this movie, trust me.

The vibe and feel for the late 70's was still a bit off, but not as much as Part 1. It was the little details that were missing, for example, where was the iconic BIG hair from the 70's? As for the music, it was a nice touch and used better throughout the movie. Acting was pretty decent, especially that of Ziggy, the main characte. As for the story itself, it felt more straightforward and to the point than Part 1. All in all it was an improvement on the previous movie.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

253,mehdiscott,Better than i expected,8,11 July 2021,"After a fairly successful game which pays a nice tribute to the 90's Slasher. The sequel continues unabated, being more solid than its predecessor. No doubt because here, the homage paid to the genre focuses only on one film in particular ... Friday the 13th.It works really well, the feature does not forget what happened at the end of the first part. But he offers something else here, with an atmosphere specific to what was once one of the most iconic Slasher of the 80's, with the famous mitten croque, Jason Vorhees. The inspiration comes mostly from Steve Miner's Friday the 13th Part 2.Well then, the film also retains stereotypes (like Part 1) related to the Slasher period. But I found everything to work much better, especially the characters of Ziggy (played by the awesome Sadie Sink ... Stranger Things) or even Cindy (Emily Rudd) and Alice (Ryan Simpkins). Who are each fighting in their own way against a certain fatality, due to their past and what will happen.The characters go much better than those of Part 1. On the gore side, we are also well served (especially the first murder) with this macabre atmosphere. It feels like coming back to the Crystal Lake camp. The 70's influenced soundtrack works well, even if the titles are STRONGLY popular, including one that referred me to the Supernatural series (15 years of summary for the last episode ^^).This second part is therefore more successful, especially because more digestible in its influence (focus on a particular film) but also on the place set up which remains a much more ... fun hunting ground, and the characters who are more endearing and are very well interpreted.Quite anxious to see how everything will end, but especially what influence will have the 3rd part, knowing that it takes place in 1666.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

257,JackWeyland,Definitely way better than part 1,6,28 August 2021,"First off, the acting was a lot better than the acting in part 1. The characters were way more likable and maybe more relatable as well when compared to the first movie. They also fixed the pacing issue for the most part. The movie was still very predictable, but it surprised me more than the 1st one ever did. However, I feel like this movie was much more cliché than part 1. You can tell they took a lot of inspiration from Friday the 13th, which is fine, but they took several moments right from the series. I think another major problem they (mostly) fixed is the music. There are still a ton of music changes to try and set the time period, but many of those changes were at least also happening in universe. (Through a radio or something else) It was still very lacking at building up suspense, especially since you knew specific characters were going to live from the first movie. Personally, I thought the twist at the end of the movie was kind of stupid. Much like the first one, the girl at the end should've been WAY beyond resuscitation. The film had significantly less cheap jumpscares (11, as compared to the first movie's 28), which is always nice. The gore was pretty well done in this movie I think. And finally, there were still a few unnecessary scenes with intercourse, but you know how horror is these days.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

Sadie Sink is a right choice (I really like her a lot since she involved in Stranger Things).The acting is more fluid and less awkward.Good music choice (especially, The Blue Oyster Cult and Foghat).More Gory and it reminds me about 80s slasher movies.All costume is perfect to represent the 70s unlike the first one that failed represent the 90s.Bad things
There is minor plot hole when Sheila passed out after Ziggy punched her. Is she survive or not?At some point I can clearly see bad editing mostly when Ziggy and Nick talk each other.When Ziggy stabbed by one of the killers, why the hell she's survive?

After seeing part two however, I can say that it is a huge improvement and is now one of my favourite slasher movies! Ive read some reviews which state that the characters are unlikeable - I do have to agree that some of them started off that way but as the film progressed, I found myself caring about them and whether they lived or died. The gore in this movie is also a step up from the previous effort so if you're a gorehound like myself then you should be satisfied!",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
270,squirrelmagic,The thing about trilogies..,10,12 July 2021,"What i like about this series is that it was written and shot as a trilogy. As the story progresses we learn what's going on along with the characters and the greater narrative slowly teveeals itself.This one did flow and move better than the first , for one..anyone having seen the first film knows ..more or less .how this one will end ..but even with that there are still enough twists and turns to surprise youThe series also likes paying homage to classic for films which is fun but can be disapointing for fans of the original series to which very little refers to.. Sarah Fier and Shadyside are as far as they go and the series could've easily added more references or Easter eggs for fans.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
271,jeff-brewer,"Enjoyable, And Better Than Part One",6,9 July 2021,"I know I am not the target audience for this film, as I was born in the late 60's, but the period, setting, and genre are right in my wheelhouse.I wasn't quite old enough to see the original Halloween and Friday the 13th in cinemas on first release, but I certainly watched them as soon as I could after the fact (on home video for both, actually). Both of these movies really scared the crap out of me, but I loved them at the same time.""Stranger Things"" really brought back the nostalgia for when I was growing up - I had four close friend (three boys, and one girl), and we were all Uber geeks, with great imaginations. I can see us reflected in each of the main characters of the first season, without the actual supernatural stuff.This instalment of Fear Street also has nostalgia feels for me. It took me right back to the Friday the 13th franchise, or, at least, the original trilogy.This film is not a masterpiece, and is not an accurate reflection of the '70s, but it is enjoyable as a popcorn movie, and is a substantial improvement over part one.As others have said, the cast from the scenes set in '78 are all excellent.I find myself now eagerly anticipating the next film in the series. I assume this is the finale, as I never read any of the R. L. Stein books - I think I was just the wrong age when they were popular, and had started reading Stephen King, etc, around that time - but I understand there were at least five about ""Fewr Street""?!?Also, is it just me, or was anyone else looking for a steel rebar whenever they played ""Carry On, My Wayward Son"" (I'm not even sure if that is the correct title for this piece)? I know it was written in the '70s, but I will always associate this music with ""Supernatural"".... :)Cheers,",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

Expertly, and appropriately, derivative of previous classics while cleverly weaving its own unique storyline into the mix...the ending only adds to the intrigue. Solid enough acting with decent character development. Excellent horror films are rare indeed, and need to be acknowledged. This one gets it.

Anyone complaining just didn't get the nostalgia they're looking for, and the point is with any movie and show...YOU AREN'T SUPPOSED TO. Nothing will ever seem as good as when you were a kid or teen. Things that weren't even that good made you really happy when you were young. As a kid or teen your brain physically processes dopamine differently. Anything that made you happy probably made you way more happier than if you had experienced it with an adult brain. Seriously! Look back at a show you watched as a kid and you'll realize that as an adult it probably seems like junk. Anyways this movie was great and gory and intriguing. To me it was sorta cliche but fun like the actual fear street books. And I read those constantly in middle school! I don't know why people think fear street was some avant-garde horror book, lol the books were good but were made for kids. Don't take this movie as a something that's supposed to deliver horror you've never seen or experienced before. Its super fun and straight to the point.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

The background set in a 1970s Camp full of kids and the whole slasher theme combined with the witch story and the cave exploration looked really cool...
This part has more bloodshed and the C. Berman narrative fit really well to the story.. Also the annoying characters from part 1 were gone... A big relief...

284,WaltBishop,A Decent Upgrade to Part 1-,7,11 July 2021,"I am actually very surprised. Because after being extremely disappointed by the dumpster fire of Part1, I wasn't expecting a decent teen-slasher flick. This movie actually felt like it was taking place in the 70's. Story and acting was decent. So it appears that without Kiana Madeira and Olivia Welch's subpar and cringe acting, this can be an enjoyable franchise. I really wish they had given Maya Hawke the lead role in Part 1!",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
285,redzonia,Good turn around,7,14 July 2021,"If part one was inconsistent and odd, this one feels a lot more classic slasher. The story has a clear thread, the actors deliver and the 70s setting is way more on point.

286,washburneffect,What an upgrade,8,22 July 2021,This is what we want in a period piece horror film. Great 70s slasher. The acting is better and felt more realistic. What an upgrade to the awful first one.,Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
287,emmafaye-88211,Definitely an improvement,8,20 July 2021,"Much better than the first movie, the characters actually held interest to me and they had more dimension and personality to them. I personally enjoed Sadie Sink's character Ziggy as she had more realistic outsider characterization than Deena did. I feel as if they were trying to give Deena an outsider vibe but they didn't excute it successfully in the first film and did so with more success with Ziggy in Part 2. The story in my mind also just seemed more flushed out and more unique than the first one. Although things with Nick are finicky (you will understand after the third movie) i really did enjoy the chemistry between him and Ziggy as well as the sisterhood between Ziggy and Cindy. All in all a decent film and probably the best out of the three movies.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

291,urizennz,Nostalgia alone doesn't make a good movie,3,11 July 2021,"The first one was bad. Had very little story to a full on teen drama that didn't made any sense. This second title does barely any better: still we get more teenage drama, relationships that don't matter at the end of the story, no consequences, characters devolve instead of actually learning something with the situation they're put through.Such a waste of potential of being an actual good curse story, now only with a chapter left to clean all this mess (or bury it deeper, if it goes where it hints it's going).",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
292,biapanduru,Much better than part 1,8,12 July 2021,"This movie was more intriguing, the plot made more sense and the characters were more interesting.

293,zjcuda-68847,Lazy,3,25 July 2021,The writing is lazy. Obviously we cant expect everything to follow fact in a movie but simple stuff like being able to save somones life with cpr after the person died of blood loss without an instant blood transfusion is moronic and takes a simple google search.

Characters were far better and more likeable.Most importantly, it was a lot scarier. I felt really tense watching it the whole time.

It is an enjoyable movie and if you don't have high expectations than you won't be disappointed.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
303,cv5404,So much better,7,19 July 2021,This one was it. Music was great. This looked more 70s than the other did 90s. Sure hairstyles weren't the same and clothes were a little bland but nothing besides the bombardment of music showed us the last was 94. Acting was way better in this one as well. Can we just talk about that closing scene with Cindy and Ziggy like damn did that hit hard that's when I knew the movie did it's job of making likable characters. Since it won't have nostalgia tropes to rely on I'm looking forward to 1666 as more of a story based suspense than the horror slasher we had in the first two films. Let's see how this started and end(?) this thing.,Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
304,martinrande,That's More Like It,8,20 July 2021,"So much better than the first film, mainly because of the acting ability of the two leading ladies. Whilst the character's in the first movie were just irritating, I really enjoyed the chemistry between the main protagonists in this instalment. Yes it's basically a rehash of Friday the 13th, but that's exactly what I wanted. Quite depressed to read the third instalment involves the original film cast. Still if it sucks as badly as I suspect, at least the memory of the second film will have made it worth checking this trilogy out.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

306,gsellalexis,Just gets worse.,1,4 August 2021,"As the story progresses, yes we get more information and a larger story development, however the overall flow and focus of this story is completely lost. This second film shows clearly that the focus was to cater to a younger audience, the editing and overall cinematography came out very clean, but without a clear cut story line the whole message came out very messy towards the end. Not enough character development on sam in the original movie just keeps adding to what this whole series is lacking- a good overall storyline, why are we fighting so hard for her? It just doesn't make any sense.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

311,christinapol-42437,Well...,1,10 July 2021,"Arguably better than part 1 BUT still not good at all. It's a classic Netflix cinematic fast-food, targeted to a very (VERY) young audience.

312,minkhantnaing-19403,I really enjoyed it!,9,12 July 2021,This is a lot better than previous one.

314,ShesGotATicketToRide,Take It or Leave It,5,10 July 2021,"Mostly everyone can agree: better than the first but is not breaking any new horror movie boundaries.The villain in this movie was plain. A guy with an axe is as generic as you can get when it comes to horror movies bad guys. No where near as memorable as other slasher film stars like Jason Voorhees nor Michael Myers because Tommy Slater just doesn't have the ""it"" factor. You can argue that it's hard to create new horrifying movie icons after so many popular films before it, but Tommy Slater is as default as you can get. Surely if they can come up with an elaborate plot about a witch, they can give their villain a little more depth. I really don't know why I'm getting so passionate about this lmao.Though entertaining, I still found myself thinking of how a large portion of the film reminded me of other movies. Not to say that's entirely bad, but to say I wish it drifted from that pit of references.I liked the soundtrack, I liked the acting more than the first, but, like the title suggests, you can really take it or leave it.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

316,gameplaycom,Fear Street an Upgrade From Part 1,9,15 July 2021,"There are many things to say about Fear Street part two other than it's an upgrade. There is so much to like about this part over the first part one, such as the music isn't shoved down our throats and it placed well through the film nicely, and the main characters are likable. Even though Ziggy can come off as mean she adds to the story and it makes you want to keep watching. This part is more of a slasher than part one which is why it's better, it reminds me personally of Friday the 13th which many know of. One thing the directors got right is in this part is the clothing yes it's simple with t-shirts, and shorts are way better than what we got in the first part and feels more like it was actually made in the 70s. Something else that we got more of is the story of why Sara Fier, and why she put a curse on Shadyside. We also get a glimpse at the end of part three where Denna and her brother Josh go back to 1666 when the curse started with Sarah Fier. It's going to be interesting to see where the story ends up. It would be interesting to see all of the people that Sarah possed and the people they killed come back to life as normal people. Another thing I want to just point out is the chemigraphy work it is amazing and is well down especially at the end with Ziggy, and Cindy's ""death"". If there's anything you should take from this, it is that Fear Street Part Two is a must-watch for anyone trying to enjoy a 70s slasher, or trying to catch up on some horror movies.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

It wasn't sadly 70's at all tho. It was like modern kids trying to act like they're living in 70's.Long story short, don't expect too much but it's good, fun and gory.

341,tljdhondt,My opinion,7,17 July 2021,"Imo better then part one. In part two there was more development in the relations between the characters. In part one it felt a little rushed with some of them. The pacing was also better in part two. Also, the plot twist were much more fun. The movie sounds a bit stereotypical but it is fun to watch.Overall my top 3 ranking:
3. Part one
2. Part three (close)
1. Part two (close)",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
342,taylor_austin,Way better than Fear street 2021,7,19 July 2021,"Part one was absolute garbage and I wish deena downer didn't make it into part 2. 1978 is pretty good, just wish I would have skipped part one entirely.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
343,leilalymendoza,I really loved fear street: 1978,9,21 July 2021,I really like how this was filmed and the graphics where the shots that they made where amazing I also like how in part one fit into part two.

346,neehirvante,better than first movie.,6,4 August 2021,"Besides all the basic things in the movie, it was tottally better than the previous one. Sadie Sink's talent should be more appreciated. It is fun when you don't take it much seriously. Not bad.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
347,jasyriajones,Love! Action! Amazing! Thrilling!,10,10 August 2021,Love this whole trilogy. It's full of action and you'll enjoy this every second. This definitely should become a Tv show series!,Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
348,jaggerc-85172,much stronger,8,9 October 2021,There's still a little to many needle drops and they could've used a more 70's shooting style but it's still a big improvement from the first.,Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
349,yashc-56919,A good throwback,8,12 October 2021,This is probably the best one in the trilogy. It actually feels like the time period it's set in and every actor is giving a pretty strong performance.,Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
350,gingerbeetle,A few obnoxious clichés but not the worst,7,9 July 2021,"Fear Street Part Two: 1978 contains, among other things, a few of the hokey clichés from the original 70s/80s slashers. A few of them aren't well done but, overall, this movie is not the worst thing I've ever seen. I was a little disappointed in the first one -- I felt like it could have been executed better than it was -- but this one actually surprised me.From the acting to the script to the setting, it felt like a more complete world. Told in the format of a flashback, we come across the Berman sisters - occupants of a summer camp, there while their mother deals with the fallout and aftermath of her husband (their father) running off with a girl not too much older than Cindy Berman herself. It's an oddly heart-filled story in the murder of what you already know, going in, is going to be a slasher fic.Despite the heavy leaning on tropes in some scenes (the counselors sneaking off to have sex, getting murdered immediately after, one of them is a pot smoking hippie) it feels a little like a refreshing take on the slasher genre. The first Fear Street had a tribute to Scream, trying to honor the roots it was playing to.This one was absolutely a tribute to Friday the 13th.There are some scenes I didn't like, some editing that could have been done a little neater, and some moments of, ""Did they really just...?"" that we could have done without. (The only minorities besides the briefly seen main two characters from the first part are slaughtered without any sort of hesitance on the part of the directors.) Some of the scenes also felt a little too modern for the era this movie is set in, which is a problem Part One had as well.I was hoping for some in-depth understanding of what happened to Ruby Lane, the female slasher from the first movie, but we got to see her mother in this, who ends up being a driving force of the plot. Ruby herself does also show up briefly, looking like a fresh kill - this film is set only a handful of years after her story happened, after all. I can only hope, based on the projected outcome from the first part to this one, that the third movie is even better.Overall, not horrible. Not amazing, but not bad. Pop some popcorn, turn down the lights, enjoy the tropes.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
351,andycoverdale1,Even worse than part 1,1,11 July 2021,"Part 1 was bad, this one is worse, I'm not even gonna try part 3.These films add absolutely nothing to the slasher genre - don't bother wasting your time watching them - instead of part 1 watch Scream, and instead of part 2 watch Friday the 13th Final Chapter.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
352,iPaul-El,Way better than Part 1 and 3,7,17 July 2021,"Having watched all 3 parts, I can say Part 2 is by far the best out of the 3. Part 1 and 3 are both ruined by the protagonist and their relationship, in my opinion.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
353,budclay77-169-356386,"Fun to watch, not so convincing",8,27 July 2021,Loved it. What I do not understand is why these young people express themselves as those of this generation with those facial expressions typical of adolescents today ... they would have better emulated how they expressed themselves in the 90s and 70s ... the rest is very fun to watch.,Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
354,lynseyforrest-lf,Upgrade,8,10 July 2021,Enjoyed the 1st part but this part was so much better! Better story / acting.,Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

357,ybwenanit,Would give it a 10 but...,9,11 July 2021,Loving this series and can't wait for the next installment but I am pretty sure I found a goof. The maxi pads from the purse were individually wrapped in disposable wrappers that are common now but didn't exist until 1985.,Fear Street - Part Two - 1978

361,I_eat_short_people,"""Daddy Issues"", the trilogy.",5,2 August 2021,"The review title says it all.Still, this second movie is surely better than the first one. Not because it's good (although not really bad), but because it's honestly difficult to produce a worse movie than Part 1.",Fear Street - Part Two - 1978
