0,MartinHafer,This is a great film to watch with a box of Kleenex,8,21 December 2008,"This film is an odd one in my household. Although my wife is a rather famous romance writer, for once I actually liked a romantic film more than her. I think the reason for our divergent views is that in most romance novels, all the nice people get the love of their lives by the end of the film. However, in LOVE ACTUALLY, some do but others do not. So, if you need to have a romance where everything works out perfectly, this is NOT the film for you. However, if you are like me and don't mind a bit of ambiguity about the characters, then you are sure to love this film.This story is a complicated film where there are many different stories occurring at the same time just before Christmas. What ties this all together is that the various stories all relate to each other somehow. In other words, this film is about people and their friends also have separate stories that diverge. I rarely have seen this type of film work so well.I could spend a lot of time talking about all the plots but I won't bother. Part of this is because there isn't enough space here to adequately do it and part of it is because there are tons and tons of very thorough reviews already on IMDb for this film, so I don't want to plow familiar ground. Read these longer reviews if you are interested in a play-by-play analysis.Instead, understand that some of the romances work out perfectly, others are uncertain and others are heart-breakers--just like in real life. In fact, that's the beauty of this film. While you really can't believe all the plots (some are very, very far-fetched and silly), all the people talk like real people. And the romances are just so adorable and sweet you can't watch this film and keep a dry eye. Plus, in the cases where the romance fails, I liked them as well because they all had wonderful object lessons for us all.Amazingly acted, directed and written--this is one case where a popular film actually deserves all the hoopla. In the UK it's sold like a bazillion DVDs and I can see why.By the way, there were only two things about the film I did not particularly like. First, the Prime Minister's love interest (Natalie) was a lovely woman but repeatedly throughout the film they made fat jokes about her. This made no sense, as she was gorgeous and the comments tended to reinforce the stereotype that a beautiful woman must be stick-thin--like Keira Knightley. Even if she was overweight, which she wasn't, this is gross to say and the film made it seem cute or funny to do so (not just with her but with a Portuguese lady as well). She was curvy and even if these gross comments were true, women are supposed to have curves and not be anorexic!! Second, the scene where the little boy runs through security really, really annoyed me. In reality, the kid would have either been shot or arrested and the airport would have been shut down--yet the movie shows no consequences for this insanely stupid and selfish behavior. Neither problem ruined the film but they did detract from my enjoyment of an otherwise brilliant movie.",Love Actually
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Unshamedly sentimental, but a very well-done film!",9,13 May 2009,"Some parts of the movie are very sentimental, but Love Actually is a well-directed and well-acted film. The script is intelligent and funny, and while the story is a little confusing, as there are so many characters, I highly recommend this. The direction by Richard Curtis is very good and well paced. I think the film's main strengths are the acting and the well-developed characters. The standout is Bill Nighy, in an unlikely but actually hilarious role. Though Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are very good as well, in one of the more interesting stories. There is also Laura Linney and Liam Neeson, two talented actors, if you see the two of them in Kinsey you'll know what I mean. Keira Knightly, Hugh Grant and Kris Marshall also delight. In conclusion, look out for this film. I was annoyed a bit by Rowan Atkinson, but I really like this. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Love Actually
2,Leofwine_draca,Pretty good,6,18 September 2021,"This wasn't so bad; it has a warm and fuzzy feel to it and I can see why it's so popular. The writing is of a better quality than expected although the odd casting choices go for popularity rather than talent, so I could have done without Nighy, Grant et al.",Love Actually
3,SnoopyStyle,Sometimes good but too many insipid stories,5,14 December 2013,"It's a multi-storyline movie about love. It opens on an airport arrival. It's a promising start. At least, it's a rare place to start, and it's a great place for love and reunion. Then it goes on to talk about 9-11. The calls from the people are almost always one of love rather than hate. It's a heighten call to action for a simple rom-com. They want to show that love is most powerful emotion.I like some of the stories. Mostly I found them formulaic and nothing original. However I am profoundly distracted by Hugh Grant as the bachelor Prime Minister. He is still playing the same character as his other movies which makes the Prime Minister too silly. For a movie with such a vast cast, there must be somebody more fitting to be the PM.The saddest thing about this movie is that it may have inspired more of these multi-storyline love stories. Only they are getting more and more insipid. If a love story is good enough, it should be able to fill a whole movie.",Love Actually
4,Prismark10,Smug Actually,4,25 December 2018,"Sugar, syruppy, a contrived bawdy romantic comedy for Christmas with paper this characterisation an none of it ever rings true.Set in London in the run up to Christmas, we see a range of characters all linked to each other in some way.The newly elected Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) falls for his teal lady Natalie (Martine McCutcheon) and when the President of the USA fondles of her, he loses his cool and stands up to the US President.Karen (Emma Thompson) is the Prime Minister's sister. When she finds out that her husband Harry (Alan Rickman) has bought an expensive gift for someone else she is heartbroken. Harry has had his head turned by their open flirting of his secretary.Grieving widow Daniel (Liam Neeson) gets to bond with his stepson Sam after the death of his wife. Young Sam fancies a girl in his school who is flying out to America soon.Colin is a friend of a film production assistant who flies off to America to find love, he goes straight to a bar and scores because of his English accent.Swirling in all these and other stories is veteran wild living singer Billy Mack (Billy Nighy) attempting a comeback by releasing a Christmas single.Richard Curtis inspired by Robert Altman has thrown a confection together some of it sticks better than others but a few of the segments just look creepy. The two body doubles in what increasingly looks like a porn film is not funny. The best man at a wedding who always fancied the bride comes close to being a marriage wrecker.I did find that the film's sickliness and tawdriness works better at Christmas.",Love Actually
5,claudio_carvalho,Delightfull Homage to Love,9,29 May 2005,"In London, from five weeks before Christmas up to a month after Christmas, the lives of different persons are linked by love. The Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) and the member of his household, Natalie (Martine McCutcheon); his sister Karen (Emma Thompson), her husband Harry (Alam Rickman) and Harry's secretary, Mia (Heike Makatsch); Harry's employees, Sarah (Laura Linney), a woman with a serious problem in her life, and the designer Karl (Rodrigo Santoro); the writer Jamie Bennett (Colin Firth) and his Portuguese maid Aurélia (Lúcia Moniz); the grieving widow Daniel (Liam Neeson) and his son, Sam; a porn actress and her colleague; the singer Billy Mack (Billy Nighy) and his manager; the just married couple Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Juliet (Keira Knightley) and their best man Mark (Andrew Lincoln); a British young man that travels to USA, trying to score women in that country. ""Love Actually"" is a delightful homage to love. There are different situations, some of them dramatic, others funny, sometimes touching but never corny. The interconnection of the stories has a perfect timing. The cast is a constellation, highlighting the shining beauty of Keira Knightley and the nice role of Hugh Grant. There are many wonderful moments, such as the collective interview of the Prime Minister and the American president; or the moment when Karen finds that her Christmas gift is a CD of Joni Mitchell; or when Mark declares his secret love for Juliet; or the relationship of Daniel and Sam; or when Daniel meets Carol; or when the manager of Billy makes a comment about Elton John; or the narration in off in the beginning of the movie. I believe I could list many other magnificent moments, but better off the reader of my review rent or buy the DVD and have a good time. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Simplesmente Amor"" (""Simply Love"")",Love Actually
6,kosmasp,Blue-Print,9,21 July 2009,"There are some romantic comedies that could be used as a blueprint. Or maybe some directors should just watch them, before they bring out their bog standard version of ""man loves woman"" and vice versa. This episodic tale of ... well ""Love actually"", has great actors in it (Bill Nighy, Keira Nightly and so forth), that make the most of even small stories and screen time.While this set around Christmas time, this is also a hint, that you shouldn't take the movie too seriously. The romantic factor in the stories works and every kind of love gets a stab at. It is a feel-good movie, a movie that speaks to the heart and actually achieves to send this message (again, too many shallow rom-coms, not here/this one though!)! I'm cynical too, but sometimes it's nice to have movie, that shows you what different meanings love can have and how love is perceived by different individuals!",Love Actually
7,gavin6942,More Than a Christmas Movie,7,7 March 2016,"Follows the lives of eight very different couples in dealing with their love lives in various loosely interrelated tales all set during a frantic month before Christmas in London, England.This movie tries to pass itself off as a Christmas movie. And I suppose it is, at least as much as ""Die Hard"". But it is really something more and can be watched at any time (I watched it in March). This is a great script with characters who cross paths in unexpected ways. Yes, it is a story of love, but it is also just a good story.What was most interesting was waiting until now (2016) to see it. At the time it came out, Andrew Lincoln was (I believe) largely unknown. And now with ""The Walking Dead"", he is an international star. Seeing him in this role is such a treat, especially considering how rarely we hear him use his real voice.",Love Actually
8,jboothmillard,Love Actually,5,12 September 2005,"This was the directorial debut of writer Richard Curtis (Blackadder, The Vicar of Dibley, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill), originally titled ""Love Actually Is All Around"", referencing the Wet Wet Wet song ""Love Is All Around"" (Number One for 15 weeks), this was shortened, and many people regard it as their favourite Christmas movie. Basically it is an ensemble cast delving into nine (or ten) separate stories involving a variety of characters and their experiences of love, falling in and out and trying to find love, all played out over the week fives, leading up to Christmas. Rock and roll legend Billy Mack (BAFTA winning Bill Nighy) has recorded ""Christmas Is All Around"", a variation of ""Love Is All Around"", he and his longtime manager Joe (Rab C. Nesbitt's Gregor Fisher) know the song is terrible, but are promoting it as much as possible in hope that it will become Christmas Number One, they are successful, but Billy leaves a party with Sir Elton John to spend time with Joe to celebrate getting drunk and watching porn. Juliet (Keira Knightley) and Peter (12 Years a Slave's Chiwetel Ejiofor) get married, best man Mark (The Walking Dead's Andrew Lincoln) orchestrates and videotapes it, one day Juliet asks Mark for footage of her in the wedding dress, as she watches the video she realises it is all focused on her, Mark has been in love with her for ages and never said anything, it is only on Christmas Eve, through cue cards, he confesses his love for Juliet, as he walks away she gives him an innocent kiss, and this is the end to it. Writer Jamie (Colin Firth) is devastated after finding out his girlfriend (Sienna Guillory) has been cheating on him with his brother, Jamie retreats to his French cottage to continue writing, there Protugese housekeeper Aurélia (Lúcia Moniz) helps him, she can only speak her native language, but they form a close bond, Jamie realises after she leaves he has developed feelings for Aurélia, so he learns (roughly) Portugese, returns to France, finds her, declares his love and proposes, in English, she accepts and they kiss. Harry (Alan Rickman) is the managing director of a design agency, he is married to Karen (BAFTA nominated Emma Thompson) with two children, Harry is attracted to new secretary Mia (Resident Evil's Heike Makatsch) who makes arousing sexual comments, while shopping he attempts to buy her a necklace, but is slowed down by obsessive attention to detail gift-wrapping salesman Rufus (Rowan Atkinson) and stops himself getting caught by Karen, however she finds out about the necklace, after he did buy it, but is heartbroken when she does not receive it, she confronts Harry, he apologises for being a fool, she knows their marriage will not be the same. David (Hugh Grant), Karen's brother, has been elected Prime Minister, junior member of the household staff Natalie (EastEnders' Martine McCuthcheon) is also new at 10 Downing Street, David feels a spark between them, and hates that people think she is chubby, he also asserts himself when the President of the United States (Billy Bob Thornton) seems to make an inappropriate move on Natalie, he moves her to a new position to end this distraction, but seeing how affectionate towards him, especially in a Christmas card, David goes to find Natalie, they go together to the local Christmas Eve school play, they try to avoid being seen, but are caught out kissing by everyone when the curtain rises to reveal them onstage. Daniel (Liam Neeson), Karen's friend, has mourned the death of his wife Joanna, he raises his stepson Sam (Thomas Sangster) alone, Sam has fallen for an American girl at school, also named Joanna (Olivia Olson), he wants to get her to notice him, so learns the drums to join the band for the Christmas play, Sam feels like he failed to impress her, but Daniel convinces him to see Joanna before she boards the plane to America, Daniel (who mentions supermodel Claudia Schiffer earlier in the film) briefly meets another parent, Carol (Claudia Schiffer), there is a momentary spark, Sam manages to get away from airport security and see Joanna, she kisses him before leaving, Sam and Daniel hug in happiness. Sarah (Laura Linney) who works at Harry's graphic design company has been in love with creative director Karl (Rodrigo Santoro) for years, they finally get together, but are interrupted by her mentally ill brother Michael (Michael Fitzgerald), who constantly phones from his residence in a mental care facility, Karl tries to say something on Christmas Eve, but cannot, so Sarah spends the night with her brother. Colin (My Family's Kris Marshall) has made many failed attempts to woo British girls, including Mia and wedding caterer Nancy (Julia Davis), he tells his friend Tony (Abdul Salis) he is going to America to find love there, convinced foreign girls love British men, Tony thinks it is a stupid idea, but once in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Colin meets three stunningly attractive women, Stacey (Ivana Miličević), Jeannie (American Pie: The Wedding's January Jones) and Carol-Anne (The Girl Next Door's Elisha Cuthbert), who invite him to their house, and roommate Harriet (Shannon Elizabeth) joins also. John (Martin Freeman) and Judy (Gavin & Stacey's Joanna Page) are professional body doubles for films, they talk to each other whilst filming nude simulated sex scenes, they carefully pursue a relationship. Many of the characters are brought together at Heathrow Airport, with real arrivals and the song ""God Only Knows"" by The Beach Boys playing. It does make you laugh, it's cheesy and schmaltzy, but it is a nice simple seasonal romantic comedy. It was nominated the BAFTAs for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and Best Screenplay. It was number 90 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for Emma Thompson's cry in the bedroom, and it was 77 on The Ultimate Film. Worth watching!",Love Actually
9,Tweekums,Many intertwining love stories in post millennium London,8,8 November 2014,"This romantic comedy follows several interconnected couples in the five weeks running up to Christmas; each is very different and not all are romantic love. We have the newly elected prime minister finding love with a member of his staff; his sister whose marriage could be in danger when another woman catches the eye of her husband; a widower whose young son has fallen in love with a girl in his class; a writer who falls for his Portuguese maid despite the fact that they can't understand each other; a single man who believes that if he goes to America women will throw themselves at him; a couple of porn actors; a man who loves his best friend's new wife and a few others besides.Over the course of the film we move between the characters, dipping in and out of their lives as their relationships develop or don't. Don't expect realism; this is after all a comedy not a study of real relationships or situations. It is however a lot of fun and will probably leave most viewers grinning from ear to ear thanks to the feel-good stories; even if they seem to include every cliché possible! The cast includes a wide array of British acting talent including rom-com regulars Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. They all put in fine performances although some inevitably stand out; Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson were great as a couple whose marriage might be about to go through a rough patch and Bill Nighy was hilarious as the aging rocker who has recorded a Christmas single; he knows it is awful and is happy to tell everybody. There is some swearing and nudity but if that doesn't offend you this is an enjoyable film just the thing to watch on Christmas if you've had enough of 'Die Hard'!",Love Actually
10,BA_Harrison,"No chainsaw wielding maniacs, but still very enjoyable.",8,26 December 2007,"At Christmas, even an out-and-out hardcore horror freak like me occasionally puts the blood 'n' guts goes on hold for something a little lighter and more heart warming. And they don't come much more fluffy and saccharine sweet than Love Actually (which I'm squeezing in between a Dario Argento giallo and a trashy Pete Walker slasher).Director Richard Curtis delivers a series of cleverly written tales about the trials and tribulations of love, covering the many facets of the subject: unrequited love, platonic love, adulterous love, young love, spontaneous love, dangerous love. Always chuckle-some, occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, but never boring, Curtis's sparkling script brings us a collection of likable characters who are brilliantly brought to life by an amazing ensemble cast, which includes Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Keira Knightley, Bill Nighy, Alan Rickman, Martine McCutcheon, Rowan Atkinson, Liam Neeson, and Billy Bob Thornton, plus brief cameos from, amongst others, Michael Parkinson, Ant and Dec, Elisha Cuthbert, Claudia Schiffer, Shannon Elizabeth and Denise Richards.Nighy, in particular, shines as a has-been rocker vying for the Xmas No.1 spot, giving a bittersweet take on the whole romance schtick, as does Laura Linney who plays Sarah, a woman whose love for her brother costs her the chance of scoring with her dream man. On the more traditionally 'sappy' side of things, Grant's Prime Minister falling for working class cutie McCutcheon borders on fantasy, but is perfect viewing fodder for couples curled up in each other's arms on the couch.Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll get back to the wanton slaughter of buxom women before I find myself hooked on rom-coms!",Love Actually
11,blanche-2,Enjoyable holiday film,8,16 November 2007,"Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Laura Linney and Colin Firth all experience ""Love Actually,"" a shortened form of a phrase, ""love actually is all around,"" as stated by Hugh Grant in the opening narration. This 2003 film, well directed by Richard Curtis, isn't a typical romantic comedy. It concerns all kinds of love...and while love actually is all around, sometimes things don't work out as we hoped.As you might guess from the formidable list of stars, the film is somewhat episodic. Liam Neeson plays a man who has just lost his wife and now has to deal with his withdrawn son; Laura Linney is an assistant in love with her boss, but personal problems get in the way; Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson are a long married couple, and now he finds himself being seduced by an office tramp; Hugh Grant is the new prime minister who falls for someone on his staff...etc. There are some adorable stories: Neeson and his son plotting to get a goddess to notice the boy at school...hilarious stories: Bill Nighy as a washed up singer who promotes one of his old songs that has been changed with Christmas lyrics; a young man who can't get a date is sure if he goes to America, his accent will bring in women by the droves; and some sadness - something for everyone. What hooks all the stories together is the theme of love.There is a good deal of fantasy in the film - it's meant to be fun, light and sweet, and it succeeds. I didn't read the other reviews, but from some of the posters, I gather there were viewers who wanted something deeper. For me it's always best to take a film as intended and not wish for more. Surely Curtis had no expectation of heavy-duty story and character development when he utilized so many stories. The great soundtrack adds to the festivities. It's an ultimate feel-good movie, and it's the favorite film of many, including the person who sent it to me as a gift.",Love Actually
12,Quinoa1984,A trusty cast and some good jokes make it an OK holiday time-filler...,8,22 November 2003,"Richard Curtis, from my perspective, deserves both panning and praise for his first film as a writer/director, Love Actually- it's loaded to the brim with nearly every kind of relationship/romance/infidelity convention you can think of, wedged into eight different couples intertwined together in merry old England.  However, having said that, I can't say I didn't have a bad time during Love Actually, and I didn't feel compelled to walk out or leave to go to the bathroom for a long stretch of time either.  What works about the movie are two things- the characters Curtis sets up and unfolds, to one degree or another in this definitely movie-movie universe, are believable, and surprisingly there is some interestingly dramatic elements thrown in here and there (particularly with Laura Linney, Liam Neeson- early on, and Emma Thompson).  The other thing is the cast, which includes the known likes of Linney, Neeson, Thompson, Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, and some charming work thrown in by lessor known actors like Kiera Knightly (who got a break during the summer with Curse of the Black Pearl), Martine McCutcheon, Lucia Moniz, Rodrigo Santoro, Thomas Sangster as the boy in love, and nice little cameos for Rowan Atkinson, Billy Bob Thornton, Shannon Elizabeth, etc.  The drawback to some of the performances and stories is that since the story jumps from one place to another, and since we can predict more or less where each character's destiny lies on Christmas Eve, there is maybe a little too much emphasis on the paths instead of a little more depth (outside of the dramatic input of course).  Plus, you can tell the film was not the kind of film released first in America and sold later to Europe.  Yet, like I said, the flaws may be moot to most movie-goers, because Curtis is just out to get the audience into having a good, escapist experience with these people, and the main and supporting players do what they can.  Also, as some other reviewers and commentators have noted, the show stopper is indeed Bill Nighy as Billy Mack, the aging, cynical rock star recording and selling a Christmas single on TV and Radio as the sort of background in the film. Along with being the funniest character of the lot, he ends up garnering some heartedness too by the climax.  I wouldn't bother seeing it again for a while, but I was glad I saw it in a packed audience-type of atmosphere. Grade: (strong) B",Love Actually
13,tavm,"After reading good reviews, I finally got to watch Love Actually and really enjoyed it!",8,16 December 2014,"After recently reading comments from posters on the tvguide.com site praise this movie, I decided to get this from Netflix to see for myself with my mom. Mom was a little put off by some of the nudity and adult humor though I remember laughing at much of those scenes. Not all funny scenes involved raunchy humor such as the one where Alan Rickman orders a necklace to be gift wrapped and Rowan Atkinson does quite a flourish on that to his consternation. Nice use of music too like ""All You Need is Love"" being performed at a wedding, ""Both Sides Now"" while Emma Thompson is crying, or ""God Only Knows"" at the ending scene. Oh, and a young girl performs a fine rendition of ""All I Want for Christmas is You"" at a pageant scene. All I'll say now is I liked Love Actually and I do recommend it.",Love Actually
14,sunwarrior13,A Terrific Film,10,23 September 2012,"Love Actually is a romantic comedy that features an ensemble cast that includes Hugh Grant,Liam Neeson,Colin Firth,Laura Linney,Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman,Keira Knightley,Martine McCutcheon,Bill Nighy and Rowan Atkinson.The screenplay delves into different aspects of love as shown through ten separate stories involving a wide variety of individuals, many of whom are shown to be interlinked as their tales progress. It was written and directed by Richard Curtis. The story involves more than a dozen main characters, each weaving his or her way into another's heart over the course of one particularly eventful Christmas. The seemingly perfect wedding of Juliet and Peter brings many of the principals together, including heartsick best man Mark, who harbors a very unrequited crush on Juliet. There's also recent widower Daniel, trying to help his lonely stepson Sam express his true feelings to a classmate. Across town, devoted working mother Karen tries to rekindle the passion of her husband, Harry, who secretly pines for a young colleague of his. In the same office, the lonely Sarah not-so- secretly pines for a man just a few desks away, who returns her affections but may not be able to dissuade her neuroses. Providing the unofficial soundtrack for all of the couples is an aging rocker who just wants to cash in and get laid -- but even he might find a meaningful relationship in the most unlikely of places.Despite of the many characters involved,this is a actually a terrific film.There is plenty of entertainment in this well acted ensemble comedy considering that it has created a joyful date movie that'll leave you with a smile on your face and an almost irresistible urge to hug somebody.A highly recommended romantic comedy.",Love Actually
15,studioAT,Comedy is all around,7,20 December 2010,Richard Curtis creates movie magic with this romantic comedy set at Christmas. He combines at least seven stories beautifully and introduces us to the same sort of manic and lovable people that we have become accustomed to in his other films.From ageing rock stars to the Prime Minister this film has it all. As with all of Curtis' comedies there is enough sap and sentiment to sink a ship but really at Christmas we want to be made to feel warm inside and this film certainly does that. Not all the stories work but the majority do in order to make this film an instant classic that can be watched every year at Christmas time.,Love Actually

17,hitchcockthelegend,God only knows what I'd be without you.,8,16 December 2009,"London, England, and it's the run up to Christmas, and we are in the company of a number of couples dealing with the joys and problems that love can bring.We open with a narration from Hugh Grant who tells us that when he is troubled by the hate in the world, he thinks of the arrivals area of Heathrow airport. A place where loved ones greet returning loved ones, a place that indeed showcases a strand of love in its joyous form. He further ventures that when the aeroplanes hit the twin towers on 9/11, as far as he knows, all those phone calls from those sadly involved were messages of love, not hate. Pertinent musings that although somewhat sombre for an opening, sets it up nicely for what Richard Curtis (writer and director) wants to say.A roll call of fine British and Irish actors, and American Laura Linney, lend their considerable talents to Curtis' ensemble piece. The structure is surprisingly simple considering the number of stories being woven together, the result being that there is sure to be a story in there to either love, or, yes, even hate. Is it sentimental? Of course. Is it as stuffed as a turkey on Xmas day? Naturally. Does it stretch credibility in some strands? For sure. But only the coldest of hearts could truly decry that Love Actually is all around. Very often it's funny too. Curtis, following on from writing credits such as Four Weddings And A Funeral, continues to show himself to be a very fine writer of comedy. None more so than with Bill Nighy's past his sell by date pop star, Billy Mack. There's something for everyone in here, indeed there's likely to be something that many can associate with.It's a lovely affecting film that should hopefully perk up those that get blue around the holiday season. With perceptive writing, some excellent acting (Nighy, Emma Thomson, Colin Firth et al) and a soundtrack of some worth, Love Actually is a winner. 8/10",Love Actually
18,jotix100,One wedding and one funeral.,7,22 November 2003,"This is a minor Richard Curtis' film, but if one is in the mood for something light, this is the movie to watch. Director Curtis has assembled an incredible array of British stars to create a film where everyone is about 6 degrees separated from the next person all the time.We have to congratulate Mr. Curtis for his musical ear, as he has selected great songs for the soundtrack. No other recent movie can flaunt a better array of love melodies to accompany the action in the film.Being this an ensemble piece, no one actor has a bigger role than another, but Hugh Grant certainly steals the film as the befuddled P.M. at the center of the action.

19,preppy-3,Light but very VERY sweet,10,30 November 2003,"A bunch of love stories that occur in December in London and all fall together on Christmas Eve.  Bill Nighy plays a has-been rock star who rerecords one of his old hits as a Christmas songs.  He's drugged out, beaten down and very very funny--and has no one to love.  Hugh Grant plays the prime minister who falls for his assistant (the wonderful Martine McCutcheon).  Colin Firth plays a man who just left his cheating wife and falls for a lovely Italian girl (Lucia Moniz) who really doesn't speak English.  Alan Rickman plays an executive married to loving wife Emma Thompson and pursued by his sexy secretary Heike Makatsch.  Kris Marshall plays a geeky English guy who flies all the way to America believing his accent will make him a stud.  Laura Linney plays a secretary deeply (and understandingly) in love with hunky Rodrigo Santoro--but she has somebody else.  Andrew Lincoln is secretly in love with his best friend's wife.  Liam Neeson coaches his 11 year old stepson on how to get a girl.  AND a guy falls for a woman while doing stand ins with her on a porno set.As you can see, there's plenty of material--too much.  The film is overlong--but all the actors are just great (Thomson, Rickman, Grant, Linney and Firth are just unbelievable) and the film is bright, colorful and--just like real life--doesn't have all happy endings.  Still, I loved every minute of this and recommend it highly.One warning--this is VERY R rated.  The language is rough and there's plenty of casual nudity in the porn sketch.",Love Actually

He was, of course, simply magnificent.The real attraction for me was, of course, Hugh Grant. No, I am not gay, but I love that guy in everything he does. His attraction to Martine McCutcheon was so funny and worth the price of admission alone.But, there are 10 love stories in this movie, and each has its own particular charm, and fascinating characters.Keira Knightley was absolutely beautiful and a real delight in her character; Alan Rickman played a softer character than I have ever seen, and was magnificent; there were so many great characters like Colin Firth, Carla Vasconcelos, Emma Thompson, and Billy Bob Thornton.

Even worse, the whole romantic angle seems so superficial, like the movie should be called an infatuation-drama, not a romantic-drama.The only interesting story was the one involving a divorce. That at least felt real and gritty and had some originality. The rest seem like fairy tales for young girls.Has some funny moments but these aren't enough to save the movie.",Love Actually
22,Boba_Fett1138,Perfect feel good movie.,8,21 May 2004,"If you are in the right mood for it than this movie can be the ultimate feel good movie for you.It's all about the feeling the movie has. The atmosphere and directing is great. The movie shows that love is all around us without ever getting over dramatized.However when you start evaluating and start thinking more and more about the movie and its story you will notice that it is flawed. Not all of the story's are as good as the others and some of them end quite abrupt and aren't satisfying enough.The acting is good, Hugh Grant actually is convincing as the British prime-minister and if only the real prime-minister would say the things to the American president (a wonderful role played by Billy Bob Thornton in the movie) that he says in this movie...how cool would that be? I would love to see that happen. Liam Neeson plays a very nice role and Alan Rickman is always a pleasure to watch, so also in this movie. Bill Nighy provides the most comical elements of the movie and he does that in a very good and fun way. The movie is full with many cameo's of both British and American actors. Maybe a bit too much but that hardly is a complaint.But what was with all that nudity and cursing? Now, I'm not against nudity and cursing in movies in any way but I felt that for this movie it was out of place and not needed at all. A movie like this should be very light to watch for the entire family, both young and adults.But what am I complaining about this movie? This movie is one of those movies where you shouldn't be thinking about to much while watching. Just let the feelings and emotions grab you. The movie of course is best to watch with your lover by the way.Further more, the movie has a nice soundtrack with both evergreens and new hits.Excellent very fun romantic movie with an high feel good value.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Love Actually
23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"British humor, love, and christmas...quite good actually",10,28 November 2003,"I have to say, I've never been too happy about British humor, I've always been more fond of the American humor. This movie has turned it around; while not always being laugh-out-loud funny, it is persistently funny, throughout pretty much the entire thing. I can't say I was bored at any point in the movie; even when it isn't funny, it isn't boring. And this is definitely the best movie I've ever seen about love. At the beginning, a lot of the characters are alone and lonely. At the end, most of them are with their love, having found the 'one and only'. I enjoyed every aspect of this movie, Hugh Grant being his typical British charming self, Keira Knightley being her adorable sweet self, even Rowan Atkinson's small, yet funny character amused me. This is not only for couples, or people who have found true love. It is most likely enjoyable, at least a little, to everyone. Whether you like British humor, wonderful music, or romance, you won't be disappointed. This movie has all three, and plenty of each. This is for anybody who likes funny movies, romance, and isn't too easily offended. 10/10",Love Actually
24,george.schmidt,Falling in love never looked so ...romantic! And FUNNY! Curtis' valentine to love is one for all; a must see and an instant classic!,10,10 November 2003,"LOVE ACTUALLY (2003) **** Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Bill Nighy, Keira Knightley, Laura Linney, Rowan Atkinson, Andrew Lincoln, Martine McCutcheon, Thomas Sangster, Olivia Olson, Rodrigo Santoro, Lucia Moniz, Martin Freeman, Joanna Page, Billy Bob Thornton, Denise Richards, Ivana Milicevic, January Jones, Elisha Cuthbert, Shannon Elizabeth, Claudia Schiffer. Utterly charming valentine to romantic comedies, romance and love – not necessarily in that order – from acclaimed genre screenwriter Richard Curtis (in his directorial debut) as a valentine of sorts to hopeless romantics and those who don't know better. Interweaving several plot points amongst a dozen or so characters including Grant as the British Prime Minister who is falling fast for his tea&crumpet server McCutcheon; his sister Thompson who is in a possibly rocky marriage with Rickman who is mulling over having an affair; Linney as Rickman's associate who is pining for fellow co-worker Santoro; Neeson as Grant and Thompson's recently widowed brother and stepfather to the young Sangster who is experiencing his first pangs of true love in the form of coed Olson; porno stand-ins Freeman and Page courting one another shyly; Nighy as a fading rock star trying to cash in on an oldie but a goody for a holiday comeback; and lastly Firth as a writer recovering from a troubled break-up falling in love with his comely assistant, the lovely Moniz. Set during the holidays Curtis wisely milks the emotions of the season with his crackerjack cast, sharply witty and surprisingly poignant screenplay and an effortless ease with the back and forth of each vignette perfectly paced and skillfully observed. An instant classic and one of the very few movies I actually felt good about myself for seeing immediately after – truly enlightening and uplifting. A choice soundtrack including Dido, The Pointer Sisters and The Beach Boys sure doesn't hurt either. Very funny, romantic and altogether perfect! One of the year's best films.",Love Actually
25,evanston_dad,Tries a Bit Too Hard to Be Quirky,7,2 June 2006,"Overall this movie works, though there is much about it that is awkward. It helps greatly that the director, Richard Curtis, keeps his movie self-aware and old fashioned on purpose--when it becomes just too cute and quirky to tolerate, it at least has the decency to know it.As happens all too frequently with these episodic ensemble films, there are some story lines that are simply more interesting than others, so the movie feels unbalanced. On a second viewing, it was much more difficult to have patience with the English-lad-in-Wisconsin sequences, or those involving the adult movie stand-ins -- which could have been left on the cutting room floor -- when there were such rich and affecting moments delivered by, for example, Emma Thompson, when she realizes the necklace her husband bought and wrapped as a Christmas present isn't for her, or by Laura Linney, in a brief scene of her visiting her mentally ill brother for the holiday. Bill Nighy, as an aging musician fed up with just about everything, is also a standout, and gets many of the movie's choicest and funniest lines.I very much liked this movie when I saw it in the theatre, but liked it somewhat less when I watched it again after it came out on DVD. I suspect it may be one of those movies that doesn't in the end hold up very well, though it's harmless enough. And it's got a great soundtrack.Grade: B",Love Actually

That is a fine picture except that it regards broken relationships and a false sense of love within infidelity. So it isn't love actually. Yet the film works due to detailed characters and circumstances. Director Richard Curtis barely holds the dozen or so subplots together but they flow with great detail. Ensemble cast includes Hugh Grant as the new Prime Minister of Britain who is overpowered with feelings towards his coffee steward. Liam Neeson plays a recent widow helping his son cope with love. Laura Linney plays a secretary trying to attract a co-worker but her cell phone is constantly ringing due to her brother being in an institution. Bill Nighy plays an ageing rock star who knows just how bad he is. Colin Firth plays a writer who falls for his Portuguese maid. Keira Knightley plays a newly wed who discovers that her husband's best man secretly had a crush on her. Great ensemble cast help keep the subplots interesting along with numerous superb locations that present different feeling. It doesn't always work due too delusional views of relationships that are the work of fiction if anything. Score: 8 / 10",Love Actually
27,HotToastyRag,Guarunteed to win at Christmastime,4,18 June 2019,"I'm probably the only person in the world who didn't want to immediately return to the movie theaters and watch Love Actually again and again when it came out. With a huge cast, a Christmas setting, and tiny romantic vignettes that are unrealistically optimistic and allow for very little character development, it's a cinch that this movie would be beloved by all. There are so many storylines, you're bound to find someone you like, and there's probably someone in the cast that drew you to the movie theaters in the first place. And since it's Christmas, everyone likes movies with happy endings. I'll stick with my Hallmark marathon, but if you love this movie, you're in good company with millions of others.Bill Nighy plays a burnt out pop singer turning his hit song into a Christmas song, which we're treated to about a dozen times throughout the movie. He's alone during the holidays, but he does have a steadfast friend in his manager, Gregor Fisher. Liam Neeson is a widower whose extremely young son believes he's fallen in love with a classmate who's moving. Rather than sitting the infant down and explaining that he'll experience exactly the same feeling with another classmate the next term, Liam tells his son that love is the most important thing in the world, and he has to declare his feelings before the girl leaves town. I know it's supposed to be heartwarming, but Thomas Sangster is in middle school! It left my eyes dry. Hugh Grant is the British Prime Minister, and while he's bored to tears dealing with the American president, Billy Bob Thornton, his wandering eye catches a lowly maid, Martine McCutcheon. This vignette is intended to inspire a belief that true love conquers any social, economic, and class boundary. First of all, that's not the case, and second of all, if it didn't work for me in Cinderella, Love Actually isn't going to change my mind.Next up is Alan Rickman, a hardworking businessman with very little happiness in his life. Sparks fly with his secretary Heike Makatsch, but since her hair and makeup reek of ""fun fling"" and his wife Emma Thompson is given a tearjerker scene to get the audience on her side, you can bet your bottom dollar he's spending Christmas at home. I was rooting for Heike to make Alan happy, so without giving definitive spoilers, let's go to the next vignette. Colin Firth takes a vacation for Christmas after getting dumped, and completely on the rebound, he falls in love with Lucia Moniz. He speaks no Portuguese, and she speaks no English. Again, this is supposed to be charming and sweet.Laura Linney gives American audiences someone without an accent to root for, and as she has a crush on the hunk at the office, Rodrigo Santoro, her romantic life has always taken a backseat to her on-call care for her mentally-off brother. Do you think the office Christmas party might give her a break? Once again, we have another plot point that doesn't think any further than the morning after. Martin Freeman and Joanna Page are given what's probably supposed to be the funniest segment. They're body doubles who spend their days on a film set acting in sex scenes, but they're both incredibly polite and shy. Rowan Atkinson has a small but important role in other people's vignettes, but isn't given a romance.And finally, we have the most famous segment: Andrew Lincoln holding up signs outside Keira Knightley's house telling her he loves her. Why is this romantic when her husband is his best friend, Chiwetel Ejiofor? Why is this teaching people good things, that ""at Christmas, we tell the truth"" when on an earlier sign, he told Keira to lie to her husband and pretend Christmas carolers had rung the doorbell? And what will happen the day after Christmas? Why are we supposed to root for this vein of infidelity when we were supposed to root against Alan Rickman's office affair?As you can guess, I didn't add this movie to my Christmas collection. If you've never seen it, and my arguments make sense to you, you might want to skip it. If you've seen it and love it, you probably haven't made it this far in my review.",Love Actually
28,FlashCallahan,Become a rock star......,10,21 December 2011,"London, England during five frantic weeks before Christmas follows a web-like pattern of inter-related, loosely related and unrelated stories of a dozen or more various individuals with their love lives, or lack of them.The central character is the new bachelor prime minister David who cannot express his growing feelings for his new personal assistant Natalie.The prime minister's older sister Karen slowly grows aware of her husband Harry's flirtation with an office worker named Mia. Karen's friend Daniel is a recently widowed writer whose 11-year-old son asks for love advice about a girl he has a crush on.Meanwhile, Jamie is another writer who leaves his girlfriend after catching her cheating on him and travels to France to write a novel where he pursues a possible romance with his non-English speaking Portuguese maid Aurelia.Other secondary characters involve a photographer who pursues his best friend's new wife Juliet; a pair of movie stand-ins, named John and Judy, who grow closer after their simulated love scenes; a libidinous chum who wants to travel to Wisconsin, USA to score with women; and a burned-out former rock star named Billy Mack who is the main connection between all stories involved...It's a Christmas film directed by the man who made Hugh Grant a star, so what would you expect? To be honest, it's the most sickly sweet romantic movie you will ever wish to see, but the performances make this movie a must see, and not one story in this layered narrative is a weak point.The opening is a little off putting, when Grant explains about phone calls during 9/11, but overlook this and you get such a rich character development, you cannot help but love the film.There is no real plot to the film, and the connections with the characters really need to be taken with a large pinch of salt, but the film is consistently funny and sad, it's really one of those films that is really hard to dislike.An essential Christmas movie.",Love Actually
29,gradyharp,A Holiday Reminder,10,26 December 2019,"Some feel that this perennial favorite film, LOVE ACTUALLY, is a response to the global devastation and fear that the September 11, 2001 created - a deeply felt longing for a return to peace and for acknowledging love. That may have influenced writer/director Richard Curtis to create this series of stories, but whether that is the case or not, this cinematic miracle has become a holiday must see and relive-experience for many of us.The stories - and there are many of them - are set in England the month before Christmas and are as varied as the feeling of love itself: a has-been rock star ultimately discovers his true love is his male manager (Bill Nighy and Gregor Fisher), the Prime Minister finds attraction to a feisty employee (Hugh Grant and Martine McCutcheon), a desiring female longs for a fellow employee but owns her love for her ill brother (Laura Linney and Rodrigo Santoro), a married couple deals with adultery (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson), a writer discovers true love in a Portuguese maid (Colin Firth and Sienna Guilory), a newly married couple cope with an ambiguous friend's attraction (Chiwetel Ejiofor, Keira Knightley and Andrew Lincoln), a father advises his young son about going for love (Liam Neeson and Thomas Brodie-Sangster) and more.Not only is the story well written and directed and full of Christmas spirit, but it also is superbly acted by an outstanding cast.

It begins in an airport and ends there.

A young boy falls in love after his mother has died during Christmastime. We don't even see Anne Reid and Frances De La Tour at all due to the edits. The film director could have made two movies. Alan Rickman and Thompson played a long term married couple. Laura Linney's character is an American woman living and working in London, England with a mentally ill brother. I wished she had a happier ending in her life. The film is heartwarming tale of life and love in London, England when you wanted to live there. Bill Nighy was great as an aging rock star. Atkinson has two scenes pivotal to the plot. There were just so many story lines going on that could have edited in writing first hand. Still it's a happy film overall.",Love Actually
32,Mr-Fusion,Shouldn't be nearly as good as it is,7,15 December 2016,"In some respects, ""Love Actually"" is every bit the gift-wrapped box of sentiment you'd think just looking at the DVD cover. Some of this rings unbelievable, and I tend to be the person who finds that a turnoff. Maybe that's the cynicism talking. But there was a point when all the moving pieces clicked (right around when Colin Firth is bidding adieu to his Portuguese maid, and soon after, the Norah Jones song kicks in) and I really got sucked into the interwoven subplots . And it's not all love and treacle; there a sizable amount of heartache also built in. This is a hell of a cast (with Neeson, Firth, Rickman and Thompson as standouts) and if you're looking for a Christmas movie, short on commercialism and long on warmth, you really could do a lot worse than this.7/10",Love Actually

There is that atmosphere of ordinary people leaving ordinary lives, yet being extraordinary in their take of things (and in their accent, of course). All those people that enjoyed Notting Hill will enjoy this one, maybe even more.The cast is full with good actors, starting with Alan Rickman and ending with Liam Neeson. You have celebs like Claudia Schiffer showing unexpectedly. You have personal drama and bliss (sometimes put together). But what is delightful is the humour of it all. Perhaps the Brits will do a dozen films like this one and I'll get fed up with their joking style and I'll write different reviews, but for me it was funny. Really funny. And not in the ""Ha Ha"" sense that we see on the Hollywood conveyor belt.I think that the attack on the British Premier was not that subtle, but then again, I doubt he gets anything else.

'Love Actually' Follows the lives of eight very different couples in dealing with their love lives in various loosely interrelated tales all set during a frantic month before Christmas in London, England.'Love Actually' is sweet, heartwarming & unmistakably charming.

A Special Mention for Craig Armstrong's tuneful Score.Performance-Wise: 'Love Actually' forms a strong ensemble & expectedly, all the actors are in great form.

35,JamesHitchcock,Too Much Plot by Half,6,23 January 2015,"Sentimental Christmas-themed movies are something we normally associate with America, but in 2003 the British cinema decided to have a go at producing one of its own. ""Love Actually"" was written and directed by Richard Curtis, the great doyen of the British romantic comedy, who had earlier been responsible for ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Notting Hill"". Unlike those two films which only dealt with a single love story, this one is an example of ""hyperlink cinema"", with numerous interlinked plot lines involving a wide variety of individuals.Almost all of the story lines, which take place in the weeks before and after one Christmas, mostly in London, involve different aspects of love. That does not mean that they are all ""boy-meets-girl"" love stories, although there are indeed several of those. David, the newly elected bachelor Prime Minister, finds true love with his pretty young tea lady Natalie. Jamie, a novelist, breaks up with his girlfriend after discovering she has been cheating on him with his brother and retreats to his holiday home in Provence, where he begins a romance with his Portuguese housekeeper Aurelia, despite the fact that neither can speak a word of the other's language. Some of the stories, however, look at the idea of ""love"" from a different angle. A recurring storyline involves Billy, an ageing rock star hoping for a comeback with a cover version of ""Love Is All Around"". There is no romantic interest in Billy's life; he claims that his great ""love"" is his manager Joe, but as both men are firmly heterosexual he is using ""love"" in the sense of platonic friendship. (There are, in fact, no gay or lesbian love stories featured).Daniel, a widower, helps his young stepson Sam who has a crush on a girl in his class. This story is really more about father-son relationships than about romantic love, although it never really rang true. I felt that in reality Sam would have been too distraught over the death of his mother to worry that one of his classmates was moving back to America and that Daniel too distraught over the death of his wife to be thinking about starting a new romance so soon. I described the film as ""hyperlink cinema"", but in fact it differs from most hyperlink films in two ways. It is a light comedy, unlike the likes of ""Syriana"", ""Babel"", ""Crash"" and ""The Hours"", all of which deal with serious themes. And secondly, with nine separate stories it has more plot lines than most of them. (""Babel"" and ""The Hours"" only had three). It is, in fact, this multiplicity of plot lines which is the film's main weakness, as there is insufficient space to deal with them all satisfactorily. The four mentioned above are all dealt with fairly fully, but others are very perfunctory and leave the viewer guessing. Is, for example Harry (the husband of David's sister Karen) actually having an affair with his secretary, or does he merely fancy her? What eventually happens to John and Judy, those politely diffident middle- class porn stars? The two most potentially serious stories, that of Mark and his unrequited love for his best friend's wife and that of Sarah and Karl, whose romance is blighted by her need to care for a mentally disturbed brother, are both told very sketchily, as though Curtis were shying away from their implications.In ""Four Weddings"" and ""Notting Hill"" Curtis seemed to be courting the American market; in both films the heroine is an American and played by a big-name Hollywood star. (Andie McDowell and Julia Roberts). Here he seems to be trying to alienate that market. The American President, a bully in his foreign policy and a seedy predator in his relationships with women, combines the most unattractive qualities of George Bush with those of Bill Clinton. When David, infuriated by the President's unwanted advances towards Natalie, makes a tactlessly undiplomatic anti- American speech he becomes a national hero; Curtis obviously wanted to align himself with those in Britain who resented Tony Blair's support for Bush's Iraq policy. The only American involved in the main stories is the hapless Sarah, the sort of woman who infuriates her boyfriend by insisting on answering the telephone while they are making love. One character, Colin, visits Milwaukee to test his theory that all American girls are nymphomaniacs who are driven wild by a British accent- and finds it is perfectly true!The film stars some of the biggest names of the British cinema, but because of the many separate strands to the plot some of them have surprisingly little to do. I doubt, for example, if even the Keira Knightley Fan Club will ever rank ""Love Actually"" among their heroine's greatest films, and the same could be said for Liam Neeson and Alan Rickman. There are, however, some decent performances from the likes of Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson and Colin Firth, all practised hands at romantic comedy, and a particularly good one from Bill Nighy as Billy, whose refreshingly honest cynicism about the pop business and his part in it makes the long-suffering Joe despair. Nighy displays great comic timing in delivering Billy's one-liners; I particularly liked his crack about Britney Spears, unfortunately too bawdy (and libellous) to repeat here. There is also a nice cameo from Rowan Atkinson as that smarmily obsequious shop assistant. These are enough to save the film from a lower mark, but I felt that it would have been better if Curtis had reduced the number of plot lines to, say, four or five. Too much plot by half. 6/10",Love Actually

Our president is a skinny southern hick who hits on every woman he sees? Actually, don't answer that.American girls are easy? The English guy comes to America, he's not even there for 2 minutes, and he gets a threesome with hot women? Yes, America is filled with women who look like Denise Richards.

37,=G=,For romantics only. All others need not apply.,8,1 May 2004,"A poet once wrote (paraphrasing); the sweetest fruit on the tree of life is love in bloom. ""Love Actually"" attempts to capitalizes on that thesis by serving up huge helpings of that ""sweet fruit"" and showing us a bunch of people falling more or less in love. With a carousel of  characters from a young boy to a couple of softcore actors to a rock star to the Prime Minister and more, this panorama of people passes round and round before our eyes as they gravitate towards one another more or less awkwardly falling in love until the culmination when the music swells and the couples come rapturously together. Sassy, silly, sarcastic, and sentimental, this fun flick features an excellent cast, good production value, great music, and a solid pedigree. On the downside, it's schmaltzy, unabashedly contrived, corny, commercial and  conglomerated. For romantics only, ""Love Actually"" requires a certain amount of just going with it. Those who can make the buy-in should enjoy this busy testament to that which conquers all. (B+)",Love Actually

When I first found out how this film is going to be about 8 different couples I thought it was going to be a long movie, but it only show short segments of each and gets straight to the point on most parts. The ensemble case is mainly British actors and actresses and they all work pretty well. And the lives of the characters are all in good taste although most of it is more feminine ideals of romance, but I guess that is okay because of the flurry of very unrealistic romance movies out there.

39,sddavis63,A Tremendously Pleasant And Enjoyable Movie About Love,8,30 December 2011,"There really aren't a lot of movies about love. There are a lot of romances, but the focus is always on the star-crossed lovers. There are star-crossed lovers in this, but the focus here is less on the characters than it is simply on the power of love as it sometimes appears in unexpected places, and as it sometimes rekindles itself after lying dormant. Sometimes we're recovering from love, sometimes love is from afar and unrequited; sometimes it's just a true and sincere friendship. But it's there. As Hugh Grant says in the opening narration: ""love, actually, is all around us.""I have to confess that I'm generally not a fan of these movies that feature separate story lines that eventually intertwine. I like my movies to have a little more focus, and these movies often seem blurry instead, as you wait (often impatiently) for what you know is the inevitable moment when the various stories will intersect, and everything will be revealed. This movie, however, I enjoyed. There were, in fact, several story lines: an old rocker trying to make a comeback; a recent widower dealing with grief and his young stepson who's head over heels for a classmate; the newly elected and single British Prime Minister who's smitten with a member of the household staff; two porn actors who fall for each other on the set; a recent divorcée who falls for his maid with whom he can't even communicate with because she speaks Portuguese; a newly married couple - and the man who secretly adores the new bride; an older man being pursued by a co-worker who wonders whether to pursue her or stick with his marriage. There might have been others. Usually I would say that's way too much to include, but somehow it all worked here; the stories blended together well and complemented each other. It's a very diverse group of people, all connected by being essentially from the same town. No one relationship really dominated in the story, although the three that really stood out for me were Hugh Grant's role as the Prime Minister (the slightly confused by love character being perfect for him), Liam Neeson as the recent widower dealing with grief and helping his stepson with love and Bill Nighy as rocker Billy Mack, who adds the most comedy to the movie as he releases a Christmas album that he knows is terrible - which he tells everyone, much to the chagrin of his manager. Other lovers in this included Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Laura Linney and Alan Rickman. There are also small (and non- romantic) parts for Billy Bob Thornton and Rowan Atkinson.The characters are basically all likable and pleasant, and you really find yourself hoping that love works out for all of them. It's not really a tug at your heartstrings type of movie, and while it's about love it's not what I would call a ""chick flick"" - there are too many situations faced by the respective male characters that I could relate to for it to be that. I suppose it's a bit too sappy at times, but that's in keeping with the subject matter. It's a pleasant movie - and at times it's very funny as we watch the various relationships work themselves out.

41,cherold,"Infatuation, Actually",6,8 December 2019,"Well, I finally saw Love, Actually. I hadn't planned to. I've read a number of articles on why it's awful - most notably Lindy West's hilariously savage takedown - so I figured I could skip it. But I was with my girlfriend's family and it was on so there you are.It's hard to be objective after so much anti-anticipation, but I'm inclined to say that, if you accept that this is manipulative and nonsensical, it's a reasonably effective bit of Hollywood Christmas entertainment. Just ignore that romance is reserved for young women without a lot to say and that this movie is not about love at all but instead is about becoming infatuated with people you don't know and may have nothing in common with and it's all fine.The structure is unusual, in that's it's a series of little intertwined vignettes about a group of interconnected people. A little boy is in love with a girl he hasn't spoken to, a guy falls in love with a woman who doesn't speak English, a Prime Minister has the hots for an attractive woman everyone in the movie inexplicably describes as fat (as though the part was written for a heavier woman and then some producer shouted ""WE CAN'T HAVE A FAT CHICK IN THIS MOVIE!"").Many of the characters are likable in general, and some of the scenes, taken by themselves, are kind of brilliant. Yes, that guy putting his emotional baggage on a newlywed is screwed up, but IT'S DONE IN SIGNS! No, it makes no sense those two people who couldn't converse and barely interacted fell in love, but the culminating scene is funny and rather touching. There is no movie that requires stand ins for a series of nothing but sex scenes, but those scenes are funny and the low-key relationship that develops is the most likable and believable thing in the movie.What Love, Actually is, above all else, is *clever.* The exhausting, sometimes annoying structure is clever. There are ingenious scenes and situations and some sharp dialogue. But the cleverness seems to exist for its own sake rather than in the service of saying something about love or lust or the human condition, so the whole thing is kind of empty.Would I have rated this movie higher if I had no information going in? Probably. I probably would have given it a 7 and said it was dumb but entertaining even though I found jumping from story to story a little annoying. I can't imagine rating it higher than 7, though, and definitely don't see this as a particularly good example of the romantic comedy.It's not really as bad as I thought it might be. If you're curious to see what all the fuss is about, go ahead and take a look.",Love Actually
42,Robert_duder,Finally conquered the juggernaut of modern day classics,7,19 November 2014,"I can't even fathom the amount of times I've heard people rave about Love Actually. Its one of those movies that people say they watch every year and how much they love it. I even started watching it last Christmas and just didn't make it all the way through for one reason or another. Honestly, you really have to be in the right mood to watch the film because in many ways despite it following a very predictable recipe, it is a very uniquely styled film. Love Actually is very British starring a host of very famous British actors and being set in London with all the quirky dialogue you'd expect from a British film. Its a film with multiple stories all happening at once and intersecting in small ways which some people really like. I actually think the movie maybe overdoes it with the multiple story lines because as good as everyone is and each story has its own merits, some are lost and you're left feeling like some of the characters' issues are unresolved. Still, its a funny, quirky, emotional film with a ton of familiar faces and great characters. Love Actually is unapologetically a seasonal special for adults. Nudity, bad language, sex and mature themes abound in the film which is unusual for a ""Christmas"" movie but why not? Adults deserve a movie for them exclusively. Still a lot of the mature content is perhaps almost unnecessary.Talking about a cast like this is really hard because it is the definition of an ensemble cast. Its a whose who of British actors with a few Americans thrown in there too. I will list some of the more significant characters and actors. Hugh Grant (watching this made me realize how much I enjoyed him when he was in his prime as a comedic actor), Emma Thompson (always amazing), Liam Neeson, Bill Nighy (small role but absolutely adore his insane character), Gregor Fisher, Colin Firth, Martin Freeman and Joanna Page (though I could have done without their story entirely. Its unnecessarily adult and changes the tone of the movie.) Andrew Lincoln, Kiera Knightley and Chiwetel Ejiofor star in a sub-plot that I didn't particularly care for either. It could have not been there and made very little difference. Laura Linney, Alan Rickman, Martine McCutcheon, Rodrigo Santoro and Thomas Brodie-Sangster round out the main cast. I think I've really covered the main people that at least have significant screen time. As I pointed out I felt like a few of the stories took up more time than necessary and sort of cut into the stories that you really wanted to see more of like Liam Neeson's storyline with his step-son and Hugh Grant's story. Both of those (for instance) could have made their own film.Its amazing that this was Richard Curtis' directorial debut and he wrote the film as well. I also have to mention that Curtis (who has only directed two other movies since this one) directed the AMAZING (one of the best films of last year) About Time. He knows a thing or two about evoking emotions and he uses this top notch cast extremely well. I do sort of get why people adore this movie so much. It has a lot of very memorable scenes and while it is based around Christmas, it doesn't shove the idea down your throat that its a ""Christmas"" movie. Its a subtle holiday film that deals with multiple versions of what ""love"" is. For the romantic in all of us, you'll definitely enjoy it. It didn't floor me, in fact considering its reputation I thought it could use a little fine tuning here and there. It felt sloppy at times. Still I enjoyed myself, had some fun, and I totally get why people rave about it. Maybe the expectations were set pretty high. Definitely check it out for something a little different this holiday season. This is technically my first Holiday film for 2014 and I love my Christmas movies!! 7.5/10",Love Actually
43,Lejink,Love Comes to Everyone,2,11 April 2010,"The Richard Curtis I like is the man behind the big belly-laughs in TV's ""Black Adder"" and ""Vicar Of Dibley"". Quite how he morphed into the purveyor of ludicrous, over-sentimental tosh like this I'll never know, although I think the lure of the mighty dollar might have had something to do with it.Mixing the supposed ""feel-good"" factor of a latter-day Christmas film to an overblown hymn to love, while meant no doubt to induce a warm feeling inside, instead turned my insides out. Here in a Britain about a million miles detached from reality, Cupid's little arrows strike out at everyone from the prime minister himself to porn actors and even, God bless, the little children. It's all set to a corny soundtrack, a new song on every two minutes or so it seems, usually consisting of poor cover versions of standards.I don't know which set of cooing couples I thought the least of, but for sheer sickliness, the exchanges between Liam Neeson and his 10 going on 40 year old son take some beating. Worst scene though, in an overcrowded category, has to be Emma Thompson silently over-emoting as she realises her husband is thinking of having an affair. I wish Dorothy Parker hadn't already coined the phrase about running the gamut of acting emotions from A to B, although I'm not sure Miss Thompson even got past A, so toe-curlingly embarrassing is her ""big"" scene.Honestly, to these eyes and ears, not one actor shines, although as I think I've made clear, I believe the fault is in the writing. There's also some unnecessary vulgarity, loads of ham acting and a direction style which tries to lead you by the nose to Christmas nirvana. No, this Christmas turkey can go and get stuffed as far as I'm concerned, its one small saving grace being that it singularly failed to launch former soap star Martine McCutcheon to movie stardom. Well, that would certainly be high up on my Christmas wish-list any old year.",Love Actually
44,ElMaruecan82,"Love is not like that ... and certainly not ""like that"" ...",6,17 April 2012,"Remember what Diana Ross said: ""Can't hurry love, you just have to wait  Love don't come easy, it's a game of give and take""Well, according to ""Love Actually"", love can come easily and quickly, count five weeks till December 25th... and you'll get it.I remember the first viewing was with my best friend precisely at the end of December 2010, we wanted to watch a gangster film but, after filling our stomachs with some cans of beers, we decided to loosen up a bit and give a chance to the most improbably enjoyable film: a Brit Rom Com  and after more cans of beers, we were ecstatic. For me, it was the most feel-good and warmest romantic comedy my heart ever experienced, I almost wanted to hug my buddy and open my heart to him. The feeling lasted.I saw it again, two weeks ago. I was left perplexed. I didn't even want to finish it. The magic disappeared. And I was almost ashamed of my initial reaction. Guess what was the only parameter that changed between the two viewings (besides being sober)? This time I was married. And this time I saw the film with my newlywed wife, and what my heart 'experienced' the first time, was 'endured' the second. In one year, I believe I learned one thing or two about love, and more than anything, about commitment. I know ""Love Actually"" is meant to be a kaleidoscope of all the love-induced situations that ever graced the silver screen for pure dramatization's sake, but this leads to underdeveloped stories canalized by a succession of painful clichés. ""I love you"" might be one of the simplest and most touching words ever said in a lifetime, it's also the most intimate and I'm not sure everyone would make a declaration of love in a crowded place.And I can go on and on with all the situations that rang false in my book. Mourning a wife's death is a devastating experience that can't be swept off just because Junior is in love with the most popular girl in school, no matter how creepily smart he sounds. Being betrayed by his wife and brother is the kind of humiliations that would severely knock out any grown-up man, and I'm not sure all it took for Colin Firth's character was a non-English speaking Portuguese housekeeper. I'm not sure it takes a girl taking off her clothes in slow motion to create a love at first sight, when lust would be the most appropriate reaction.Love is not just like that, and love is not ""just like that"" (snapping fingers). And ""Love Actually"" consists on a successions of wannabe witty romances that would have made Woody Allen roll over his grave, if he was dead. Oh yeah, and the whole thing is packaged in a dazzling celebration of post-9/11 post-modernistic political correctness which is a real insult to reality. A young man is in love with his best friend's wife, and we should just ""oooow"" about this because Keira Knightley is just so irresistible. The betrayed friend happens to be black like many other secondary characters that embodies the so cinematically convenient idea of differences that 'make no difference'. I never care about racial minorities' depictions in films, but since the film was obviously desperate to prove its open-mindedness, then why not featuring Indians, Pakistani, Arabs or Muslim characters for that matter? Oh yes, of course, they don't celebrate Christmas.The racial thing is just the tip of the iceberg, that -in fact- betrays an extreme shallowness in the script.One of the Prime Minster's assistant is black, and can easily be regarded as beautiful or ugly, following the tastes. At one point, she referred to the PM's secretary as fat, when she was just voluptuous and quite frankly had more sex appeal than her. But we're supposed to see Natalie as the ugly duckling while she's really attractive. Natalie is ugly by cinematic standards, just like her foul-mouthed language proves that she comes from the 'worst part of London'. Enough to make her unlikely romance with the PM (Hugh Grant, ladies) happen  Well, this was one of the most blatant cases of useless manipulation since the romance between a head of state and a secretary was already good material.I can't believe I missed these details the first time. But at least, it makes sense considering the way the stories are handled, some end happily, some very happily, and 'foursome' lucky dorks, the Christmas miracle happened.""Love Actually"" betrays more what it tries to be, than what it actually is. Not any movie can have the wit of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and the warmth of ""Annie Hall"" so the film can only exploit the magic of Christmas and a penetrating music to beg us to feel good for archetypes, you know those formulaic ""You'll laugh! You'll cry!"" slogans.And they're all here, the workaholic architect, the lonely writer, the office's slut, the wife (Emma Thomson) who endures the infidelity of her husband (Alan Rickman) with dignity, the climactic race to the airport for a simple declaration of love, all the multiple story lines tying up at the end in the most artificial ways (did the stories all need to be connected?). The movie tries to satisfy everyone, with interracial love, kids' crush, international love, class loves, infidelity followed by divorce, infidelity followed by reconciliation.Yet, the film is so politically correct that it didn't even have the guts to ruin the 'Family' feeling by having a gay couple in the storyline, so we have a Rock star who prefers to spend Christmas with his manager, two body doubles pretending to have sex is one thing, but is a gay couple for Christmas asking too much?",Love Actually
45,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"To me, you aren't perfect.",5,27 December 2019,"'Love, Actually (2003)' is like a slab of aged Stilton on a chocolate-chip cookie ice-cream sandwich: cheesy, saccharine and a tad confused. On-the-nose, sweet-and-savoury metaphors aside, the movie is a mess. It's overly sentimental, relentlessly earnest and hopelessly predictable, conforming to the conventions of its genre a dozen times over. It's no accident that two of its several, somewhat intertwined stories are more fleshed-out than the others; Curtis apparently combined two separate screenplays, one which focused on the prime minister and one which focused on a writer in France. Perhaps these would be good on their own, or even as a two-hander. The problem is that the script is overstuffed and sort of unsure of itself, slipping between subdued, pseudo 'kitchen sink' reality and stylised, 'every man's dream' fantasy. It's the sort of thing in which people propose almost before they've been properly introduced. It all comes together, aside from one story that's left hanging at an oddly downbeat point, in two or three (depending on how you count it) finales, each cheesier than the last. None of it feels like 'real' romance - though, Thompson and Rickman's relationship is rather grounded - and it all seems sort of manipulative. It's not cohesive, clumsily coming together to make for a turbulent time. It's not terrible, however, and there are a couple of laughs - Nighy is a real treat, for example. Still, the end result is sloppy, unrealistic and practically designed to make you go 'aww'. Instead, you kind of just want to go 'yuck'. 5/10",Love Actually
46,dromasca,"good, actually",8,7 January 2006,"Here is a rare bird in my cinema landscape. I really am no great fan of good-feeling movies or romantic comedies, but this Christmas film really succeeded to make me feel good, and romantic. Sure, Richard Curtis is one of the best directors in this genre, certainly the best British one, but it takes a pound of courage to engage in such a deprecated genre and a bunch of talent to get out with a cued piece of work like this one.Multiple stories movies are often brought to screen in the last few years. To be successful you need not only for each story to be simple and credible, but you also need a script that gives enough individuality and weight for each of the segments, and a good director that brings everything to look like one piece of work, more like a good composer combines different orchestra sections in a symphony. Al these are present here, and moreover, a brilliant cast, including half of the who's who list of romantic comedy actors, and still allowing a few of them to do memorable creations, especially Bill Nighty in the aged rock star role. Hugh Grant is the only one who seems slightly mis-cast, and this is not because he is not a good romantic actor, but because he looks too young and unsure for a British Prime Minister to be believed.'Love actually' will be on the holidays seasons TV schedules for many years, and for a change will be the one movie on the list that will not cause me switch channels.",Love Actually
47,gbill-74877,Charming and inspiring,9,20 June 2017,"What a charming movie this is. It's not perfect or anything, and probably gets a little too syrupy towards the end, but it's romantic, funny, and the star-studded cast is outstanding. Weaving through so many story lines could have left the viewer confused and unsatisfied with any of them, but director Richard Curtis pulls the right strings and keeps us entertained from beginning to end. There are just so many wonderful scenes and lines. Andrew Lincoln's card scene with Keira Knightley. Colin Firth watching Lúcia Moniz walk out of his life, and then later both of them learning each other's language. Thomas Sangster, the little boy, talking to Liam Neeson about the ""total agony of being in love"". Hugh Grant the Prime Minister going door to door to find the sweet and sometimes foul- mouthed Martine McCutcheon. And on and on.The movie is filled with all those little moments we can identify with – secret longings, flirtation, and first kisses – but also those that are bittersweet, and those that disappoint us. The overall theme of the movie, that ""love actually is all around"", even though we often focus on the incidents of hate in the world, is inspiring. The shots in London are gorgeous, and the comic relief provided by the aging rocker Bill Nighy is funny. It is a feel- good movie and bound to be criticized, but it's OK to feel good once in awhile :), and this is certainly one of the better done romantic comedies.",Love Actually
48,lesleyharris30,"Filled with Whimiscal Characters and Heartwarming Stories,",9,1 January 2016,"Love Actually is a great movie with several well developed story lines that all come together nicely and a terrific cast that can be both comedic and dramatic. It certainly wasn't an easy film to make and I'm sure the studio must have considered it a huge risk, telling stories from several characters in the space of two hours, with all of them having little to no connection with the others, but it worked, Richard Curtis clearly put hard work in to this script and gathered a very impressive cast to make it a hit. Of course, with the amount of stories there are, some of them felt underdeveloped, I found Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson's to be one of the most compelling, but in the great their story dosen't get any proper closure, Colin Firth's story felt very tight, I would like to have seen more of him with Sienna Guillory, but with a film as crowded as this you are going to feel underwhelmed with certain parts. The films cast really is terrific and is the main reason why a story as complicated and messy as this really works, Liam Neeson shines as a step dad hoping to cheer up the son of his deceased wife, Emma Thompson is delightful as a wife questioning her own decisions, Alan Rickman astounds as a confused husband, Hugh Grant is terrific as a prime minister who discovers love for the first time, every actor puts all their heart in to these roles and they are all a delight to watch. However, the best performance for me would have to be Bill Nighy, who shines in every scene as Billy Mack, playing a character in no way similar to any role he has done previously, he plays a straight up pompous musician, and he does it ridiculously well. Always a fun film to watch at Christmas time, Love Actually is funny, emotional and very sweet, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy or romance film. Set one month before Christmas, we follow the lives of several people falling in or out of love. Best Performance: Bill Nighy",Love Actually
49,secondtake,"Brilliant, non-stop, dazzling network of relationships, very British, very fun",9,27 December 2011,"Love Actually (2003)This huge network of feel good stories could have been sloppy and sappy. Oh, heck, it is sloppy and sappy, and that's why it's so lovable. And great, in its own way. A whole slew of top notch actors give really sincerely spot on performances--all of them rather brief in terms of screen time because there are so many stories here, but still satisfying.What is there not to like about a movie where almost everyone succeeds in overcoming something, mostly loneliness? The point of love actually is actually just love, and falling in love, and making what love they already have meaningful. There are relationships that makes sense, like Laura Linney's heartbreaking nurturing of her mentally challenged brother to the detriment of her own love life. There is the painfully realistic and mature marriage between two sophisticated educated professionals, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, with their varying levels of sincerity. And there is the Prime Minister of Britain himself, played by Hugh Grant, who falls in love, and resists falling in love, with his secretary. Throw in a more drab if pretty-ish Keira Knightley, a wonderfully love-sick Andrew Lincoln, and the oddly adult relationship between Liam Neeson and his cute cute stepson and it gets more and more layered up and fun.While certainly the film is well known here in the U.S., it is practically a national treasure, from what I gather, amongst rank and file Brits. This is a thoroughly British movie, to be sure, and more lovable for it. For one thing, they have removed all the pomp and security machinations around the Prime Minister, so he seems just like a regular lonely guy who goes to work and gets coffee. Then there is the key scene where this Hugh Grant P.M. stands up to the visiting American President, and it's a great rah-rah moment.While not all the actors are British, most are, and some very much so, such as Bill Nighy who plays so dazzlingly well the aging rock star on the comeback. The terrific British comedian Rowan Atkinson has a couple of key roles that are brilliant. And so on. Of course the President is Billy Bob Thornton (Arkansas) and Linney is a good old New Yorker (bless her) and there is Claudia Schiffer who is international somehow, but born in Germany.All of these people are interconnected in ways that really don't strain the plot. (A wonderfully excessive chart of all these, with French text, oddly, is clickable on the Love Actually wikipedia page.) The writing and directing are both the work of one man, Richard Curtis, who has directed only one other film but has written a slew of them (and who is only British by means of the Empire--he's from New Zealand). But if the direction is solid, the writing is sublime. Yes, it doesn't strive for Shakespeare level profundity, and it doesn't reach it, either, but it's really smart, snappy, believable, funny stuff. That will also get you in the gut if you let it.",Love Actually

Sets the bar for all other such features. From the opening with Bill Nighy (who astonishingly did a vampire series just after) to the closing, this is the most fun you are going to have outside of a theme park or an adult ranch in Nevada.Every country on the planet has given this type of film a whirl, and probably there are even now film students who think the US nailed it (maybe with one of the old O HENRY anthologies?)

The film is quite humorous and humane, giving out smiles and sighs with aplomb. All of the actors do their jobs very well and should be commended for making what will probably be a classic in holiday films and in British film-making. One caveat, however. The film got a deserved R rating for language and for one plot line that involves body doubles doing sexual situations for the film industry. Alas, if these two things were eliminated, the film could be recommended for viewing without hesitation. As it is, the film is not suitable for anyone under 18, without extreme guidance. Or, wait. Doesn't the film show up on television from time to time, with some scenes edited? Instead of getting the movie at the local video store, this viewer recommends taping it right from network television.

However, this one does work, although I'm a little surprised to see such a high rating by our IMDb reviewers. Generally I liked the film, but I felt that there were actually too many ""couples"" stories being told -- 9 in all; that's really only an average of 15 minutes per story...and several of the stories deserved more.The Billy Mack and Joe segment just didn't work for me, although there were some funny moments as an old rock star tries to remain relevant. I wondered if there would be a gay segment in the film...it surprised me that this was it. I must admit that I'm not particularly enthralled with Bill Nighy, although he did better in ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"".The Juliet, Peter and Mark segment was entertaining. Keira Knightley and Chiwetel Ejiofor were very good as newlyweds, and the wedding ceremony was downright entertaining. And the way the triangle works out is different, and therefore quite interesting.The Jamie and Aurélia segment is strong due to Colin Firth's performance, though the bit in the pond is rather absurd...why would you retrieve soaked papers that would be damaged beyond recognition? The whole infidelity segment with Alan Rickman just didn't really work, from my perspective. He's a fine actor, but this just seemed awkward. Emma Thompson was very good, as always. This could have been the basis for a whole movie, which might have made it more understandable.Hugh Grant, as the new Prime Minister...well, although he seemed too young for the role, it worked well. Nice to see the U.S. President (Billy Bob Thornton) taken down a peg, although Thornton as President...egads! There's humor here, and I enjoyed it.The subplot of Liam Neeson and his son just seemed to go nowhere.I did find the segment with Laura Linney and Rodrigo Santoro interesting.

56,Red-125,A waste of good acting talent!,4,24 November 2003,"Love, Actually (2003) written and directed by Richard Curtis, is a movie about Christmas that misses the mark.  In fact, it misses more than one mark because it's not a good screwball comedy, it's not a good romance, and it's not a good drama.The film tries for a light touch, but doesn't achieve it.  It's hard to believe a director could waste the talents of actors like Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant, Laura Linney, and the incomparable Emma Thompson, but Curtis manages this feat.There are eight couples--more or less-- in the movie, but the match that should have been the highlight of the film is between Hugh Grant as Prime Minister, and Martine McCutcheon, as Natalie, the employee whose job apparently is to bring him his tea..  This Cinderella story starts out with the first meeting of the Prime Minister and his staff, in which Natalie delivers the unforgettable speech, ""Hello, David.  Oh, sh*t, I can't believe I just did that. Oh and now I've gone and said 'sh*t' twice.""  Not a great marital prospect for a young statesman.(If you want to see an intelligent movie about a politician's romance, rent ""The American President""(1995) with Annette Bening and Michael Douglas.)

57,howard.schumann,Heartwarming and endearing,9,4 June 2017,"Not being a huge fan of romantic comedies, I felt somewhat dubious about watching Love Actually, but I was enrolled almost immediately after the film began. With all the hatred going on in the world today, it was gratifying to see a film that is all about love - falling in love, being in love, and falling out of love. Written and directed by Richard Curtis, the film is not only about the ecstasy of young love but about love in all forms, between brothers and sisters, parents and children, and even best friends. Performed by a great ensemble cast that includes Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Rowan Atkinson, Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy, Marlene McCutcheon, and others, It is often silly and over-the-top but its British laid back humor keeps it from being sappy and the film has a freshness and vitality that makes you think (at least for a moment) about going out and seeking to find or renew the experience one more time.Of course, Love Actually is primarily a comedy but it has enough moments of genuine heartfelt emotion in which tears are not inappropriate. The story takes place in the weeks before Christmas which is a season where love and peace are supposed to be more than just New Age clichés. While there are a lot of characters to keep track of, several relationships stand out. There's the love between the widowed Daniel (Neeson) and his 11-year-old stepson, Sam (Thomas Sangster) who provides advice to the boy who has ""fallen in love"" with a girl at school who does not even know that Sam is on the planet. We also look in on the life of Britain's new Prime Minister (Grant) who bears a strong resemblance to Tony Blair. Grant plays the PM in the suave sophisticated British manner of another Grant – Cary, as he pursues his secretary Natalie with some significant reservation.In another, the PMs sister, Karen (Thompson) is afraid her husband Harry (Rickman) will leave her for an attractive coworker, Mia (Heike Makatsch). The office also knows that two of their coworkers, Sarah (Laura Linney) and Karl (Rodrigo Santoro) are in love but are too inhibited to let the other know. One of the best realized segments is about Billy Mack (Nighy), a washed-up rock singer who is trying to save his career by promoting what he acknowledges to be an awful pop-song remodeled for Christmas. Yes, there is more, perhaps too much more, but for me it was so heartwarming and endearing that it could have kept going until it covered all the romances in the world. Can I say that I loved it? Yes - actually.",Love Actually

At least once a year so that would now be at least seventeen (17) times now. Great songs, a superb cast from top to bottom, heartwarming romances, and of course a must see ""FEEL GOOD"" ending.It is most deserving of a perfect 10 for 10 IMDB rating.",Love Actually
59,insomniac_rod,Dynamic and tender. A one of it's kind.,7,23 April 2010,"I watched this movie on a Sunday afternoon and I can say it was an enjoyable watch. Not the perfect movie I was told about, but I think it serves for it's main purpose: entertain and leave a smile on your face.Most stories are meant for lovers but I liked the way some other kind of love is displayed. The step father-son relationship, the ill brother- sister relationship, the manager-artist relationship, and my favorite, the impossible love situation.There's plenty of humor, excellent settings (the French village was my favorite), nice soundtrack, acting, and a dynamic direction. This is what an all cast film should be made. Dynamic.The scenes I will always remember about this movie include Keira Knightley's character getting a ""Bob Dylan"" style love declaration, the final airport sequence, the sexy assistant and her sexual offerings to her boss, the whole Portuguese maid situation (loved her!), and the mad rocker's final speech towards his manager.Some things I didn't like about this movie: The way American girls are displayed. According to the movie, American girls are easy, trampy, stupid, party all the time, and fall easily for English men. Hey, and I'm not American! The way the Director tries to make politics ""fit"" in the plot. Was not necessary to send a political message.Anyways, this is an enjoyable watch for those who are in love or for those who like these kind of stories.",Love Actually
60,matthewssilverhammer,I'll make my own edit and raise it a star.,7,2 January 2019,"Man, we REALLY loved these interwoven epic dramas in the 2000s, didn't we? As with many anthology films, Love Actually is a hit-and-miss outing that is nothing more than the sum of its individual parts. Thankfully, the hits (porn stand-ins, Linney's brother, Rickman and Thompson, Neeson and his son, Nighy) do outweigh the misses (travels to America, Knightley and the best-man, parts of the Grant and Firth stories).",Love Actually
61,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Romantic comedy with something for everyone,8,7 December 2008,"I like the thinking behind Richard Curtis' concept for ""Love Actually."" Why tell one Christmas love story when you can tell eight? Everyone loves Christmas, everyone loves love, and if you can tell eight stories that are all related but about something different, you're bound to have everyone who sees the film relate to at least one of the story lines. It sounds sort of gimmicky when put in those terms, but with good writing and some great actors, ""Love Actually"" works and is surprisingly enjoyable despite a high cheese factor.""Love Actually"" is sort of the ultimate British-American romantic comedy. When you put Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley, Bill Nighy, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman, Laura Linney, Colin Firth, Rowan Atkinson, Billy Bob Thorton (and then some) all in the same billing, it's ridiculously impressive. You almost can't fail. I mean, at one point there is a scene featuring a sort of negotiation between Grant, the prime minister of the U.K. and Thorton, the president of the U.S. If the demographic for this film isn't overstated with Christmas and romance already, that certainly ices the cake.The story lines are for the most part all good, but with eight of them, they all don't have to be. You pick the ones that you like and you stomach the ones you don't as much because you know they won't last long enough to bore or annoy you. Some people will like the more comedic ones like Bill Nighy as a recording artist trying to re-ignite his career with a hit Christmas single and some will like the more straight up romance like when Firth, an author, tries to communicate his feelings for a Portuguese woman who doesn't speak English. Fortunately, it's not disjointed either, so you don't feel you're watching several different films. Christmas time helps set that tone, but in general the mood the film is consistent in all the story lines.Like most romantic comedies, there's always a cheese factor, but the better ones make you forgive the cheese. For the most part, ""Love Actually""'s cheese is very forgivable. Towards the end it gets a little out of hand, but you are so immersed in the story lines that you let it go. The humor of the film is also so strong that it also earns your appreciation regardless of how much you like romance.As far as film concepts that seem like romantic comedy sell-outs are concerned, ""Love Actually"" is probably one of the best. It's diverse but cohesive and funny to all senses of humor. It has a killer cast and of course good heart and strong themes. So as much as you might think you're watching just another romantic comedy about Christmas, ""Love Actually"" at least convinces you that for the time you're wrong.",Love Actually
62,Vartiainen,"Horrible morals, terrible execution, misused cast",2,6 January 2018,"Love Actually is a collage of stories centering around people living their intertwining lives in the weeks leading up to Christmas. It's also something of a Who's Who of British acting at the time of its release. Almost every single British actor worth note is in this pile of droppings. Power of Christmas, I suppose, for I see no other reason for them to debase themselves like this.So what exactly is wrong with this film? Well, the few upsides first. It is a nice looking film. The locations are nice, the stories are varied, some even interesting, and it has that Yuletide feel to it. And the actors are talented. There are some truly nice scenes and good character moments. But that's because the actors are so good, not because the script is worth anything.And the stories are terrible. Some are merely bland, like the one containing Bill Nighy and Gregor Fisher. Some are just wrong, but in a funny way, like the one with Kris Marshall. But the vast majority of them are more than a bit cringe-worthy. We have over-sexualized prepubescents, a best man wooing after the bride, an adulterer, an import bride and far far too many dudes lusting after women based solely on their looks. And this is supposed to be a Christmas movie about the concept of love. Give me a break!The only decent story, where I actually bought the chemistry and thought it kind of sweet, was the one containing Martin Freeman and Joanna Page. And their characters are porn stunt doubles. That should tell you something about this film.",Love Actually
63,lisafordeay,If you like Gary Marshalls Valentines Day you will love Richard Curtis Love ActActually uslly,6,11 December 2018,"Love Actually is a 2003 Romantic comedy starring Hugh Grant,Colin Firth,Kiera Knightly,Kris Marshall,Emma Thompson,Liam Nesson,Alan Rickman and Martine McCutheon and tells the story of a group of people who all somewhat go through ups and downs along with falling in love a long the way.
Some plots include a gay singer named Bill Mack,who sings Christmas all around, a prime minister who falls for a young Secretary, a man whos in love with his best friend whos married to someone else,another guy who falls for a Portuguese woman after he spots his former wife having an affair,another woman finds out her husband is having an affair with his secretary and many more stories intertwining together during the Christmas season.
Overall I enjoyed this film yet I hate when the plot has way too many scenarios going on.Keep an eye out for cameos from Rowan Atkinson, Ant and Dec,Elisha Culbert,January Jones,Ivana Makuviec(she was in just like heaven ) and Billy Bob Thornton.

64,GOWBTW,"With a title like that, who needs to add extra words?",9,1 February 2005,"Love, a word you can't take your mind off of. The characters in this movie explains love in all different ways. Young love, puppy love, lost love, or forgotten love. This movie is nothing but love. And I say in my opinion can be seen in any holiday, not just Christmas or Valentine's Day. But I do say, It's a good Valentine's Day movie. There's some heavy scenes there, and the cynical Brit who thinks his chum wouldn't find any American women who will love him did. He got lucky with the sister of his friend's girlfriend from Texas. The movie is a one of a kind hit in any way. You got Britain's own Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley, Rory MacGregory, Elton John and other in the cast, along with Ireland's Liam Neeson.I liked the the one who fell for the Portuguese woman who happen to take that cold swim to retrieve the story that blew in the lake. And he had to make a big deal like it was unimportant to him. The title of the movie should have been ""Love is Strange"", then again, that title would come as no surprise to anyone. Rating 4.5 out of 5 stars.",Love Actually
65,hellraiser7,Love Everywhere,10,13 December 2019,"Driver Stu from ""The Adventures of Pete and Pete"" once said, ""When love comes, you better pull over to the side of the road and open your doors, cause nothing in this life matters more."" The strange and funny thing about love is how it can just happen when we least expect it to, when we feel very little to no control over our lives, when it seems at almost the most inconvenient time it just simply happens. Just like the seasons of nature it is an element vitally needed so not just can the world be nurtured to continue to grow and thrive but our own spirits.This film is one of my favorite romance films but also an honorable mention in favorite Christmas movies. The film is sort of an anthology by its nature as the stories are focused on multiple individuals whom all somewhat are in the same place and sometimes connect and intersect with each other, but the theme is the same which is about love.To me this is one of those romance films done right for one thing each of the stories like in any anthology are short which means there's no filler and sub plot nonsense which is what plagues a lot of bad rom coms and make them forget what movie they are.Most importantly though they each keep their eye on the ball, each of the stories knows who they are and what they want to say and be which is part of why the stories and characters in them to this day are endearing and timeless. Ok, not everyone of them one or two I can leave out but like with all anthologies it's all a matter of your preference.The cast consists of an all star cast which most of the time isn't always a good mix as it's been known when most films which consist of all-star casts don't always equal good movies. But fortunately, this film is one of those case where it does, personally I feel an all-star cast film can work where you use each of them right and well but also have a good story.Though believe or not, this film didn't consist of an all star cast as only half of them were major leaguers and most others we're either unknowns or minor league players, this film was sort of a launch point for them. It makes watching the film even more interesting seeing a face or two getting their start, and anyone that has seen it before at the time thinking who knew.I'll just say a few of the stories I really like as there are a lot of them.Jamie and Aurelia: Colin Firth is just great as Jamie, I like how in the film he sort of looks like Richard Castle, ok not really but from his haircut and the way he's dressed, even a little of his character is a bit similar to that character.
Here he's a guy a bit on the introverted side, he's a little down on his luck as he has writers block or on a losing streak as he's had one bad book after another.It's also funny how his a bit of a slob as his desk are always in disarray as we see papers are dis or unorganized but also a bit of a caffeine addict as he has a series of coffee mugs pileing up his desk, this sort of reflects his whole life and even love life is in total disarray.But of course, his luck is just about to change when Aurelia comes into his life. She is played by a lovely actress, Lucia Moniz whom hasn't really done any other movies outside of her region afterward. Anyway, I really like the chemistry between the two is just beautiful as both are from two different worlds.The relationship is somewhat ironic as his profession part of what it's about is communicating with everyone around you by putting your ideas out there. We see that Aurelia really is good for him from not just making his house more livable but helping him become more assertive, do what he must do.One interesting moment is when he visits his family which I'll admit was something that came completely out of the blue. This scene works well in two ways, I really liked that look on his face which is exactly what we're all thinking, and it says, ""Wait a minute what am I doing here."" He realizes he's not where he should be that his place is with Aurelia. But also, it was sort of the broken fourth wall joke as that look is someone that suddenly walked into the wrong Christmas movie, like a scene that was just inserted at the last minute which was the point and joke. What he does at the last minutes are beautiful, I won't say anything else about this except it show both truly are on the same page.Mark and Juliet: This is another which is a small one, which involves Juliet and Mark played well by one of my favorite actress Kira Knightly and Andrew Lincoln whom weren't stars at the time. This one is simply about unrequited love; we see in one scene where Mark inadvertently fudges up a wedding video for Juliet and her husband Peter played by Chiwetel Ejiofor before he was a star.We see Mark is a guy that has always harbored feelings for Juliet but never said anything as he was too afraid to. Which is understandable for some people it's really doesn't come easy and it's not so much fear of being shot down but being misunderstood. Or even simply the fact in life you let certain things get in your way which is an easy thing for all of us to do because hey life happens and dilemmas don't solve themselves; but also, simply not believing in oneself enough. It can also be a painful dilemma and cross to harbor as it leaves people wondering what could have happened if they did make a move.Though we know it might not have made much difference as Juliet doesn't feel the same way about him as she'll always see him as a friend which is also understandable too because that's also part of life as one doesn't always feel the same way or anything more about the other, it's just simply not in the cards.But the final minutes of the story result in a timeless scene which has been parodied a lot over the years. But this scene was obviously an homage to ""A Hard Day's Night"" which of course is the cue card scene. It's just really sweet because he never says a word and he doesn't need to because in each of the cards he presents he is expressing his feelings for her but also shows how he's begun to become more assertive and find love of his own. This also goes with another quote from ""The Adventures of Pete and Pete"" which is ""If love is true, really true it doesn't need an answer.""Prime Minister and Natalie: This one of course involves Hugh Grant whom at the time was somewhat the king of romance movies. Here he plays a prime minister of the UK, it's that simple story of the man that has everything except love. And there is his secretary Natalie played by Martine McCutcheon whom I think is cute and hot, it's too bad this actress didn't have a little more afterward as she's a capable one.The interplay between both Prime Minister and Natalie is just sweet as we see both are struggling to maintain a professional relationship, but we see that cracks are forming. Both already know what they feel for one another but have not just been unassertive about those feelings but have never felt or made time for them, as we see both are too busy maintaining and living a lifestyle but not a life, hence the fact Prime Minister's real name isn't known because he has no life outside of office. This makes both sympathetic as we see it's can be a very lonely and two-dimensional existence, sure you have success but as they say what good is it without happiness, to me that can be a waste of life too.I really like it when we see the Prime Minister finally being assertive or has been given the push to it when a high ranking political member sexually harasses Natalie and the Prime Minister in a speech defends her which shows he not just shows the strength of his integrity but also how strong his feelings for Natalie really are. When the payoff happens it's just sweet because it shows how the one you love is closer than you think but also putting your feelings out there for the other isn't as hard as it seems.Love can happen everywhere to anyone, throughout the holidays.Rating: 4 stars",Love Actually

67,ianlouisiana,Miss Emma Thompson - gold amongst the dross.....,4,10 November 2005,"If you think Hugh Grant is the greatest light comedian since Cary Grant you may be able to watch his performance as the Prime Minister through slightly open fingers.If you think having a sprinkling of thespians spread thinly amongst the 2nd rate TV actors is ""fun"" and not patronising,and if you think smug trustafarians happily send their ""kids"" to bog standard comprehensive schools then you are the sort of person at whom ""Love actually"" is aimed.Martine McCutcheon,so well-scrubbed she almost gleams,seems surprised to be in this movie,as well she might.She must have got a really good agent. The story line involving her,Hugh Grant and a Clintonesque US president(whatever his other faults,G.W.Bush couldn't be said to be a ladies man) is absolutely ludicrous,and Grant's speech at the Press Conference is nearly as nauseating as his ""amusing"" best man's speech in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"". The use of the music couldn't be more blatantly manipulative and unsubtle.If someone had appeared on the screen with a card marked ""Cry now"" I wouldn't have been surprised.Only Miss Emma Thompson as a betrayed wife is the least bit believable,a vein of gold amongst the dross. Mr Neeson,as the stepfather to a precocious bad-mannered little curly top,looks as though he has remembered a subsequent,rather more important engagement and is just looking for an excuse to slip away. That rather anonymous chap from ""The Office"" is,er,rather anonymous in a particularly silly episode about two porn movie stand-ins finding love whilst pretending to have sex.. Colin Firth was not born to play the author falling in love with his Portuguese housekeeper,nor indeed any other comedy part. Rowan Atkinson is almost as bad as he would later be in ""Johnny English"" and he can't really need the money,can he? I will save the blushes of the other actors by drawing a veil over their performances. So - obviously - I didn't think a lot of it.I looked for some sign of wit,originality or even truth (heaven help me) in ""Love actually"" and Miss Thompson excepted,found none. I don't mind being manipulated by a movie - after all,that's what they do - but I don't want my intelligence being insulted at the same time.",Love Actually

69,meeza,Actually One of the Best of the Year,10,9 December 2003,"Love Actually"" actually has the credentials to be judged as the supreme romantic comedy of the year. The film follows an ensemble of lovestruck characters in a five-week period before the Christmas holidays. It combines the ingenious character-filled interrelated subplots of ""Magnolia"" with the exhilarating joyous connotations of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"". Moreover, the irony of the situation is that too much love actually leads to 4 weddings and in some cases can lead to an unexpected funeral in an unexplained magnolia occurrence. Screenwriter Richard Curtis' freshman directorial effort deserves a Curtis curtain call. Ok! Let's go back to our cupid players. Hugh Grant grants us another superb bland performance as the crafty Prime Minister who falls for one of his assistants. Alan Rickman, the famous ""Die Hard"" villain Hans Gruber, executes a towering performance as the editor who is tempted to an infidel act by his sexually obsessed secretary. Emma Thompson was also wonderful here as Rickman's endearing wife. Colin Firth, of ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" fame, was ""write"" on as a secluded writer who falls for his Portuguese aide. Liam Neeson's performance as a widowed stepfather who strongly bonds with his 10 year old stepson is in my ""Meezer's List"" as one of the best supporting performances of the year. However, I am not saying ""nighty nighty"" yet to the superb acting of ""Love Actually"" because I must commend Bill Nighy's work as an aging musician who executes the scene-stealing performances of the film. ""Love Actually"" is a cinematic classic film act to act. You actually have to see this one! ***** Excellent",Love Actually

The weakest one was that guy who loves his friend's fiancee (they get married to the Beatles' ""All you need is love""... this movie has no limits).Alan Rickman brings a touch of class in a relatively dark story that almost balances the thing out.

71,alindsay-al,a great feel good film,8,27 December 2014,"Now I am not a Rom com fan at all and I thought being made by my mum and younger sister to watch love actually was going to be awful. But to my surprise I came out of it absolutely loving it and thinking it was great. The story starts a month before Christmas and sees 8 different couples go through the journey that is love. Now with all the performers in the film they really share the lead and my goodness is this a legit cast. Big name actors such as Alan Richtman, Colin firth, Hugh Grant, Liam neeson, Bill nighy and Keira knightley are all in this film and they are all great. There isn't one bad performance in this film and that is mainly due to the high calibre of the performers in the film. Now as you can imagine with 8 stories going on the film can be a bit messy and this is true here with just way too many things to focus on and it does hurt the film. However, the majority of the stories are really thought provoking and really teach a lesson about love. The script is fantastic with the dialogue between hilarious and turning this film into mostly a comedy and making it one of the funnier films I have seen. The style is okay but sometimes London can become a bit cliché and overbearing and also this film seemed to have to connect everybody and it did make it a little hard to understand sometimes. I can't believe how good this film is and people who don't think they will like it please see it especially around Xmas time.",Love Actually
72,MaxBorg89,"Very good, actually...",8,19 October 2006,"If you want a good romantic comedy, you can always count on Richard Curtis. Having written Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill and Bridget Jones'Diary (and sequel), he's the man responsible for Love Actually, which he also directed.The film takes place a few weeks before Christmas, and tells the stories of people looking for love. Among these we find Hugh Grant's (priceless) Prime Minister, who develops feelings (""Oh no, this is so inappropriate"") for his new secretary Natalie (Martine McCutcheon); his sister Karen (Emma Thompson), trying to save her marriage with Harry (Alan Rickman, constantly looking as if he's about to announce you're terminally ill); widower Daniel (Liam Neeson), dealing with his son's love problems; one of Harry's employees (Laura Linney), who's too shy to confess she's in love with a colleague.These characters (and several others) meet throughout the film, with unexpected, hilarious and touching results. As in Four Weddings, Curtis artfully keeps the tone between affecting (the Neeson segment) and gut-burstingly funny (if you don't laugh watching Grant's dance routine, then there's something wrong). All this is largely due to an amazing ensemble cast, comprised of top class thespians from both sides of the Atlantic (Billy Bob Thornton is quite enjoyable as the President of the United States). Standouts include Curtis-regular Grant (the scene where he mocks Margaret Thatcher is comedy gold) and Bill Nighy, who deservedly won a BAFTA award for his portrayal of disgraced (and deliciously sweary) singer and former drug addict Billy Mack. Also notable: Martin Freeman (The Office) playing a porn actor and a cameo by Rowan Atkinson (ace).Overall a funny and well made film, although I must say I could have lived without a couple of episodes (one featuring Colin Firth, the other about a sex-obsessed guy going to America). But if you liked Four Weddings, Notting Hill and the rest, chances you'll like this too are very big.As Billy Mack says, love is all around...",Love Actually

Some bits were just too obvious.Basically it was the stories' structure. Some stories were good, but others fell apart and it seems they shouldn't have. And overlapping moments were forced.The two standout overlaps were the PM knocking on the door and Alan Rickman's secretary opens and tells the PM that Natalie lives next door.The other one was Atkinson at the airport. Now what both of these moments say is England is very small.The PM is looking at his brother-in-law's secretary. Surely she knew that her boss's brother-in-law was the PM. It was just too close.And Atkinson again at the airport. He is holding up Neeson, who had Thompson at his wife's funeral and her husband attempted to purchase the necklace from Atkinson.There were other characters who could have been in either one of these positions.Karl would have sufficed in either position and would have successfully looped that storyline within the movie.The problem with the movie was the three cornerstones, Grant, Thompson and Neeson (Rickman a very close fourth) shouldn't have been in contact with one another.Grant and Thompson should have never been siblings and Thompson didn't need to be an associate of Neeson's.Neeson could have held up his entire storyline just fine all on his own (when he motions for Sam to look behind him and see Joanna at the airport).Linney was a major loose thread. If nothing else, she could have been seen at the airport, returning to America, since she wasn't going to be with anyone (yea, and run out on that brother, sure. She'll send for him later) Perhaps it was the movie's working that made the weak ends so difficult.Hugh Grant, Colin Firth and Neeson all had strong stories.Two movies that sprang to my mind that did this were Pearl, about the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and Carwash.Carwash did it very well, but then that was a very confined neighborhood.Pearl was good, but a handful of characters were military and they simply were brought together as military figures and met that way.Lesley Anne Warren was the furthest out of the loop, involvement pretty much only with Robert Wagner, but then she has encounters with the Japanese woman (only major Asian figure in the movie).Any of the incredibly minor figures (Tony, the porn actors-stand ins, whatever they were) could have had the Atkinson position at the airport or something. It would have threaded the movie together much better.Perhaps I will watch it a year or so from now and get better sentiment from it.Probably.And what a shame Miss Dunkin Donut 2003 couldn't have been paired up with Billy Mack's manager or something.And why was Mack's unseen ex-girlfriend named Daisy, the same as Thompson's daughter?",Love Actually
76,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Charming Christmas classic,9,15 December 2015,"Who doesn't love Love Actually? I know I do. It's such a sentimental, goofy, overblown pile of mush and I love it even more for all those reasons. Not to sound sappy, but a lot of the situations and character interactions it entails are blunt, awkward truths made even more hilarious by an even more awkward cast, and encapsulate the true meaning of Christmas. Not all the couples work out, not all of the individual stories end well or in satisfaction for themselves or the audience. But you know what? That's life, and they make the best out of what they have at this special time of year, which is what it's really about. To balance it out, not all of them end like that; some turn out splendidly for the characters, leaving them beaming. Some learn tough lessons that are necessary for growth, some find love in storybook fashion and others are simply there for coming relief. And what comedy we get, tearful drama as well, delivered by an astoundingly massive cast of British legends, speckled by a few familiar Yankee faces as well. Liam Neeson plays a grieving father whose son (Thomas Bodie Sangster) is sick with love. Neeson's sister (Emma Watson, grounded, real, heartbreaking) deals with her irresponsible husband (Alan Rickman, incapable of a false note). The newly elected Prime Minister (Hugh Grant in flustered, fumbling glory) is attracted to his cute secretary (Martine Mcutcheon) and aloof writer Colin Firth feels pangs for his Portuguese housekeeper who speaks not a word of English. Laura Linney has a steamy office romance with Rodrigo Santoro whilst dealing with an ill sibling, Bill Nighy is hysterical as a cynical pop star learning what old age means, Keira Knightely, Chiwetel Efjor and Andrew Lincoln are involved in a subtle love triangle, and there's all kinds of interwoven people including Martin Freeman, Desmond Askew, Elisha Cuthbert, Ivana Milicevic, January Jones, Claudia Schiffer, Shannon Elizabeth, Denise Richards, Sienna Guillory, Billy Bob Thornton as the sleazy US President and a priceless Rowan Atkinson as the world's weirdest jewelry salesman. It's a big old circus of Christmas spirit with all kinds of different motivations, desires and relationships, which reach a festive fever pitch of a finale as all the stories escalate into giddy yuletide melodrama and cathartic god times that are impossible to not smile at.

77,Kdosda_Hegen,Very immature film.,3,3 January 2021,"This film sucks. It has a very simple and family friendly storyline, but it's also full of swearing, sex and nudity. So it's neither a family movie nor for adults. There are multiple stories here and some of them are clearly unfinnished. Did creators forgot them or just left them without ending on purpose, I can't tell, but the script was terrible for sure. Everything's full of cliches and stereotypes and there's barely anything interesting in this film. I guess, the song and music choice was great though. This film is a generic romantic comedy, the one we usually make fun of and avoid at all costs.",Love Actually

It somehow manages to juggle a whole bunch of characters and their stories over the course of the movie, all with satisfying resolutions. Now, I won't say that everything the movie does is perfect, because there are some choices that bother me. The most prominent example being the boy who pines for his best friend's new wife. Also, the guy who goes to America to meet girls was too over the top. But overall, it's very likeable and gives a lot of talented people some fun stuff to do. The highlight? Bill Nighy. It's always going to be Bill Nighy.",Love Actually
80,caspian1978,One wedding and a funeral,5,17 December 2004,"Love Actually, is actually, all of Hugh Grants's past films all rapped into one. You have moments of Notting Hill, Four Weddings and a Fuenral, 9 Months, etc. all seens in Love Actually, Even some actors from Bridget Jones' Diary make an appearance in this movie. An amazing cast, Love Actually doesn't get the credit it deserves as being a big motion picture. The actors in the film alone make the movie good. A typical Romantic drama / comedy withe several stories in one, the movie jumps back and forth to one romantic / drama to another. Although it works to its advantage, it also works against it. Many in the audience wished there was more story to Liam's character as well as Hugh's. The story of a single Prime Minister alone makes for a good romantic comedy. Still, Hugh is a strong supporting actor instead of the main attraction.",Love Actually
81,aidanratesmovies,"Medicore and overrated, but not as horrible as some may say",5,11 November 2021,"At times sweet and charming, but often overly sentimental and tonally awkward- Love, Actually feels more like a sugar overdose than a romantic comedy- and instead leaves you feeling more sick of love than in enjoyment of it. I will say that the film was better than I anticipated it being from its opening act, but it still feels to busy and medicore to be much fun. The film has a large and very impressive cast, but its use of so many short storylines hardly allows the film to take the potential needed to make each story actually interesting- and instead of being inspiring, or even romantic, they all end up being rather dull. The story with Hugh Grant is probably the best the film has to offer, although the film can be rather inconsistent on when it wants to bring that side of the spectrum to the light of day- as well as many of the other stories- making it confusing at times and all together just disorienting. The actors all try their best, but Grant is definitely the most charming throughout, providing the soul the film needs by being himself- even if it is far from perfect. As i've said before the films tone can be rather off at times, with its pacing moving too fast or too drawn out, moments feeling more creepy than in any way romantic, or the film just being too corny to bare at times. It ends up being mostly entertaining, and it has its sweeter moments for sure, but I can't help but look at this film as such a wasted and misguided opportunity. In the end, Love Actually means well, but lacks the impact it so confidently thinks it has- and instead ends up feeling like more of a dud with good moments than at all a highly praised christmas flick.My Rating: 5.2/10.",Love Actually
82,ShootingShark,Prurient British Romantic Codswallop - Avoid At All Costs,3,26 June 2005,"Over the course of a few weeks leading up until Christmas, various friends and relations fall in and out of love and examine their relationships.This is what's generally known as a feelgood movie, but it had the opposite effect on me. It's not really about being in love, it's about the happy, giddy feeling of infatuation - it neglects to mention all the deeper emotions and complications which arise when you are in love with someone, and whenever it looks like it might start to get close to that (a grieving widower, a wife who suspects her husband has fallen in love with someone else), it makes sure it moves quickly onto something lighter. It's very badly written - vacuous and predictable, and somehow both unnecessarily vulgar and repellently sickly-sweet at the same time - which is a shame since its writer-director wrote some of the best British TV comedy of the eighties. Visually, it's tedious, and its soundtrack consists entirely of bland love songs. Its only asset is its huge cast, but since none of them have anything interesting to do or say they are mostly wasted. Big stars like Neeson, Rickman and Thornton are just plain slumming, Grant does his insufferable usual charming Lord Snot routine and most everyone else is just a Pretty Person. Only Linney and Thompson come close to drama and only Nighy (as an ageing Rod Stewart-type lothario rocker) says anything funny. If you want to see a real movie about love, made by grownups, watch any of the films of Ingmar Bergman, John Cassavetes or Nicolas Roeg, not this bland, superficial, ingratiating pap.",Love Actually
83,triple8,The sweetness of this gem of a movie is irresistible.,9,22 November 2003,"What a sweet feel good movie! I liked Love Actually very much actually! The movie's central theme is-what else-love. And how love can be found anywhere. You just have to look for it. OK-call the movie sappy, call it corny etc-but also call it good, very good. In a time when there are so many movies where the central themes are violence and indeed at a time when there is so much violence all around us-not just the movies-isn't it NICE to have a sweet little fairytale of a movie once in awhile? Now some people have said there were to many stories in the movie and although I could understand that I enjoyed all of them. Some stories got more time then others and I did feel that some should have got more time that didn't. Still thats a minor criticism. GO SEE THE MOVIE IF YOU HAVEN'T! It'll leave you feeling good. And some scenes will make you laugh hysterically, there is a lot of humor in this movie too.SPOILERS: My only problem with the movie was with Laura Linny(Sarah's) storyline. It was not wound up neatly-to the contrary it seems like the writers forgot about her completely. I know that not everything can end happy in real life. Still-if the movie was going for sappy and uplifting it should have gone all the way. To just leave one of the best story lines hanging like that-it took away a little something. Even if Sarah and Carl did NOT wind up together there should have been a final scene between them. Also the whole theme of the movie is you should speak out and proclaim how you feel. So why didn't Sarah speak out to Carl and just TELL him about her brother? I think, though, the writers were trying to say that love comes in many ways and her story was about her love for her brother rather then her love for a boyfriend. Still I'm a sucker for happy endings so I didn't like that!All in all though I still felt Love Actually was a nine of 10. And the BEST scenes by far was the opening and closing(people hugging in the airport etc). When life feels particularly bitter, a movie like this is heaven. Definitely one of the must see movies of the year!",Love Actually
84,Sherazade,The Brits are trying to make a point...,2,8 April 2006,"we pulled out all over top guns and then some and yet this fluff is all we could come up with. Like anybody would every believe a person like Kiera Knightley would marry a Black man. Portraying graphic sex in what should have been a family holiday movie? How classy! And those anti-American statements were just too tacky. While I don't know how true it is that an average American girl would have sex with the ugliest of Brits just because of his accent, I just found the Bill Bob Thorton president scene to be a bit much. Yeah, so Americans have stereotyped Brits for years as the villains in their films. That's not actually a stereotype y'know? You do the math. Anways, let's talk about the film if you care for my review. That stuck up Hugh Grant narrates how after 9/11 (yeah they're that tacky to use 9/11 to gain sentiments) people seem to understand that Love actually is all around us. Then the film proceeds to show all sorts of British relationships and how they all have their ups and downs. And they throw in a few Americans in negative roles just for affirmative action I guess. Who knows. The film stars Bill Nighy, Gregor Fisher, Rory MacGregor, Colin Firth, Sienna Guillory, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Lulu Popplewell, Kris Marshall, Heike Makatsch, Martin Freeman, Joanna Page, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Andrew Lincoln, Keira Knightley, Bill Bob Thorton, and Laura Linney just to mention a few. A few wise Brits like Rachel Weisz and Catherine Zeta Jones wisely avoided this canker-worm of a film like a bad rash. They couldn't get Kate Winslet (that wise darling) to come her waste her two cents in it, so they stole a scene from Titanic and put it in the film. Yes, they are that tacky! I could sit here and list everything that's wrong with this pretentious overblown, over praised and overzealous film but y'know what? I'll rather go punch a wall.",Love Actually
85,rosscinema,"Charming ""Love Actually""",7,30 November 2003,"This is the definitive romance film and its not just about one couple but about twelve! This film runs about 2 hours and 10 minutes and it crams a lot of characters and events into that span of time. Emma Thompson is Karen and she is married to Harry (Alan Rickman) and things seem to be fine but she notices the obvious flirting between him and his secretary. Things get worse when she finds out that he bought an expensive piece of jewelry for her. Liam Neeson plays a recently widowed man named Daniel and his stepson Sam (Thomas Sangster) is in love with an American girl at school and together they try and figure out how he can get her to notice him. Hugh Grant is The Prime Minister and on his first day in office he meets Natalie (Martine McCutcheon) who works for him and he is attracted to her. We watch an aging rock star named Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) who has put out a bad Christmas CD and he has come to realize that he has no one in his life after all these years. Harry works with Sarah (Laura Linney) who is in love with  Karl (Rodrigo Santoro) but is too shy to tell him. Colin Firth is a writer named Jamie and he falls in love with his Portuguese housekeeper Aurelia (Lucia Moniz) but there is a language barrier keeping them from communicating they're feelings. A young bride named Juliet (Keira Knightley) finds out that her husbands best friend has been secretly in love with her since the beginning and she is stunned. A young man named Colin (Kris Marshall) can't find a girl and thinks that its because they're British so he decides to travel to Wisconsin where he can find an American girl.
This film is directed by Richard Curtis who is the great writer of such films as ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" as well as ""Notting Hill"". Romantic stories are his forte and he possesses a real knack for creating romantic scenarios for characters. This is the first time Curtis has directed a film and he manages to juggle a plethora of events and characters and he does pull it off for the most part. Some of the stories work better than others like the Emma Thompson/Alan Rickman crisis and Bill Nighy practically steals the film as an aging rock star. Hugh Grant also fairs pretty well as The Prime Minister in love and he seems to be cut out of the same mold as Cary Grant. Others don't come off very well and I think Kris Marshall as Colin going to Wisconsin is totally ridiculous and contrived. Nothing seems to come of Linney and her infatuation with a co-worker. It was never resolved and just seems to fade away without any closure. But this is a genuinely charming film and has so many romantic moments in them that I'm sure any viewer can find one or two that work best for them.",Love Actually
86,Galina_movie_fan,Life is full of interruptions and complications but true love lasts a lifetime.,8,30 April 2009,"Love, Christmas, London, England Richard Curtis, the talented writer of the very successful Four Weddings and Funeral, Nottting Hill, and Bridget Jones' Diary, and one of Mr. Bean's the creators, wrote and directed Love Actually, and what a directing debut it is. The ultimate romantic dramedy, the film that is not ashamed to be sweet, heartwarming, and outrage romantic. Love Actually talks about love, romances, break-ups, moving on, and does it admirably. This is the film I can watch over and over - during Christmas time or spring time, or summer, and it always brings warmth, humor, laughs, sadness, and yes, Love that is everywhere, just look a little closer. This is the film that makes me smile and even brings the tears to my eyes - all at once. Love Actually gives romantic comedy its good name back. It is a very good movie - sometimes, close to perfect, gorgeous, sweet in the good sense of the word and always lovely.First, and foremost, I admire the film for outstanding (and I mean it) cast. Some of the best British and American and European actors (and there is also simply gorgeous Rodrigo Santoro who deserves a special mention) play twenty or even more Londoners who were hit by the Cupid's arrow during the Christmas season of 2003 in absolutely stunningly looking, lively and bright London. I won't be original if I say that the funniest character belongs to Bill Nighy as once super-famous rock star (in Keith Richard's type) who is making his comeback with an old love song that he is turning in the Christmas super hit. Another outstanding performance belongs to divine Emma Thompson. She brings depth and real emotions into her and Alan Rickman's story of the marriage in crisis. Laura Linney's story of love that was so close and possible but not meant to be was also very well told and acted.This time, Liam Neeson's story as a newly widower with the young step-son who is desperately in love with the most popular girl in school, touched me the most. After recent untimely tragic death of Neeson's wife, the mother of his two sons, Natasha Richardson, the story feels the most poignant and sweetest. The scene during Daniel's wife funeral, his speech celebrating Joanna's life, moved me almost to tears.Yes, it is a long movie and it tells the stories of 20 people or so who all happen to live, work, fell in love, sometimes have their hearts broke in London that I've never seen so bright and lovely as in this picture - perhaps, because the stories start five weeks prior to Christmas and end on Christmas night. With so many intertwining stories, not all of them are equally good. Some could be dropped, leaving the movie shorter, leaner, and perhaps better but even the way it is, Love Actually deserves its place on such top lists as Best of 2003, Favorites, and Favorite Romance. It is beautiful and magical - just like the season during which it takes place.",Love Actually
87,nycritic,All You Need is Love,8,11 January 2006,"London, and its citizens, are in love in Richard Curtis' debut film LOVE ACTUALLY, which tells the intertwining stories of about a dozen characters, all experiencing different forms of love during the course of the Christmas holidays. There is the love between siblings, love that isn't reciprocated, love amongst friends, young teens, lovers, spouses, family members, politicians, co-workers, and the list goes on.This, of course, is not a bad thing -- Curtis manages to fill his story lines with a large cast of mainly British actors who have all in one form or the other been in successful romantic comedies, but with so many stories, one gets the feeling that at times, either the film should have been longer, more episodic, or made into a two-part miniseries.But as it is, LOVE ACTUALLY is a pretty good feature film that managed to bring more smiles and tears than anger and frustration. Most of the story lines, if not all, resolve themselves much in the tradition of feel-good films and while sometimes a bit much on the sugary elements, it entertains, especially in one sequence where Liam Neeson's character's son runs through security at the airport in order to get a response from the girl he loves.Maybe not the definitive romantic comedy of the year as it was touted, but one that tugs the emotions in all the right places, and sets out to do what it's supposed to do: make you cuddle up with your partner, sip some hot tea, and enjoy.",Love Actually
88,eric262003,Not Enough Grant But Too Much Elevator Music,7,23 April 2018,"Due to his stature as the icon for British culture, complete with with aristocratic accents, and an immaculate view of upper-class London, writer/director Richard Curtis truly has the substance factor in his favour. However in his holiday season themed film ""Love Actually"", he throws all that posh out the window in resorts to sentimental gush, saccharine music and indecorous humour. This is a far cry from ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"".It's great that Curtis called up his partner in crime Hugh Grant to be one of the stars in ""Love Actually"", but he's been rendered down to a small supporting role and is lost in the crowd to the over-stacked ensemble cast. Grant plays the part of David, who's been a newly elected British Prime Minister, his comical moments truly usurps the other who's who in this ultra-British cast that includes Emma Thompson, Bill Nighy and Alan Rickman. In his witty and subtle demeanour, Grant has become a stapled icon in the romantic comedy genre and can generate a lot of humourous moments with his twitches and in this instant, the shake of his tush.A character break into dance mode has become common in romantic comedies, but Grant conveys a new and eccentric twist to what is an awkward predicament. When he was dancing to The Pointer Sisters' ""Jump (For My Love)"" we can see how embarrassed he his doing it, but his sportsmanship is something we can applaud to. With all these intertwining subplots, the one that's barely given screen time involves around Prime Minister David as he's mitten over his ravishing assistant Natalie (Martine McCutcheon). The chemistry between the sophisticated Prime Minister and the slightly lower class help is the one that sparked my interest the most. McCutcheon even adds an original twist to her character by breaking the cliche of the cute newly in love assistant by unceremoniously swearing at her superior.The opening scenes centres around the week before the holiday season as the ever-present variation of a Mod rock song ""Love is All Around"" with a hint of holiday cheer is rubbed into our faces. Yes the British love their pop music and Curtis is not ashamed to exploit that to us. He did a similar thing in ""Four Wedding and Funeral"" with ""Bye Bye Baby"" by the Bay City Rollers. This eye-roller sets the tone of many absurd things to come.With a myriad of romantic subplots, they could all stretch to half an hour segments before we see them one more time. Sadly, not all of them were not given enough time and could've easily been edited out. One example would be the body doubles John and Judy (Martin Freeman and Johanna Page) who are dating quietly while giving fake orgies on the movie sets. Or the story involving a hopeless romantic named Colin (Kris Marshall) who travels to America to use his British accent to woo hot women, which to me felt like an overlong coke commercial. Still most of the stories work due to the talent pool and the good vibes it brings to the story.Liam Neeson is wonderful as a widowed man named Daniel who's 11 year old stepson Sam (Thomas Sangster) seeks his first crush, an American girl named Joanna (Olivia Olson). Sangster conveys a daring and dashing presence of energy in his character, but his drive feels too young and forced for his age. However, his comic skills when he meets his dreamboat for the first time is flawless.Colin Firth plays a sympathetic note here as Jamie who after feeling betrayed by his girlfriend (Sienna Guillory) hides out to his French cottage and gets love-struck by his Portuguese maid Aurelia (Lucia Moniz) though they can't speak each other's language, the magic comes from the fact that the language of love bears no boundaries. Moniz embodies a keen sense of intelligence and seductiveness to her character. Both Moniz and McCutcheon are more interesting performers than the more established ones here. Emma Thompson's housewife Karen believes that her husband Harry (Alan Rickman) is secretly having an affair with his sultry receptionist, Mia (Heike Makatsch). Thompson and Rickman's talents are badly wasted here and their cliched ways proves the point here. The love between each other makes it hard to believe that Harry is a cheater and when Karen who was expecting an expensive necklace from Harry as a Christmas gift only to realize that the gift was not for her (her's was a Joni Mitchell CD) we get the music score running with Mitchell's weary version of ""Both Sides Now"". The song was nice I felt bad for Karen, but it still was drained out.Laura Linney plays Sarah, who works at Harry's company and is attracted to her co-worker Karl (Rodrigo Santoro), but the relationship is set back due to her mentally ill brother, Michael (Michael Fitzgerald). Sure Curtis like to include somber pieces to his agenda, but the thing that transpire in this subplot results in strange and jarring moments. Bill Nighy has equal comical moments as Grant playing a has-been rock star knows his best years are behind him, but still has some optimism that his awful holiday song might be the keys to comeback and promotes this song at a gala event hosted by Sir Elton John. While he and his partner Joe (Gregor Fisher) spend the holidays inebriated and watching porn.Yes the British strive to get a #1 single has been a tradition since the 1960's which has a community feeling in the UK than it does in America. Sure the cost of oneness is expensive, especially having to deal with saccharine music.",Love Actually
89,Matt_Layden,Best Romantic Comedy Ever?,8,20 July 2009,"This film surprised me. I did not know what to expect, I thought it was going to be another cookie cutter romantic comedy, only with a big cast. What I got is my favourite romantic comedy of all time. This film is touching, hilarious and extremely well made considering the amount of characters it had to juggle with.Everyone in the cast is wonderful, from Hugh Grant as the dancing Prime Minister to Liam Neeson's brooding widow father role. My favourite character was Bill Nighy. This was my first introduction to him and I loved every minute he was on screen. He was so funny and has been in every role since then. This was also my introduction to Keira Knightley, who doesn't really get that much to do but looks gorgeous. I final shout out to Martin Freeman as the porn stand in, too funny.This is a great film to watch to get in the mood for Christmas and ranks in my top 5 to watch during that season. Richard Curtis, in his directorial debut, handles numerous characters and story lines with ease. Not once did I think they were concentrating too much on one or not enough on another.In one of my favourite scenes, which is heartbreaking and a homage to Bob Dylan, Andrew Lincoln tells Knightley how he 'really' feels about her. This is all done through giant index cards and not a word is spoken between the two. Beautiful, funny and heartbreaking all at the same time.Give this film a go if you haven't already and since you'll be reading this during the Christmas season, it's the perfect time to throw it on.",Love Actually

It could probably have anything you ever wanted in a romance. There's the old marriage proposal in a restaurant and language barriers.The acting is great by all of the cast. There are some sweet and sometimes very funny moments in the film. There are some very great dialog in the film too.In this world, you probably think there are greedy and bad people out there but this film actually shows that love is all around us. It even mentions the 9/11 moment where each people call their families with love rather than hatred.This is a very well made film that is light-hearted and funny at times. If you don't mind this film being that long, then you can watch it if you want to.",Love Actually
91,tomsview,Pre-loved,6,8 September 2013,"The perfect Christmas movie for the family? Well, no actually. It's too raunchy for that. Early in the movie, Martin Freeman and Joanna Page play nude stand-ins for a couple of movie stars who are about to film a sex scene. One can see why it wasn't cut out to get a lower censorship classification; it is funny in a film that is rather hit or miss.Set in the weeks leading up to and after Christmas, ""Love Actually"" is not exactly a Christmas turkey, but it does serve up generous slices of Christmas ham. Created by Richard Curtis, the writer of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""Notting Hill"" and the screenplay for ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", ""Love Actually"" falls short of the clever insights and the originality of those previous works, however the film's hectic structure doesn't give you time to dwell on such misgivings.The film features nine stories and a score of characters. Some of the stories are linked, but the theme of love in all its variations weaves its way through them all.In a role that predates the real tragedy that befell Liam Neeson, his character, Daniel, attempts to adjust to life after his wife dies. He is left with an eleven-year-old stepson, Sam, played by Thomas Sangster who has a crush on a girl at school. Trying to get the girl interested in Sam brings the two together. Another story features Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman. They play a couple dealing with the pressures that getting older has placed on their marriage – and from the pretty young secretary in Rickman's office.The two protagonists from ""Bridget Jones Diary"", Colin Firth and Hugh Grant star in separate tales in this film. Firth is a writer who heads to the South of France to escape a broken relationship only to find a more meaningful, and unexpected one. Hugh Grant offers another variation of his self-deprecating charm as the new Prime Minister of England. He becomes infatuated with Martine McCutcheon as Natalie, a caterer at Downing Street. The cheekiness of this scenario is one of the surprises of the script.Bill Nighy gets the best lines in the film as aging, burnt-out rocker, Billy Mack who is cutting a Christmas album from one of his old hits. His long-time manager and friend, Joe, helps him through the trials of a comeback. The saddest tale has Laura Lindley playing a woman who is torn between her needs and of those of her mentally ill brother.Andrew Lincoln as Mark loses the love of his life, Juliet, played by Keira Knightly, when she marries his best friend. Unfortunately, the resolution of this sequence is the least believable of all the stories.Kris Marshall is Colin Frissell, a gauche young guy who thinks his English manner and accent will work magic for him with American women – he's right.Like the story, the soundtrack is a mixed bag and features Nora Jones, Dido, and The Beach Boys. While Craig Armstrong's towering anthems supercharge the emotions, they wouldn't be out of place in a movie about final victory in World War Two.Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue just about sums up ""Love Actually"" – not as memorable as some of Curtis' other rom coms but enjoyable enough while it plays.",Love Actually
92,mjw2305,One of the best romantic comedies ever,8,21 January 2007,"Its totally different to most others in the genre, it stereotypes the clichés and then mocks them beautifully, it explores different types of love, couples, married couples, kinship, business relationships, etc. There's actually eight stories in this film, some cross over, some blend together and some stand alone, but they all play wonderfully; and the humour is consistent from start to finish.Littered with top names, and scripted by the brilliant Richard Curtis -Love Actually breaks the mould of the romantic comedy genre while remaining totally appealing to the fans of the tradition.8/10 Brilliant",Love Actually
93,Cosmoeticadotcom,Good little film,7,14 September 2008,"The start and end of the film takes place at Heathrow, where a montage of people being greeted by their loved ones is lent poignancy by the opening narration of Hugh Grant stating that all the known messages left by the people who died on the 9/11 airplanes were messages of love and not hate, and the closing song of the Beach Boys' God Only Knows. Also effective is the use of cameos in the film, most notably as dream babes such as Claudia Schiffer, Denise Richards, and Shannon Elizabeth make brief appearances in the airport as love interests for some of the diverse characters, who we see now have known each other in casual ways, each with different takes on love.Is Love Actually a film that will challenge you the way 2001: A Space Odyssey does?

For instance, there is a British guy named Colin who wants to go to America so he can hook up with American women. Because British women aren't his type.Liam Neeson plays a widowed step father who's step son is in love with a girl. So he teaches him about the birds and the bees. This is one of my all time favorite films ever. He's just not that into you was like this movie. It lacked humor. Also, it was way too serious and way to real. Love actually is a serious film also. Not as serious or real though. He's Just not that into you was okay, but Love actually is a fun film to watch. The person that made the movie for me was Bill Nighy. Nighy played Billy Mac, an ex-heroin addict who starts getting famous again by doing a remake of a famous song. Love is all around.

My review mainly concerns my opinion on the performances of the cast and the quality of the writing.I didn't see 'Love Actually' until a year after its release when it was repeated on a satellite movie channel. Though it did not strike me as a wonderful film, far from it, I was rather taken with the thoughtful message behind it, the message being that even in a world full of hate, war, greed, intolerance and destruction, in the words of the famous song ( which is sent-up here ), 'love is all around'.Impressive in their parts are the late Alan Rickman, Martine McCuttcheon, Hugh Grant ( in what I consider to be his only decent acting role ), Emma Thompson, Bill Nighy, Gregor Fisher, Sienna Guillroy, Martin Freeman, Joanna Page, Kris Marshall, Billy Bob Thornton and Heike Makatsch.Not so memorable. in my personal view however, were Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Rowan Atkinson, Laura Linney, Rodrigo Santoro and Olivia Olson.Many of the cast seem to have profited from the success of the film. Emma Thompson later landed the lead role of the kids' comedy film 'Nanny McPhee'. Bill Nighy and Gregor Fisher both appeared together in the 2010 assassin comedy 'Wild Target', Sienna Guillroy was awarded the role of Jill Valentine in 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' while Billy Bob Thornton gave us 'Bad Santa'.'Love Actually' is sometimes hard to follow at times but on the whole I liked it and, whilst not the biggest favourite of mine, there were some fine moments in the film which made it memorable.This year, a short sequel was made for 'Comic Relief', reuniting its cast, minus Gregor Fisher, his character having been killed off, much to the dismay of many of the film's fans.",Love Actually
98,vithiet,Meh actually.,5,2 December 2020,"I feel bad for not liking it because 1. I'm a big fan of rom coms and 2. this is one of my good friend's favorite movies. But I just couldn't get pass the overly cheesy stories, frequent overacting, enormous plot holes (bordering on nonsensical situations), terrible 90s vibe (especially for a movie from 2003), all of it punctuated by annoying music. I see how people can see this movie as cute but I really couldn't get into it, which is weird considering how I usually am a sucker for sappy flicks.",Love Actually
99,sarastro7,"Yeah, profanity is soooo romantic...",3,30 December 2004,"A rating for this movie of 7.8 is ludicrous. I'm glad to see that *some* others besides me finds this to be, well, drivel. And sexist. After watching this, what little respect I had left for Richard Curtis has been shredded good and well. It's a conundrum to me why this movie was such a success (no, actually it isn't: it's because of all the big name actors in it - no other reason. Well, except for the fact that most people have no taste); in my opinion it has all the hallmarks of a disaster. It is pretentious and over-sentimental, and in many scenes can't decide if it wants you to take them seriously or not. There are good bits here and there, but they are swallowed up by the tastelessness of the whole. I feel sorry for the frequently excellent Colin Firth that he's primarily getting known for horrendous comedy crap like this and that Bridget Jones tripe.3 out of 10.(Having said that, I must remark that the song towards the end by that kid, Olivia Olson, was fantastic. All I could think was ""Impossible! No 10-year-old can have such a voice!"" But she has. I'm certainly going to get her debut album when it comes out, that's for sure.)",Love Actually
100,ODDBear,Pure movie magic,10,30 August 2004,"I can't exactly say why I love this film so much, I just do. 
This is one of two, maybe three movies I have seen in my lifetime that I can say is just perfect.  Everything falls into place here.  Every character is interesting, well written and expertly performed by the most irresistable cast ever.  Every story is touching and you wouldn't want to drop any from the film.  If I had to pick a favourite, Colin Firth's romantic adventures and his unforgettable proposal.  And also, who wouldn't want Hugh Grant as Britain's next Prime Minister.The 2 hours plus go by too fast, actually. You laugh, you sigh, you cry (well, very nearly) and when it's over you're all cheered up. 
If that's not movie magic I don't know what is.",Love Actually
101,Stampsfightclub,Love is all around - except in the overall feeling,4,9 December 2009,"In a collection of different love stories in Britain the Prime Minister (Grant) falls in love, a young boy falls in love with a singer and an office worker chooses his colleague over his wife for Christmas.Richard Curtis' directional debut brings about his familiar agenda of love and lust and everything relating to the emotion and with an array of renowned names and faces from Britain this was a guaranteed smash at the right time in 2003.Curtis' collection of writing credits has spurned many films and honours in the 20th century with enjoyable romantic comedies such as Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill. Then after a successful Bridget Jones' Diary adaptation came this, the Christmas extravaganza of 2003, packed with more stars than you can count and whilst the records may say differently, this is a pretty standard flick.Defining the genre of romance is relatively easy. Guy likes girl, girl likes guy, someone has an affair, a kid complicates life etc the formula is generically familiar and Curtis takes the conventional format and attempts bravely but foolishly to mix all the formats with all the celebrities into one film, and this sends the film in a downward spiral.One example is the Prime Minister's sister is having trouble with her husband who is contemplating sleeping with his work colleague who ends up telling the Prime Minister where the love of his life is, next door. Everyone at the airport feels too good to be true. All in all, wrapping everything up in a tight package does not give any sense of realism to proceedings, and neither does the gut wrenching scripting.A perfect example is Colin Firth's story where he speaks perfect English but his assistant only speaks Portuguese and yet when he says one thing and her subtitles are exactly the same. Funny? Not really when you know the inevitable outcome and wish they would just get it over with. This film will test the patience of it's viewer thanks to similar agendas and messages with its multiple stories.One scene in the airport where Liam Neeson's son Thomas Sangster dives past professional bodyguard's in an attempt to tell a girl he has never spoken to that he loves her. This will either make you laugh at the silliness or turn away and pretend to be somewhere else. I'm all for romantic gestures but this is no ending to 'When Harry met Sally'; this is a completely exaggerated fantastical depiction of love.There are the odd moments of comedy that work regardless. Kris Marshall's sex generator is amusing and the scene in America is a standout and Bill Nighy is easily the best out of the bunch with a stereotypical rock star.If its Christmas this is a bit of fun but ultimately the romantic stories are too unrealistic in the sense of being too picture perfect and the sleazy standard multi narrative never lets up with too many characters with too much personal agendas to concentrate on.",Love Actually
102,tbills2,Love Actually's Actually Very Good,7,25 November 2019,Love Actually is actually really good. The versatile ensemble cast is all-time great. Love Actually's actually an excellent Christmas movie even though it has nothing to do with Christmas but people are desperate for good Xmas movies because there are just not enough of them to go 'round it seems like but you just have to take what you get. Love Actually's actually really funny too. I adore Love Actually! It's a British hit. I love Laura Linney. She makes the movie with her performance. Good stuff. This is how you do intertwining character stories in a romcom with a bunch of stars from the United Kingdom. I especially like cutie Martine McCutcheon as Natalie. I wish she did more Hollywood movies she's great. LA is actually a classic Xmas movie that you can rewatch again and again. It's good basically. With a lot of Xmas cheer.,Love Actually
103,The_Movie_Cat,Is it possible for a film to be so smug that you can actually choke on it?,5,6 March 2004,"Because I found myself gagging at this cavalcade of middle class self-satisfied dross and needed the sick bag when I saw Emma Thompson on the screen. Add to this a cameo role for Rowan Atkinson and we're in business.Yes, it's the return of Richard Curtis. You remember him, surely? He was the one who made us all laugh with his film about posh people who said ""f***"" a lot. Then there was his follow-up film about posh people who said ""f***"" a lot. Not forgetting the one about posh people who said ""f***"" a lot. Well, he's back, still not presenting us with anything approaching a genuine human emotion and yes, posh people do indeed say ""f***"" a lot. Well, to be fair, only a bit this time around.Because Curtis has at least branched out, making this the most watchable of his luvvied-up monstrosities by presenting us with a series of vignettes. Naturally, we get Hugh Grant and his ""I'm posh, whoops, I've said f***, and here's a dead pan take to a blatantly obvious social juxtaposition"" shenanigans. To be honest, I do quite like Hugh despite myself, so he doesn't produce the biggest allergic reaction. Neither does Thompson, who gets the most depth, and the story that doesn't have a happy ending. Probably the biggest non-starter is the sweet rendition of All You Need Is Love which then unfolds into a full brass band playing in the church. Well, imagine that! A full brass band! In a church of all places! How I laughed.Some have actually criticised Curtis for not splicing his vignettes together successfully enough, like they're watching Robert Altman or even Kurosawa. For God's sake, it's just some tatty comedy for posh people who don't get out much, it's not supposed to be art. Yet while I give the writer/director some slack there, it must be said that not all of his pieces actually go anywhere. Particularly of note is the one with the talented Kris Marshall, who dreams of going to America where he believes all US girls will want to sleep with him because of his accent. So he goes there and... four US girls sleep with him because of his accent. And the punchline is...?Despite coming out of the noxious All You Need Is Love scene, Keira Knightley and Andrew Lincoln do come off better than most, Lincoln because he gets to, like Thompson, show something beneath the self-amused surface, and Knightley, well, just because I would. Big time. Other highlights include two pairs of bare breasts, Bill Nighy in parts, two pairs of bare breasts, some gratuitous cameos, two pairs of bare breasts, an okayish yarn for Colin Firth and two pairs of bare breasts.But this is the wacky, zany world of Richard Curtis, a land where everyone is a great British eccentric, and even the sole working class character (Martine McCutcheon) and her family are just offbeat and loveable. It opens by allying itself with the events of September 11th, an event nicely re-alluded to at the end by a so-so scene that shows lax airport security. This is a world where everyone talks, hugs and can find true love... just as long as they're straight, able-bodied, middle class and good-looking. 
You do have to question in what reality the Prime Minister's nephews and nieces would go to the same school as the kids from the roughest end of town, though thankfully with Nighy's ""Christmas Is All Around"" life didn't imitate non-art. On the one hand fairly amusing, on the other a smug self-reflexive reference to his own Four Weddings and a Funeral, the real record-buying public saw the film's No.1 Christmas single barely trouble the top thirty. It's a small phyrric victory in a war of bland.",Love Actually
104,gregsrants,Will leave your cheeks hurting from grinning for 2+ hours,8,3 December 2003,"Films with ensemble casts and multiple story lines are not easily put together with success.   Directors, at the time of filming, are not able to predict to which of the characters an audience might have an emotional attachment or which story line might be of most interest.  Even the most crafted of directors, namely Robert Altman, has had more failures with this practice (Cookie's Fortune, Pret-a-Porter) than successes. 
With film history not exactly on its side, it is even more incredible that Love Actually, works, and works rather well.  Writer/Director Richard Curtis, known for such romantic flicks as Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral, assembled as many hip British actors as the marquee would allow including Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Bill Nighy and Liam Neeson,  and threw them into a comedic script that is cut into so many segments, that a small review cannot possibly cover.
What Curtis does that is so refreshing is that he never stays on one storyline more than 10 minutes (which is actually quite back and forth considering the 130+ minutes running time), yet he never leaves us with a serial cliffhanger as he moves from character to character.  Each segment gives us enough of each story without over saturating us with a specific plot development.  And the surprising part is how well it works.Actually, the only thing that doesn't fit are the American actors and their contributions to the mix.  Billy Bob Thornton plays the President of the United States that is awkwardly caught trying to seduce the English Prime Ministers intern and Laura Linney plays a down on her luck workaholic that spends more time tending to her sick brother than dealing with her emotional needs.  The President sub-plot was too forced as if Curtis was trying to use his soapbox to make a post 9/11 political statement, and Laura Linney's woes just take from the joyfulness of the overall film.  A Curtis favorite, Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) is given a moment that should also have seen the cutting room floor.However, when all is said and done and the stories all come together and intersect like a loosely wound Tarantino movie, you notice that the two plus hours have been more than enjoyable and that your cheeks are sore from grinning so much.  So, Love Actually is the 2003 Serendipity of the holiday season, a good date movie that at least gives you your money's worth.",Love Actually
105,Rogue-32,A labor of love actually,8,24 November 2003,"The greatest thing about this movie (and there are a LOT of great things) is how it's edited -- although we have a lot of stories running simultaneously, thanks to the brilliant editing (which cleverly employs music as a tool to link the scenes) we are able to juggle these stories with no problem whatsoever.  This is a very rich and rewarding film, loaded with heart, unabashed romanticism and just enough 'reality check' elements to keep it grounded. Kudos to all concerned.",Love Actually
106,agmoldham,Sickly sweet but without the honey,6,20 January 2004,"There's no real surprise in the fayre served up by this movie. It's a movie of the feel good variety, but there's at least a few of the characters that don't have everything their own way.The film would have been more interesting if it would have focussed on a smaller number of relationships. We don't ever really get a deep understanding of any of the relationships which is a shame, since it would have been nice to get to know some of them a bit better.Alan Rickman is excellent as the grumpy Harry and his relationship with his wife Karen (Emma Thompson) and secretary Mia is the most complex and interesting  of the relationships. In terms of laughs Bill Nighy steels the show and the rest of the cast all contribute exactly what you would expect of them. There isn't anything outstanding in the movie, but it's a fairly pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. If you like Brit Rom Coms such as 4 Weddings, Notting Hill then you're more or less guaranteed to enjoy this.",Love Actually
107,FilmOtaku,Underwritten and overambitious,4,6 November 2004,"'Love Actually', written and directed by Richard Curtis is a romantic dramedy which pretty much runs the gambit in terms of relationship stereotypes. Hunker down, here are the basic story lines: It's a few days until Christmas, and Billy Mack, (Bill Nighy) is a washed up, boozed out former pop idol who has an unlikely hit with a crap Christmas song. With his newly formed fame, he finds his chummy relationship with his slobby, average-Joe manager faltering as he makes the talk show circuit. Sarah (Laura Linney) has had a crush on a co-worker in her office, but she proves to be weighted down by the baggage of having a mentally ill brother who calls her three dozen times a day. Harry (Alan Rickman) is Sarah's boss, who is married to Karen (Emma Thompson), and is seriously considering cheating with his secretary. Hugh Grant is the newly elected Prime Minister of England and Karen's brother, who begins to fall for a member of his staff. Daniel, (Liam Neeson) has just lost his wife to cancer, and his young son reveals that he is in love with a young girl in his class, but doesn't know how to show it. (He's about 10 by the way) Jamie Bennett (Colin Firth) is a writer who breaks up with his girlfriend and falls in love with the Portuguese-speaking girl who cleans his house in the country. And finally, Juliet (Keira Knightley), a newlywed, is bothered by the fact that her husband's best friend Mark (Andrew Lincoln) doesn't seem to like her. Throw in cameos by Rowan Atkinson and Billy Bob Thornton and (I think) you pretty much have the cast.As you can see, there are a lot of stories going on here, and unfortunately, Curtis put a few too many in. The result is that there was not one story that I truly cared about in 'Love Actually'. The closest I came was feeling for Karen, but I think a lot of it was because Emma Thompson is just so damn good. Situations occurred that made no sense, plots were concluded with unbelievable ease, and by the time we would move on from one scene to another, I had completely forgotten what the situation was with that particular character because I hadn't seen their story for a good twenty minutes or so. It was like Curtis came up with the characters, wrote a paragraph as a treatment for each and then relied on just that paragraph to tell their stories. For example, I felt hardly anything regarding Daniel's loss, the only emotion or feeling in that regard was in the obligatory funeral scene. Basically, a cute film could have been made using just a couple of the characters, and it would have been an okay film. This was simply atrocious and for the most part, sappy. The acting in the film was of course decent, with this cast it had to be, but all of these great actors were wasted with the little bit they were given. And a note to Hugh Grant:The shrugging, self-deprecating thing has gone from charming to insipid over the course of the last ten years, so drop it. Now.I suppose that anyone who loves a romantic comedy is going to find this movie good. I found it lame and barely mediocre. Had Curtis not tried to shove the concept of love down our throats with about 20 different characters, it may have been decent, but in this form it turned out to be sub-par. Only for the decent acting jobs and that knock down, drag out Christmas program musical number at the end do I give it a 4/10.Shelly",Love Actually
108,jpschapira,Actually...,8,13 September 2005,"There are films that one sees and find very nice; but that just at seeing them a second time, discovers the magic they contain, the charm and above all things, the quality in their genre. ""Love Actually"" is one of those movies; it is enchanting and very good as a movie, however excellent as a romantic comedy.Although no one admits it, the genre of the romantic comedy is pretty underestimated, or in other case, left aside. I mean that there are no romantic comedies considered actually as movies, they are mostly entertainment and fun for a while; but I, as a fan of the genre, find more difficult developing a script within these terms than writing an action film, or on the other side a shocking drama (""it is easier to make cry than making laugh"").Specialists for this are people like Richard Curtis, who has been collecting hits as a writer in the last decades and now has had the chance to direct, and for the first time, what is the most delightful of his tales. I forgot to confess I prefer a drama to a romantic comedy, because of the variations that one can find. Dramatic writers (and this is easy) take things from any part of everyday life, and turn it into a story.Instead, as I said a while ago, the ideas in the comedy field are drying out. The plots don't change much and sometimes we find ourselves watching the same thing, especially in the romantic comedy. As I was saying, Richard Curtis knows his theme, how it will begin and how it will end; the incredible thing about his scripts is what happens between that. How he makes us arrive to that satisfying final moment is what says everything about him. He has already proved it, creating different emotional impacts in movies like ""Nothing Hill"" or ""Bridget Jones Diary"", which could have been exactly the same.And it is after more than ten years, that he grabs the camera with his hand. Maybe he felt the need, or maybe he realized he had to take possession of the lives of these characters. Because in ""Nothing Hill"" and ""Bridget Jones"" the central characters were two in a relationship, or three in a love triangle, and everything was more reduced; but in ""Love Actually"" they are neither two nor three, but a dozen of persons, which in some cases don't even relate, although they are united by a same bond: love, that is actually all around.From that, we become witnesses of these people's hearts most deepest feelings and through the words and superb leadership of Curtis, and the portrayals of Hugh Grant (he should never change what he does, he's an expert), Colin Firth (keeps on growing in romantic terms), Emma Thompson (always talented), Alan Rickman (incredibly funny), Laura Linney (good in anything), Martine McCutcheon (a revelation), Bill Nighy (from other world), Keira Knightley (still divine and promising) and Liam Neeson (he reminds us what is the passion for work), plus an excellent ensemble; we understand, as a friend of mine said, that we must fight for what we love, without fear and against all odds, and that for loveNothing is impossible.",Love Actually

However last March I finally got around to it and I saw it. My opinion suddenly changed as I thought this movie had some funny moments and some serious ones. And I don't think of it as an holidays movie.The plot is a bit complicated as it follows many different people that prepare themselves before Christmas. What ties all together is that the various stories all relate to each other. In substance this film is about the people in the posters and their friends have also stories that diverge. And it all works so well.Since there are already 1,190 reviews to date for this movie I won't talk about those stories as it's one of those movies that is aired lots of times on TV.I liked most of the performances, expecially those by Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson (in a different sort of role), Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth and even Rowan Atkinson in a small supporting role. And it gives also a nice message of hope (especially in this dark period) and also that love is all around even in the smallest things.Overall, a very well made Christmas movie.

In other words, this is an ensemble movie, something the British do easily and we Americans do poorly.  Each of the love stories has its wonderful moments and the comedy is (almost) believable.   Best bit: The British Prime Minister (Grant) cutting the American President (Billy Bob Thornton) down to size after the President makes an unwelcome pass at the PM's unacknowledged love.

113,Ben_Cheshire,"Perfect popcorn, snuggle with someone you love, entertainment.",7,27 June 2004,"After a silly intro about terrorism, the rest of the movie features what, if we're being honest, everyone wants to see: people meeting and falling in love. Its the best part of every love story: so instead of dealing with all the unpleasantness that follows (a la Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind), let's just have excerpts from twelve characters who experience only those good bits.I'm not doing it justice by saying its only the good bits - its more like the most vibrant bits. Two or three stories have a more sombre, sour quality. But vibrant highs and lows are not unique to Love Actually - they're a staple of any melodrama: they are the definition of melodrama! In this context, though, as happy ending as was possible considering the premise of each short story, was affixed.I think he's cottoned onto a good idea with this - take the best (or most interesting) bits from many short stories and stitch them together into one movie. I thought the connecting material was sometimes weak, and i often felt we were just bouncing back and forth from story to story, progressing like a cement-mixer across the narrative. A bit to mechanised, not fluid enough, in other words. Also, i never felt like i got to know these characters. There's no time to really delve into any of these stories - which leaves us with something that's fairly superficial. But not as superficial as you might think.This is indubitably popcorn entertainment, and a fitting choice for a couple looking for a romantic night at home, but you didn't need me to tell you that.7/10Highlights: I was glad i saw this for Bill Nighy, who plays the aging has-been pop star.

The plot consists of lives and behavior of various people in UK, from the head of the government to simple persons in this society and the ways each tries to celebrate Christmas. Not all is positive, a couple is also shown having a husband with false values always looking for other ladies and fun. For me the best of the film is the romance of Hugh Grant with his maid/secretary, it is funny the way they met for Christmas, and how he as Prime Minister was caught together with her.",Love Actually

A first length feature directorial debut from the extremely popular British writer Richard Curtis finds ease in delivering heartfelt and accessible warmth in spades throughout the two + hours of multiple character acts, though fails to tie all these inter-connected and pleasant enough relationship threads into a more emotionally cohesive whole.Feeling wildly uneven at times, Curtis lets a few of his characters breathe, while restricting others as mere wallpaper. All in all though Love Actually remains the lighthearted romantic holiday epic that it sets out to be by appeasing as many sappy-hearted Brits and Americans as possible and by cutting out the middleman known as subtlety.",Love Actually
116,Superunknovvn,Kitsch actually,5,30 November 2003,"Once a year a man has got to do what a man has got to do and take his girlfriend to the latest chick flick. This year the flick is called ""Love Actually"". I wouldn't go as far as calling it the ""My Big Lame Greek Wedding"" of 2003, but it is long, it's unbearably ""sweet"" and it's consciously unrealistic. Or is it?The main problem of the movie is that it has too many episodes. It's like watching the ending of ""An Officer And Gentleman"" eight times in a row, when really one time was more than enough. Some plots are quite good, mainly those that are not so ""cute"", but either ratty or tragic. Bill Nighy is the shining light of ""Love Actually"" and Laura Linney's story is kind of moving. Keira Knightley's episode is nice, too. However, it's a thin line between funny and silly, between romantic and kitschy and the movie shamelessly covers the whole palette of these adjectives: Liam Neeson as the understanding lone father and his annoying son made me want to throw up. Hugh Grant in his typical ""charming but confused and clumsy bachelor"" role made me want to punch the screen. He couldn't convince me that he was a politician at all, he doesn't even seem to try, either. And what's with all the bubblegum critizism on Tony Blair and George W. Bush? Couldn't they at least make it a bit more subtle? That part was so sophisticated a kindergarten kid could have written it. The thing I hated the most, though, was the large amount of ""Ally McBeal""-like humour. Scenes like the one in which Hugh Grant is caught doing a funny dance. Haha, I totally didn't see that coming! And the worst part is that people in the cinema went crazy when cheap jokes like that were coming on. Drove me nuts.As I said above, ""Love Actually"" had its good moments, too, but unfortunately there were far more bad ones and when I left the theatre after all those happy endings I felt like a diabetic that had too many candy bars.

And what a busy little film it is with so many characters burdened down with so many difficult relationships. At first I was somewhat confused as a multitude of characters were introduced ,but slowly I was able to sort out the couples and their particular problems.It's a happy film set a few weeks before Christmas with the street illuminations decorating many of the scenes. The dialogue is suitably punctuated with songs many of which were familiar to me. I actually found myself tapping my feet in some scenes. This is unusual for me.The large cast had a nice variety of characters, too many to comment on all. I liked Hugh Grant as the English Prime Minister and some of the impossible situations he found himself in. Some of the scriptwriting was surprisingly frank relating to the President of the United States. Love has no boundaries it seems when a young boy makes a determined effort to meet the girl of his dreams by breaking all security rules at the airport.

Unfortunately, what starts out as a modestly brilliant dialogue-driven script slowly becomes a little more theatrical than necessary, and if the viewer chooses to be a Grinch and dissect the plot, they'll probably find one or two unnecessary stories—after all, a 136 minute rom-com is indeed pushing the limits. Still, the viewing experience is wonderful during the Holiday season, and the movie has great potential to be a Christmas classic. While Knightley and Lincoln's story is just downright rubbish, Nighy and Fisher's takes the cake! *** (out of four)",Love Actually
119,TheOtherFool,"Wanted to embrace it, but couldn't",8,1 May 2004,"'Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world, I think of the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport. General opinion's starting to make out that we live in a world of hatred and greed, but I don't see that. It seems to me that love is everywhere.' With this monologue by the British Prime Minister (played by Hugh Grant), that wouldn't have been misplaced in The Great Dictator (I mean that as about the highest honour I can give), Love Actually begins. It's the story of about a dozen people (all somehow linked to each other), who are in relationships of some sort. Some fall in love, some cheat, some just don't know what to do with themselves.Obviously, one story is better than another. For instance, there's this guy going to the USA to 'score some babes', and he actually does, but we couldn't care less. Then there are two 'actors' who hit it off, but that's not really that interesting neither, nor is the romance between a woman (Laura Linney) and a co-worker, with a mentally ill brother standing in the way of things.Other stories work better, with the Prime Minister falling for a servant of his, and a widowed step-dad (Liam Neeson) explaining his 'new' son how to act towards the most popular girl in school.The two really interesting stories that remain are that of cheating husband Harry, and how his wife is dealing with that and the romance between writer Jamie (Colin Firth) and his Portuguese cleaning lady. There's a wonderfull scene where Jamie is asking her father for her hand, and the whole town following them to where she works.But overall, the movie was a bit disappointing. The love-stories were too simple, too flat and one-dimensional. Also, the 'red line' between things (no. 1 hit by 'Billy Mack') turned a bit boring near the end. Too bad as I really wanted to love this movie for it's bright and upbeat message.Final score: 5/10.",Love Actually

Inspires love, uplifts our 'human-ness'",10,27 June 2005,"The premise, which you must know by now, is the romantic trajectories of 8 couples. Even critics who praise it have remarked that the filmmakers were a tad bit rushed to find satisfactory conclusions to each couple's romantic potential. I disagree! The premise, that 'love is, actually, all around', is a delightful and uplifting tale. Following the characters through from promising beginnings, to uncertain middles, all the way to emotionally resonant ends is a legitimate and worthy enterprise.There are no spoilers here, although I would say that it does not stretch the imagination too much to anticipate certain types of outcomes in a romantic comedy. All of the story lines, even those with a bit of sadness, feel true- to me, anyway. I was, at all times, able to identify with the scenes on the screen (a TV screen for me, because I had only gotten to watching 'Love Actually' recently, on DVD).The cast of 'Love Actually', is, duh, an amazing constellation of superb actors. Some 'star vehicles' contain only stars, seemingly not really portraying anything meaningful, but merely being their own famous selves. The assemblage of stars here, however, is that rarest of things--- an assembly of world-class artists and 'presences'. Each was perfectly cast, each gives a natural and astounding performance.I loved this movie! I found it a rich and delightful source of inspiration and upliftment. Hurray for all involved.

123,PersianPlaya408,A must-see,10,26 July 2006,"Curtis' holiday comedy about the various lives of eight couples in modern London. I thought Curtis did a great job with this film, its an instant favorite of mine. An amazing screenplay, suitable direction, great performances, and a great atmosphere. I loved the incorporation of music, jokes and oddball comedy into this picture. Hugh Grant shined as the prime minister, while Colin Firth, Liam Neeson and Bill Nighy were also pretty good. Keira Knightley and Emma Thompson were also good. This film is a must-see for any fan of cinema, comedy or Christmas.

124,lawprof,Richard Curtis Actually Isn't a Cockeyed Optimist,7,12 November 2003,"""Love Actually"" deserves a good review.  It's a fine example of ensemble acting directed by a master of the winsome/wistful genre of romantic comedy. Comedy with a dash, and a strong one at that, of drama centering on issues of commitment that are strongly played amid the sometimes madcap humor.Director Richard Curtis may not own the Hugh Grant franchise in boyish innocence hitched to almost palpable virility but the two of them have done rather well together on the screen.  Here, a fine cast (too many for me to list-check the film's page on IMDb) play characters loosely or closely related in one way or another, all sharing a need for love with commitment. Whether they realize that or not.Fantasy abounds.  Grant plays a young British prime minister who reviewers seem to feel is tenuously modeled on George W. Bush's loyal servitor, Tony Blair.  For the record, it's nonsense.  Anyone with a modicum of knowledge about English history will recognize Grant's portrayal as based on his solid study of William Ewart Gladstone.  Putting that aside he is a prime minister with more of a personal than an official life and it's all in good fun.Comments on both sides of the pond have ascribed a political message in the P.M.'s strong stand when bullied by the U.S. president played by Billy Bob Thornton (he's everywhere these days, isn't he?).  Some folks can't see a joke when it's on the big screen in front of them.  Curtis has created a fantasy character - can anyone imagine a lecherous president going after a prime minister's lovely but slightly plump house maid on two minutes acquaintance?  And on a STATE VISIT? Please.Some of the characters are more finely developed than others, especially the roles inhabited by Emma Thompson, Colin Firth and Liam Neeson.  All contribute to a fairly well put together story.In Curtis's ""Love Absolutely"" not everyone finds even ""Love Marginally."" Decisions are made, risks are taken, happiness is doled out and its permanence isn't assured.I don't doubt the director's genuine belief that he was making a positive statement in the first minute with Grant, in a voice over, characterizing the last, terribly tragic phone calls from trapped victims in the World Trade Center but, frankly, it's an unnecessary and jarring comment.
So just enjoy it and await, I'm sure, Hugh Grant's next exasperated trolling for love under Mr. Curtis's benevolent but not Pollyannish direction.7/10.",Love Actually
125,joachimokeefe,"Cheap, cynical, threadbare racist chick flick",2,26 December 2007,"Hmm, let's see... according to Richard Curtis, all American girls are airheaded nymphomaniacs, all Portugese are poverty-stricken kitchen staff, all black people in England want to be middle-class white people, working in p0rn is no different from working in any other area of showbiz and provides a decent living to even the slightest member of the crew, the Prime Minister spends Christmas chasing skirt and would be unaware of where his sister worked, the 'dodgy' area of Wandsworth is populated totally by white not-quite-so-middle-class families, the record-buying demographic of the UK consists mainly of the mentally deficient, British airports continue working at full capacity with no holdups right up to Christmas Eve, high-powered frumpy British wives forgive their husbands' infidelities all the time - especially at Christmas, middle-aged men become gay after becoming disillusioned with years of one-night stands with women... I could go on. If you are prepared to accept premises like these without question, then please, go ahead and enjoy 'Love Actually'. To people like me who don't turn off their critical faculties at the sight of Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, or Joanna Page's lady bumps, this movie is plainly the work of a group of white, middle-class grammarschool boys who decided to add every ingredient they could think of to appeal to an audience they obviously hold in the deepest contempt.

The fact that i almost always like British comedy is one of those facts. I can't always say why but it more or less never fails.Light British romantic comedy is a genre that seems to have grown considerably these last few years. Add Hugh Grant and you have a winning formula. And why not? Even though movies like ""Love Actually"" are often quite corny and never really surprising they are nevertheless enjoyable. Mostly because of two things really. First of all the comedy is very British, meaning that it's usually quite subtle and often a little peculiar. Second there is almost always great actors involved. Here we have a big part of the British acting elite. Aforementioned Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, Alan Rickman... The one that stands out most in this movie though is without a doubt Bill Nighy as the washed-up rock singer who gets one last chance with a Christmas song.This is very much a Christmas movie. Not only because it's set at Christmas but also because it's warm, funny and very cozy. And i say that in the best sense of the words, not in the vomit-inducing way that sugar-sweet TV-movies are cozy. It does have problems.

If you're a cynical person this film really will not work for you. Especially in the opening scene where it's EXACTLY stated that love is everywhere, if you look.It's a statement alright. And now it has to prove that love does and will come in many forms. I love the interconnectivity of these seemingly disconnected people. This type of movie is what Garry Marshall wishes he could do with those stupid holiday movies. This one clearly defines the relationship. This guy loves this girl but can't follow through because of this reason. That's it. Simple. Drama. Comedy. It's all here.

The issue being, HE doesn't believe in his Christmas song. Delightful! There's also a heart-wrenching moment, when this old codger realizes the real meaning of love, through a mist of groupies, drugs and alcohol. What prevails is the heart.

130,Rickting,A great display of Richard Curtis feel good rom com heaven- although there is such a thing as too much of a good thing,7,30 March 2015,"Richard Curtis, one of Britain's most successful screenwriters, turns his hand to directing and virtually every successful British A list actor falls in love in Love Actually, a rom com of epic proportions. 10 stories unfold across the film in the weeks leading up to Christmas, with a one month later epilogue. Love Actually starts off superbly but then fails to sustain itself across its full 2 hour runtime. The cast charms throughout, with Liam Neeson giving a touching and likable performance far away from his recent action typecast role and Bill Nighy stealing the show as an aging rock star. The film is sweeter than a box of Lindt chocolate and often feels like an extended sugar rush. It's sentimental, but its' difficult not to be genuinely charmed by it. Richard Curtis, with his razor sharp humour and wonderfully British writing, gives us laughs galore, and for the first hour the film is more often than not hysterical. Although the movie devolves as it goes along, it remains funny throughout, and Curtis proves himself a good director as well.The problem with Curtis is that his films are feel good, but they don't offer enough conflict and can just feel like syrupy fantasies. Without actors like Hugh Grant, these romances might not work at all. The stories in LA don't have enough conflict and at times I found myself wondering where it was headed, as the film's only real message, love is all around, is one we've all heard hundreds of times before. It's quite sweet and there is one effective sad scene in the second half of the movie, but overall the emotional grip slackens as it all just gets a bit too much in terms of the sentimentality. Since it's all fantasy, it doesn't always feel that romantic. With good direction, an irresistible sense of charm, strong acting and Richard Curtis' sharp humour complete with his typical fine use of profanity, LA is an entertaining and likable rom com with admirable ambition, but on the storytelling side there are definite shortcomings. The Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Bill Nighy, Colin Firth and Kris Marshall story lines should perhaps have made up the film with the other story lines (Which either don't go anywhere or are just a bit weaker) dropped.7/10",Love Actually
131,saadanathan,Absolutely beautiful 8/10,8,4 October 2020,"""Love Actually"" is a cute, funny and mostly emotional love story. With an ensemble cast that appears in eight different tales. Each of the following love stories are unique and tell a different kind of romance between the characters. There are all kinds of different romances between them: young people, old people, adults, kids, people who seek to be in a relationship, people who want to shagg. All kinds of romances. I Think this is where the movie succeeds, by giving plenty of stories with a lot of interactions between the characters. How they feel towards each other, how they end up together. Even the fact that the setting happens in Christmas is made on purpose, because Christmas is a special holiday that has a lot of vibes of romance. So there is a perfect connection between the holidays and the emotion the film delivers. I love how simple the movie may seem and yet I enjoyed it very much, I wouldn't bother watching it again. The cast is impressing and I love the performance of every one of the actors, from Thomas Brodie Sangster to Bill Nighy. Overall a really great movie and a beautiful one, absolutely worth it and highly recommended.",Love Actually
132,ruby_fff,"How reassuring that love IS actually all around us -- unabashedly optimistic ""Love Actually"" is.",7,12 January 2004,"British writer Richard Curtis' directorial debut of his own script ""Love Actually"" is an ambitious endeavour -- a big heart packaged to encompass the world. It could very well be as grand a scale as ""The Last Samurai"" with cast of extras just as plenty (imagine the airport scenes) besides managing nine concurrent stories about love. He pulled it off successfully with a stellar casting by Mary Selway and Fiona Weir. Bill Nighy's Billy Mack rock singer story is used as the staple timeline the other stories revolve -- it's countdown with 5 weeks to Christmas. Here, Hugh Grant's Prime Minister role is not exactly the main one, each of the other stories share its sum of on-screen time. Some of the characters do cross each other's path. For example: Emma Thompson's Karen is sister to Grant's PM, her husband (Alan Rickman) Harry's secretary Mia turns out to be neighbor of Natalie's (Martine McCutcheon). The story of Liam Neeson's Daniel and his 11 year old stepson Sam is a hit. Thomas Sangster played Sam (his sixth acting endeavour and first feature in 2 years) certainly tugs at our hearts by his innocent love pursuit. You'll find satisfactory rationale to all this in Curtis' genuinely thoughtful dialogue. He's never flippant about any aspect of the subject at hand. Not even when he showed us John and Just Judy -- just the right restrained dosage of comedic pairing of Martin Freeman and Joanna Page as stand-in actors on set. There's the 'triangle' of Keira Knightly (shines in both ""Bend It Like Beckham"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"") as Juliet, Chiwetel Ejiofor (the intriguing Nigerian doctor in Stephen Frears ""Dirty Pretty Things"") briefly as Peter her newly wedded husband, and Andrew Lincoln as Peter's best man Mark secretly, hopelessly in love with Juliet.
Life is not all roses, and Curtis is not coy about uncomfortable aspects of love. Karen's (Thompson) suspicion about Harry, the sentiment though sad is eased by the chosen song played at the time. Joni Mitchell's ""Both Sides Now"" rings true.  Harry's employee Sarah (Laura Linney from U.S.), her crush on colleague Mark (Rodrigo Santoro) is like a painful fairytale, time may generate hope. Kris Marshall's Colin is certainly the most happy go lucky one: 'coming to America,' meeting dream girls like Denise Richards, Shannon Elizabeth and returning home with him -- such satisfied faces at the airport.I'm most akin to the story of Colin Firth's writer Jamie and his Portuguese-speaking only housekeeper Aurelia played by Lúcia Moniz. I like it already when Firth sat down at his writing hide-out in the French suburb and said, ""Alone Again, Naturally"" -- the title of a popular 1970 song by Gilbert O'Sullivan. The comic yet tender language barrier scenes with subtitles remind me of the Russian/Finnish film ""The Cuckoo"" (Kukushka). There are dashes of references to other movies or songs, e.g., Grant doing a 'Tom Cruise Risky Business' singing pose as he starts a gig of a song; Daniel and Sam watching 'Kate & Leo in Titanic' for motivation.
To w-d Curtis' credit, following the 9 stories was not at all confusing. I saw the movie on its opening weekend and the packed audience thoroughly enjoyed the 2 hrs. 15 mins. of laughter and tears. The story scenes intercut each other in an assured pace, like movements of a symphony -- overture, interlude, yes, the finale is well-crafted to the cadence of love IS actually all around -- visual camera at play.   If you're interested in behind the scenes, visit the official Web site of ""Love Actually"" -- there are generous production notes including excerpt dialogues and how each story came to be.

In essence, this film ends up not being romantic, dramatic, funny (except for one or two scenes with Rowan Atkinson) or anything else for that matter. For example, just figure the probability of a British PM knocking on doors in the middle of the night looking for a lost girlfriend (and by the way, Hugh Grant is pathetic and totally unbelievable as the PM), or a kid simply running through airport security virtually unhindered (whith his father encouraging him to do so), etc. This list could go on and on...

138,estreet-eva,The Most Overrated Underrated Movie,3,8 December 2014,"The most famous example of the, thankfully, very narrow subgenre of holiday themed movies that feature maximal celebrity cameos and minimal story organized around a major holiday. Christmas, rather than ""New Year's Eve"" or ""Valentines Day"" gets the treatment this time with but despite the presence of an excellent British cast (Hugh Grant, Kiera Knightly, Emma Thomson, etc) the result is the same as equivalent American holiday outings. To put it succinctly there's no ""there"" there. The film contains a pastiche of boring little love stories with obvious endings in largely unrealistic scenarios. Particularly Hugh Grant playing a single heterosexual man who ascends to the highest level of office comes across as completely unelectable in real life. Hugh's standard performance as the good-looking absent-minded middle class everyman had grown stale by this go-around and even he seemed bored. The talents of powerhouse actors such as Knightley and Thomson put to no good use seems a shame. If only they had some decent lines to say. Martin Freeman and Joanna Page as porn actors who fall in love starts off as clever but quickly becomes repetitive. Everyone else just seems bored. Having said that blaming the folks involved somewhat does them a disservice as this type of quick-cut vignette film can amount to only so much given the necessary shallows it plays in given the number of subplots that the director tries to cram in. In short, ignore the advice of reviewers who talk about this trifle being unfairly underrated - the underraters have it right.",Love Actually
139,DavidSim240183,The biggest love story(s) ever told,7,5 March 2008,"After the success of multi-narrative films like Pulp Fiction and Magnolia, I wondered how long it would be before Hollywood tried the same thing with rom-coms. And so we have Love Actually, Richard Curtis's directorial debut, the man who's worked behind the scenes of many a Brit rom-com.I must admit I'm a man who doesn't exactly rush out to buy romantic comedies under Richard Curtis's banner. But I must say the premise for Love Actually rather intrigued me. An interweaving tapestry of romantic encounters with a who's who of British talent. What more could anyone ask?Being produced by Universal has sadly blunted the bite of some of the British humour I was hoping for. There are times when it seems a bit too Americanized. One kid even says ""duh!"" And where Harry Potter made the wise choice of leaving the Americans out of it, Love Actually can't resist squeezing in a few. The film even makes a somewhat needless sidetrip to America.But you can't deny that Love Actually has a quite phenomenal cast. There are some really wonderful actors present. At the head of the line is Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman and Bill Nighy. A film that had any one of these actors present would be worth watching, let alone a film that has all three under the same roof.Love Actually doesn't tell one story about a couple, it instead tells several, all at the same time. Where films like Pulp Fiction tell a self-contained story one at a time, Love Actually more daringly tells these stories simultaneously. They flow in and out of each other. Granted it does tend to sketch the characters a bit thinly, some stories are more interesting than others, and some could have been edited out altogether. But for the most part Love Actually is a film that hangs together surprisingly well.I won't go into intricate detail about every single tale. Otherwise we'd be here all day, and the IMDb would really need to lift the 1000 word limit to accomplish that near impossible task. The film's major flaw is Richard Curtis tries to do too much. The plot is very busy. Always on the move. And because of this desire to cram everything into the cooking pot, it deprives the characters of some much needed development.The most engaging story was the one with Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman as a married couple, who face trouble in paradise when Rickman's wandering eye sets upon the lusty secretary that works for him. I get the impression Curtis was equally entranced with this story, because he gives it the most development. It follows their typical married lives. Gently, affectionately sniping at each other. But then Rickman's Harry gets distracted by his secretary, and Thompson's Karen slightly picks up on it. There's a particularly devastating scene when Karen unwraps a Christmas present she assumes is a necklace she found in his coat pocket. Instead its a CD. The necklace was for somebody else.Its very well directed by Curtis. You feel just as crushed as Karen. The ever delightful Emma Thompson really shines, and she makes a very believable couple with Alan Rickman. Even the scene when she confronts him about it feels real and natural. I wouldn't have minded if the whole film had been about them.There are some other nice stories too. A sweet one involves the tale of Colin Firth and Lucia Moniz. Firth is a heartbroken writer mired in depression after his wife had an affair with his brother. But a cure for the lovesick Firth arrives in the form of a comely Portugeuse maid, and even though they don't speak the same language, they are obviously quite taken with one another. Curtis occasionally mismanages the story by allowing it to topple over into slapstick farce. There's a really awful scene when the pages of Firth's latest novel ends up in the lake thanks to a careless mistake. The two lovebirds wind up in the lake desperately thrashing about. Its a scene that aims for laughs, but never really takes flight. Their relationship is more effective in its quieter moments, like watching them try to express their feelings while overcoming the language barrier.The best laughs come from the story of Bill Nighy and Gregor Fisher as a washed up rocker and his long suffering manager. Their tale charts a wonderfully funny course as in the run up to Christmas, Billy boy patents a blatant ripoff of a once popular song (which has to be heard to be believed) in his quest to hit No 1 in the charts. Great chemistry between the two, acidic one-liners and cuss-words galore make they're story enough of a reason to watch Love Actually at all.There are some nice performances from the rest of the cast, in particular Liam Neeson's equally sweet story of a widower trying to sort out his step-son's lovelife, but they feel like filler material. The rather ludicrous notion of Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister seems added only to poke some potent barbs at the Bush/Blair administration (and Bill Clinton's too!). And because he's always in a Richard Curtis production. Other stories could have been left on the cutting room floor like a hopeless Kris Marshall hopping planes to America to chat up the local gals. A story that falls curiously flat.I think, in the end, Love Actually is what might be oddly described as a flawed masterpiece. Richard Curtis does an admirable job keeping so many stories in motion, but did it really need so many? To see great actors like Laura Linney, Chiwetel Ejiofor and the radiant Keira Knightly saddled with fairly anonymous parts to play is surely evidence the film is not all it should have been. When Love Actually is good, its very good. But its still not quite the lyrical symphony of love it likes to think it is.",Love Actually
140,AvidClimber,Love Actually — Watch different kinds of love all inter weaved,10,29 January 2013,"Love Actually is a clever tapestry of different kinds of love, each somehow related to an other, yet independent. That kind of weaving is an art. Too disparate and the piece looses cohesion. Too tight and you can't differentiate the threads. In this particular case, it is done right.Each story is interesting and present us with various facets of love. They are all sweet, but sometimes sad, and a few times funny. You get easily attached to all the characters who are all very well acted in this star studded cast and rendered with depth and subtle emotions.It's difficult not to fall in love with these wonderful stories, and there are virtually no flaws in this film, especially when it comes to the scenario, editing, and photography.The only things that might distract you from seeing it is if you need action to watch a movie, if you can only watch a movie set around Christmas time during December, or if such kind of lives weaving doesn't interest you.Otherwise, it's a must see.",Love Actually
141,Flagrant-Baronessa,One of my all-time favourite 'chick-flicks',8,13 July 2006,"You know how most chick-flicks fall under the category of 'guilty pleasures'? Well, Love Actually is not one of them because while it does indeed have chick-flick tendencies, it is a well-made, heartfelt and original film. You never ever need to feel guilty about enjoying it, even as a guy. What sets it apart from the guilty pleasures is its whole approach to love; it doesn't have to be between a young, hot couple but can occur in the unlikeliest of people and in the unlikeliest of times. Here we finally have a romantic comedy that manages to avoid the cheesiest clichés, but is still rich in romance. In Love Actually, we get to follow a multitude of characters in story lines that gradually intertwine. My favourite one was actually between a father (Liam Neeson) and his son.Without spoiling anything, it must be put forward that not all story lines end happily or even traditionally. There is no grand romantic ending for all couples, nor is there a big heart-breaking finish to any. Love Actually treats its relationship much like reality--sometimes a relationship works out--sometimes it doesn't. It is not completely devoid of cheap romantic moments and in my opinion the Colin Firth storyline should have been omitted altogether as it is richest in these. Still, a very enjoyable Christmas romantic comedy. 8/10",Love Actually
142,willcundallreview,A Romcom perfected,8,24 February 2014,"Love Actually is just about an excellent Romcom which balances that Romance and Comedy perfectly to be one of the highest rated ever. A great film with some great actors and cameos with a great writer ,director and story which well just goes together perfectly. In my review I'll tell you why overall I found this to be a great piece of cinema and why you should watch it too if you haven't.The story is intertwined and lot's of things go on at once, this makes for one interesting piece which I am sure you find delightful and heart warming at the same time. It is more romantic than funny but the humour flows at times and you can feel yourself laughing a lot and then feeling sorry for someone because there sad too, it has it's moments. Another thing with the story is that the intertwining doesn't confuse you and the characters always know each other but not too much to bother them in there side of the love mega triangle.I loved the acting of the various actors on show with such people as Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman among the fantastic people on show. Liam Neeson I think stays with you with an emotionless performance that suddenly becomes emotional because of his son's problems in the story and your heart strings are pulled by the end in part well, you will see or know what I mean with Neeson's sweet little son. A great cameo from Rowan Atkinson as the jewellery store owner is one of the funniest bits of the film and annoys Alan Rickman so well, it great.Richard Curtis who directs and writes this is just superb and one the best ever with Romantic Comedies. His idea is brilliant and comes to life not just with the great acting but also his great script and I feel he deserves even more acclaim for his work than he already does so. The script is gold and ever so smartly done by Curtis and Curtis is just the mastermind of the entire project as a whole.The film is not without slight criticisms and I guess it is in the sense that it is not laugh out loud funny and sometimes the laughter can be cut short by an emotional scene which doesn't quite work so well in parts. Although the film hardly suffers from these tiny things and all together it is just Great so not much to write here in a critical sense of the film.I think people who like RomComs should love this film as it isn't poor in that area although people looking for hilarious jokes are going to bore themselves here. The story is soppy and for those who hate loved up feel good films then please don't watch this or you will hate it, because that is the entire film in a nutshell. All kind of people should like it but some won't, it just what happens with film, not every film can pleasure everyone.Overall it is great, it is only just there and just about steers clear of just being a very good movie. If you dislike it I would think it would still be an OK film so it worth a watch of course, sit back and if you have a lover then this is perfect for you because if anything it can make you near fall more in love than you were before.",Love Actually
143,rajatdahiyax,Wonderfully made and connected!!!!!!!,8,21 October 2014,"All of London is in love -- or longing to be -- in Four Weddings and a Funeral writer Richard Curtis' first directorial effort. Billed as ""the ultimate romantic comedy,"" Love Actually involves more than a dozen main characters, each weaving his or her way into another's heart over the course of one particularly eventful Christmas. The seemingly perfect wedding of Juliet (Keira Knightley) and Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) brings many of the principals together, including heartsick best man Mark (Andrew Lincoln), who harbors a very unrequited crush on Juliet. There's also recent widower Daniel (Liam Neeson), trying to help his lonely stepson Sam (Thomas Sangster) express his true feelings to a classmate. Across town, devoted working mother Karen (Emma Thompson) tries to rekindle the passion of her husband, Harry (Alan Rickman), who secretly pines for a young colleague of his. In the same office, the lonely Sarah (Laura Linney) not-so-secretly pines for a man just a few desks away (Rodrigo Santoro), who returns her affections but may not be able to dissuade her neuroses. Providing the unofficial soundtrack for all of the couples is an aging rocker (Bill Nighy) who just wants to cash in and get laid -- but even he might find a meaningful relationship in the most unlikely of places.",Love Actually

Some of the stories are ridiculously unrealistic. One involves a poor simpleton who can't get laid. He goes to Wisconsin, where hot girls throw themselves at him.

There was just something exceedingly special about romance from that era and it's now gone. ""Love Actually"" is not only a prime example of that. It also depicts almost all kinds of love possible. Love before marriage. Love within marriage. Love (or lust?) outside of marriage. Love unrequited, and the ""total agony"" thereof as elementary schoolchild Sam (young Thomas Brodie-Sangster) explains. Love lost to death. Love lost to your best friend. Love before sex.

I don't like that sort of music so I found it detracting from the stories.If they had cut about 30 minutes from the film it would have been better.

From the prime minister, to the ordinary man on the street, it's always happening. I first watched this movie on cable here in my country some time back and so this is my review...It's kind of fun and interesting to see how the cast celebrate love in many different ways leading up to Christmas in London. Hugh Grant as the prime minister, it's kind of funny and cute. Rowan Atkinson's appearance also brought some laughs.Love between friends, lovers, couples, siblings...most of it were being dealt with in the movie.

151,macpherr,Very uplifting movie.,8,22 January 2004,"This is a delightful movie. As we walked out the of the theater my husband said:' Get the tape, get the DVD, whatever.' There are many aspects of this movie that mean a lot to me: (1)  The majority of the movie was filmed in England, a country that I have great memories of. It is true that there is a lot of love in airports. I was there just last Spring, and felt very loved when my friends waited for me at Heathrow with big smiled giving me hugs and kisses; (2)  I do live about 10 minutes from Dulles airport where one of the planes was hijacked from on September 11,  and the amount of security we had to go thru at Dulles gave me a strange feeling. Although such a crime against humanity started at the airport, the writer of the screenplay was inspired by the events and came up with such an uplifting movie;  (3)   I do speak Portuguese and I must congratulate Colin Firth (Circle of Friends, Bridget Jones Diary, and the much anticipated Bridget Jones, The Edge of reason). I watched him in an interview where he said that he does not speak Portuguese at all. I thought he was fluent. Perhaps his knowledge of Italian and French helped. It was flawless. It was such a pleasant surprise, to hear Portuguese. It is very hard to summarize this movie, because it has a lots of people and lots of stories. Just think of it  as a spoken musical, during the Spring and it is all about love.  It is impossible to write a summary about everyone without making people bored to tears, and have their eyes crossed and their mind wandering after the third sentence. After awhile it is ludicrous to read because your mind will wander if you try. This movie  is to be watched, and felt and not to be described. This movie is to be enjoyed, like love. The characters are all flirting, falling in love, falling out of love.  The movie is excellent.  We left the theater happy, enthusiastic about life. The cast is full of giants of the British Cinema. I  highly recommend it!",Love Actually
152,dommercaldi,One Of The Few Good Rom-Coms,7,27 December 2020,"Pros:
1. The comedy is laugh-out-loud hilarious and produces copious memorable moments.
2. The contemporary soundtrack not only contains multiple great songs, but also adds a modern feel to the movie, in addition to encompassing all of the relevant emotions.
3. There are fantastic performances by Colin Firth (Jamie), Andrew Lincoln (Mark), Hugh Grant (The Prime Minister), Alan Rickman (Harry), and Emma Thompson (Karen).
4. The love-making scenes, and the romantic scenes in general, are intimate and intense in their shooting and execution.
5. The film does a brilliant job at showcasing different types of love, how they can come about, as well as how you can fall out of love.Cons:
1. The movie is a little over-edited at certain points with needless cuts added here and there.
2. The film jumps about with too much incoherency which is slightly jarring, and difficult to follow at some points.
3. There are a couple illogical moments that are clearly just written in for forced cheesy romance, for example, when Jamie and Aurelia (Lúcia Moniz) jump into the lake to save pages of the draft of Jamies' book.",Love Actually

I've seen it about half a dozen times since!Love Actually has 9 plots that go back and forth about love in London at Christmastime. Usually I would sit down and summarize each one, but instead I will suggest Googling Daily Dot's ranking of the plots and immediately discuss what I enjoy about the movie as a whole.Romantic comedies are hit or slight miss for me. Religious convictions aside, I think it's stupid for sex to advance the romances in these movies.People fall in love because of who they are, their character, their beauty-inner and outer, likes, interests, etc. and NOT BECAUSE THEY BANG EACH OTHER AFTER BARELY KNOWING EACH OTHER!Love Actually does have some sex in it(Hence it's R rating), but there are all kinds of love in the movie. For example, a stepfather named Daniel gives his stepson advice about how to get to know his love, showing a father-son bond. Daniel also asks if the crush is a boy, hinting that he loves his son no matter his sexual orientation.One woman has a boyfriend AND a mentally unstable brother, and she sacrificed her dating life for her brother. She could have done the cognitive and gave up her brother, but she knew family came first and her brother mattered more.There is also some homosexual love, pointing out that romantic love comes in multiple forms as well.Aside from the love aspect, other things make Love Actually fantastic. The movie's no Citizen Kane, but every moment is so entertaining and well written.Ignoring a pointless plot with sex scene stand ins, there's not a thing I'd change about the movie. (I don't love that plot but I've been less annoyed by that overtime.) To me, Love Actually is perfect. (You'll get that later.)By definition, Love Actualy isn't a masterpiece, but it is a masterpiece to me. It's so fun and endearing, no words can satisfy my admiration for it. When it comes to it's subject matter, this is love....actually!",Love Actually

156,geminiredblue,Sprawling Rom-Com,9,14 February 2012,"I admit, even though I'm a die-hard action/ horror/ scifi fan, there's also a little part of me that loves the occasional romantic comedy (or rom-com as it's known in the movie world.) While admittedly most rom-coms are pretty formulaic, every once in a while one will come along that tackles romance in a unique way. Amazingly two of my personal favorites share several things in common: both are set at Christmas time (so they also count as Christmas movies), both feature a good number of British actors, and they portray most (if not all) their characters in a realistic light. The first is THE HOLIDAY, featuring a charming cast that includes Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz, Jude Law, Eli Wallach, and a very nuanced Jack Black. The second is this film, which quickly becomes a roster featuring all the talented, and uprising, stars in London. Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, and Andrew Lincoln (THE WALKING DEAD's Rick Grimes) are just some of the noteworthy roles. The whole cast gives 110 percent. The movie covers a multitude of stories also, I believe somewhere around a dozen. And it shows how all of these seemingly random people are connected. All the stories explore certain aspects of relationships: between parents and children, siblings, married couples, friends, co-workers, etc. The most wonderful parts are quiet little poignant moments that appear throughout the film. For instance in most rom-coms, a guy proclaims his love for a woman who's with someone else. As he's walking away, the woman runs after him and kisses him. Followed by a short little pause as the guy is conflicted. Then they kiss a second, longer time before the music swells and the scene fades. In LOVE ACTUALLY, when this same situation arises, the two kiss for one tender moment before the woman walks back inside the apartment. And the guy walks away, happily determined, saying ""Enough."" At another point, Emma Thompson's character excuses herself from her family's Christmas celebration and ducks into her bedroom where she silently cries to Joni Mitchell. A few minutes later, she composes herself and rejoins her family, with a brave smile on her face. Moments like that happen in real life, and that's what is so great about the film. Clearly the makers were interested in capturing real human interaction, feelings and emotion, even in the most awkward situations. With this film, you will laugh and cry and become teary-eyed. And you'll leave the movie feeling a sense of hope and maybe even love as you discover that there are other flawed, hurting, lonely, caring, passionate, and loving people in the world. So enjoy this heartwarming tale!",Love Actually

But here we are 15 years later and I was forced to watch it by my family as it's Christmas and I always make them watch gritty stuff. The film itself was mostly over sentimentalised and predictable claptrap but it didn't take itself seriously and it easily passed both the 6 and 10 laugh test, although I did often laugh at how ridiculous it all was. I hated the Bill Nighy song but maybe I'm just being overly grumpy. The ending was so sickly that I felt I needed to purify myself with a Ken Loach drama.

158,Darkest_Rose,Is Love Actually all around Us?,7,24 November 2003,"I heard a lot of good things about this movie and since I'm a sucker for holiday films I decided to check it out for myself. The story revolves around several love stories and the movie goes back and forth to show what's going on with each character. There is the Prime Minister(Hugh Grant) who slowly starts falling in  love with his pretty maid Natalie(Martine McCutcheon). A married father and husband(Alan Rickman) who has a thing for his younger secretary Mia(Heike Hakatsch). A young man Mark(Andrew Lincoln) who has always liked his best friend's wife Juliet(Keira Knightley) but has always been afraid to tell her how he really feels about her. A young boy Sam(Thomas Sangster) tries to win the heart of his classmate Joanna(Olivia Olson) with the help of his father(Liam Neeson). A young rather unattractive man(Kris Marshall) is sick of snobby British gals and decides to go to America to find the right girl for him. A lonely woman named Sarah(Laura Linney) who has always had a thing for her sexy coworker Karl(Rodrigo Santoro). An old drugged out rocker(Bill Nigghy) who realizes that his fat manager is the only real friend he has ever had. A man(Colin Firth) working on a novel in his cabin in the middle of nowhere falls in love with his foreign caretaker Aurelia(Lúcia Moniz). And last but not least, a couple who fall in love while shooting a porno. At first I thought of this movie to be overrated and I didn't see what all the fuss was about but I have learned to appreciate it. It is rather long and sometimes it feels like everything is just thrown and mushed together with no directions and it makes you wonder if it will ever come to an end. However, it is touching in it's own way and it's interesting to see how each love story turns out. I did not leave the theater with my heart humming happily like the critics promised but it was still a enjoyable and entertaining movie. I would give Love Actually 7/10.",Love Actually
159,zac-04879,"Charming, But a Little Too Much... Actually",7,28 July 2021,"It's fair to say that Richard Curtis' idea of introducing the issues of multiple relationships is muddling and confusing. But the story is humorous and light-hearted enough to engage you. It's also certainly an average Christmas/romance sort of idea, which is one element some audiences will either enjoy or dislike, but it's surprisingly pretty pleasurable.So is Love Actually worth it's big stars and talented cast? Not necessarily, but it's pleasing to involve stars such as Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley and Colin Firth. What's important in this movie is the performances being dramatic and romantic enough to class the film as a decent romance movie. Luckily, they are, but a bright cast won't promise an excellent movie.The entire story of Love Actually is not for everyone, and most viewers will even find the film too puzzling to appreciate. However, the film delivers a nice amount of heart and each romantic story is quite appealing. But some will also find this film quite offensive and flat, which is reasonable, but it's quite enjoyable.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Love Actually
160,herbqedi,"Facile and muddled, yet pleasant and amusing enough",7,9 May 2004,"The DVD analysis and out-takes make a few things clear.  The writer-director had a great many ideas, some brilliant, many overblown, but far too many to be contained in a two-hour-and-eight-minute-and-at-that-still-too-long commercially aimed holiday movie.  One of the sad results is that the five out-takes included on the DVD would have been five of the best 8 scenes in the movie.  apparently, nearly three-and-a-half hours were filmed and the editing obviously turned into a ""team effort"" in the absolute worst sense of the term.One theme, almost a mantra to the people involved with the film, is that these were all conceptually variations on one basic story, with common threads from the global tapestry of love.  This is great stuff for film school, but in direct conflict with what studio executives think there audiences want to see when they come out to see a romantic comedy at holiday time.  And, this time, the execs are probably closer to what's best for the film than the creative geniuses who can no longer see the forest -- but they are hooked totally on commercial viability.With 20-20 hindsight, the problems are easy to see. Most simply, eight-plus stories are at least two-plus too many.  Unfortunately, the two weakest and most peripheral stories also had the hottest and most marquee-worthy names. Somewhere there may be a brilliant movie waiting to be made with UK Prime Minister Hugh Grant refusing to continue being a lap dog for US President Billy Bob Thornton after the latter puts the make on an office girl that the former had his eye on.  But, it would require much more emphasis on governmental and global issues that did not belong in this movie -- with the result that, really, none of this belonged in the movie.  But, how can you cut out Hugh Grant's character and keep the film commercially viable?  You can't -- but since the format allows for no expansion of the complications of such a romance for a Prime Minister, you are left with a subplot with little to offer beyond the charm of the two principals portraying the actors.   Similarly, the Colin Firth character was supposed to connect somehow to Alan Rickman's character's mistress -- who in turn -- would have supplied some important insights.  Without them, we have the ugly Briton in the South of France trying to write a novel with a Portuguese ""beauty"" who speaks no English and is as shallow as a wading pool. So, we get Colin Firth's considerable panache, a bunch of forgettable slapstick and even more forgettable wistfulness, an enjoyably choreographed --if overblown -- march through a Portuguese village, and a waste of 25-or-so all-too-valuable minutes of the movie's run-time.  There's a bittersweet subplot with a wedding photographer that doesn't quite belong in the pastiche in the manner intended. The subplot with the overdependent brother ruining a love-life via cellphone falls flat quickly as well.   The shame is that stripping these excess threads out would have allowed the film's true gems and interesting vignettes (Liam Neeson & son, Rickman & Thompson's entire family, the sex doubles, the singer-manager duo, and the stud with the American dream and his nay-saying friend) to keep their more memorable scenes and weave more seamlessly into the director's intended tapestry.Okay, so much for the movie that did not get to be released.  I believe that one that did get released did retain the writer-director's pervasive message of the delightful incongruities of the ""family holiday"" aspects of Christmas contrasted against all the commercial selling of sex concurrently airing during the period whilst adult sex-party games are in full force.  Too bad these messages are not nearly as insightful or revelatory as intended. Worse, including all these smutty references -- irrespective of motivation -- limits its accessibility to an 8-to-14-year-old holiday audience that would have otherwise found much to enjoy.In summary, Love Actually is full of flaws and misfires.  The closer you get to the movie, the more you'll see them.  But, if your looking for a pleasant enough pastiche of attractive people delivering witty and urbane dialog in a pleasant setting with a great soundtrack -- then put down your critic's pencil, check your brains, grab someone you love, and enjoy Love Actually.My score: 7/10.  By the way, if you enjoyed Hugh Grant in this film, make certain you see the far-better About A Boy from 2002.  He's terrific in the comedy, and the film is quite a bit of fun for all but the most extremely hypercritical or for avid haters of Mr. Grant.",Love Actually
161,kooleshwar,Great on feel good factor!! Not really that funny though!! ( i deny everything),8,21 January 2006,Lets be frank i don't like watching romance movies. The only ones i do watch are romantic comedies (that i watch when I'm alone and deny seeing later).So i only agreed to watch this movie because i was told it was really funny......I deny saying any of these things The movie even though was not really that funny was really good. Its utterly predictable ( i warn you i get it right 9.5 times out of ten) and a lot of the fun comes from being right with maybe some changes.The movie is loaded with feel good factor and i mean loaded. Being Indian i may not feel the Christmas spirit i can easily factor in.... say how someone will be feeling in diwali and then watch the film. And all those things spread with the occasional laugh and constant smile make the film great to watch.The only thing going against the movie is that it is not as funny as the best movies out there. Definitely worth a watch.,Love Actually
162,Jared_Andrews,It's not Love Actually; It's a Cheesy Love Fantasy,2,3 September 2017,"Love Actually is a lot like actual love---it's wonderful until it isn't. Then everything blows up, leaving you to pick up the pieces of your devastated reality.Relax. I'm only kidding. Love really is wonderful, even the struggles. The movie Love Actually, not so much.The first 30 minutes or so are downright hilarious, featuring a mix of charming British humor and broader appeal jokes as well. The setup of each storyline features likable characters in relatable situations. You root for everything to work out. You want all of them to be happy.Then, through no fault of the characters, you change your attitude. Instead of rooting for the characters, you become apathetic, at best. Why? Because the movie makes every story nauseating with irritatingly manipulative music, cuts to closeups of hopeful or gleeful faces to force viewers to elicit the ""hooray"" emotions. It's all very painful and frustrating.The movie is called Love Actually (which is a great title, by the way), but so little of what occurs in the movie can be passed off as something that would actually happen. A more appropriate title would be Love Fantasy.Thirty minutes into the movie (again, the beginning shows promise and is mostly delightful), all the believable buildups have morphed into shameless fairy tale-like sequences. It's all a bunch of love at first sight silliness. Sorry if this sounds too harsh, but there is no love at first sight. The very concept is shallow and supposes a fundamental misunderstanding of what love is. There can be attraction at first sight, or lust at first sight. But not love.The most ghastly instance of using music to manipulate the viewers comes during a scene when two people, who have never spoken a word to each other because they don't speak the same language, develop feelings for each other. That is an interesting idea that could have been quite moving if handled deftly. Instead, the moment is a bit more blunt. The music indicates that the man develops loving feelings for the woman when she takes off all her clothes to jump in a lake. Viewers are led to believe that the man felt little for this woman until he saw that she looked good in her underwear, after which he fell in love with her.So, I guess the message is that you can love someone that you've never spoken to as long and the other person is attractive. It's basically a different version of that thing in movies when the dorky girl takes off her glasses then everyone realizes that she's beautiful and then the main guy character can love her now. The biggest difference between those two cases is that the dorky girl removing her glasses moment usually happens in a movie that clearly isn't taking itself too seriously, whereas Love Actually is posing as a movie that represents realistic love. That's sad to me because many viewers, especially the impressionable young ones, may walk away from this movie confusing attraction for love.Since I'm unleashing all my gripes with this movie, I may as well mention one more. This one didn't so much make me mad, as much as it confused me. It is also kind of funny in a way. I'm talking about the portrayal of the U.S. President (the movie takes place in England). It casts him as this arrogant, smug, woman harassing pig. Basically, he's a bully. So, when one of the British characters stands up to him, the music swoons once again, indicating to the audience that they should be happy that the American jerk couldn't push people around anymore.To be honest, I have no idea if this is the perception that people in England have of Americans. Perhaps it is, and the viewers from England really did applaud this moment. But I personally found it all to be laughably cheesy.That's a pretty accurate summary of my take on the movie overall---laughably cheesy. I'll just leave it at that. I recommend that you take a hard pass on Love Actually.",Love Actually
163,ArizWldcat,As good as I hoped!,8,15 November 2003,"I'd seen the description of this movie about a year ago, I think, and couldn't wait until it came out! What a terrific cast...all of my favorites; Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman! The rest of the cast is quite strong, too. I was a bit worried that the cast was too large and that the stories would be hard to follow, but since most of the actors are quite well known, I didn't have any trouble at all. The story lines were smart and witty, touching held my interest! Hugh Grant is improving with age, too. There was a time that I would rather not see a movie with him in it, but he has redeemed himself in this movie as well as ""Bridget Jones"" and ""About a Boy!"" He was excellent in this, although his storyline was the most unbelievable, and his big speech made me roll my eyes, but I guess that's just the conservative in me. It wasn't enough to ruin the movie, at any rate. My favorite of the stories was probably the one with Liam Neeson and the child who played his stepson. Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson were absolutely brilliant, as usual.I will say that the nude scenes did make me a bit uncomfortable. (Probably this was because 3 older women behind me were screeching about how it ""ruined the whole movie""...yet they didn't get up and leave! hmmmm.) I almost wish those scenes had been left out of the movie as without them, it would be a fun movie that my daughters would like... I did appreciate the incongruity of the situation which has movie star stand-ins having simulated sex. The two of them are quite shy and reserved,just getting to know each other. Perhaps more creative people could have created another incongruous situation that would have been just as amusing and that would have made this a movie that young teens could enjoy as well. I don't think I'll let my 12 and 15 year old daughters see this for a few more years. It's too bad, because I thought the movie was well made and had some good messages. I plan to see this again with some friends soon. This was one definitely of my favorites this year. And looking ahead to coming attractions, it's likely to be one of the few romantic comedies coming out during November and December.",Love Actually
164,coasterdude44,Heartwarming Christmas Tale with so many great performances in this intertwining story about Christmas love,7,14 December 2019,"I would always watch this movie every Christmas time to be reminded that love is always all around and connects us all, It's a cracker of a comedy and always gets you in the Christmas spirit every time you watch it. With so many characters in one movie it's hard to follow at times but it's a feel good movie no matter which way you look at it.The comedy is great aswell with a special appearance from Rowan Aktinson who sprinkles his british comedic talent throughout the movie. The soundtrack is also great and very memorable with ""Love is all around"" being an instant classic for me and always puts you in the mood for Christmas. The script is very well written and some very sharp and talented directing. The whole concept of it is very original and something that more Christmas movies should do. I always watch the movie every Christmas to remind me that love really is all around us",Love Actually
165,iwatcheverything,"Good Romance, Lot of Nudity",8,4 January 2004,This film was great.  It was comical and even the nude scenes although very risque seemed okay in the way the film depicted them.  This is a film that was made for the holidays.  I wanted to see this a while back and just saw it tonight.  I will want to own this one.  Do expect to laugh many times while watching this film.  It does have some sad moments but this does not slow down the films momentum.  Although the film is long it does not seem as such.  If you are looking for a good romance or a date movie this one would be perfect.  Check it out soon.,Love Actually
166,mrcaw1,Hate actually........,1,6 June 2004,"This movie is such tripe that I now understand why a movie that was supposed to be so good did so poorly at the box office. Because the general public knows an over-hyped, shallow, vulgar, piece of crap masking as 'romantic comedy' when it sees it. I should have known that something was up when the credits were barely over & Hugh Grant is narrating about love and how there really is so much love in the world and that we just don't notice it and then he remarks on how the victims of the World Trade Center when they were making their last phone calls to family had nothing but love in their hearts not hatred which is probably true but seemed a very strange choice to use in the beginning of a romantic comedy. Apparently it was a portent of things to come.The movie shoves characters and story lines into our faces without any story development and then expects us to care as every clichéd trick in the book is used to squeeze an emotion out of us. My primary emotion throughout the movie was disgust. On top of this was coarse language totally out of place in a quote un quote light romantic comedy.So many story lines throwing so much out at us and we're supposed to be amused and engaged by all of this. As usual with ""multi"" story lines, after the first story is presented, the rest only serve to interrupt and distract or force the audience no matter how unwillingly to choose which storyline they prefer.It's a shame about the movie. There are some good story lines, some fine performances, Laura Linney in particular but again, the movie just jumps in without warming up it's audience so that by the time starts reaching it's dramatic peaks, you're too p***ed to care.And now we get to really bad part of the movie. Hugh Grant practically doing a parody of his on screen self is absolutely, atrociously bad as none other than the Prime Minster of England.He's totally unbelievable in the role.Billy Bob Thorton as President of the United States in a cameo role gives another great performance as a sleazy Clinton-esqe type.Unfortunately the film also includes a rather silly scene where Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister at a press conference with Billy Bob's President makes a rather dumb statement to the press about how the UK is although a small country, a great one and the US has been a big bully so the UK is going to be tough too. Seriously. This is presented as a serious political ""moment"" in the film. Besides the fact that the political statement is totally out of place in the film and besides the fact that UK's Prime Minister is standing strong and tall as an ally of the US despite criticism in his own country, besides all this, it's just another incredibly stupid moment in the film. This is one very strange movie.",Love Actually
167,johnny-08,Actually...excellent,8,16 March 2008,"Well this movie is actually...excellent. It includes lots of characters who are all in love in their own special way and the whole story is set in London five weeks before Christmas. We meet Billy Mack (Bill Nighy), old singer who tries to get back on top with help of his loyal manager Joe (Gregor Fisher); David (Hugh Grant) has just become the new Prime Minister and he instantly falls in love with his new personal assistant Natalie (Martine McCutcheon); Karen (Emma Thompson) and Harry (Alan Rickman) are married couple with their own problems; Sarah (Laura Linney) is women torn between a man she loves and her sick brother; Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Juliet (Keira Knightley) are fresh married, but Peter's best friend Mark (Andrew Lincoln) is in love with Juliet; John (Martin Freeman) and Judy (Joanna Page) met on shooting of porn movie; Jamie Bennett (Colin Firth) moves to France after he found out that his girl is cheating him with his brother and there he meets Aurelia (Lúcia Moniz), young Portuguese woman; Colin Frissell (Kris Marshall) hopes that he'll find 'normal' girl(s) in America; and finally there is Sam (Thomas Sangster), who is young boy and also in love, which makes a problem to his stepfather Daniel (Liam Neeson).So many characters and so many actors that are beautifully composed in this movie. All that is achieved Richard Curtis in his directorial debut. His story is for everyone. I think that lots of people could find themselves in this characters that are full of life and very real. Maybe the only characters that are little stretched are the ones of John and Judy. It's hard to believe that porn actors are so shy like they are both presented. But here Curtis makes fun with everything. That's why I love Britons so much. They smile to others equally as they smile to themselves. ""Love Actually"" rises above many romantic movies because it has great story, capable direction, top class actors and magnificent soundtrack mixed with some old and some new songs. I really can't talk about all the actors in this movies cause it would last for days; instead I'll mention only two: Bill Nighy and Emma Thompson. Nighy brings breath of fresh air to his character while he's making fun with his manager, his own hit song and Britney Spears. Emma Thompson, ah Emma Thompson. She makes acting so easy, makes you feel that anyone could act. She's so natural and believable, such extraordinary actress. There is also lots of cameo roles (Billy Bob Thornton, Claudia Schiffer, Denise Richards, Sienna Guillory...) and one hilarious appearance of Rowan Atkinson as jewelery salesman (he's like Christmas ghost, you know when he helps young Sam).Well, I almost forgot to say what is this movie about (at least how I understand it). It gives us a message; that we must search and struggle for love, we must make sacrifice, just like Jamie and Sam for example did, while Sarah choose the other way (her brother) and she gave up. Actually everything is said in the beginning; there is enough love on this world (great idea with airport arrivals). Actually, I advice you to watch this movie. Actually, I gave 10 to it, cause it's so much better then any other romantic movie I've ever watched. Or I could just say, love actually.",Love Actually
168,ilovedolby,`Love Actually' is a treat this holiday season and is easily the best romantic comedy of the year.,9,14 December 2003,"The opening solo of `Moulin Rouge' made the comment, `The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love, and be loved in return.' In `Love Actually' we get the same feel, except with combination of romantic, friendship, and familial love. It works remarkably well! `Love Actually' was written by Richard Curtis, who brought us `Notting Hill' and `Bridget Jones's Diary.' Curtis has a knack for showing the realities behind love that is not as sugar coated as the common Hollywood melodrama.	Hugh Grant plays the Prime Minister of Britain. He opens the film with a narration on the greatness of love. We get that impression as we follow all the characters as they struggle to accept the difficulties that come with love. No one just gets up one day and automatically finds that perfect someone. Sometimes, that perfect person is someone we cannot have. For instance, the character Mark (Andrew Lincoln) is in love with his best friend's wife, Juliet (Keira Knightley). In one scene, he goes to his friend's house, knowing that Juliet will answer the door. He signals for her to keep quiet, and he plays Christmas carols from a radio to sound like carolers. He then holds up poster boards in which he writes how much he loves her. She is flattered by it, but they both know that this will be the only time that such affections can ever be shown. It is one of conundrums of love-more often than not, it is kept a secret inside that person's heart when they want to tell the world. The scene is easily the film's most charming moment.  	Another hard fact that `Love Actually' faces is adultery and the pains that it can cause spouses-not from sexual infidelity, but from the loss of love. This happens between the married characters of Harry (Alan Rickman) and Karen (Emma Thompson). Harry is approached with the sexual interest of his secretary. Karen discovers the affair when she finds a gift that Harry plans to give to his secretary. Karen questions Harry as to what he would do if he found a gift that was meant for someone else that she loved, and approached the subject of splitting up. She says, `Would you stay, knowing that life would be a bit worse? Or would you cut and run?' 	One of the film's cuter tales follows the character Daniel (Liam Neeson) and his stepson Sam (Thomas Sangster). Sam keeps a secret-he loves a girl at school who is leaving soon. When he finally reveals it to his father's chagrin, the two conceive plans to let the girl know that Sam loves her. It leads to some of the film's cutest moments that would make us all laugh at our own childhood escapades to get to the ones we are in love with. 	`Love Actually' is marvelous in its humor. There are quotes that would make us smile and those that would give us all a good belly laugh. The funniest moment in the film, seen in the trailer, occurs when Bill Nighy, who plays an old rock-star making a comeback, is interviewed on the radio. When he is questioned as to whom he has had the best sex with, his answer is `Britney Spears. No, only kidding, she was rubbish!' 	There is some rough language and a few scenes with nudity, but this is clearly a film for adults. In the end, `Love Actually' is a treat this holiday season and is easily the best romantic comedy of the year. ***1/2",Love Actually
169,RhapsodyReviews,Great Rom-Com.,8,6 December 2019,"Review:
'Love Actually' is a Christmas-romantic-comedy film directed by Richard Curtis.
This is another film that has been a long time coming, when it comes to my first viewing. When the film first started, I was a bit nervous because it seemed very clustered trying to introduce all the characters in the story, but by the end I was thoroughly entertained.
The plot follows seemingly unrelated people as their lives begin to intertwine while they fall in - and out - of love. Affections languish and develop as Christmas draws near.
Everybody in this movie does a brilliant job. Some were more utilized then others given the amount of story telling this movie has, but my two favorite performances came from Hugh Grant and Liam Neeson. It may be do to the fact that they are fairly type-cast in todays world and being able to see them out of their element before they were stuck in it.
I like movies where characters are all connected in some way and we slowly find out how throughout the film. I think this movie pulls it off nicely and stories don't stop making sense. I do find however; some stories get lost while others are the main focus. Not every story is told equally, and this makes it hard to care about some of the characters.
Overall, aside from some of the characters getting a bit lost, the story about love is beautiful. It's funny, sad and heartfelt at the right times, and just the right amount of holiday cheer.

170,Ronin47,"Hit-and-miss, but the last 30 minutes are PERFECT (***)",6,22 November 2003,"Richard Curtis, the guy who wrote the screenplays for several classic British comedies (""Four Weddings And A Funeral"", ""Notting Hill"", ""Bridget Jones's Diary"") wrote and also directed ""Love Actually"", and with it, has set out to make the Ultimate Romantic Comedy. It even says so on the poster.It's over 2 hours long, it's crammed with several different storylines, well over a dozen main characters (most of whom know each other in some way), and has numerous subplots, some of which add depth and others that take it away. Yes, it definitely wants to be the ""Magnolia"" of romantic comedies. And...it doesn't really succeed. But it's a valiant effort.Although I do have to say that it certainly does LOOK like the Ultimate Romantic Comedy. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous.I'm not even going to try to summarize all those storylines, so I'll just say that it has an all-star cast including Hugh Grant, Laura Linney, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley and many others.Some of the storylines are very enjoyable, but others could have been cut completely and wouldn't have been missed. And it's that kind of constant teetering, between the interesting stories and the not-so-interesting stories that makes this ambitious film fall far, far short of being the ""Ultimate Romantic Comedy"". Not to mention the many dry spots and flat jokes.That said, the last half hour or so of ""Love Actually"" is about as perfect as a movie of this kind can get. All the stories are drawn together and concluded in a way that is very moving and satisfying. And I fell for it, what can I say? Sometimes, you just gotta surrender to the warm-fuzzies.It's nothing too special, and it certainly doesn't compare to some other recent British comedies, like ""About A Boy"" or ""Bend It Like Beckham"", but it's pretty enjoyable, has wonderful cinematography, a good soundtrack, and some nice Christmas spirit. So there ya go. It's more or less worth it.",Love Actually
171,blacklist-1,The best romcom of all time!,10,14 September 2009,"Ten minutes into seeing this film I was enraptured. This is two hours and fifteen minutes of pure cinematic entertainment.Everyone who starred in this film and helped make it have to be commended for a tremendous achievement.First of all Richard Curtis the director enlarges on the theme of love with 9 short stories and 22 leading characters. The technique and discipline of cutting to each story is incredible. Which goes to say for me this is one of the best edited films I have seen. Credit goes to Nick Moore.The acting from all involved too name just a few Alan Rickman, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Martine Mccutcheon, Emma Thompson, Kiera Knightely, Laura Linney, Thomas Sangster, Liam Neeson, Kris Marshall, Joanna Page and Martin Freeman is superb. Each character is convincingly believable and warm hearted in there roles.Also watch out for a hilarious cameo role from Rowan Atkinson. Love Actually because of so many stories and characters could have become confusing but due to the editing and there performances which makes them engaging and memorable. I never lost my way and cared about all the characters.The effect was charming, magical and cute. In particular Thomas Sangster who lusts after a girl at school and Joanna Page and Martin Freeman as the porno actors, which could have been sleazy and grubby, but because they act so professional with there occupations and are natural when getting to know one another made there romance sweet.The film makes you believe that they do love each other. Even the Sangston storyline.Curtis knows when to give the comic set pieces. Most credit to Bill Nighy and Kris Marshall, give the romantic escapism and to bring us back to reality in a dash as not all love has a happy ending.The cinematography by Micheal Coulter's is gorgeous by making London seem the love capital of the world.This film made me believe love exists and I came out of watching on TV with the biggest smile on my face. There are no criticisms for this film.It rightly deserved all the Oscars it scooped. One of the best films I have ever seen.",Love Actually
172,brian_r_wright,Ultimate post-911 feel-good holiday movie,8,1 December 2007,"There's a less subtle political subtext in Love Actually, which works equally fluently with the universal love theme: the prime minister David (Hugh Grant) is hosting the US president (Billy Bob Thornton) for a state visit. For the character of the president think of George Bush, loutish yet with an IQ elevated to 95. Thornton comes to town, does his ""I am the decider"" routine, expecting to ""get everything we came here for"" from the long suffering codependent UK weak sister. Only the new single PM, inspired by his attraction to a young lady on his catering staff, behaves unexpectedly. To the delight of his countrymen, the PM stands up to the bullying president, at least symbolicallywhich I think speaks to our current reality of just saying NO... to American empire. ...For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2007",Love Actually
173,The_Orenda,Disappointing.,4,10 June 2004,"It has been too long since I have seen an overlong display of sap, drowning over every heart the world over. 'Love Actually' will work at every chance it has to get you drawn in, with several stories from a large cast hoping that one of them will make you feel for the movie. It's all fluff really, and the cramming in of all the stories create one indifferent movie, with no time to really care about most of the characters.The stories of several couples and their love are told around Christmas time.For a romantic comedy, there is very little of the latter. Because of the length of 'Love Actually,' next to none of the charm works! It's boring and drives home its only point, that love is all around, so many times that you might as well take the film, throw it in the fridge, let it age and serve it at your next cocktail party with the red wine. Be prepared for a mind-numbing experience, with little chuckles.",Love Actually
174,snowfre,Somewhat messy but still successful in bringing Christmas joy,8,26 December 2019,"In ""Love Actually"", Richard Curtis puts together a British all-star cast consisting of mastodont actors such as Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Keira Knightley, Liam Neeson, a young - still not zombie slaying - Andrew Lincoln, cameos of Rowan Atkinson, and American Laura Linney. Not to forget, one of the film's biggest highlights, Bill Nighy. How to summarize the plot of ""Love Actually""? It's about a million love stories leading up to Christmas in which they are dotted together through the characters' relationships to each other. On my opinion, no one does the predictable genre of romcoms as interesting and funny as the Brits, and this movie is basically an orgy of every single pastiche. But it also contains originality; when have you seen the love story of two naked doubles finding each other on set (Martin Freeman and Joanna Page)? And when was the last time a Portuguese father called his daughter ""Dunkin' Donuts 2003"" when leading Colin Firth to his much more beautiful daughter. Yes ""Love Actually"" is a tender, but extremely funny film. It is long but deservingly so. There are so much get out of this fantastic cast. These aspects overweights the predictable storylines, thus giving me no other option than rating this over the top Christmas-bonanza a solid plum pudding smelling 8. The memorable moments are just too many to count.",Love Actually
175,budmassey,"I love ""Love Actually.""",10,17 June 2011,"""Love Actually"" is a film of exquisitely delicate emotions blended with just the right touches of humor to keep it from becoming maudlin. Everyone in the film appears to be an emotional train wreck waiting to happen. They dangle precariously at the end of their respective ropes over chasms of heartache. But what is so rewardingly beautiful is that each survives through different kinds of strength, inspiring viewers to find within their own strength in facing similar disasters.The incidental entwining with the Christmas season lends the many disparate stories a sort of framework that supports their almost imperceptible weight. Writer/Director Richard Curtis, true to form, constructs a brilliant and complex work that in the hands of lesser directors might have come off as diffused and ineffective, but in his hands comes together with astonishing elegance and power.Craig Armstrong's score is so beautifully subtle and yet powerful that it weaves with the delicacy of silk and the strength of steel throughout the film, masterfully setting its tone and unifying the diverse subplots into a seamless whole. The additional music is cunningly selected to provide counterpoint to Armstrong's score while at the same time complementing it perfectly.The cast is beyond compare, superb to the last detail. I can't even imagine where to begin singling anyone out, so I won't try. Suffice it to say that, in typical British style, the entire ensemble shines as a whole without any one cast member overshadowing another, no mean feat when the credits read like a Who's Who of what I would call ""serious cinema."" There are so many moments to treasure that, once again, I will not even attempt to single any out. You simply must experience them for yourself, which I recommend without reservation. This is yet another of those incidentally Christmas-themed movies that I watch without fail every holiday season. I could continue spewing superlatives, but I think you get the idea. I love ""Love Actually.""",Love Actually
176,arthera09,Not a chick flick,9,3 June 2007,"I think this is a one of the best movies that has come out in a long time and actually got a lot of recognition for it being a good movie. First of all the cast is beyond amazing. Some of my favorite actors and actresses are all there. They are some of the best actors out there right now. I think it may be one of the best put together casts that I have ever seen. Each part was cast perfectly and the only one that had a little trouble pulling off their role would have been Hugh Grant, but he had a very hard role to fulfill. I won't talk to much about the actors, but some need to take note. In only a few minutes of screen time Liam Neeson makes one feel really sad and I honestly got a little choked up when the songs starts at the funeral. That is impressive to get that much emotion in a role in such a short period of time. The next that need mentioning is just about all the scenes with Emma Thompson. I like the scene at the end of the play when she confronts Alan Rickman and pulls it off really really well. The next mention would be Laura Linney who I think it is just wonderful and I loved her role in the movie. My next is actually the young women who play Auriela. She put some physical mannerisms in there that made that character extremely desirable and made me believe that it was possible for Colin Firth to fall in love with her with such limited interaction. I almost fell in love with her. Now onto the substance of the film. I like how it approached just about every type of love and showed that it is not just boy gets girl, boy loses girls, boy gets girl back. I loved the different type of loves, from the love of two life long friends, love for a brother in need, a love between kids, a hopeless love, and all the problems that maintaining that love or even obtaining love. The ability of love to transcend language, age, and social class are all there. I liked how the movie dealt with nearly every type of love, but did not bore me by making an entire movie out of each story. But making the movie this way requires an incredibly talented cast and they had that. The soundtrack I loved and before this gets too long I would like to emphasize the point this is not a chick flick. It is just a really good movie that makes one feel good.",Love Actually
177,Ibuk,Love actually- filled me up with a whole lot of love,9,26 December 2007,"I only watched it for the first time last might and I was very impressed. What impressed me is that there is a perfect balance between romance and comedy. I don't normally go for rom-com so I was initially sceptical about watching it but I thought that since there was nothing else on I gave it a go, glad I did.Kiera Knightley was stunning but it was Hugh Grant who stole the show as the prime minister. He provided most of the laughs, the scene in which he is forced to sing carols for the chidren was hilarious. One of my favourite romantic scene is the scene in which Kiera Knightley realises that the best man at her wedding has feelings for her. Bill Nighy was also funny and so was Rowan Atkinson. The child (who also appeared in Nanny Mcphee) was so cute. One of the best romantic comedies I have seen in many years.",Love Actually
178,tequila101,Definitely Good Film for the Christmas Season,10,16 December 2011,"There have been mixed reviews about Love Actually and I have to say that it's not the case that it shouldn't be mixed. This film doesn't flaw nor does it bail on anything it makes itself out to be. The actors all are really believable in their roles, the story involving Christmas was a really good idea. Blending in romance and having the use of comedic and emotional scenes to top it off were all a blast in this film. The cast are excellent, again.I do remember watching this as a kid but I only remembered a few small parts of it. Because the film was set on Christmas, setting it off, I decided to try it out again, now being older also, wanting to watch it near Christmas time. It also used to premiere on channel 10 a bit.The film sets during the Christmas season where there are mix up's of all these couples trying to get together and enjoy this joyful time of the year for what it is. The film stars some of these actors: Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Bill Nighy, Emma Thompson and Keira Knightley. There are many more but the list would go on if I mentioned all. What I will say is that ""Mr. Bean"", Elishia Cuthbert and Billy Bob Thornton make small cameo appearances.I love nearly every character. They just pull of their roles really well and the casting of them was an excellent mix. I mean who could have thought that Liam Neeson would mix with Hugh Grant? I didn't know that all these actors coming together would make this film so special.I also love many of the scenes. Either emotional or comedic but either way, I found it to be enjoyable, EITHER WAY.Anyways, this is a film which deserves to be highly rated and those who don't like it too much must have cheesy films glued to their brain. This is a comedic masterpiece. Everything is put together so well, and when I was getting into it, like ""About a boy"" when the title credits ended, I was already into it, loving the characters, loving the scenes and praising the story for what it was.If you watch this film, you must watch it near or during the Christmas break. That's what I did and I'm so glad I did. This film goes for just over two hours and amazing thing is that if you're hooked to this, it won't feel like two hours.This film is an easy 9.5/10",Love Actually

What I got was a string of celebrity vignettes in ordinary situation comedy skits. It's easy to take and has enough laughs and romance for its running time, but fell short of my expectations. Take away the A-list cast and some of the sexual content and there is nothing that you haven't seen before. It could have easily been called ""Love British Style."" Liam Neeson's role as a recently widowed man was the most moving, but because it happened to him in real life, not because of anything that happens in this film. Laura Linney is given a reasonably compelling role, but the story hits a dead end, as if the writers didn't know what to do with her character. Hugh Grant is cast as the Prime Minister, but the role is written to suit his on-screen persona so his performance here seems generic and his pursuit of a member of his staff member seems far-fetched. Emma Thompson does well, but her role is pure soap opera. One can easily sit through this film and even enjoy it at times, as I did, but don't expect anything more than an decent time filler.",Love Actually

Really a perfect mixture of tears and smiles, a huge injection of happiness, in these dark days of filming shock and awe, destruction of planets and floods of blood. Clever scenario, an impressive number of prime actors (also in secondary roles), smart dialogues, sense and feelings and nice music too. One of the few happiest movies I have ever seen. My compliments to all (they are really too many) participants! Bravo!",Love Actually
185,skymovies,Possibly the smuggest film ever made,3,2 April 2004,"You can almost hear Richard Curtis chortling at his tripewriter as he trots out yet another batch of oh-so-clever gags, naff pop culture references, and mawkish sentiments. Weddings, funerals, Notting Hill, hysterical use of expletives - Curtis never seems to tire of having been there and done that, but I certainly have (the same thing happened after his brilliant Blackadder II series gave way to two largely uninspired follow-ups).I know that this is make-believe, but Curtis links his romances with ridiculous and lazily contrived scenarios to cover up the fact that this is nothing more than a collection of sketches. Admittedly, some are quite cute, but the 'horny idiot goes to America' story is just rubbish, and no number of celebrity cameos can fill the dead spaces in the script.The cast is certainly strong, but again, much of it is window-dressing - Keira Knightley might have million-dollar looks, but she's a two-bit actress. And Rowan Atkinson's store clerk is a direct rip-off of Eugene Levy's part in 'Serendipity'. At least Curtis has finally discovered that there are black people living in London.No doubt Love Actually's fans are legion, but no matter how much they enjoy it, they'll never be as pleased with it as it is of itself.",Love Actually
186,Jakemcclake,Great Music - Uplifiting - Romantic - But not much Story,7,24 March 2013,"I saw a movie that is often compared to this movie, ""He's Just Not Into You"". There are many similarities. This movie intertwines the tale of 8 couples. That is not a good recipe too begin with. For the movie ""He's Just Not That Into You"", it was a recipe that almost sent it down the toilet. Lucky for that movie it had really good actors and actresses and one story (the Gigi story) that save it and made it good.This movie ""Love Actually"" does not cause one to think, much about any of the couples. The stories mean little or nothing and the characters are forgettable. There is little to laugh at, if this ever was meant to be a romantic comedy. There are no peculiar characters. There is no clearly identifiable main story and not much to learn except ""take a chance and make a romantic gesture"" which has been said a million times before.The stories are cute and perhaps in some cases the stories are adorable. The actors and actresses, are very attractive, topping off with beautiful Keira Knighltly. The music is the reason to hear or see this movie. The music is fantastic and makes the movie worth seeing/hearing.",Love Actually

It's important that in a movie every person is valuable and effectively, but with so many, I despised more than half.It's around 150 minutes long. Everyone is having some angle with love, even affair or whatever.

Ever since I watched Robert Altmans Short Cuts I have had a thing going for all the small stories weaving into one. Like that Love Actually can compete with Magnolia and several other.Why? Probably because it gives space for thinking. The stories are spinning, and the viewer isn't forced to just be a mindless spectator, but may weave into the story, he may do something that is more worth while than just pouring out his money. Now of course the actors do great jobs do.Especially Alan Rickman... who gets to show that he really is a great character actor. But hey, Bill Nighy, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Keira Knightley, Hugh Grant, Billy Bob Thornton, Rowan Atkinson, Elisha Cuthbert and Claudia Schiffer are doing great performances too.They must have had the time of their life making it.",Love Actually

It was a sprawling epic about the state of being ""in love"" covering the whole of London, with an extension to Marseilles.  The greatest living actors in all of England got together (with a couple of Americans) to create a Christmas card.  A few of the many stories made me teary-eyed, and the story of the has-been rock star was hilarious.  The way the stories link up in various ways makes the movie into a giant jigsaw puzzle.  It's one of the great Christmas movies, up there with ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Christmas Carol"" and ""Christmas Story.""  The near-capacity audience in the giant theater where I saw it burst into applause a few times.",Love Actually
190,neenahhh,Love is all around us,9,12 January 2011,"A romance movie that wasn't about a love story, but about the wonderful gift of love itself.I wanted to download this movie some time when I was planning to watch Black Swan (December 28, 2010). I thought this would be a nice and heartwarming film like When Harry Met Sally, but it wasn't. It reminded me of that 2010 movie, Valentine's Day. In fact, I downloaded VD just to compare what was better.There were a number of crude scenes that I wasn't really expecting to see. John and Judy's ""sex"" scenes were very.. Mhmm. Turns out they were both actors who did naughty movies or something of the like.My favorites were Jamie & Aurélia (a writer and his Portuguese maid) and Sam & Joanna (young children).When it was still in the middle of the movie, I found that I wasn't particularly interested in any of the relationships except for Juliet & Peter (newlyweds) and Mark (Peter's best friend). I was wishing that they'd have included at least ONE homosexual couple in the movie, but ha. As if. I was wishing that Mark would be secretly in love with Peter, but.. Yeah, right. Turns out Mark was in love with Juliet, even though he's never talked to her before. :| Very unrealistic, if you ask me. I must admit that their ending scene (Mark with the cards), was very sweet, though. :D While watching Sam finding Joanna in the airport, I felt all kinds of chills. That was the moment where we see everyone being interconnected. When Daniel (Sam's stepfather) tells Sam to run, we see the mysterious jewelry salesman (who was introduced during Harry's- I couldn't see him as anyone other than Professor Snape, by the way- scene of buying an expensive necklace) kind of ""distract"" the airport employee. It made me smile. Rowan Atkinson (I couldn't see him as anything other than Mr. Bean) reminded me of an angel. After Sam runs through more obstacles (outrunning guards, for example), he stumbles upon another conflict; 3 staff employees guarding the entrance gate. Then Billy Mack (rock singer) comes up and catches everyone's attention. That is when Sam managed to run past, undetected. Very sweet.My favorite scene, however was Jamie & Aurélia's. We saw Jamie take Portuguese language classes. It was obvious he was trying to learn the language so that he could talk to Aurélia. When he reaches the restaurant where Aurélia works, he makes a big speech in her language, with many errors. In the end, he asks Aurélia to marry him. I was surprised by her answer. ""Yes is being my answer. Easy question."" It hit me. She tried learning his language, too! I felt so heart-warmed by that. :) Probably why they were my favorite couple in the movie.The last scene- where we see everyone again- was nice. It put closure in everyone's love story. Billy & Joe's friendship was nice. I even thought they'd be the unexpected twist in the end, where Billy was gay for his manager. But, of course that wouldn't happen. Juliet & Peter are happily married, with Mark being the supportive best friend. Jamie & Aurélia are still together. We also see that Aurélia's grammar has improved significantly. Harry comes back and there are no hard feelings between him and Karen. Or are they just being civil? I can't tell. Joanna comes back and Sam's there to greet her, with his stepfather, Daniel- who's there with another single parent he met, Carol- is also there with him. John & Judy are getting engaged. Colin comes back from America with a beautiful girlfriend, who brought her sister for Tony. David comes back from a trip and Natalie greets him with a kiss.Yes. Too many relationships. I know. I even got confused myself! That's the biggest problem, in my opinion. That's why I gave this movie a low rating. However, I don't think this movie should really be analyzed. People should just look at the big picture- the message that the movie is sending.""Love is everywhere. Often, it's not particularly dignified or newsworthy, but it's always there - fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends. When the planes hit the Twin Towers, as far as I know, none of the phone calls from the people on board were messages of hate or revenge. They were all messages of love. If you look for it, I've got a sneaking feeling you'll find that love actually is all around."" That's it. Love is all around. We all know that, but we don't particularly remember it. That's why this movie is here. It's to remind us of that fact that most of us take for granted or hardly even notice. Love is all around us. I did like that song, by the way.",Love Actually
191,Jexxon,"I didn't hate Love Actually, but I didn't love it either...",4,7 May 2005,"Obviously, Richard Curtis set out to make the ultimate love story film of all time. Love Actually contains no less than nine (I think) different stories intertwined a la Short Cuts. They try to cover virtually every aspect of love there is (however, not a gay one - I guess that wasn't PC enough for a Christmas time feel-good movie).Equally obvious is that there are way too many stories. The pacing is erratic, some subplots getting a lot of screen time, while others seem to have been forgotten about. Just witness how Laura Linney just disappears towards the end of the film. The end result would have been much better if they had just cut away half of the plots and fleshed out the remaining ones. In my opinion they should have kept the ones with Rickman - Thompson, Firth - Portugese maid, Linney, and (possibly) Keira Knightley.Too many of the others are simply completely pointless. For example, Marshall's trip to the US to sleep with American women doesn't go anywhere. The only thing it's there for is to show of some ""hot"" young actresses like Elisha Cuthbert, Shannon Elizabeth, and Denise Richards. Throughout the film, there's also an obsession with showing women in (or preferably out of) their underwear. There's no reason for it, and it just feels really tacky.The filmmakers don't want to risk that the audience actually has to think for themselves - so at every key moment in the film there's usually a song or a piece of music that lets you know exactly how you're supposed to feel. I know that everybody does it, but here it's just too obvious and clumsy. This can also be said about the choice of setting the film around Christmas time, as if most of these stories weren't sappy enough...In conclusion, Love Actually is a decent film that could have been much better. Cramming in material enough for three films doesn't make it three times as good as one. There are some really great moments, but they're all to often lost among not so great ones. With a cast as great as this one, it must be tempting to use them as much as possible, but as it is now, most of them are sadly wasted. This is definitely a film where less would have been more.

192,howie73,Terrible,1,24 March 2005,"This is one of the worst British films ever made and I'm staggered it has such a good rating here - no accounting for taste I guess. Why is it so bad? It's cloyingly sentimental to the point of being vomit-inducing: the characters are all middle-class and boring, wrapped up in their own self-obsessed tedium. London is re-imagined as a heavenly place which it isn't. Hugh Grant plays himself yet again - ah the tedium. The jokes are unfunny. The direction is patronizing and condescending. It's also too ambitious for its own good. Director Richard Curtis has attempted (attempted being the operative word) a romantic comedy that apes the multi-narrative structure of Altman's Short Cuts. It fails miserably to weave the stories together as Altman did; instead some stories such as the Laura Linney one remain unresolved as if they don't matter to the overall naffness of this terrifyingly awful film. The musical segments are also cringe-inducingly bad. I wish Curtis would have shown some restraint.",Love Actually
193,shu-fen,Ambitious attempt above-averagely achieved (aaaaa),7,6 December 2003,"The only thing I am not happy about is the cut of John and Judy censored footage!  Why did they do that in Asian release!  Because of those bed scenes?  I feel that I was cheated.  I love the movie, I enjoyed every moment so I want to enjoy ALL its moment.  Now, I am patiently waiting for the director's cut DVD.  When will it be out?  Anyway, I am not sure if R. Curtis has carefully calculated everything or not, undoubtedly it's a 100% ""money collecting"" commercial movie, one ticket for 10 love stories played by so many world-renowned actors, what do you ask more for?Good stuff for Christmas especially when so many Brit soldiers are still in Iraq.  Hugh Grant's words to BB Thornton, ""We may be a small country but a great one."" are truly the thought of most Brits in unity to both Tony Blair and GW Bush!  More love stories, more and more to the Brit troops.  At this time of the year, they need over-sweetened nectar plus positive messages like, ""Love actually is all around (you and I).""What a huge tank of top-notch actors not only from the UK, but also portuguese speaking countries like Portugal (Lúcia Moniz) and Brazil (Rodrigo Santoro), USA (Laura Linney) and astronomical-figured German model. Amongst all the male actors, Santoro should be the sexiest even without taking his clothes off, the Latin virility is filling the air... hmm... unforgettable.  Colin Firth's part can be cut away, it's not really attached to the main line.  Why such a development?  Poor Firth, he has to struggle with the Portuguese.  Actually this language is not for the mouth development of the Brits.  Perhaps Curtis finds that Firth's wife is an Italian, and Italian is so similar to Portuguese so he think this tall guy should be the one for Jamie because he listens to the language everyday at home!I don't exactly remember many of the actresses in the film but Laura Linney for her episode should be the one of the greatest love amongst all the subplots.  I gather that nowadays not many sisters would sacrifice her time, love, even career to take care of a mentally-challenged brother.Curtis can make lots of sequels:1) Alan Rickman should give a clear account of his dubious office affair with his secretary.  E Thompson is seeing him at the airport with the children and so what? (Another Kramer vs Kramer)2) How about Linney and Santoro?  Many possibilities.  Married? Living together and taking care of Michael?  Killed Michael (so it can turn to be a thriller)?3) Neeson and Schiffer's new life.4) See 3) N and S's boys' come-of-age movie5) Chiwetel Ejiofor, Keira Knightley, Andrew Lincoln triangular relationship, add some racial elements... (clash of civilization)Good discovery of the kid-actor Thomas Sangster, the never-met-before cousin of H Grant (an unimaginably enormously big family the Grants and Sangsters have, I believe).

194,rjsf96,Like Actually,6,30 June 2014,"It's a darned shame that Love Actually is only just okay, I like it; but the film's title is misleading for the most part. It definitely has likability, which when it comes to Romantic Comedies is somewhat of a miracle. Yet I have no capacity to love it, which the film wants me to, so frequently throughout the runtime that it can be a little unnerving. At certain moments it feels like the director is nudging the audience to chuckle, which when you are aiming for laughs in a film that has a high concept as much as this, is a little odd. The laughs for scenes with particular couples feel forced and unnatural; when I did laugh felt sorry for the film trying to hint that the certain scene or gag is in fact amusing.The film involves about eight couples in the weeks leading up to Christmas at London. It follows their antics and what they do in the countdown to Christmas, whether it is trying to get the Prime Minister's attention or one of the school teachers to like you. The characters themselves range from porn doubles to one guy who has fallen very deeply for his best friend's fiancée; so I cannot fault the film for its ambition or scale which is no mean feat upon Richard Curtis's part in particular, him being the director and the writer I am sure that most of the film was under careful consideration. Other parts I feel are not; it is really annoying that the flaws sometimes overlook the positive elements of the film.It is however, an exceedingly charming film that has infrequent laughs which can sometimes make the whole affair seem a bit dull, especially when it comes to the segments that have little humour, charm or even an actual point for that matter. In particular a scene with one of the characters trying to get girls to like him and repeatedly have sex. Fortunately the best moment comes from Bill Nighy as a singer who does not realise how bad his record is. Nighy can always make a film that is middle of the road, much better than it has any right to be and this is the case with Love Actually.Thankfully, the ending is fulfilling, much more so than some of the other elements that just feel there to add to the already unwieldy length. I cannot help but feel disappointed what with the amount of potential it had and most of which is wasted or lost amid all the different sub plots. It can be hard to get your head around a film like this, and it is certainly much more complex than it needed to be.A more appropriate title would be Like Actually. There are key elements that light up the whole affair and others that just crave the attention they feel, but in no way do they actually deserve. With many gaping flaws through the film; some that run fairly deeply, I cannot see why people adore Love Actually as much as they do.",Love Actually

I knew it was going to be really cheesy and shallow, but I thought I might get a little entertainment out of it. I thought wrong. There are 10 stories all happening at once, which is absolutely absurd. You will completely forget about all of them at one point or another. Why did the director include so many? There should have 3 or 4 tops. Any more than that makes your film cluttered and overly crowded. Because there are so many stories, each one gets very little screen time, which means you do not build a single emotional attachment to anyone in this movie. Since there is no attachment, you do not care about what is happening, which makes you want to go to sleep. On top of this, the film insists on beating you over the head with the message of ""love is everywhere in many different ways and you should act on your feelings on Christmas"". It is possibly the least subtle message in a movie ever. Nothing of value here. Stay away.",Love Actually

At best the movie gives you a choice of several stories from which you may find another more interesting than some other, or you may just enjoy all of them because each one of them is so different and none of them is too ordinary.

205,native_girl333,"""All You Need Is Love""",10,26 June 2006,"""Love Actually"" happens to be one of the best romantic comedies out there! Director/writer Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral)has made a combination of brilliant humor and heartfelt romance.""Love Actually"" is a mosaic story of people who are floating around in the breeze of complicated relationships. In the film there can be found several types of relationships. There is a story of a bachelor prime-minister (surprisingly funny Hugh Grant), a story of traditional love triangle, a story of deceitful love and many more. It's the Christmas season and love is floating freely in everybody's hearts. People discover the true spirit of holiday's magic and realize that Love is all around us.Curtis has managed to catch a few affront stars of United Kingdom and some of United States also. Great talents such as Alan Rickman. Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth and superb Bill Nighy make fantastic performances in this heartwarming comedy. Furthermore there is an amazing supporting cast around the stars backing up them.A hilarious revelation Curtis had was to include the hit song ""Love Is All Around"" of Wet Wet Wet which was made famous by ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" to ""Love Actually"". By replacing the love-word with ""Christmas"" and performed by the aging old rock star Billy Mack (Nighy) was a really good idea.The film is a marvelous example of an enjoyable romantic comedy which isn't being ruined by length. A nice two hours covers it all even when there's eight stories to tell. Even if the film consist some of cliché like turns it isn't numbing to watch. Big thanks to the director who realized there isn't always have to have gays or other that kind of things in every movie. Nothing against the minorities but sometimes a stereotypic characters of homosexuality are underestimating people badly.The soundtrack of movie is filled with holiday-music but includes also some great piece of music what you can listen whenever you want. ""God Only Knows"" by Beach Boys is one of the nicest ending songs there is. If you enjoy the movie you will even listen to the Christmas-songs in the middle of Summer!!! ""Love Actually"" is very enjoyable, incredibly insightful saga of people who discover the different ways of relationships. In result you get happy spirit and a lot of favorite characters whose life you want to see over and over again.I recommend it from the bottom of my heart!",Love Actually

Then there was the completely inane plot diversion involving the Brit who travels to Wisconsin and becomes the biggest stud in town . I was waiting for the dissolve to him waking up in the plane and realizing it was only a dream. This is the kind of light/cute film that used to only be made in the U.S. but after ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" has become a staple of British films.The soundtrack is omnipresent although halfway through you'd wish it would disappear.

Well, I've come to the conclusion that what I liked about ""Blackadder"" must have been all due to Ben Elton because I found this embarrassingly bad. After making myself watch about the first half hour, I realized I wasn't going to be able to stand to watch it at normal speed, so I tried fast-forwarding just to the Alan Rickman-Emma Thompson storyline segments, but the spectacle of Alan's character casually betraying Emma's with that Scandinavian gargoyle was too much for my stomach and I just ended up watching the rest of the whole thing at top speed. Now I'm seeing people yelping with rage over Garry Marshall's newest installment in his Love Actually-clone holiday-themed romcom series. If people hadn't emptied their saliva glands onto this movie so copiously we might have real movies for grownups in theaters instead of this kind of sludge, but you voted with your feet and this is what we get.",Love Actually
209,ronfernandezsf,"Strange, Actually",5,16 March 2021,"Not a bad movie, but a bit strange. A bit convoluted and overdone at times, especially with the boy at the end running around the airport. Very strange indeed. Most of the cast is on the mark, especially the wonderful Emma Thompson. She has a scene in the bedroom with no dialogue, but her face and actions says it all. Truly a brilliant piece of acting. The two porn stand in people could have been eliminated, and the English guy going off to America is truly bizarre. Completely unbelievable. Nice seeing January Jones in one of her first films. Truly a beauty. Too bad the Laura Linney character gets such a short shift.
Again, not bad, but not a must see!!",Love Actually
210,GuyCC,"Well Done, Actually.",10,6 December 2003,"To to a brief summary, this has been one of the more uplifting, witty and ""feel good"" films that I've seen this year, if not the most.  A combination of solid writing and an incredible cast makes this worth the watch for those who are not completely cynical on the concept of love.The overall plot follows the life of several couples or wannabe couples, and an aging rock star who could care less about ""Christmas spirit"" or a quality record. It's all about making a quick buck and a quicker comeback.  That particular subplot is hilarious due to ""Billy Mack's"" blatant and unrestrained candor that his newest ""hit single"" is utter garbage.The other plots each have their own charming moments, though my personal favorites had to do with Hugh Grant's, Liam Neeson's, and Colin Firth's subplots.  In my opinion, those were the more charming and fun of the stories.  But each story each had their own little moments, never really focusing too heavily on anything negative, and everything (generally with the exception of one or two) came to their own little happy ending.  This was carefully designed as a ""feel good"" movie, and it does its job very well.  And fortunately, the movie never drags or lingers in pacing, making the overall experience a satisfying one.  And very, very funny.The acting is remarkable.  It's amazing that this film would be able to have an ensemble cast of this size and caliber, and be able to utilize them as properly as they were.  The writing is clever and witty, with realistic sounding dialogue, and a nice ""bookcase"" feeling for the beginning and end. The subplot of Colin Frissell is by far the most far-fetched and unrealistic of the stories, but it's genuinely funny because it is so unbelievable. The soundtrack is light and pop music filled, and even helps the story along at points, instead of blaring for you to buy the soundtrack for a ""5 minute career Top 40"" artist.As mentioned earlier, this film is designed purely to cheer the audience up, and to cheer on the concept that love can happen for anyone in some form. It plays heavily on the ""happy"" factor without delving into sickly-sweet sap that you just can't take.  All this, and an eccentric cameo by Rowan Atkinson.It's nice to see a film like this that relies more on well-written humor and solid acting than what a lot of films have been missing lately.  I really couldn't get enough of this film, and I look forward to its eventual DVD release.Recommended if you just want to spend 2 1/2 hours having a movie cheer you up.",Love Actually

You would think that I would be over the movie by now and I thought I would but I could watch this movie at least one hundred times and still it would extract a smile and a laugh out of me. It is a good Christmas story and the acting is very good (it is British of course)Liam Neeson is good. Emma Thompson is good. Bill Nighy is hilarious. Alan Rickman reminds me of Professor Snape but is still great. Laura Linney is surprisingly good and so is Keira Knightley.

Quaint, I think is the word.A romantic movie usually leaves the audience with nothing more than a want for identifying with this or that character.

I like the theme of how everyone has a life, everyone has problems, each individual lives their own life main plot, and how everyone turns out to be related. I liked this film because it succeeds in showing that. However, working with a story composed of many equally important plots is no easy task, since there's limited screen time available. And I think that's what ends up affecting Love Actually. I feel some of the plots were rushed, like the one of the Portuguese girl, the one of the guy in love with his friend's wife, and even the Alan Rickman's one . Others even felt unnecessary and that added nothing to the plot, like the ginger guy traveling to America. I liked how the revelations of how each character is related with each other escalate, but it was tough for me to process how at the end everyone knows each other. Overall, the story is good and complies with the basics, but I think it misses in going a step beyond that.",Love Actually

Hugh Grant ( Prime Minister) is always the same. Dazedand confused look throughout a movie before ending up with the girl. Spoilers ahead: The best way to see this movie is to record it and skip every scene not involving Aurelia and Jamie ( especially the subtitles scenes showing their thoughts and his proposal to her in Portuguese).

Already the beginning of the film with the horrible Billy Nighy does not bode well and unfortunately it does not get any better. The film is far too long and tells completely implausible stories, which it somehow tries to hold together, but doesn't really succeed. Robert Altman would have approached this quite differently. And better. The actors are all likeable, but nothing more. Some play themselves somehow (Hugh Grant), others can't show their potential (Emma Thompson, Colin Firth).

217,greggman,"Wow, I can't believe how bad this movie is!",3,10 December 2020,"Somehow it almost seems like people are blind who like this movie. Either that or they somehow ignored the 95% of the movie that's crap and only remembered the 5% of ""feel good"" parts.I watched it because someone on a podcast I listen to said it was her favorite movie and she's watched it more times than she can count.I like ""good"" romcoms, maybe even mediocre ones. I remember enjoying Crazy Stupid Love for example. I remember enjoying My Best Friend's Wedding. So I was assuming this would be along similar lines. Boy was I wrong.There's 9 stories and almost all of them are crap---A British guy that believes if he goes to the USA he'll get laid. And guess what, he goes straight from getting off the plane to a bar and 4 hot roommates pick him up for a foursome. He then brings a 5th home to England and a 6th for this best friend in England who the moment she gets off the plane walks up to the friend and starts kissing him.WTF?!?!?!---A Writer who falls in love with his assistant, who happens to be 16yrs younger than him. They don't speak the same language. They hardly interact with each other. But somehow the movie claims they fall for each other. Nothing is ever shown to convince us of this except one moment where the girl undresses to jump into a lake to rescue some papers. That's not love that's lust, actually---A man in power over a woman has her fired because he has feelings for her. That's called sexual discrimination. Oh but it's okay because on Christmas eve he seeks her out. Please run this by some SJWs and see how that goes.---Girl interrupts sex with the man of her dreams who she's been longing for over 2 years because of a phone call. Any normal person would have pulled out the battery or turned off the phone. We're supposed to let this go because of ""reasons"". It was ridiculous---We have a boss who tells his subordinate to go hit on some other employee. We also have an employee who spreads her legs to try to entice her boss. Both of these would be called sexual harassment but because it's a ""romcom"" suddenly we're supposed to turn off our brains?---We have a best friend not along longing for his best friends bride / new wife but even going so far as to tell her. In what fantasy world that ever be a good idea?---On top of that it has 3-4 formulaic musical numbers. You know you're being manipulated when they pop on some old popular song and spend the next 3 minutes of filler with the song trying to transfer your affection for the music to the movie.---The mildly good arcs were maybe the aging rock star and Liam Neeson and is son's story though the love at first site moment toward the end was most more drivile.---Based on several lines, scenes, and actions in the movie it's clear the writers of the movie really should have titled this ""Lust, Actually"" Every romantic relationship in the movie is entirely based on physical appearance and sexual desire. None of it on love, appreciation, affection, respect. I'm all for lust but there's no balance here. Love is never shown, only lust.I guess I was lucky I missed it when it came out in 2003. I feel worse off for having had the last 2 hours and 14 minutes of my life wasted by this bad poorly written movie",Love Actually
218,jhsteel,Stand out moments make this worth revisiting,6,29 December 2010,"I like aspects of this film very much. Every Christmas, I watch this because my sister loves it and she wants me to watch it with her. Sometimes I think ""oh no, not again"" but then I remember the brilliant moments in the various sub-plots that make this a memorable film worth seeing again. For my taste, there is too much unnecessary bad language, and sexual references directed at children, which seems inappropriate to me even if it's a mature treatment of the subject. But I can usually forgive these lapses. It's well-acted and the performances that stand out for me are Emma Thompson, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant. All are doing what they do best, playing English people struggling with their emotions.It is a very British film and the reason why it may not have done so well in the US may not just be down to the PM's speech (referred to in earlier comments). There are a lot of subtle and not-so subtle jokes, and overall, it's a feel-good movie with some realism thrown in.I have read the other reviews on this site and it's interesting to see how polarised the opinions are. I'm tending to agree more with the negative comments and I think the problem with the film is that it's very unrealistic, and simplistic, and there are too many stories covered in a superficial way. Romantics might love it, but anyone who has a strong cringe reflex will probably dislike it. My previous comments still stand, but I'm not a big fan of it. I also think it does a dis-service to the image of Britain and the jokes are on the whole not very funny, unfortunately.",Love Actually
219,irish23,Wild ride of emotions & situations,7,27 July 2008,"How I view this film depends on what mood I'm in when I watch it. The first time I viewed it on DVD was during an extremely lonely holiday break, and I was devastated and drowning in Kleenex before the opening credits were finished. My most recent viewing found my reactions sliding all over the scale as the various story lines unfolded.Each storyline is a different type of romantic genre -- everything from ""Beavis and Butthead"" humor to painfully exquisite, understated drama (perfected by Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman). One of the strengths of this approach is that, if you don't like one style, another will be coming along presently. This is also a weakness.Each vignette has its own strengths and weaknesses, but the majority of the threads are strong. All the characters, no matter how outrageous, are likable. Weaving the stories together takes a very deft touch, and this is where the director missteps most often, with forced transitions that are jolting and confusing. For instance, the story opens with a tight focus on a black man; I'm pleasantly surprised to see so many people of color on screen. But it's not until the end of the picture that the character reappears (after a wild ride of story lines and emotions), and the shocking realization that we've been watching white people almost exclusively for the rest of the picture intrudes on the storyline. The opening and ending shots of Heathrow are extremely compelling because they show love manifesting in *people* -- not just trim, glamorous, white 30-40-somethings. It would've been nice to see that theme carried through the film with more diverse casting. Not just to make a more universal story, but to help ease the plot challenge of interweaving the many characters and story lines.As others have commented, the nudity in the picture was often a hindrance. While it did work to contrast our notions of ""sordid porn"" with the downright ""aw, shucks"" innocence of the characters playing it, the clash of vulgarity and innocence was often too powerful to be anything but distracting and sometimes offensive. It was certainly gratuitous.This is not standard ""let's shut off our brains Sunday evening and just veg out to a brainless romantic comedy"" fare. If you've just gone through a break-up, don't watch it. But if you want to contemplate the many manifestations of love, or just have a technical exercise in different forms of romantic genres, enjoy an evening with this.",Love Actually
220,FilmLabRat,"super collection of ""love"" cross-sections",8,25 December 2003,"Fantastic movie brings out all the things that go right and go wrong with love, including how high the stakes can be.  Beginning with a view of airport arrival scenes, it puts the world in the lens of love and offers everyone something to think about, because almost any situation is represented in short narrative... even a child's first love.  More honest than most screen portrayals and cleverly done with outstanding acting, it barely falls short of a masterpiece and certainly ranks as worthwhile viewing for almost anyone, anytime.  Filmed as an apt countdown to Christmas, it would also work for other times of the year.  This giant collage of filmmaking about relationships captures a lot of possibilities, potentials and pitfalls.",Love Actually
221,Exiled_Archangel,"Not that good, actually.",7,5 March 2004,"Love Actually is a cute romantic comedy. But just ""cute"" as I said. Nothing like a masterpiece, not even close. Quite superficial indeed. This much of romance is simply plasma state, i.e. does not occur on planet earth. The Hollywoodish screenplay surely doesn't add much to the quality. It's designed to be a feel happy movie, and that's pretty much the only thing it's good for. A few nice jokes, a hell load of beautiful women, an extremely unrealistic plot, overexaggeration of the love concept, a Hollywood movie shot by Brits. That's what Love Actually is. Not rubbish, but just not good enough.
I recommend it to anyone who can't stand watching movies with subtitles. That's the level of superficiality this movie matches. For anyone else, go find yourself a lover, and watch this movie when you both are drunk. Either way, you won't remember a trace of it half an hour after it ends, but you'll enjoy it while it lasts.",Love Actually
222,cleary-joshua,"This is a courageous effort from Richard Curtis, and he just about pulls it off...",7,2 June 2014,"Anthology films, or movies with a lot of different situations and characters, are very difficult to get right, because it is difficult to cram so much information into a 2 hour movie. You've got to make sure that everyone is given enough time to be a completed, three-dimensional character with no rushing, but also ensure that the film doesn't drag. ""Love Actually"" is a film made up of many different segments and characters, all of whom are interconnected in some ways. Some characters work really well, some don't work at all, and some are middle ground. It's a courageous effort from writer and director Richard Curtis, and he just about pulls it off.The film follows 10 different sets of people who are romantically involved, or hoping to be, all in the weeks leading up to Christmas. The ensemble cast is enormous, including so many Great British actors like Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman and Liam Neeson, and work together very well. It also contains Hugh Grant, who I have to confess is far more bearable in this film than anything I've ever seen him in before. Grant's Prime Minister is actually well managed, and his door-to-door search at the end is extremely enjoyable. Because the film does so much, I'll briefly talk about a few of the segments which I did really like.The story between Colin Firth and his Portuguese maid is really great, giving Firth the opportunity to play his very amusing bumbling British gentleman again. Their chemistry is truly fantastic, and the final scene when he goes to propose to her in her home town is really funny, especially due to the language barrier. The relationship between Liam Neeson and his son, played by Thomas Sangster, is also extremely sweet and endearing.On the flipside, one of the most beautiful and heartbreaking stories in the film is between Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, who begins an affair with his secretary. Thompson's character starts to suspect things, especially when Rickman buys an expensive gift which doesn't turn out to be for her. The gift is bought from Rowan Atkinson, who steals the entire movie with a brief yet hilarious performance. And when Thompson finally realises the gravity of his affair, she goes to her room and just cries, while Joni Mitchell's ""Both Sides Now"" is playing in the background. The emotion Thompson shows here is so raw and genuine, and it's a credit to the film and to Curtis that so many different emotions can be squeezed into 2 hours.Not all of the film works, and Kris Marshall and Martin Freeman's respective segments are a bit crude and gratuitous, adding little to the overall humour of the film. Bill Nighy's ageing rock- star is also quite dislikable, and spends far too much time on screen. It's not a work of genius, but it is fun and incredibly sweet, and to be honest I rather enjoyed it. It's also very Christmassy, and the perfect thing to get you in the festive mood (when that eventually rolls around again).",Love Actually
223,Denver53,A good movie that was badly named and marketed,7,3 June 2004,"I only saw Love, Actually because it was shown on a commercial flight and I was bored. From the TV commercials I had seen for it when it was in theatres, I expected it to be a lightweight, goofy romance almost in a slapstick vein, all set at a sappy time of year (Christmas).Well, it is set at a sappy time of year, and milks it. But the various storylines involved (following different couples at various stages of relationships) were far more realistic, thoughtful and serious than I had expected.The movie should have been called ""Four Stories,"" or something that made it less slapstick and more a view of different aspects of relationships. True, some of the relationships were slapstick, but that had a place among the more serious tales.

It engages with unrequited love, lost love, parental love and family love. It does this through a number of different narratives and characters, which all, for the most part, work very well off each other. Mostly, none of these narratives are under or over- represented. This is partly due to the great ensemble cast consisting of Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Andrew Lincoln, Keira Knightly and Rowan Actkinson amongst many others. For me, Rowan Actkinson was undoubtedly the star of the show. His comedic timing is just excellent.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/2TiY6F",Love Actually
226,segacs,Could have used a few less subplots,7,21 February 2005,"This was actually a pleasant surprise. If you can suspend disbelief long enough to buy Hugh Grant as Prime Minister of England, and you believe that the PM's job is so un-demanding that he's got nothing better to do than dance around in his underwear and pursue romance with pretty staffers, then this movie may be for you.As ensemble casts go, this one pretty much puts all preceding movies to shame. The question isn't who is in this movie, but rather who *isn't* in this movie? There is some great talent here, including Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Laura Linney, Alan Rickman, Keira Knightley... the problem is, the cast list just goes on and on, leaving each of the actors with only a few short scenes in which to develop their characters. Quite simply, the movie just tries to do too much.There are some memorable sub-plots (Hugh Grant as Prime Minister, Bill Nighy as a washed-up popstar itching for a comeback, Liam Neeson as a recently widowed father, etc. But there are others that just seem thrown in for no particular reason. Yes, the stories are all interconnected, as it turns out, but you never spend enough time with most of the characters to really ever care about them or to bother trying to sort out how the connections work.One of the best parts of the movie involves the amazingly talented-for-her-age Olivia Olsen belting out a Mariah Carey song so well that she made me overlook the fact that it was a Mariah Carey song. It's hard to believe that she was only ten years old when she did the part.Saccharine, sugary-sweet and light, this is a perfect date movie. Just don't expect to discover any deep revelations about life or even about love. All in all, this is a decent movie. But with a few less subplots, the main characters could have been much more fully developed... and it could have been a much better movie.",Love Actually

229,Laitue_Gonflable,I'm grateful to Richard Curtis,8,12 December 2003,"I would consider myself a lifelong fan of Richard Curtis, from Not the Nine O'clock News and Blackadder to Four Weddings & a Funeral and, of course, without a doubt his greatest work IMO, the 1991 telefeature Bernard & the Genie. So naturally, his next feature is always eagerly anticipated by yours truly, especially when he finally makes the big step from writing to directing. All I can say is, I am extremely grateful for this film.I'm grateful to him because he has produced another gem. A funny and touching, sentimental film that really puts one in the Christmas mood. The difference between this and his other films is that it contains numerous different stories (I haven't had time to count them all), rather than just the simple love story between two main protagonists with several supporting characters and subplots. They're all intertwined, very loosely it has to be said, but it doesn't really matter, since they're all sweet tales and I loved all of the characters in one way or another. Despite the limited time spent on each one, we get a fair insight into the characters and their lives.The cast is wonderful, and Curtis does wonderful things with them. Neeson, Rickman, Thompson, Grant, and Firth all give very fine and sympathetic performances. Bill Nighy is hilarious as an ageing rock star out to grab publicity for his awful new song. And of course, a special personal mention must go to the short but sweet Martin Freeman/Joanna Page story, since for me it's wonderful to see Martin finally get the girl and be happy after seeing him strike out in love in two series of ""The Office"".I'm also grateful to Richard Curtis simply because the film is predictable. Like so many other romantic comedies, it just wouldn't work if it weren't. If he tried to stretch the boundaries, cross borders and experiment; If, for example, every story didn't end on a high note with everyone falling in love and hugging and kissing, we'd feel ripped off, surely? It does what it's supposed and what it promises to do, and not only that, but it does that many times over, in the same film.Plus I'm grateful that he didn't resort to hackneyed ideas; every story has its own journey, and although we know the direction it will eventually take, there is enough winding in the path along the way to keep us interested. There are also no cheap laughs; towards the end of the film there is a scene where a character looks through a glass pane at another character below. I was terrified that Curtis may ruin the film by inserting yet another cheap sendup of the church scene from ""The Graduate"" but he didn't. For that I'm grateful.So basically, I'm grateful because he's given us yet another brilliant film. One to amuse and one to touch us. If you're a fan of 'warm' then this is definitely a film for you. It may be just like every other romantic comedy, but with one important factor; it's undoubtably one of the best.",Love Actually

The only real issue with this movie are the many on-going love stories at the same time, maybe if they had removed just a few of the many main characters, at times i felt confused over it all and it made the movie less intense of each person than it could have been, but in the end everything worked out, i especially loved the guy going to america, nice to see a british movie that can make fun of themself while displaying america as a strange country as well, everybody whom have seen this movie will know what i'm talking about if i say ""Bottle"" hehe.Out of the love stories i preferred the one with Keira Knightley really the best, and the moment with the carol singers and the friends confession was so original and warm i couldn't help it to admire both these two in that exact moment, a well done scene, best of the movie, and a scene that is doomed to be copied in future movies.I could praise this movie so a while becuase it's been a while since i've seen a movie that had an aim of being an romantic comedy, and then it wasn't even stupid, it's nice to see that hollywood's dumb romantic comedies haven't taken over england yet, damn well done!8/10",Love Actually

You anticipate the film hopelessly counting down the days but trying not to think about because you're afraid you'll hype the film to death.Then you see it and are dumbfounded. They caught lighting in a bottle. You get what the trailer promised and more.This film has no pretensions and doesn't do those stupid reversals most romantic comedies do when the result of the story is pre-ordained. This film is no more or no less a tale of people seeking to find happiness in their lives and to share that with someone else. It's a romantic comedy for real people. And for those people in the cliché of people who hate romantic comedies'This film makes you glad to be alive. It's cinematic bliss. If you're looking for a purely visceral, emotional experience with a lot of laughs you should definitely see this film.All the storylines do not detract from the emotion or the narrative structure. Upon first viewing pieces of each characters tale may seem as if they're spread too fart apart. And you find you want to get back to the Prime Minister's story or Jamie's but by the end you love all the stories. And the pay off is great.It's one of the year's very best.",Love Actually
234,Rozinda,A very enjoyable movie and Hugh Grant is outstanding.,10,26 November 2009,"This movie isn't quite as good as Notting Hill, but it's very good fun. Hugh Grant is the star, as the PM who succeeds Tony Blair at No. 10. His romance with No.10's teagirl is lovely, but even better is his performance as PM doing things we all wanted Tony Blair to do but he didn't! For me Hugh Grant is a class above everyone else in this movie, but if he isn't for you there are plenty of other characters to like as it's an ensemble movie. I don't usually like ensemble movies and I wasn't very keen on Four Weddings but this one works well as all the characters are entertaining.I first saw Colin Firth, so far as I remember, in Pride & Prejudice and it was rumoured that he wasn't keen on the part. Yet he acted it splendidly and received many accolades. I wondered why he'd not be keen on the part - until I saw him in some of his later movies which I think showed Darcy wasn't the kind of part he usually acted. In this movie he suits the part in this movie and his character's romance is really charming - he can't speak her language, she can't speak his....... and so neither has any idea how the other feels. The other story lines include ...A man who stupidly buys a very expensive Christmas prezzie for his predatory secretary even though he really isn't after her at all, and his wife finds out and is devastated. A young boy who's fallen in love with a teenage girl and doesn't know how to tell her. Kids who are acting in The Nativity as all kinds of strange animals (it's a lovely sequence, the actual performance, with an unexpected ending!) A Best Man who's in love with the bride. A young man who goes off to Australia and comes back with a girl for himself and his friend as well. A couple of actors who seem to be making suggestive adverts in which they wear less on each occasion, and their totally detached conversation throughout is hilarious. But the best of all next to Hugh Grant is Alan Rickman (I think it was him anyway) as a very faded popstar who's made a Christmas CD. You mayn't expect how his romance works out but really is Love, Actually.Final comment - would that we had Hugh Grant as our PM!!",Love Actually
235,christophaskell,...perhaps the greatest romantic comedy of this young millenium,9,17 November 2003,"Love, as a word, contains a hundred different meanings. Loving someone covers many situations, depending on the context it's used in and your relationship with that person. Even though certain love might be hard to understand, and even harder to express, Christmas generally is the one time a year where you're allowed to make said expressions, where you're allowed to say how you really feel. Especially in the world Richard Curtis creates in Love Actually'. By using the trendy technique of telling a billion stories at once and having their interdependence gradually revealed, he has crafted perhaps the greatest romantic comedy of this young millennium. With Love Actually' Curtis raises the bar at what we're allowed to laugh at (by showing us what would have previously been considered too risqué), challenges us to keep our eyes open for love (it might be in the place you least expect it), and most importantly challenges the studio system by redefining the romantic comedy market (up until now being monopolized by teens or young twenty-somethings). My hope is that everybody gets to see this movie: it has a wide release over here in the states and it's currently on at least two screens in all those big multiplexes. If you have loved on any level, from a friend to a spouse to your young child, you will find someone to relate to herein. And in a wonderful surprise, someone finally separates the genres romantic comedy' and chick flick', Curtis making a film that's just as side-splittingly funny as it is saccharin and romantic. Cancel plans if you must, but make sure you get out and support this movie in the theaters. If you're reading this after the movie has left the theaters then make sure you go rent it soon, you'll be very happy you did. Rating: 32/40",Love Actually
236,canadude,the magnum opus of the romantic comedy genre,9,13 March 2004,"It is. And I generally don't like romantic comedies because the plots are too contrived and the characters (of which there are usually two, of opposite sexes) fall too easily together. ""Love Actually,"" however, reconstructs and outdoes the genre. It's the ""Nashville,"" or ""Magnolia"" of romantic comedies; a multi-character, multi-sub-plot, multi-layered and hard-to-describe-without-a-crapload-of-hyphens film. It's pleasant to watch, it tries to be very honest and it's constantly entertaining. The stories intersect through the relations between the 12 (or whatever) characters, and often in a very amusing way. But they also cohere through the common theme: namely, that love is present in one way or another in each of the characters' lives. The movie has several advantages because of its large cast. With many stories, the film has both pay-offs known in romantic comedies (ex: guy declares his undying love for a girl in front of a large crowd) AND romantic disappointments. Still, regardless of what the characters go through, and where fate takes them, ""Love Actually"" never falters in its warm atmosphere and great sense of humor. It's a pleasure to watch - and it's one of the few comedies that I've walked out of smiling and not feeling cheated by the story. It's a romantic comedy that transgresses the conventions of the genre and does it refreshingly well.",Love Actually
237,H_Spengler,Terrible actually,2,20 December 2008,"How do you have a stellar cast: Rickman, Nighy, Firth, Thompson, Neeson, Knightly, Grant, Linney, etc. And have such a terribly depressing, dull, boring movie???!I really looked forward to this mostly because of the cast. It was actually embarrassing watching them play out a script that was surely pounded out by a group of attention deficit apes. Whoever wrote this movie had absolutely no concept on what romance apparently is. It's more a depressing demonstration on the effects of keeping your mouth shut, staying together out of habit or for the children, and carnal lust over someone with the depth of a parking lot puddle. There was absolutely nothing redeeming, funny, or romantic about any of the stories or people involved in them, and the one couple (Rickman & Thompson) who you remotely find interesting spend the movie building up a semi acceptable story that completely falls flat without any passion or resolution. Rickman contemplates cheating, or does actually cheat (you never know) she finds out and confronts him on it, and that's it, nothing more, you never find out what happens. There's just some lame robotic like kiss at the airport. I was actually insulted. It doesn't help that any of the couples except for Thompson & Rickman lack any chemistry together whatsoever, and even then Thomapson & Rickman are dull as dishwater. Whomever wrote the part for Linney did a poor job. She started off good, but fell flat on her face as were forced to accept her role as an apparent forever enslaved spinster. The tragedy is that most of these actors have either won or at least been nominated for Oscars and have actually proved their guts in romances Thompson (Sense & Sensibility), Grant (Four Weddings & A Funeral), Rickman (Truly, Madly, Deeply), Firth (Bridget Jones), Linney (The House of Mirth) need I go on?I'll never recapture the time I spent watching this, and i'm getting upset thinking about it, but hopefully my review will help you in not wasting your time with this one. A horrible waste of a group of very talented passionate actors.",Love Actually
238,RJBose,"Quite Good, Actually",8,11 November 2003,"This fairly-tale land of upper-class London has by now become a friendly and familiar venue to American viewers of such movies as ""Notting Hill"", ""Bridgit Jones' Diary"" and ""About a Boy"" (all featuring Hugh Grant in simple variations of his one character, as a matter of fact).  The pervasive nature of American Culture in the very fabric of British life is quite an interesting phenomenon, and it plays quite a significant role in ""Love, Actually"", though perhaps without intending to. ""Love, Actually"" is a series of vingnettes strung together about a dozen or so characters whose lives are somehow all connected, which makes for easy transitions from the individual characters and their separate stories.  It is quite entertaining, and sometimes touching, though sometimes also very familiar from previous films of the genre (a climactic scene at an English school student production, for example). America features quite prominently directly as well as indirectly, which may explain a rather awkward and unnecessary scene in which Hugh Grant (as the Prime Minister of England) loudly proclaims Britain's independence from the United States of America, to the apparent adulation of his staff, and the British public.  I am unaware of the English feeling repressed by the US, but the scene struck me as one of those contrived sequences in ""The West Wing"" (an American TV show alluded to in the movie, ironically) in which the Left-Wing script writers have a character spout off about some pet issue-of-the-week (gun control, global warming, ad nauseum) to put everything right in their fantasy world where Martin Sheen is President, and the Democrats always win.  This American President (played by Billy Bob Thornton) is a leering, smug Bill Clinton-like weasel whom Grant's character spots hitting on the housemaid to whom Grant himself has taken a fancy; British international policy thus dictated by the hurt feelings of an English PM, who puts America promptly and coldly in its place at a Press Conference, while Thornton looks on in surprise and dismay. America is described as a land of opportunity (of a certain sort) for a buffoonish would-be casannova who flies to Milwaukee, lands up in a random bar, and has all of his dreams remarkably come true (as in a beer commercial).  It's quite funny, but also rather a meanspirited swipe at the women of America's heartland.  A little boy pines for a classmate, who will soon be returning home to (guess where?) and one of the main characters is herself apparently American (and doomed to one of the only segments without a happy ending).  Movies, music expressions and customs all imported from West of the Atlantic punctuate and permeate the film; and of course, most of the film's profits will be generated from the spending of American movie goers. Politics and sociology aside, ""Love Actually"" is really a rather entertaining and pleasant film.  The segments dealing with the two characters who are stand-ins for the lighting and staging of a pornographic film have elicited many comments from other viewers, but the innocence of their burgeoning romance, juxtaposed with their increasingly intimate postures was also clever. It's really worth seeing, actually.",Love Actually
239,Paddy-49,Ambitious movie with lots of authentic Richard Curtis moments,6,18 December 2020,"After ""Four Weddings"" and ""Notting Hill"" Richard Curtis's next foray into the RomCom genre was ""Love Actually"" which, for the first time, he directed as well as wrote. It's a very ambitious movie with multiple plots and sub plots and fast cut switching between them. The cast is strong and it has the gloss of a high budget film. I suspect that like me not everyone will like all the plot lines but overall it's a satisfying Christmas movie.The romance between the jilted Jamie (Colin Firth) and his Portuguese housekeeper Aurélia (Lúcia Monica) is delightful. Set in Southern France it is an ""odd couple"" story - they have no common language but clearly strong mutual feelings. The scene where Jamie flies into France intent on proposing to Aurélia is cleverly written and very well set and directed.The premise of the developing affection between John (Martin Freeman) and Judy (Joanna Page) is that despite acting together naked as stand ins for a porn movie they are personally shy with one another away from the set is rather preposterous. I found these scenes rather repellent but others might not. Personal choice I suppose.The best performances in the film come from Alan Rickman, as Harry, and especially Emma Thompson as Karen whose apparently happy marriage is threatened by the arrival in Harry's office of the uber-sexy Heike Makatsch as Mia. Whilst there may not have been infidelity (it's unclear) Harry's expensive gift to Mia suggests intent. When Karen finds out Thompson plays a scene of genuine pathos.The Colin Frissell (Kris Marshall) story is a fairytale relating how the spectacularly unsuccessful in love Frissel decides to try his luck in America where three gorgeous girls immediately take him on and invite him to move into their apartment , and beds. It's very silly but very funny as well.Sarah (Laura Linney) has a passion, unconsummated, for the handsome Karl (Rodrigo Santoro) in her office. They do finally ""connect"" and are getting down to some love-making when Sarah's mentally disturbed brother interrupts with a phone call. I found this improbable as well as sad and slightly pointless.David (Hugh Grant) is the handsome but single new Prime Minister. He falls for the Number 10 tea lady Natalie (Martine McCutcheon) and another improbable fairy tale romance story begins to be told.There are side plots and other characters in what is essentially a feel good movie and a showcase for cameos from actors of quality. The tour de force is Bill Nighy's portrayal of the fading rock star Billy Mack - this alone justifies seeing the film.""Love Actually "" is a bit over complex and very variable in the quality and believability of the storylines. But it's a clever potpourri around the subjects of sex, love, friendship, obsession and the rest. It's hits its mark most of the time and will make you smile much more than it makes you cringe.",Love Actually
240,iamyuno2,Delightful Holiday Film - If You Suspend Your Disbelief (And Please Try),8,28 December 2013,"Touching, moving and yet a movie that leaves you feeling good - even if you shed a tear in the process. Yes, it's imperfect but it's so good in its better aspects that it's easy to sit back and just enjoy this good-time holiday pic. And helping us forget the few corny moments of the film are the many wonderful vignettes put in by a wide variety of fine actors. Also making this an 8-star movie are the touches of real life that ring true on a deeper level and speak to serious issues we all have to deal with - all the while providing comic relief in most cases (not all). I'm not a huge fan of Hugh Grant but he provides some wonderful comic moments here, as the British Prime Minister - including a somewhat Scrooge-like transformation that warms your heart near the end of this film. Bill Nighy is brilliant - and if you're not aware of his work, you will admire him after seeing this film. But perhaps Emma Thompson is the one who most gives this movie its greatest depth. It is her role that demanded the most acting skills and she rises to the challenge - as she always does. What a great actress - and even in this light comedy she impresses. There are aspects of the ending that are cliché and could have been better but slog through the final concert scene and the airport scene because the final video statement will really get you, summing up all the disparate stories in one neat heart-warming visual commentary. You'll need a handkerchief - even though it's mostly laughs you'll enjoy. Because Love Actually does have its ""aw!"" moments.",Love Actually

242,shiftyeyeddog,Too many story lines...,5,5 July 2007,"There's a good movie in here somewhere. A few story lines, given more screen time and development, could have made for a very entertaining Christmastime romantic comedy. Unfortunately, the glut of story lines and overstuffed cast ultimately hurt the film. No story is given enough time to make us really care too much about any characters, and several feel like they were completely superfluous and unnecessary. The Brit who went to Wisconsin, the porn stand-in couple, Laura Linney and her co-worker, Colin Firth's story... these were all completely pointless. Keira Knightley's storyline probably had the least screen time of all, to the point where when they showed up on screen near the end, both Kathy and I looked at each other and said, ""I'd forgotten about this whole story!"" While Keira's jaw and gritted-teeth smile annoy the hell out of me (and her stick-figure doesn't help), this is one of the stories that had potential, but failed to deliver due to it brevity.Several of the characters, therefore, were also unnecessary, especially the pointless cameos. Rowan Atkinson, featured on the poster but barely in the film, Shannon Elizabeth, Denise Richards, 24's Elisha Cuthbert... and I don't buy Billy Bob Thornton as the U.S. President for one second. The best actor of the movie was probably the kid who played Liam Neeson's son.So basically it's disappointment.

245,folsominc2,What the English Really Believe About Love,1,12 March 2008,"I had seen the ending of ""Love Actually"" on cable television and never was inspired to rent or borrow the movie. I suppose it was the idea that Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister was just such a ridiculous idea that I felt the entire movie was a bunch of hog wash. Illogical actions like the Prime Minister dragging members of his security out on Christmas Eve to hunt up and down a street for a girl was a bit stupid since as the head of England government couldn't have her address within seconds of requesting it.However, as I have recently had a fixation on the career of Colin Firth and found out he was in it, I fought with myself for several weeks before renting the film  and brother! I just couldn't believe the disgusting crap that was in almost every scene and the over powering anti-American attitude.From the fact that our American president was portrayed as a womanizer (which I am assuming they meant Clinton except the actor looked like Bush) and a bully and a plain old-fashioned jerk to the fact that ALL American women are represented as loose, into kinky sex and available at the drop of an English accent was predominant.What do you think really bugs the English about America and our people? Could it be the fact that so far, their European influence and amoral attitude hasn't completely destroyed our Christian stability in this country? Or could it be that whenever they get into a disagreement with another country like Germany or Italy, we have to bail their fannies out of it by sending American troops to die on the battlefields? Or are they still hung up that over two hundred years ago, our Country and soldiers made up of a bunch of back woodsmen freed itself from their tyranny? The entire picture was full of foul language, kinky sex and NO ONE really understood the meaning of the word LOVE  except, of course, our hero's character, Colin Firth. That character was perhaps the ONLY one who fell in love without sexually experiencing his heroine beforehand.As usual, he was fantastic in the role, but his only three shots in the movie do not make up for all the disgusting sexual perversions and language in the rest of the movie  even by the young boy, Sam, as depicted by Thomas Sangster. And even Colin Firth and his heroine had to say the ""F"" word at least once in an unnecessary situation. This must have been a requirement to each scene because that word came out in the most needless circumstances.The truly heartbreaking thing is that Colin Firth is perhaps one of the best actors to the modern-day film making industry; however, he plays in the most stupid and ugly crud and trash that is out there. No wonder he can't shake the ""Mr. Darcy"" image. That was the best thing he ever played in!",Love Actually

Who else would have the courage to open the film with a voice over that pondered the cell phone calls from the September 11 aircraft passengers, and suggested that surely none of them were calling with messages of hate, but of love?

Yet when it was nominated for a Golden Globe and I saw it was playing at the ""$1.50 Theater,"" I decided to give it a try.  What I got was much more than my money's worth: a truly delightful, thoughtful film.""Love Actually"" is advertised as a romantic comedy, but I believe the movie was much more than that.  Richard Curtis' story is complex, yet believable, showing the ties between between several different people with the common factor of love.  Also, the love portrayed is not only romantic love, but also love for friends and love for family.  The love in the movie is often unexpected, sometimes not, but always enjoyable.  The movie was simply hilarious, seemingly without much effort.  Also, Craig Armstrong's score is simply immaculate, portraying the themes of the movie through both uplifting and dramatic pieces.  The score succeeds in not only showing the ups and downs of love, but also how little events can seem over-dramatic to those involved, especially those ""in love.""Complaints: I have very few for this movie, because of how extremely enjoyable it is, but I must say two things.  First, the beginning, maybe, fifteen minutes of the movie seem chaotic,as Richard Curtis switches from one story to the next.  Yet the movie quickly warms up as the characters in the movie are developed.  Second, those who read my reviews probably get tired of me saying this, but there was a little too much nudity for my tastes.  However, I will say this, I liked the point that the director makes through his use of sex scenes.

Then proceeds to try and pull the wool over our eyes by showing stories mostly consisting of lust, immaturity, misogyny, and stupid self-indulgence.A maid who doesn't speak his language takes her clothes off and has a tramp stamp – all that is needed for true love for writer whose wife cheated on him. Spends 3 seconds at his family's house at Christmas but leaves to be with the maid and propose marriage when they haven't even had a real conversation.Prime Minister who disses American President because he kisses girl that works in the office from the wrong side of the tracks.; they call her chubby, which she clearly isn't; then he ""redistributes her"" from the office.

No sadness at Christmas missing his dead mom, just playing drums to get the attention of a girl; staring at her creepily.

You find yourself wanting each character to achieve their desires though you know in your heart that some dreams won't come true.

Also, the commentary track with The director, Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy and the main child star is by far one of the best commentaries I've ever heard. And to top it all off, my wife loved it just as much as I did.",Love Actually
259,enigmaticmaniac,It will make you fall in Love,8,19 October 2011,"At last watched this one and believe me I carried a smile across my face throughout the movie. The moment it starts and the music starts playing am pretty sure everyone of you will want to remember the one you love. The music is simply awesome and not just in beginning but entirely including the background score and its just too romantic. Now talking of the script, its quite well written with the interwoven lives of the cast and it exactly manages to depict life and how its affected by love. Everyone in the cast has done a good job. Movie carries on a tint of humor throughout with all the cheesy bits. Its quite beautiful and contains a lots of hooting moments for audience especially the story of the kid which is really cute.  It has those touchy moments as well. Although some negativities are shown but its perfect as love is not always ideal. But I guess that you won't find yourself noticing that as the movie will just make you fall in love. Perfect to watch with your partners and get cozy. I want to watch it over again and just can't let go of the music from my mind. Its not perfect I will say as some parts are exaggerated and loosely screen-played but still its a much watch. Loved it.",Love Actually

Started up muddled, and after much patience, maybe it became a little more solidified by the end, but then, just as, well, it was over. In the beginning it was probably a good idea, maybe even should have made a good movie, but? More just disappointed from the let down though.Always knew the Brits had a mixed up view of love and relationships, it must be the total mixed bag of cultures, as it doesn't always mix and that confuses them.""You could spend ages just trying to work out where the various connections between the story lines actually were."" Humm? I expect to use my mind a bit, as formula is hollow, but I truly believe at least the director should know the answer to this issue. The commentary leaves it a real issue. Maybe he shouldn't have cut the hour out; then again maybe he should have cut another hour out. A few scenes and moments only makes me more frustrated with the rest of the mess.I don't mind the syrup, nor the Gordian thing, but it moves through a façade, pretending profound, then you realize how shallow, maybe stock.

263,Ellie-23,What a hoot!,9,5 August 2004,"I bought this film for our collection not noticing that is was R rated, now I will add it to my collection and buy something less revealing for our library.  Admittedly there is nudity, language and questionable behavior but it is so funny and outrageous that by the end I decided I had to keep the film-wish I'd bought the DVD now. The story involves several couples and at times it is hard to keep them straight.  I knew of three of the actors; Hugh Grant Liam Neeson and Alan Rickman so I had to get familiar with the other faces.  I wanted the film because it was a Christmas time comedy. I nearly fell off the couch when the one guy flies to Milwaukee to meet girls.  Brit accents are popular in this country and I can easily see this happening to some extent.  We tend to be pretty relaxed and open to strangers, of course the film goes a little far. I liked the part Alan Rickman played, I have only seen him in the Potter films.  I find him very interesting but he doesn't get as wild as the other couples so I guess I'll have to see some more films he has been in to get more of a feeling for his acting.  I love the way he plays Prof. Snape and he really touched a note in this film too.  I have liked Liam Neeson for a long time and  Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister was funny if a little far fetched.  I suppose the U.S. President they allude to is Clinton since he is on the make so that was a little uncomfortable.  If you are looking for a good laugh and don't get upset by the R rating this is a great one.",Love Actually
264,obiwan2005,"Exuberant, Actually",10,17 November 2003,"This movie is exactly what we need at the holiday season. Something fun and funny that touches the heart in a non sappy kind of way. ""Love, Actually"" is the intertwining of 9 seperate love stories. At Juliet and Peter's wedding (Keira Knightley and Chiwetel Ejiofor) Pete's best friend realizes he should have told Juliet he loved her. Daniel (Liam Neeson) and his step son are trying to figure out a way for his step son to win the heart of a classmate. The Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) is starting to fancy his secretary, Natalie (Martine McCutcheon). His sister, Karen (Emma Thompson) is finding out that her husband (Alan Rickman) is having a fling with his secretary. His employee, Sarah (Laura Linney) is trying to get something going with a fellow co-worker. Jaime (Colin Firth) is trying to write a novel while falling in love with his house keeper. And lastly, Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) is an aging rock star trying to get his Christmas cover song to the top of the pop charts. There are a couple of subplot stories as well. The writer/directer Richard Curtis has exactly the kind of comic flare and heart that so little filmmakers try to capture. His brand of humor can please anyone. The star power in this movie can light a building, there's so much of it. It makes you all warm inside when you leave, hoping that the same thing can happen to you in real life. The film captures a charm that Britain is uniqely known for. Makes you want to pack your bags and head there for Christmas holiday. Every character is likable. So when they transition to other parts of the story, you're always left entertained. It's a classic movie going experience. Go see this film, it's gureenteed not to disappoint!RATING: **** out ****",Love Actually
265,OllieZ,Didn't work.,5,29 October 2005,"Firstly, the score of 5 means average. Therefore, this film is average - the nicest word possible for this overly sweet romance from Richard Curtis.I like Four Weddings and a Funeral,not a popular opinion for film buffs but I thought it was witty, and save for MacDowells risible performance, well acted. It was a change for British comedy, but it is such a shame it spawned so many bland and lifeless films - mainly from Curtis' own hand (wrote Notting Hill, directed Love, Actually).Now, you may think I am a miserable old sod, not liking this new rom-com fare...and you may well be right. I am a fan of romantic comedies, yes, such as Woody Allen's films. Annie Hall, Manhattan for example - but what makes them work is that they are sad - Annie Hall in non linear fashion, charts a relationship through its highs and lows, whilst Manhattan, taking place in the black and silver backdrop of Gershwin's in the titular city, also explores relationships. Yet these films almost end (or in Annie Hall's case, start) on a series of down notes, which agrees with Dante from Kevin Smith's Clerks (1994) that life is a series of down notes.And therein lies Love, Actually's problem - the story, even though it has some down notes, they are ALL resolved in the completely ""coincidental"" ending, where the characters' paths all seem to cross. Almost too coincidental, the Hollywood ending that Allen avoided in The Purple Rose of Cairo. Curtis is all too happy to resolve the ending in this film. Even though Four Weddings does end happily, at least it had the courtesy to include some laughs - which this film seems have forgotten about.The main laughs for mainstream viewers might well have come from Hugh Grant playing Prime Minister (and strangely enough, himself), dancing and pratting around with house maid Martine McCutcheon. I expected laughs from the morose dead pan of Alan Rickman - instead the story was at its most dramatic with him. I did enjoy his section of the story, because although it was clichéd, it was enjoyable to watch.As for the other stories in this film, they were cringe worthy. Liam Neeson and his son hunting for women was really quite a bore...Keira Knightly and her two lovers was underdeveloped...the guy who went to America, also in hunt of sex and (love, actually!)...Colin Firth's story of love in a foreign climate was well handled admittedly - as for the rest, I have already forgotten them.Films that handle a lot of characters like this, are normally paced rapidly. Think Altman's Short Cuts, Anderson's Magnolia and Boogie Nights. If Curtis would have paced the film up, injected a little life into this film, it probably would have been a bit better.""Loce Actually"" had its moments of comedy, its moments of drama - but overall, it never really came together. The happy ending was too sweet, and the lead up was badly directed - the acting was fine. So an average film, with an ending that will be rotting your teeth and burning your brain with anger.Ah, but I'm a cynic. If you liked this film I recommend you seeing: Annie Hall, Manhattan, Crimes and Misdemeannours - romance/drama that is subverted.Happiness - this film also explores a lot of characters. Enjoy.",Love Actually

267,catfarmer1358,Great Christmas Movie,10,25 November 2018,"This is one of the those Christmas movies that is way more than just a plain old Christmas movie. This movie is something special. This is a movie I can watch any time of the year. It's that good. It has a great ensemble cast set upon one of the most noteable cities in the world. As Billy Mack would say, ""Christmas (and love) is all around)",Love Actually
268,ForReal84,Actually Good!,10,15 November 2003,"Very few times does a little film have a big message. LOVE ACTUALLY actually does. The meaning behind this film is that love is all around. It may be hard to find sometimes but it is out there in its many forms. The beginning of the film starts out like a documentary, with the voice of Huge Grant talking about love. He speaks about how even in the saddest of times love is there in full bloom. Love is a very powerful word, but in this film it seems to go above and beyond its normal principles. Here, love is a simple word that overtakes the lives of the characters in the film. As hard as love is to understand lovers around the world still seem to wish and hope about one day finding that special person. The characters in LOVE are very interesting. The ranges of personalities that make the characters come to life are excellent. An outstanding cast that includes, Huge Grant, in his usually comic timing, pitch perfect performance. He plays David, a man who is in love but doesn't express his feelings right away. Although it seems like we have met Grant's character before in any of his films, here he is very fresh and funny. Colin Firth turns in another fine performance as Jamie, the loveable writer. One of the finest living actresses of today is Emma Thompson; here she only justifies this statement.  She is very funny in a role that could have been upstaged by the other actors. She plays Karen, a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown. She is exceptional in this film and deserves some type of recognition. Keira Knightley plays Juliet. Although she has a very simple part in the film, she plays it very well. The love triangle that she is in also makes the even better. The scene where her admirer comes to the door is actually one of the most romantic film scenes in a while. Bill Nighy turns in one of the funniest performance of the year. Bill as Billy Mack is actually one of the best aspects of the film. His comic timing is genius. He is in fact the scene-stealer. Every time he appeared on screen the audience started to laugh. Liam Neeson plays Daniel, a man deeply involved with his son after the death of his wife. The relationship between the too is very strong. He does a very good job; it's nice to see Neeson playing someone likeable. Laura Linney plays Sarah, another complicated woman. She is one of the best up and coming actresses today. She is very funny in this role, but also delivers a very soft character that is in love with one of her co-workers. The thing that makes her life so complicated is that she has to care for her brother who is sick. It's a decision that plagues her love life as well as her every day life for that matter. Linney plays Sarah the way not too many actresses could; she is complex, soft, and likeable. Alan Rickman plays Harry, a man who many may find hard to like. He does a very good job balancing a mean character with a likable personality. Martine McCutcheon plays Natalie. She is very funny in this role. A pretty new face in the film business, she looks to have a bright future. And last but not least another major player in this film is the always-funny Rowan Atkinsin. Even though he is only in the film for a few minutes he still turns in one of the funniest performances as Rufus. The film has a great supporting cast and includes a few top-notch cameos. There is a great sound track that accompanies. All in all, it's a feel good, funny as hell film that will leave you rolling in your seat. Love Actually is actually one of the best films of the year! 4.6 out of 5: A-",Love Actually
269,ajrg-17-381639,Very good one of my favorites,10,28 September 2015,"This is a sweet exploration of different kinds of love. There are many kinds of cheating, father son love, family love, puppy love, old married love, rejected love etc, and for those who say it is lust I say no, that is just a part of love. We never think of it but the point of the movie is that love is everywhere in many forms. This movie is not a parody or a travesty with the emphasis on superficial relations. It is just a movie pointing out that we love all the time in many different ways and even if we do not see it love is all around us. This movie is brilliantly edited and acted. I don't think such a simple point could have been made in such a complicated movie by anyone else.",Love Actually
270,Skint111,One of the worst films ever made,1,8 January 2006,"After seeing this I wanted to inflict actual bodily harm on Richard Curtis. I'm not joking. I really, really did. Love Actually is the vilest, most ghastly, most putrid film I have ever seen. It is appalling. The nadir of Curtis's output, it is a toe-curling abomination. Where to start? What about the pure, undiluted cynicism of the enterprise, evident in everything from the music to the manipulative sentimentality to the use of children to the Christmas setting. It's a film with no heart, no structure, no sense, just a series of orchestrated, contrived scenes, augmented by the odd stale comic line (eg 'Now I can only get into dresses that belonged to Pavarotti') and utterly stupid improbabilities. To go through those would take way, way too long. And what's with the use of bad language in the most inappropriate of situations? Do not see this vomit-inducing turkey of a movie, especially in a couple if you're a man because it may well end your relationship, which would actually be quite ironic, eh Mr Curtis?",Love Actually
271,gevalero,Lust Actually,8,18 June 2009,"There's plenty to love about LOVE ACTUALLY. It's just that I found a couple of the stories downright perverse. It may be convenient for the film never to show us where Keira Knightley's new romance will lead but nothing changes the fact that is not a love story but one of betrayal in which not much good will come out at the end; at least the Alan Rickman / Emma Thompson part is honest about its subject and what the consequences to his actions will eventually be for both of them. Further, what can you say about a story in which a girl is unfaithful to his boyfriend with his own brother ? The funny thing is that the filmmakers want to make us believe these are just different facets of love and for some reason, they time them at Christmas time, as if they would actually have anything to do with the real meaning of Christmas. Still, any movie in which Hugh Grant makes a convincing British Prime Minister can't be all bad. The truer love story in LOVE ACTUALLY ?: Laura Linney giving up on her dream for the sake of her brother, that part might just be enough to justify the title.",Love Actually

274,gbx06,All you need is love,8,21 July 2008,"First of all this isn't a simple and silly romantic comedy, and that is its greatest charm. The film itself is an x-ray, an analysis of what is love actually and its beauty lies in the fact that it remains today, you could see it a lot of times and its essence continuous fresh thanks to a series of stories that show us the different faces of love and above all, by a spectacular cast for one single movie, in which none of the players is lost and each make their best effort to give a more real interpretation.To be honest the biggest hit of the movie is the script and the direction of Richard Curtis that with subtlety builds a beautiful story that can move from comedy to drama without any complication because, at the end of all, is there a suffering or joy more great that love? In addition, photography and art design also contribute to create warm atmospheres, yet despite that the film takes place in winter, where the characters make great performances and show us more intimate sides that help achieve greater identification with some of the stories.Another detail is that, definitely, if this story will develop elsewhere than London and at another time than Christmas, we would probably face a silly movie about love, but these factors combine to give a more consistent, as a wink toward anything that moves us the heart. But not everything is happiness there are also some details that are bad for the film especially with some stories that have a very open ending, like the case of Sarah and her love for the graphic designer, which makes it unnecessary.In short, is an excellent film to see if you are in love but also if you don't, perhaps you will find here some love.",Love Actually
275,brownish33,"Ugh, another poor post-modern view at love. Old fashioned romance movies are officially dead.",1,8 October 2010,"so, a friend rented this movie and since she was a chick, i decided to sit through it. I'm a guy, but secretly i do enjoy those corny love movies, or ""chick flicks"", every once in a while. however i tend to watch the ones that are shown on TCM or any old movie channel because old movies tended to have a sweetness and a kind of innocence to them. you weren't allowed to curse or show nudity or any of that. thats why i like those old fashioned romance movies. today, there is a fine line between romance movie and sex comedy. the only romance movie in recent times that i can think of that was actually good was ""a walk in the clouds"" with keanu reeves. that movie was not ponly beautiful looking, but it had an old fashioned heart and a beauty on the inside that really touched me in a good way.however, films nowadays, i would even say for the past 30 or so years, romance films have been getting progressively worse. a ""romance"" film these days must include senseless scenes of sex, nudity, swearing and sometimes very crude ""humour"". love actually isn't the worst when it comes to this, but this movie actually showed promise but again fell very short of what it could have been: a nice sweet tale of romance (or romance's). the perfect example of the grossness is the naked couple who are constantly talking while doing some kind of strange nude scenes. personally, i found these parts of the movie pretty distasteful for a ""romantic"" movie. was it supposed to be funny? it was just weird, and odd. but they talk like they just met and they act all nervous and shy while doing these random sex acts? am i supposed to laugh at the paradox? wasn't funny to me, it actually was pretty sick. things like this in movies show just how uninhibited society has become where people can just get naked in front of you and act like its nothing (not saying everyone does but you get my point). pretty disturbing stuff. remember a time when women were so afraid to even show there knees or ankles? boy had the apple fallen far from the tree where you live in a society where prostituting ones self is perfectly normal and acceptable. very sad.the rest of the relationships offer nothing much that we haven't already seen elsewhere. i also didn't like the amount of swearing in it. it just came off as awkward and unneeded, especially since the film takes place around Christmastime. it could have been sweet. it could have been nice. but what it is is a post-modern strange look at love. the only story lines that were actually not too bad and kinda sweet was the writer falling in love with the house cleaner and the office woman who sacrifices love for her mentally ill brother. i have one question though: was is REALLY necessary for the house cleaner girl to take off all her clothes (in a very slow manner) just to jump in the lake? if she was in such a hurry to get the notes why would you feel the need to take off all your clothes? especially right in front of your employer? there were also some pretty random and pointless scenes of alan rickmans secretary taking off her clothes or walking around in lingeria. just, pointless stuff like this...i don't get it. and this movie is filled with them.there is one very funny moment with Rowan Atkinson aka Mr. Bean who appears at the jewelry counter. but really, the film could have been so much better. i didn't even like the environments, besides the writers house, all the houses/buildings looked so sterile and white and soulless. i also found liam neesons son's behavior to be so unrealistic. no 7 year old acts like that, or talks like that. and neeson talks to his very young son like hes teenager, mentioning things like ""haveing sex"" and even saying ""who is she, or HE.."" i was like, what? why would you automatically assume your son is gay? just weird. i heard about this film 7 years ago but i could tell what kind of movie it was going to be. lo and behold, i was correct. now i know why i hadn't been in any rush to see it. same with king Kong. heard about, it was popular, but deep down i knew it would suck. and i was right. anyway, sad to see liam neeson in such rubbish, but hey every actor needs work right? cant always be in those deep human drama's or action blockbusters like schindlers list or star wars, unfortunately. but he is still good even in this cold turkey of a ""love"" movie. the days where you could go to a romance movie with a date or family are gone, as by ""romance"" they now mean ""must be 18 years or older to attend this R rated sexual movie"". very very sad. now i know why i don't go to the movies anymore, not only is there a lack of good action adventure films, but also decent romantic films. i think i'll just stick with watching TCM for my romance fix.",Love Actually

There wasnt one, two, or three stories here, there was eight.  But really, all eight were the same.  about the different ways in which love affects all of us, the different places, the different circumstances.There wasnt much time to devote to most couples, and i was sad to see the 'sadder' ending for the office couple (Laura Linney and that hunk) but realise the irony of the love - and obligation - that made her character give up a possible romance for the sake of a brother that needed her.  not the healthiest of relationships, but a fact none-the-less.Hugh Grant was Fab, and so was Colin Firth.  I loved seeing his character SMILE for once, he does tend to steer clear of showing his flawed, but stellar, smile.A mention to Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson and Alan Rickman.

It was far funnier in places than I expected, and quite subtle in its balancing of love affairs that do take off, generally in unusual circumstances, against failures and other kinds of love, all in pursuit of the theme that ""love is all around"". I have to say, some of the developments are wildly implausible, and Hugh Grant does not convince as a bachelor Prime Minister, who must, to judge from a remark by his sister in the story, be a lot older than he looks (and would either party actually have a leader in his forties who was not merely a bachelor but without any kind of female partner at all?

I have watched this movie with many different people and they all agree that it is simply a great romance that will someday become one of the ""Classics"" to watch every year. Except for the nudity this movie would have been a TV annual event, but since the nudity is involved within one of the smaller love stories within the film, yes it is needed. It is sweet between those two young people.My favorite story is the romance between Colin Firth and Lucia Moniz. They cannot speak the others language, but fall in love with each other. The end of the movie is the highlight for this romance as it flashes back and forth between a couple of the ongoing story lines.Hugh Grant does not hurt this movie one bit, but playing the British Prime Minister with real life faults, it was refreshing to see life through his eyes also.

In the movie, you get to experience all kinds of love from a different point of view: love between two hardcore porn stars, a young boy hitting on the most popular girl in school, the British Prime Minister and his secretary, an English author and his Portuguese maid, and a million and one other unlikely combos. The result is clear: a funny, feel-good, heartwarming, and above all romantic movie that all can enjoy...not just the romantic comedy suckers like me.",Love Actually

Among others, Hugh Grant is perfect as Great Britain's first minister while the ""hidden lover"" declaration to Keyra Knightley is both incredibly sweet and heart-breaking.It's puzzling to see the difference between US and international box office about this movie.

All the negative comments about it are basically true: It's sappy, manipulative, simple minded, trashy crap. A bunch of love stories wound up around Christmas? I think it's giving me diabetes it's so sickeningly sweet. Basically, this movie is a by-the-numbers piece of crap.And what I hate most about all this is that I loved it. I've watched it several times, and even if it's on TV I watch it again. The funny scenes are funny, the heartwarming scenes are heartwarming, and the heartbreaking scenes are heartbreaking. The actors are terrific, for the most part (not surprising given its A list cast), and as sappy as they all are, I liked them. I even liked the stories that were completely absurd, like the guy who wanted to fly to Wisconsin so that he could pick up American girls with his British accent.I am embarrassed that I like this movie so much, and if I ever meet someone on the street I'll pretend to hate it, but in fact it's awesome.",Love Actually
291,Jenny Ho,Another feel-good offering from Curtis. I actually like Four Weddings and a Funeral' and Bridget Jones' Diary' more,7,9 January 2004,"The film is set in the five weeks leading up to Christmas and consists of a number of love stories affecting people who are related to characters in the other stories: a best man (Andrew Lincoln) is inexplicably hostile to his friend's new wife; the British Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) falls in love with his tea lady (Martine McCutcheon); his sister (Emma Thomson) is faced with her husband (Alan Rickman) having an affair at work; Alan Rickman's colleague (Laura Linney) finds her long term crush and love for another colleague requited; a widowed father (Liam Neeson) helps his son cope with falling in love for the first time; a writer (Colin Firth) escapes to France after being cheated on by his wife and finds new love; and an aging rocker (Bill Nighy) aims to make Christmas Number One in the pop charts with a cover of Love Is All Around' only the lyrics have been changed to Christmas Is All Around'.  (Astonishingly, this song has been released for real in the UK and made the top 40!)If you enjoyed Richard Curtis's previous offerings Four Weddings And A Funeral' and Notting Hill', you will not be disappointed by Love Actually' which is fun, likeable and romantic, if a little formulaic.  Hugh Grant gets another starring role in a Curtis movie and gives an endearing performance as the British Prime Minister.  I like him a lot but I am sure that there are some people out there who will be irritated to find him in typical bumbling mode (yet again!)It is a joy to see the abundance of British stars on the screen and it is fun to spot the additional television stars including British television presenters of the moment Ant and Dec!  My favourite moment is one I'm sure many of the British public have been faced with at some point in their lives when Bill Nighy refers to one of the presenters as Ant or Dec' as he has no idea which is which!  Other comic highlights include Hugh Grant dancing in the hallway at Number Ten and the language barrier between Colin Firth and his maid in France even though they are unable to speak each other's language, the subtitles on the screen show that they are communicating even if they are not aware of it.  The chemistry between these two is irresistible but is let down by the silly way that their story is resolved.While the film is filled with likeable performances, there is one piece of casting which let Liam Neeson's story down.  His son is cute but he sounds far too posh and well spoken for me to feel sympathy for his situation!Alongside the humour, there are some unexpected serious moments which I think over tip the balance and sit uncomfortably in a mostly lighthearted comedy.  One of these is the discovery that Laura Linney's new love is jeopardised by her commitment to her mentally ill brother.  Emma Thomson's realisation that her husband is cheating on her is also heartbreaking.  You have these serious undercurrents on the one hand and on the other you have a couple of silly stories: one featuring Kris Marshall leaving his life in London for Wisconsin in search of beautiful girls and rampant sex and another featuring Martin Freeman (Tim from The Office') as a porn body double having getting to know you' conversations while engaging in various sexual positions with his naked co-star.Love Actually' is like a book of short stories and suffers in the same way: by the time you get into the stories and you are just starting to get to know the main character, it is time to move on to a completely new story which is sometimes less interesting.  However, it makes for an enjoyable and romantic enough date movie and is Christmassy enough to warrant repeat viewings on DVD and television over festive seasons to come.",Love Actually
292,tjcclarke,Curtis directorial debut fails to deliver,6,5 January 2004,"Hugh Grant, Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth - Few first-time directors can ever have assembled such a formidable British cast. But Richard Curtis is no ordinary first-time director, and Love Actually is no ordinary debut. The writer and producer of Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill has given himself the job of helming his most ambitious project yet - A multi-stranded love story following the lives of nine Londoners in the run-up to Christmas.Grant is the newly-elected post-Blair Prime Minister who develops a crush on his Downing Street maid; Rickman's marriage to Thompson is on the rocks after his head is turned by a younger woman; Neeson is a widower coming to grips with his loss by helping his step-son woo his classroom sweetheart; and Firth plays a writer who falls in love with his Portuguese cleaning lady (Lucia Moniz).Some of the plot-threads lend themselves well to this kind of sugar-coated vignette: Martin Freeman (from TV's The Office) and Joanna Page play stand-ins in a pornographic film - the gag being that they are very tentatively trying to ask each other out while simulating sex acts - but others lack gravitas as a result. Emma Thompson gives a typically emotive performance as a wronged wife who keeps up appearances for the sake of her children, but the power of her scenes are diluted by the frivolity and silliness going on elsewhereAnd therein lies the problem: The key to Curtis' previous successes has been his ability to engage audience affection for his characters. Here there is simply not enough time for this to happen. The action shifts clumsily from scene to scene. Further sub-plots are introduced with yet more hapless, lovelorn characters. It is almost as if Curtis has emptied out his 'Ideas Book' and lumped everything together under the flimsy premise that: a) they are all based in London; b) it's nearly Christmas; and c) er. that's it.Well, almost. What really links all the stories (as the Prime Minister solemnly states in a voice-over at the beginning) is that 'Love Actually IS All Around'. Indeed, the soundtrack to the movie is dominated by a bastardised version of the Trogg's 'Love is all Around' with the word 'Love' replaced by 'Christmas' which a washed-up, has-been rock star (Bill Nighy) is promoting to try and get to the coveted Christmas Number One slot - a nod to Wet Wet Wet's cover of the same song which topped the charts for an eternity thanks to the popularity of Four Weddings and a Funeral. There is no disputing the fact that Curtis is a true romantic - his pursuit of lump-in-the-throat cinematic moments is as relentless as ever and there is plenty here to melt even the coldest of hearts. What irks is his tendency to pigeon-hole his characters into white middle-class dreamers. Not content with making Notting Hill look like a suburb of Henley-on-Thames, here he proceeds to do the same with the rest of London - no wonder they elected Hugh Grant Prime Minister. Love may very well be all around, but men who don't have floppy hair, perfect teeth and Etonian accents, and women who don't look like Kiera Knightley need not apply.When he strays from his well-trodden path of frothy romantic comedy, you get a glimpse of something deeper. Laura Linney's character is in love with a co-worker but she is stricken with guilt about her mentally ill brother who is emotionally dependent on her. Her scenes are nicely handled, understated and genuinely moving but it is hard to take them seriously in the context of the rest of the movie. They are also so infrequent as to be rendered meaningless - you can almost hear Curtis saying: 'Cut. Wow, that was a bit intense - quick, let's play an up-beat pop song and show some footage of Hugh Grant dancing'.And in fairness, he's probably right to do so. It is almost impossible to imagine any Curtis vehicle NOT featuring Grant stuttering, grinning bashfully and generally larking about. It is, let's face it, a winning formula. In this case, it really shouldn't work - after all, he is competing for screen-time with eight other stories - and yet he somehow pulls it off. There are some patchy moments: In one preposterous scene he lambastes the US President (a nice, sleazy cameo by Billy-Bob Thornton) in front of a packed press conference after catching him frisking McCutcheon the night before. One wonders what George Bush would have to do to Cherie Blair before Tony jeopardised their 'Special Relationship'. No matter. It is this story that carries the essence of the wider message - love will beat all the odds and win the day. The chemistry between Grant and McCutcheon in surprisingly strong, but it is the chemistry between Grant and Curtis that carries the movie - so much so that the other stories really only serve as padding, which is a shame because there are some nice moments scattered amongst the cloying sentimentality.Love Actually is a hit largely thanks the reputations of it's director and cast (as well as the main players, there are cameos from the likes of Denise Richards, Claudia Schiffer, Ant and Dec and the ubiquitous Rowan Atkinson), but whether it will match the long-term success of Curtis' previous efforts remains to be seen. Personally, I think the film would have benefited from a stronger central plot and fewer story-lines. Romantic comedy does not lend itself well to the subtleties and complexities of inter-connected plot-threads. This style is better suited to more off-beat (and generally less commercial) movies such as Paul Thomas Anderson's excellent Magnolia.6/10",Love Actually
293,ackthpt,"Loved It, Actually",10,2 January 2004,"January 2, 2004 - Solely upon recommendation of friends I took this film in. I was utterly charmed by it. I'm fond of films with multiple plots and, though perhaps not all were to my liking, it worked quite well and fits into the top films I have seen. All performances were far above the usual holiday rubbish Hollywood peddles. It'll be in my DVD collection ASAP. Sadly, the nudity and sexual references of one sub-plot limit the audience to adults.Follow Up - December 2008 I must have watched the DVD of this film 10 times since obtaining it. I still love this film and tremendously enjoy watching. I continue to be utterly amazed such a rich cast was assembled and carried this off without being crass, boring, stupid or predictable. It ages well, five years almost since I first watched it. Richard Curtis and his writer(s) carried out a brilliant production which is still great fun to watch.I've purchased the soundtrack CD to add some of the Christmas music to a playlist for a party, including that 'Festering Turd of a Record' by Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) Good stuff!",Love Actually

295,jwiley-86292,Huh?,3,23 July 2016,"This movie feels like it should be better than it is. The production values and soundtrack are pretty, but I kept asking myself why it was lingering on stories that seemed either inconsequential or off-putting. In the first place, there's Colin Firth's character trying to build a relationship despite a serious language barrier (lots of room for abuse,) but the subplot that most repulsed me was the one involving the guys going to America to meet women. They find a number of hot women in a bar who instantly want to have sex. I'm NOT exaggerating! You might call me shallow for complaining about the men in this situation being unmatched in terms of attractiveness with the women, but hear me out. This would be all well and good if the ugly male/hot female pairing weren't so inescapable in pop culture while you're hard pressed to find the reverse. Mostly, when someone uses this trope, they are exploiting the double standard by which men judge women's worth based only on their appearances. Maybe I need to get out more, but I can't imagine any woman acting like the American women in the bar do when they meet those guys. As a woman myself, I should know.What about the rest of the movie? For whatever reason--I don't know whether it's the fault of the movie or me--I wasn't emotionally invested in most of the characters. I feel that the different story lines are too disparate to coexist within the same movie. Here is another part I couldn't accept: Sam's crush on Joanna is treated as SPESHUL, but we don't find out what Joanna thinks of him! He acts kind of like a stalker in the airport scene. The random nudity is not only unnecessary, but disturbing, contributing to my suspicion of the movie being exploitative in the wrong ways. Not even the subplot with Alan Rickman's character made me want to watch it ever again; you feel guilty if you identify with Mia (the woman pursuing him) rather than Emma Thompson's character. In this case, the large number of dynamic screen presences is no match for the baffling, ho-hum writing.",Love Actually

The three climaxes at the end of the movie, where the three main plotlines come to a resolution, are all an emotional roller-coaster ride.  I can't say enough good things about this movie.  Yes, it has some flaws, yes, I think it has a few too many f-words and nude scenes, but as I tell people, you forget about all that and just get so caught up in the sweeping stories.  The music is brilliantly used, especially at the very beginning and the very end, to weave the stories together.

(I don't want to give away the story, but many of the things that happen in the movie would virtually never happen in real life).This is a movie that tries to demonstrate that there is a lot of different types of love in this world, and that movies don't have to have a storyline of hate in order to be enjoyable.You have probably heard this, or read this in the Bible, but it is a movie of Hope, Faith and Love.  Most of all, Love.Although this sounds really corny, it is a part of many people's daily lives and religious beliefs.Another movie that is much like this one, but much more realistic, is Playing by Heart.

298,mhtyler,"Love is everywhere (Even in the ""Evil American Empire"")",6,29 July 2005,"""Love Actually"" is a fun, witty, and clever film that hits its target more than it misses, and as a comedy, that is enough to make it exceptional.The film starts with the extraordinary statement by Hugh Grant that cell phone calls from the 9/11 planes show how much love is in the world.Well, citing terrified calls from people being murdered as an example of the fullness of love, certainly shows the European perspective is a sunny one.Throughout the film though, it is the love-lorn Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) that repeatedly tests our suspension of disbelief, such as when he fixates on a lowly poddy-mouthed secretary, and conducts a personal door to door search for her on Christmas Eve.The film is generally upbeat, although we eventually discover that ""love actually"" peters out in middle age to be replaced by deception and dejection. This is quickly swept under the carpet though since all of the young people end up happy.The ""stand up and cheer"" moment in the film comes fairly early on, when the Prime Minister confronts the slimy-American President (is that superfluous?) in a press conference.The happy moment for all Europeans is not dimmed by the fact that the P.M. was incapable of any disagreement with the President until the latter moved in on his biscuit-and-tea Bimbo. Still, if you feel politically impotent I guess you take your licks where you can get them.American's can take heart from the fact that their women (particularly ones with comic-book accents) are apparently useful as sex-toys for starved British men, which certainly redefines the ""special relationship"".In summary, the film is funny, moves quickly, and lets you hate America if you're in the mood.",Love Actually
299,lawnboy1977,Did I miss something?,7,23 May 2005,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect going into watching this film, I just rented it to see what it was all about. I did expect a total love story with a bunch of different characters, which is what the movie pretty much is. I expected more of a connection between all the different stories that for me didn't quite play out the way I expected. I'll admit I'm not a huge fan of British comedies, a lot of the humor just doesn't make sense to me, which might have been my major problem with this film.There were certain elements that really bothered me about this movie though. At the beginning, we see the characters being introduced. One scene has Colin Firth saying goodbye to his girlfriend, saying I love you about 27 times while doing so, while on his way to his French cottage to work on his novel for several weeks. For some reason he falls in love with his Portuguese housekeeper who he never says a word to because, alas they don't speak the same language! We never again here from the girlfriend the rest of the movie as he runs off at the end to marry the housekeeper, because he has finally learned to speak Portuguese. That didn't make much sense to me, but I guess running away from someone you say that you love is funny to some people, not to me. I guess the point of that story was that true love exceeds culture and language.Another story that bothered me was the one involving the best friend of a newlywed groom who is secretly in Love with the bride. The bride, Keira Knightley, finds this out when she comes over to view the wedding video, shot by the best friend in a stalker-like fashion where every single frame is a close-up of the bride. She apparently find this to be cute, and doesn't run off in a terrified state of ""oh my god this guy is obsessed with me""!! They don't run off together but still remain friends, for some reason.I think I need to watch this film again with someone who understands it because I felt like a lot of the humor was over my head.

Liam Neeseon steals the show as the best actor in the film, he is the most charming and nice dad in the world, and you can feel his agony, love, and how much he wants to help his son.

301,jn1356-1,The Impossible Movie,10,10 May 2014,"The perfect movie is not a huge, earth-swaddling epic. It is a simple thing, a small story, one that fits in a 1 1/2 to 2-hour span. ""Casablanca"" is the greatest, a perfectly polished little gem, the story of two former lovers who bump into each other again in the shadow of World War II. ""The problems of two people doesn't matter a hill of beans..."" But they make amazing movies. More is not better in movies. More is simply more.In other words, to try to interweave more than a couple of stories together in one movie is idiotic.Let's see. There's the new Prime Minister who gets a crush on a cute girl who works in 10 Downing Street. There's his sister and her husband, a respectable middle-aged couple with fairly typical behavior- problem kids, and a wicked secretary waiting in the wings to try and destroy it all. There is the writer whose lover jilts him with his brother, who goes to Portugal to write his next novel and becomes enchanted with his housekeeper. There's the cute couple who meet on the job--their stand-ins for a porn movie. There's the man whose wife has died recently and left him with a stepson going through his first crush. There's the aging rock star with the intoxicated leer who is looking for lasting love. There's the lovely young woman with the mentally ill brother. How many is that so far? That's not all the stories.But not only do they work together in one movie, THEY WORK TOGETHER BRILLIANTLY!My standing joke is somebody has to have sold his/her soul to the devil. In this case, it's writer/director Richard Curtis, who also gave us ""Mr. Bean"", ""Notting Hill"", and ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", to name a few.If I haven't convinced you, maybe this will: Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson, Martin Freeman (as the male porn movie stand-in!), Laura Linney, and (in a support role!)

The movie's premise was great; we were going to follow the blooming and flowering of eight different relationships in the 5 weeks before Christmas.  Suffice to say, some of the movie made me cry and some made me laugh and all of it gave me a warm, tingly feeling inside. 
The acting is really superb and MOST of the characters interesting.  The best story involves Hugh Grant as a Prime Minister who falls in love with his secretary.  I admit I've been in love with Hugh Grant for ages and ages, but he is really a great comedic actor.  His timing is right on.  Most of the other stories were very interesting and we end up really liking the characters.  However, naturally, because there are so many stories, we don't see as much of our favorite story as we'd like to.  I wish we could have seen more of the stories featuring the prime minister (Hugh Grant), a couple facing a marriage crisis (Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman), a man teaching his son about love (Liam Neeson), and a man falling in love with his housekeeper (Colin Firth), probably just because their acting sucks you in. I also wish they cut three stories (the porn one, the coworkers one, and the British guy going to America one) that, to me, were incredibly unnecessary, didn't go anywhere, and took screen time away from the better stories. 
But don't let that stop you from seeing the movie.  The music is wonderful and you'll find yourself humming that `horrible' tune Bill Nighy sings through the movie.  `Love Actually' is far from Richard Curtis's best, but a winsome British cast, a really witty script, and a shot of Hugh Grant dancing and singing down the stairs will make this movie incredibly enjoyable.

Instead of shunning him or telling hubby (a perfectly good chap played by Chiwetel Ejiofor), she thinks the man's gestures are sweet.We also get Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson as a couple whose marriage is on the rocks, Liam Neeson as a man who is struggling with the loss of his wife, the mother of his sensitive 10-year-old stepson (who just happens to be a budding drummer who idolizes Ringo Starr), Colin Furth as a novelist who falls for his sexy young Portuguese housekeeper, and (tying all the plot-lines together) Bill Nighy as a jaded middle-aged rock star who hopes to turn a Christmas-themed cover of The Troggs' 1968 hit ""Love Is All Around"" into a Yuletime pop hit, and who realizes that the deepest emotional connection he has with any human is with his corpulent, long-suffering manager (Gregor Fisher). Given the sappy soft-rock soundtrack calculated to evoke kitschy emotions in the audience, it is the height of hypocrisy and cynicism for the makers of this movie to mock the kitschy bowdlerization of The Troggs' song.The whole movie is an exercise in manipulation of the most obvious and meretricious sort. The PM enacted by Grant rejects sexier women to fall, of course, for a rather heavy-set, naive, and awkward (but still highly cinegenic) young woman. The Knightley character reacts to the creep not with ""eww"" disgust and dismay but rather with sympathy, especially since he feeds her narcissistic self-image. There are happy endings appended to all the story lines in classic canned sitcom fashion, where no problem can't be resolved in 22 minutes, though this movie takes over 2 hours to reach this conclusion. If you like the smarmy self-satisfaction combined with middlebrow intellectual pretension that characterized the romantic comedies of Delia and the late Nora Ephron (I hate them), chances are you'll love this self-infatuated extravaganza. Me, I'll take Alistair Sim as Scrooge for my Christmas watching.",Love Actually
312,schreiber-stephen,All star cast delivers a world class failure,3,21 January 2014,"Monetarily, Love Actually was a hit. Unfortunately box office numbers do not translate into a good film. This movie was painful to get through. Love Actually is probably one of the movies I will use as an example of an ensemble cast that is trying to be something great but just doesn't seem to work with the number of characters involved in the production. The story has a weak excuse to have all of the characters connected. Each storyline could be its own movie and as a result each character isn't fully developed. It almost seems like writer and director Richard Curtis had this idea that he had to make a movie with an ensemble cast because that is in vogue at the time and as a result had to write a script as quickly as possible in order to monetize on this movement. There were parts of this movie that seemed like they didn't belong. With the large cast, the movie felt like watching something shot by someone with extreme ADHD or someone who didn't know what he was doing without a storyboard. Watching this movie, I also got the feeling that Curtis has a sense of humor that didn't quite line up with mine and then I saw Rowan Atkinson pop up on screen and everything came into focus. I immediately had to see if Curtis had his hands on any Mr. Bean episodes and possibly the movie. Turns out he did so much of the humor in this movie made total sense to me. It's not my cup of tea but I do get it now. That said, it wasn't shocking for me to find out that this was Curtis' first film as a director. Love Actually was not good. There were a few bright spots in this, however. Andrew Lincoln was excellent and I was surprised to see him in this cast as I am a big fan. He was the best part of this movie. Considering the cast around him, that was shocking to me but he was very good. Emma Thompson is always great and she was fantastic here. One or two of the story lines were good but for the most part they felt a little incomplete or rushed.I hope I don't have to watch this one again as this was already the second time I watched this film and I remember leaving it with the same issues both times. What a shame. On the bright side, Love Actually has made quite a lot of cash so congrats to all those involved!",Love Actually

314,bzb2001,A deeply loving film rich in character,10,28 November 2004,"It has been a long time since I have seen a movie so rich in character that I did not want it to end. Love Actually is not a love story, it is a story about love. Love that reinvents itself, multiplies itself, opens itself up, and even devastates.I am sure the film has its critics who say it drips in buttery corn. But when you are able to retreat inward and let it take you over, it is impossible not to feel. It is a rare treat - a film that makes you feel. During the process I was sad and happy and relieved. I was turned on, turned off, dizzy and grounded.I was in love one time and it reminded me of that. The power of cinema can be that amazing, it can be that intense. The title of the movie is, perhaps, meant to confuse. Yet I believe it is designed to ask. Love Actually is ... what?Is it lust? Or a deep appreciation of the past? Can it be conquered by language or political barriers? Race? Infidelity? Age? Can it be all of the above plus more? Maybe a mingling of several?It is rare for a film of great acting to be married to a terrific script. Yet it is something else for it to speak right to the audience; not talk at them, not try to sell them a film. Let them experience the film. Let it wash over them little by little until there is nothing more of them left.**** (A)",Love Actually
315,reeseslightning,The only film that does it right,8,22 March 2012,"I really, really hate large ensemble cast movies with intertwining story lines. The reason for this is because the characters in that kind of movie are usually one dimensional with one dimensional problems - and of course they're all beautiful and things are always alright at the end with the cheesy lines and bad chemistry. I can't bring myself to care about the characters because 1) I hate the actors in it or 2) the plot/story lines/acting/dialogue is god awful that it makes me want to hurl. In fact, romance is just not my area.Love Actually is the only one of these kinds of movies that does it right. And does it very well. Somehow, the writers for this film found the perfect balance of the most amazing cast ever assembled and the the satirical trait that lurks in the background. Love Actually is light hearted with some heavy moments in it but it never takes itself too seriously. It has people making up, breaking up, coming, going, cheating, loving, and everything else that should utterly confuse the viewer. With other movies, things take too long or are too slow; the writers fixated on couple/actor A because they're more famous than couple/actor B.Not so with Love Actually. Even if one gets more screen time than another, they make up for it in quality. There's a delicate balance between real situations that couples go through versus events that are just so not (*cough* Natalie and the Prime Minister *cough*). However, that's where the casting comes into play. Each actor portrays their character with just the right amount of sarcasm, mystery, or love that it needs so that even the silly story of Natalie and the Prime Minister seem plausible.Sure the cast is great looking, but you don't notice really because you're so swept up in the magic of the dialogue, which is charming (then again, Brits did make this so I guess that's to be expected) and lighthearted.This film separates itself simply because it's better than anything like America's put out in this genre. And yes, I am American.For some reason, Love Actually struck a chord with audiences that won't go away, nor would we want it to. Almost ten years later and people still love this film. It's the only chick flick/holiday film I look forward to watching each and every time.",Love Actually

317,vegeta-julian,Hardly enjoyable,4,2 January 2019,"This movie has way too many storylines to really develop any of the characters and for you to connect with any of them. They should have at least killed 2 or 3 of them to have more time to develop the other stories, because like this it felt absolutely rushed and implausible.
My breaking point in this movie was when the mediocre looking british guy who went to the US to get American chicks went into the first random bar there to find 4 girls who all miraculously love british guys and hit on him. When that scene was on I at first thought that must be all in this guys head, no way the filmmakers are portraying this as reality. I was laughing and shaking my head in disbelief when I found out.

But, in this case, there was frankly too much rhetoric. Some of the stories were frankly so silly, like the one about the sandwich deliver boy. Some others were better: the one involving Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman was actually quite moving, like the one involving the girl with a mentally ill brother; and the one involving Colin Firth was really funny. Also, the story about the character who falls in love with his best friend's wife and tries desperately to hide his feelings was touching.But the others were frankly ridiculous, in particular the one about Hugh Grant. Not even Frank Capra would have depicted a prime minister in such a silly way.Some scenes stand out: Hugh Grant dancing, or the cameo role played by Rowan Atkinson.

Movies like this should be enjoyed en masse.It seems to me that there is a wide rift of opinion on this film. You either love it or hate it. Those who hate it tend to hate the concepts presented in the film, rather than the presentation. So it seems to me that if you're bitter and empty inside, you might not enjoy ""Love Actually"" for what it is: a light happy film about the perils and rewards of love.The ensemble cast did a great job in a series of vignettes. Colin Firth is amazing with Lucia Moniz. Kris Mashall is hilarious as a Brit who heads to America to get lucky. I enjoyed the interaction between the stepfather and son combo played by Liam Neeson and Thomas Sangster. They have a real chemistry on screen. The story of platonic love between an aging rock star Bill Nighy and his manager is so touching.If you're looking for a happy tale of love, you'll adore it.

That is a very audacious attempt for a romantic comedy. Regardless, director Richard Curtis is talented, but everything he touches doesn't turn to gold... or silver. The question is: can this film succeed? There are parts when it does and there are parts when it doesn't. It does not mean it does it poorly, but it dwells into the clichés of its genre. Curtis tries to be an overachiever and sets up too many story lines and characters thinking that they will eventually (and cleverly) cross over and meet up at the very end. Like I said, his strategy is very hit and miss. However there are parts where I felt he did things perfectly: the beginning and the ending. These were the parts where it was original, especially the last three minutes of the movie. In my opinion, that was probably one of the best endings Curtis could have thought of given the circumstances. The performances are even better. Richard Curtis has assembled the best character actors in England to make this film. There was really no performance I could complain about, it was done practically. The main payoff for me is that, at the end, Curtis prioritizes. He picks the stories that actually mean something to us and develops them to the best of his ability. Instead of developing something that we dislike and want to turn off if we hear any more about it.",Love Actually

This movie shows us that love is all around us. And this message it delivers loud and clear. I will not analyze each of the many plot lines, I will just say, that each contains one or several aspects of love. Though some may be corny and exaggerating, you have to admit that each contains a bit of truth. I for myself can give you examples for each and every scene from around my circle of friends. One plot line in particular is the one concerning Karen (Emma Thompspn) and Harry (Alan Rickman). Many find that this episode only shows the effects of getting your love broken, but it shows too: the love of a friend (Karen to Daniel after his wife's funeral), the love of a mother (the deleted scene with the ""Horrible Bernard""), the love of a sister (to the Prime Minister). A great movie with great acting, though as a German viewer, I didn't know many actors before this movie.The actors really carry the movie, and I believe that they all had a great time on the set.This movie is a real uplifting experience, which should be shared by all.

I was happily surprised to see this film, what may be wrongly classed as a ""chic flick"", having equal parts of comedy/drama and a great balance of ""cheese"" and reality to make it thoroughly enjoyable. The visual tie-in of the Airport arrivals and the line that ""Love is actually all around"" is really poignant. After that, each story represents a piece of the spectrum of how powerful this love can be. What you end up with is a lot of fun, and hardly any opportunities for the story to drag; it clips along and entertains throughout.

334,shinymc_shine,Laughs Are All Around,8,28 January 2004,"""Love Actually"" is a crowd pleasing romantic comedy from writer Richard Curtis, making his directorial debut.The movie takes place in England, five weeks before Christmas, and has multiple storylines about love and sex. The main focus is on three siblings. One is the new Prime Minister, played by Hugh Grant, who has fallen for one of his staff, the new tealady. The other is a long married wife, played by Emma Thompson, who suspects that her husband, Alan Rickman, maybe contemplating having an affair with his secretary. The last is a newly widowed stepfather, played by Liam Neeson, encouraging his stepson who's trying to impress his first crush. There are other characters including Bill Nighy as a fading, old rock star, Laura Linney who holds a flame for someone at work but has a secret which is ruining her love life, and Colin Firth as an author who can't express his love for his foreign housekeeper because she can't speak a word of English. Majority of the characters intertwine at some point in the movie but due to excellent casting and solid writing you're never lost plotwise.Curtis is possibly the best screenwriter for Grant. Every line roles from his tongue as if he had thought of it. They're the comedy equivalent of writer David Mamet and actor Joe Mantegna. I feel that the sequences with Grant as Prime Minister could've been a movie all by itself. Grant has real competition humor wise from Nighy who always brings a smile to your face the moment he appears on screen. He's perfectly cast and his lanky frame brilliantly conveys his aging, laid back rocker. On the more serious side Neeson has never been better. His scenes with the young boy are the emotional heart of the movie. This strand of the plot is possibly the most successful of all the storylines. Thompson has the more thankless role and is overshadowed by her on-screen husband Rickman. It's been years since we last saw her and I wish she'd had a more meatier part. Rickman over comes the simplistic kitchen sink drama of a man tempted by a younger woman. We feel more for him rather than Thompson even though he's the one thinking about cheating. The pairing of the two as a married couple has a comfortable and true feel to it as if they had played husband and wife before. Linney seems miscast possibly because she is the only American lead in this extremely British movie. She sticks out like a sore thumb and you can't help but think that there must be a good British actress who could've played her part. Her appearance smacks of an advertising ploy to get an American name who could sell the movie in her home country. Firth is good though a little typecast in the more romantic storyline of the movie. His role has you on his side from very early on and you constantly root for him to make the right decision. The other cast are excellent though in the case of the gorgeous Keira Knightley there isn't much for her to do apart from look beautiful. Outstanding cameo from Billy Bob Thornton, the perfect choice to play the American president.I've always been a fan of Curtis' writing since the TV series ""Blackadder II"". His writing is the highest calibre of British comedy and it's not often that he makes a mistake. (""The Blackadder"", ""Blackadder: Back And Forth"" and ""Bean"" are possibly his only work that isn't up to scratch and he can't be solely blamed for those as he was credited as a co-writer.) He has been lucky with other directors, Mel Smith with ""The Tall Guy"", Mike Newell with ""Four Weddings And A Funeral"", Roger Michell with ""Notting Hill"", but it's entirely logical for him to take up directing as most writers want to control the way their work appears on screen. He does a fine job. None of the storylines outstay their welcome and the scenes have a Christmas glow about them. It's also good to see Curtis regular Rowan Atkinson in a glorified cameo as a sales assistant.Overall this is a great, grown up, inoffensive comedy that doesn't necessarily have to be watched at Christmas time. The negative aspects which I have already discussed are only minute and if it's pure entertainment you want you can't go wrong here. So many romantic comedies of late, ""Two Weeks Notice"" and ""Maid In Manhattan"" for example, have been seriously lacking in the comedy department. It's refreshing to find a good date movie that a man can safely enjoy.",Love Actually
335,charmadu,"Not Love, Actually",3,22 June 2014,"I watched this movie for the first time recently and yes, I know the world has changed in 11 years but wow - did this really pass as something terrific then? Of course the acting giants in this film could read you the phone book and it would sound great. After reading what stories should have been cut, I agree that the guy going to the US to get laid and the stand-in porn actors' stories were not worth the paper they were written on; however, taking them out would not have saved this picture. A serious problem is the pervasive sense of the ""love (or lust) at first sight = forever"" mentality. The only female part with any depth to it at all is Emma's. Laura Linney's character quite quickly reveals herself as a terminal co who is only going to have a life once her brother dies. It's hard to not just pity her. Unfortunately all we get from Emma's character at the end is a kind of wan smile accompanying her ""I'm fine, I'm fine!"" to her husband's somewhat thoughtful ""how are you?"". The one relationship that showed some hint of possible potential is only allowed to reach the depth of a birdbath apparently. Too bad the film maker didn't take a cue from the real footage in the airport that ends the film - there suddenly we are smacked up the side of the head with every type of real relationship EXCEPT this shallow Hollywood romance stuff, and you realize, ""ahhhh, THAT's love actually!""",Love Actually

I enjoyed watching the scenes go from one story too another, and how they all came together at the end.  Not everyone ended up happily ever after, and the film left you wondering what happens next with all of the characters.  The only thing I did not like were the pot shots at America.  It was blatantly obvious that the director had an axe to grind, and so he took as many cheap shots as he could in his film.  I guess I thought that after the incidents on 9/11, Americans would receive love and support from our allies. Instead everyone has become a critic about everything we do, and we are forced to endure political agenda being shoved down our throats in the movies we go to see for entertainment purposes.  Ah, silly me.  I guess there really are a few British left that are still sore about what happened between our countries in the late 1700's.  (Hey, I'm an American.

It's a complete mystery to me why this movie does not have a perfect score both here and on rotten tomatoes. It's right high up there with The Shawshank Redemption, Back to the Future or Ghostbusters as one of the perfect movies, that work every time, don't loose anything with age and don't have a single flaw or weakness, no line or scene or character is too much or too little.This movie have saved me many Christmas Evenings, it's unresistable romantic and both true and magical, funny and touching. Describing this as a romantic comedy is as describing The Godfather simply as a gangster movie. It's one of the best movies, perhaps even the best, ever made about love.",Love Actually
338,zsigomiklos,"Lovely, charismatic, humorous, hilarious movie...absolutely unbeatable",10,14 July 2007,"Love Actually is my favourite romantic comedy and I do not think it would change in the near future. What a great casting, witty script, genuine and very sensible plot with intelligent solutions. I do not even have to say that all the jokes landed. I cannot remember such a beautiful character development in the British film history as in Love Actually. There was something in Pride and Prejudice, but there were not 8 couples, only just a few (different genre anyway).Hugh Grant delivers a wonderful performance as the PM, Emma Thompson as a caring mother and heart-broken housewife, Bill Nighy as the over-aged rock star (my personal favourite), and so on. I could mention the entire cast here but if I told you everything, why would you watch the movie? I would highly recommend Love Actually, it warms your heart up. Well, it did mine.My rating is a well-deserved 10 OUT OF 10.",Love Actually
339,dark_elf02,It should have concentrated on less stories,8,11 December 2005,"I remember finally getting my hands on this movie the day it arrived at the rental store and popped it in my DVD player. My hands were shaking with anticipation, and by the end I was satisfied but not with all of it.My only complaint was that it had too many story lines in it. If I could cut down the amount of couples whos story lines were interesting, the top three would have been, Juliet and Mark. I honestly felt bad for Mark who has always loved Juliet, but as a way of protecting himself never said anything and had to watch his best friend marry her. The prime minister and Natalie. It was nice to see the prime minister portrayed as a guy who's just as lonely, and in love as the next guy.And lastly Daniel who has just lost his wife and is grieving, and his step-son sam who is in love. Its a touching relationship where we see Daniel coming out of his pain and helping his son which in turn helps him to heal.The movie isn't perfect, and if it concentrated on these stories instead of so many more it would have been better. Some of the others were good too but I think these 3 if they were given the detail, and time would have made a great movie.",Love Actually

The movie stood by itself very well without all the garbage.  From people I know who have seen it unedited, it is not the sweet movie which I saw.The movie shows parallel love stories of different couples.  Some end up happily, but some do not.  The part we liked best was Colin Firth and his Portuguese girlfriend.I do not recommend this movie in its natural state.  No, I haven't seen it that way, but I won't recommend movies with smut for smut's sake.  On the other hand, without all that, the movie was quite pleasant.",Love Actually

I like it; it is mostly undemanding, the vignette structure lets me dip in and out of it without much thought. Of course it is unrealistic, but then romance in movies is and when you see something billed as a romantic comedy you have to expect to leave your disbelief hanging. In general there is more to enjoy than to deplore. But two specific comments which may help.1. Alan Rickman DOES NOT get his end away with the office tease. He never does. He buys her the bauble (despite Rowan Atkinson's camouflaged attempt to stop him) and she ends up grinning away because she knows she has him over a barrel. Emma Thompson has to cry not because Alan doesn't love her but because now she cannot trust him.2. Sorry it comes over as sexist. Romantic comedies are, aren't they? I mean, that is the central point of romantic comedies, either vive la difference or can't-live-with-them-can't-live-without-them style of thing.

344,johnleemk,A Dickensian Love Fairy Tale,7,27 December 2007,"Love Actually is one of the most mawkish, treacly, sugary romantic comedies out there - as has been noted, there are a tonne of different plots, so you have basically eight times the amount of upbeat treacle you would normally get. The movie tosses an incredible ensemble cast in your face, flaunting well-known celebrities in almost unremarkable cameos. Yet, incredibly, the movie works - it makes you feel good about yourself and about love.The critics can say what they will, but Love Actually actually defies all these things working against it, and for inexplicable reasons, tells eight uplifting love stories. It would be difficult for someone not to be touched by at least one of them, seeing as how the movie takes pains to cover almost every type of love imaginable, from romantic to platonic.The important thing to bear in mind is that you can't take the movie too seriously. Most romantic comedies flirt with the barrier between reality and fantasy, but by the end of Love Actually, it's pretty unquestionable that this is a modern day fairy tale - it's not just implausible, it's impossible.Love Actually reminds me of something Dickens would write, because it adheres to Dickens' style. The denouement of the movie ties together all the subplots, bringing the characters together at the airport - a definite Dickensian move.Dickens dealt with mawkish fairy tales, and he has found popular acclaim, both among the masses and among the critics. If the critics would let their guard down and accept Love Actually as a fairy tale, I think they'd find it's a very Dickensian story at heart.If you loved reading Charles Dickens's improbable stories, and didn't mind the exciting but improbable happy endings he almost inevitably produced, you will like Love Actually.",Love Actually
345,IloveHanks,Pointless Actually,7,14 July 2010,"This is a pointless movie actually. It takes us through eight different love stories, most of them which just end as soon as they begin. What good can eight half baked love stories can do, when two fully baked could have sufficed. There is no heart in almost all of the love stories in the movie. Most of the stories are superficial and get too mawkish.The likes of Laura Linney,Liam Neeson and Kiera Knightely are wasted in a movie that did not require them. To add onto the miscasts, Hugh grant plays the British Prime Minister. Nothing can get more absurd and ludicrous than this. Most of the stories are superficial and get too mawkish.I could see that the movie actually makes a lot of digs at the Americans. This is not a bad movie actually, but i see that the director just wants us to see different people falling in love and empathize with them. I think he just overdid it and would have done better had he had just shown 3-4 fully developed love stories. The performances are nothing spectacular except Bill Nighy as an aging rock star who really sparkles up the screen whenever he is on it. Rowand Atkinson appears in just two scenes and does what he does best,I reiterate the point that it is not a bad movie, but just a bit overindulgent . If you are in a foolishly romantic mood, then this might just be a classic for you else just a casual movie for killing your time. 7\10..",Love Actually
346,slayerholmes,All you don't need is rubbish like this,1,6 April 2008,"This sort of a British version of Altman's ""Short Cuts"" (1993) is lightly brisk and totally intellect insulting romantic comedy, exactly the way a movie should be I think when it's targeted by precision for Holiday season and women, elderly and ""those boys"". I was, actually, already willing to stop watching this nonsense after the scene where cute Keira Knightly is getting interracially married and soul brothers and sisters begin to destroy The Beatles from the church balcony. (I don't hate black people, I just don't like to see them ruin the gems of the western culture!) In addition, the new PM Hugh Grant, judging by his behavior, simply couldn't have any previous experience of politics whatsoever, etc etc... The only achievers are always pleasant Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, as is Bill Nighy in his deliciously vicious and cynical aging rocker role. But even their contributions get lost in this over two hours and a hundred speaking parts mess. The worst torture awaits in the end, last half an hour or so, of which I doubt any normal male aged 15-60 is able to get away without diabetes... A couple of interesting cameos: Rowan Atkinson in his small role as a clerk in jewellery store is quite funny, actually, but Claudia Schiffer as a ""gift from heaven"" makes you wither in pain once again.

As it was contents of Christmas, I was able to be excited even more. The theme song of a movie is ""All You Need Is Love"". This is so good and I think it match this movie. My favorite scene is the scene that Sarah is pleased with. I thought that time when Sarah sent Carl of the unrequited love partner to the room was very pretty.

All the characters are constantly opening themselves up (sometimes in spite of themselves) to the possibilities and heartbreak of actual love. In doing so, they also open up those around them for better and sometimes for worse, to show compassion and passion for those around them. It is a wonderful fable, with great music, acting, comedy and pathos. Great cameos, also, from surprising folks like Claudia Schiffer (a Christmas angel if there ever was one) and Rowan Atkinson. The last act of this movie always leaves me a puddle on the floor, and when the Beach Boys start singing, well, it's almost too much. This movie is more than about romantic love, in fact the movie itself is a tremendous gesture of generosity. The first time I watched this movie, on first release I really liked it, then the more I saw it the deeper it got for me. Now, one of my favorite movies, obviously.",Love Actually

They could have easily dumped the story about the cheating boss and the stand-ins and the guy who loves his his best friend's wifre...seeing as how those stories were only about 10 minutes of the movie anyway--and not very interesting.

350,coopski1@aol.com,Steaming Pile of Crap,1,23 December 2014,"I watched this movie with mouth agape. As it went on I kept waiting for some as-yet-to-be-revealed character to wake up from the ridiculous dream he/she is having and for something even remotely resembling plausibility to present itself. It's like a junior high school girl and a college freshman girl collaborated with a middle aged woman with borderline personality disorder and committed it to film and then had someone throw in a manipulative soundtrack. Let's start with the phone call between Emma Thompson's character, a self-important stay-at-home mother, who takes a tearful phone call from her grieving brother (Liam Neeson) ... whose wife has just died. His wife has died recently enough that the funeral hasn't even taken place yet. But Emma Thompson, in a dismissive tone, tells her brother that she has a much more pressing priority demanding her attention at the moment and says she'll get back to him when she can. Hanging up, she turns her attention to the highly important matter of her grade school child announcing to her that she has just won the role of the second lobster in her school Christmas pageant. I don't blame her husband for almost being stolen from her by his predatory secretary. And I don't feel one bit sorry for her. But then let's not forget that her OTHER brother is the new Prime Minister of Britain, Hugh Grant. Which also makes him the brother of the recently widowed Liam Neeson. But while the new Prime Minister doesn't find time to go to his deceased sister-in-law's funeral he feverishly trots after and tracks down the office step-n-fetch-it hottie at her little brother's Christmas pageant (where, of COURSE he runs into the woe-is-me Emma Thompson).

352,je-remy,Only Richard Curtis could have made this film.,3,31 August 2012,"Too many characters and stories and neither a natural nor a contrived but clever connection between them. Too many stories meaning there wasn't ""a"" story and no time for characters to develop. It looks like Curtis has used all his failed plot ideas - the ones he couldn't make a full movie out of - and fitted them in this. And some of them are truly dire.Only Richard Curtis could have made this film - I imagine if anyone else wrote the same it would never pass a read. Its not really a film so much as one huge number of shorts intertwined.The film begins with the same kind of voice-over that we saw in ""Notting Hill"". ""That again"" or ""them again"" is the main feeling I have with this film. It ends with the old character-in-a-race-to-catch-their-loved-one before they leave/to deliver a message - in not one but several of the stories. A tirade of swears is meant to be comedy. etc etc. Curtis uses all the old ""tricks"" we've already seen.There was one story thread which I would have liked to see as the whole movie - the writer and the maid. Going into the water to look for the blown papers was about the only place in the film I laughed. Thus I've given it a 3 - without it, it would have been a 1 from me.",Love Actually

In 2020, I told my wife, that this was a good movie that I always liked. I remembered it being much better that the corny Valentines Day and Happy New Year.How wrong I was. The word -Love- is apparently mixed up with falling in love or rather the willingness to sleep with someone. Because there isn't much real love to find in this movie.
Out of all these stories, there are 2 really good ones and 2 at all bearable ones.
The sister who sacrifices here own love life to care for her ill brother, is genuinely heartwarming. The wife that doesn't want to spoil Christmas for her children, although her husband is cheating"" on her is a story of true love. Albeit love for her children.
All the other stories are between okay and terrible. The Liam Neeson one has to be the worst of the bunch. Is this really a father-son-relationship, where the mother just passed away? And their only aim is to go out and get a girl... okay then.In addition to that, the movie is weirdly condescending to women and portrays them in a very outdated way. Most women are in lower position than the men of that respective story. Also, several women are portrayed as mindless objects, that just do whatever a man wants of them.Lastly, the only two cases of real love, are two women who are left without a happy ending? Do I have unrealistic expectations and do I say it is not okay that not everyone gets a happy ending? No! But if you give Liam Neeson and the frat boys going to America a laughably over the top ending, then why not do the same for everyone?Skip this!",Love Actually
354,igm,Works for me,7,4 December 2003,"***  spoiler alert ***<love, actually> is an engaging, feel-good concatenation of nearly a dozen love stories that climax at Christmas.  It's message, spoken over the title credits by Hugh Grant, is probably true: love is ubiquitous.  The device of using the arrivals gate at Heathrow to drive home this fact is at once kitschy and poignant.  There are so many odes to hate, violence, war, and conflict in movies that this clever, fun, and upbeat movie will find difficulty gaining footing in a desolate filmscape.It is a challenge to review this movie because so many aspects of love are explored.  Unrequited love.  Love's first bloom.  Love on the rocks.  Love ended prematurely.  Fraternal love.  Love's sacrifice.  Love bridging language.  Love bridging class. Ugly duckling finds love.  They don't all work, but most do.  And in many there is a rich and economically communicated subtext about how these people succeed in love.Things that work especially well:  Laura Linney caring for her mentally ill brother.  Bill Nighy's irreverent, unapologetic rock-and-roller.  Emma Thompson and Allan Rickman's brinksmanship with adultery.  The hurtfulness of the Martine McCutcheon chubby jokes.Things that don't work:  Rowan Atkinson (not here, not like this).  Billy Bob's wooden, implausible American President.  Denise Richards (waste). Hugh Grant's trite rebuff of the US.  Rodrigo Santoro saying virtually nothing to stir love in anybody.Love can be painful, limiting, paralyzing--and it is in this film--but every character in it doggedly pursues it anyway.

I had to replay the scene where Hugh Grant is listening to the radio and starts dancing and singing- pretty funny stuff.It's just too bad the movie was not able to sustain character development to keep me caring about what happens in these peoples lives. It just became one big cliché by the end and there was so much potential with this great cast. I wanted to root for them and occasionally I did and then I would find myself gasping with the shock of cheesy dialogue and plot development- the way the storyline jumped from one character to another.. Without any apparent rhyme or reason. So in the end I was conflicted.

The 'jokes' are forced as are the emotions. There is no visible conclusion to the scenario with Rickman's character's marriage and with all the talk about deleted scenes I hope there was some sort of close, but I would rather have my eyeballs sucked out than sit through any of the 80 minutes of director's cut. When it comes to the anti-American stuff  who cares? We're portrayed as a country of lust filled vixens and an over sexed president, that's not so bad, but I would hope to think someone as nasty as Billy Bob never gets elected. For the reviewer who wrote 'For romantics only'  get over it. If you think this is romantic then you probably still live with your parents and attend junior high. Yes, we go to the movies for the escape, but not for lobotomies.

I appreciate her love and loyalty to family, but, once again, a woman subservient to a fault.) If you watch this movie with the artificial world view that women are merely objects for men, then it is 10 stars.

We all have our good points and bad, don't we? That's what made it so human.One of the best things about the film was that these story lines were all centered around the Christmas season. Wow! You can actually say ""Merry Christmas"" in Britain? And you don't have to spell it ""X-mas""? How politically incorrect is that? A very good film worth watching.

371,cm-9,The ultimate romantic comedy,10,28 November 2003,"This is a film for adults.  Everybody must have found themselves in one of the situations portrayed, and in that sense it is very true to life. Because it is a film, and a comedy, the situations are  exaggerrated obviously but nevertheless the underlying truths are there.LA: best man is in love with the bride (but doesn't talk to her for ""self-preservation"") RL: you find yourself attracted to your friend's partner, and what on earth do you do about it when seeing them both all the timeLA: nice girl is in love with intelligent Adonis dream male but sadly every time she has a chance of getting it together with him her mentally disabled brother gets in the way RL: family or other obstacles thwart your romantic objectivesLA: sexy young PA makes a powerful and sustained pass at her married boss RL: many workplaces mix together older married men and younger women, often creating difficult temptations (although most commonly the younger women are simply not sexually interested in the older married men, which is probably a good thing for the future of the species)LA: English writer loves Portugeuse housekeeper but they don't have a language in common RL: this is a metaphor for any barrier to communication between loversLA: naive young Brit goes to America in search of girls and lands in a wet dream situation in the first bar he visits, just by virtue of his 'cute' accent RL: many people find foreigners more attractive and interesting due to cultural and linguistic differences and stereotyping - the 'cute accent' phenomenon is a real one which I have personally experienced in both directions. (Of course in real life American girls are not typically so attractive or so thin, sadly.  Sorry to say, but that's the way it is.)LA: new Prime Minister finds himself attracted to the tea girl RL: we often find sexual attraction where it is socially inappropriate, indeed that can heighten the attraction, the theme of many books and filmsI could go on, but the long and the short of it is that I found this film simultaneously the most intelligent, apt, warm, human and humorous film I have seen for many years.  I don't agree with those who say it is too rose-tinted or too unrealistic.  For me every moment was sheer brilliance. The writing, acting, and direction are the best bar none.

373,chrishend,painfully bad,2,31 December 2004,"Where to start on this superficial, overly-sentimental piece of garbage?The blatant sexism? The total lack of any developed characters? Hugh Grant as prime minister?The flaws are too many to count, but I'll just go over some of my biggest problems with this piece of junk ...1. There is not one single character that is even moderately developed. We are flooded with all these situations in which these humanoids are supposedly falling in love, or already in love, with each other yet we have absolutely no idea why, nor in most cases do the characters seem to know either. Writer falls in love with maid. Let's not bother with the fact they've never spoken a single word to each other (they don't speak a common tongue) and don't know each other at all. She looks good in a bathing suit. Apparently that's all that's necessary for a guy to ask a girl to marry him (and for her to say yes). Superficial garbage relationship #1.Prime minister falls in love with his secretary. Do any of us know why, other than the fact she likes to swear in inappropriate places? No, of course not. That would require writing and actual ... you know ... story. Superficial garbage relationship #2.Office-worker lady is in love with a co-worker. Do we know why? Do we get to know either of these characters at all? Of course not. That would once again involve actually developing a story. All we know is the guy looks like an abercrombie and fitch model. If there's any other reason to love the guy, we sure don't know about it. Superficial garbage relationship #3.Dude is in love with his best friend's wife. Sure, she's Keira Knightley and therefore hot as hell. Do we have any other idea why this guy is in love with her, and willing to hit on his friend's wife behind his back? No, of course not. Once again, apparently all we need to know to is that she's hot ... the end. Superficial garbage relationship #4.2. Bizarre misogyny. Almost all the relationships in this movie involve some extreme power differential b/w the male and female. The guys want the hot chicks because they're hot, the hot chicks want the old fart guys because ... because ... I'm not sure. Because they have good jobs I guess. There's also an inordinate amount of time where one of the hot chicks is bagged on repeatedly for being ""fat"". Note this is a girl that could only be considered ""fat"" in the movie-make-believe world. Even in that world it still doesn't make any sense. The term ""fat"" is one of the last that would come to mind when describing her and I spent more than a couple minutes scratching my head trying to figure out why characters were making fun of her physical appearance. On any other universe she's a solid ""9"". If this girl is lucky to have a relationship because she's ""fat"", all I can say to the rest of you women out there is you might as well shoot yourselves, cause she's hotter than 98% of you. 3. You know how in a good romance movie there is often that one point where the characters finally have their big connection which fulfills the build-up of the movie over the first couple acts? This movie just skips all the stuff involved in actually telling the story of relationships and just has the sappy payoff ... in every scene of the movie ... over and over again. While watching this wreck I couldn't help but feeling that the writer just took the payoff scene in his top 50 favorite romance movies and just wrote them all into one movie. Too bad he left out all the stuff leading up to the payoffs (character, plot, theme, etc) that made them work in the first place.Pure junk. One of the worst movies I've seen.",Love Actually

375,mike-wright-1,Ambitious? No. Perfect? Yes.,7,20 December 2012,"The film most obviously comparable to Love Actually is Paris Je T'Aime. Although LA never scales the heights of its French counterpart, it never attempts to. In doing what it sets out to, Richard Curtis's montage of love at Christmas is every bit as perfect.It is fair to say that this is very much a fantasy film. There are elements which are completely unrealistic and there is definitely a need for suspension of disbelief. The film does not branch out too far from middle class London with almost all of the cast living in very trendy, modern homes. Where it really succeeds though is that each of the nine story arcs has its own charm – there are no duds. For comedy value, the strongest are those involving Hugh Grant's Prime Minister and Martin Freeman's body double. For good, old fashioned schmaltz it's hard to look past Colin Firth's writer and his Portuguese maid. There's also a strong turn from Laura Linney in the film's most serious arc, as the office girl in love with her colleague for two years but with the burden of a sick brother keeping her from her own life.Love Actually has quickly become a Christmas classic. One of the those films you can come into half way through and still enjoy every bit as much.

378,luvnsweet,Great movie! *some spoilers*,10,16 November 2003,"Just knowing that Colin Firth was in this movie was enough to make me go and watch this film.  There were some storylines that I could have done without (e.g. the going to America story and body double) but overall it was a great movie.My favorite storyline was the Colin Firth one.  It was really cute although I know it's unrealistic.  It was cute how they didn't understand what each other was saying yet thinking the same thing.  Jamie: ""It's my favorite part of the day driving you home."" Aurelia (in Portuguese): ""It's the saddest part of my day, leaving you.""  And how cute was it seeing Colin Firth speaking broken Portuguese.  It was much better than having him speak perfect Portuguese after only a few weeks.  And he was so cute in the beginning of the film saying ""I love you"" to his wife three times... only to come back and learned she's cheating on him with his brother!  I don't think I was the only one in the theatre going ""how can you cheat on him?!""!  AND Colin Firth is in a pond again... My other favorite storyline was the Emma Thompson/Alan Rickman one and Liam Neeson son.  Emma Thompson truly astounded me with her performance.  The scene where she is so excited about opening up her Christmas present only to find out it was a Joni Mitchell CD instead of the necklace was heart-breaking.  I was hoping that Alan Rickman's character had come to his senses and decided to give her the necklace instad.  Then when she goes inside the room and cries while listening to the CD broke my heart.  She didn't want to break her children's heart during Christmas but her heart was breaking.  Then the scene where she embraces Hugh Grant's character at the Christmas pageant was so sad.  She was obviously hurting (you can tell by how hard she hugged him) but trying to put on a good face for the children. The storyline was kind of unresolved at the end leaving it up to speculation and that drove me a little crazy.  They need to make a whole movie just on this one storyline!  The Liam Neeson storyline was cute too and the little boy was too precious for words.  Yea the whole running through the airport scene and learning how to play the drums in 5 weeks was unrealistic but how cute was it?!The Hugh Grant storyline was okay but was anyone else confused by all the fat jokes about Natalie?  It was enough coming from her ex-boyfriend but from the other office assistant and her dad. She was not fat at all!  I'm glad they took out the ""fatso"" card for Keira Knightley character too because if you're calling Keira Knightley fat, then that is just wrong!  I was kinda of ""eh"" about the Keira Knightley storyline because while it was cute; I felt sorry for her new husband who was totally oblivious to what was going on.The singing guy was HILARIOUS.  Loved him.  The Laura Linney storyline was good too although unresolved at the end.  The guy that she liked was HOT! (the bedroom scene... wow!)The body double storyline I could have done without and the useless nudity. However all in all great movie!",Love Actually

I recently watched it on DVD and although it's still great fun...seeing this on the big screen was a real treat. The scene with Emma Thompson breaking down to Joni Mitchell's Both Sides Now is also a highlight of the film. So many great actors in one film and so many great songs it's hard to believe it works but it does. Sure it's corny in spots but it's also filled with really great actors actually acting for a change with dialog that is rich and genuinely funny.

Each actor is excellent in his role. Bill Nighy still stands out. And to see Martin Freeman (the Hobbit, Sherlock's Dr. Watson) in an early role is delightful. I was so impressed with the younger actors too. They have certainly matured in the last 12 years. ONE DISAPPOINTING FACT: I simply adored the scenes with young Bernard (William Wadham). This little guy can ACT. He and his 'mom' Karen (Emma Thompson) cover a young man's need to fit into society, and overcome his insecurities at home and at school.But in the DVD version his scenes had been deleted. What a disappointment! Please put them back.",Love Actually
381,Sandcat2004,"Welcome to ""Mastercard: Priceless-- The Movie""",4,10 November 2003,"I am not sure if I went into this movie with expectations of a formula movie (such as Curtis's well-known writing efforts: Four Weddings and a Funeral; BridgetJones's Diary; Notting Hill), but it disappointed me none the less. Although the cast is packed with thespians that have turned out regularly impressiveperformances, none of them is given a chance to explore any depth within their characters.  Instead, the viewer is expected to watch poorly paced vignettes that never ad up to anything more than cute moments inspired by the universalChristmas emotions of love and goodwill.The largest problem of the film lies with its inability to settle down and let the beats of a scene unfold naturally.  The first fifteen or twenty minutes of the film is so frenetically edited, jumping among the myriad of storylines, that the viewer is exposed to the most rudimentary aspects of each character (each scene reliesheavily on reaction shots, clever narrative jokes, witty dialogue lackingemotional subtext, and a memorable physical comedy setup involvingpornography stand-ins).  There is a definite interest in getting to know thecharacters because they are endearing; but alas, there is no payoff in the end, just a hollowness echoing some jovial laughter.Much of the problems arise from the oversaturation of characters.  Billy Mack, a middle-aged pop star looking for a comeback, is sn interesting character played quite well by Bill Nighy.  Many of the funniest scenes  (not to mention a nice emotional payoff at the end of the film) involve him and his manager. HighGrant also is charming, but is forced to partake in one of the most superfluous dancing sequences seen in many a year.  I cannot fault the actors, they do well with the little of which they have to work.  But I would have preferred to see some of the roles excised in order to develop the others more fully.  EvenMagnolia (P.T. Anderson's tour de force that relied on the connections between an ensemble of characters) allowed scenes and characters to evolve beforeemploying its sweeping camera movements and edits.The intentions behind Love Actually are commendable.  The opening VO setagainst a nice montage of newly arrived air travelers leads the viewer to believe the complication of relationships of love might be explored.  Sadly, that is never realized.  The final product is nothing but a collection of cute moments that seem to be selling the idea of love rather than showing the depth of its effects.",Love Actually

It was actually quite unfortunate because there were only two of the several stories that I was actually interested in. It felt like quite a mess, actually.It wasn't awful.

Not all the storylines in his multi-story lovefest were equally sustainable; one might have wished for half the number of stories and significantly more time devoted to the better ones, but the truth is, one never quite gets as much of Hugh Grant or Colin Firth or Emma Thompson as one wants, so perhaps it didn't really matter that their characters' screen time was diluted by some lesser adventures.  In any event, the ride was fun, several funny moments were quite memorable, and it was particularly enjoyable to see Bill Nighy let loose again in his patented, unchained, not-dead-yet persona.

There's a fair amount of subtle satire and a generous portion of irony; the characters are quite human and often don't do the right thing.

392,JokerSwan,"Fragmented, unfunny movie",5,22 November 2003,"Spoilers, in case anyone really cares-This movie is best characterized by the last scene: 100 tiny pictures of ppl hugging each other. That's just about what it was all along. A bunch of couples falling in and out of love, some of the stories very loosely related. Fragmented, difficult to follow, and none of the storylines were carried out properly. I suppose this happens when they have too many famous actors and actresses that all need a role in there somewhere. Rowan Atkinson, for example, got only one funny scene, although he's on the promo posters. They could have done so much more with him.Somehow the film doesn't fit the genre. It's not really funny, and a romantic comedy should have ""happy endings"" for everyone. What happened with Keira Knightley and her husband's best friend? Did they fall in love now? So she'll leave her husband, well merry Christmas to you too. And Emma Thompson cheated on and Laura Linney stuck with an insane brother and losing the guy - not my idea of a feel-good movie.As for the humor, it was really almost nonexistent. There were a few ""cute"" scenes, and I laughed heartily at Bill Nighy once or twice, but it seems the writers didn't even really try to make it funny. The jokes were predictable, forced and sometimes just plain weird (like the little girls wanting to hear Christmas carols - huh?) There was only one big laugh in the theatre during the whole movie. Didn't feel like watching a comedy. Bill Nighy as the aging rock star and Colin Firth with his Portuguese girl were funny at first, but both stories were watered down by the end. The ""fat sister"" thing was so predictable. They even hinted at it in the beginning of the movie!
Speaking of which, what's with all the fat jokes?  They're ok in Bridget Jones, but here we have a normal weight girl being called ""plump"", and Emma Thompson comparing herself to Pavarotti?! Way to promote a healthy body image. Not to mention the characters who actually were fat. I wonder if the writers have weight issues?Hugh Grant was, as usual, charming, but his storyline wasn't as central as I had hoped. Also, they shouldn't have brought in the politics between USA and GB. I get the Monica Lewinsky joke (""plump"" girl kissed by US president), but it just didn't fit the movie.And the appalling storyline about the little boy who falls in love? 11-year-old boys do NOT fall in love. And he just lost his mother but is much sadder about a girl not noticing him? Maybe if he were 15, and the mother had died a year ago, or something. I couldn't believe the airport scene. It's even older than ""fat sister"" or ""friends are more important than success"". Too many clichés for one movie.I mostly went to see this movie for Hugh Grant, so I didn't expect too much, but I was still disappointed.

I was so ashamed to have my uncle and aunt exposed to such foul language and explicit nudity for no apparent reason, and ONLY 5 miserable minutes into the movie!Anyway, I forgot all about this movie and went on with my life, until a few weeks ago I was again confronted with it and this time being by myself I decided to give it a go, considering the number of big stars in it, it couldn't be that bad, right? WRONG! It was that bad! I am glad now that I didn't waste more time of our Christmas eve with such piece of garbage. I can't understand how so many dedicated and serious movie stars would put their names up for such trash. Love Actually has very little to do with love but an awful lot to do with lust, but again, for today's standards there's very little difference between these two.The plot, if you can call it that, is a mess, it makes no sense. The continuity is non existing and many characters simply vanish. I can only assume they did not know how to end their part in the story and it finishes unresolved. For others, it's simply too stupid, like the Collin Firth character, that after having his heart broken, falls in love with his Portuguese house maid who can't speak English, therefore, they can't even talk about the simplest of subjects. It goes from bad to worse, from unhappy and cheated house wives to foul mouth and ""has been"" rock stars and young and defiant prime-ministers.Whatever, this was a complete waste of my precious time, and truly disappointing to see how so many people could get so excited about so bad a movie, I suppose it shows that the bar is really low now and any piece of trash is appreciated. what a pity!",Love Actually

*Cons:-Some stories are neglected and feel unresolved.-Fairly full of itself.-Brief political subplot******************************************From Richard Curtis, the cinematic genius who brought you ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", ""Notting Hill"", and ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", comes a film so perfect, so well done, and indeed so long awaited, that you'd have to be a completely heartless, uncultured arsehole to not enjoy it.Of course, I don't really think that, but the filmmaker seemed to, given the overall tone of the trailer for this self-proclaimed ""Ultimate Romantic Comedy""... It was because of this very pretentious tone that I approached this film with a bit of hostility; but really just increased expectations. To me, if they're going to tout their brilliance as a marketing tool for this film, they'd better live up to the higher standard they claim as their own.The good news is, they mostly do. I mean, how can you dislike a film that announces that its purpose is to point out that love is actually all around you?Sadly, a few different ways. A brief subplot involving Grant's character and the President of the US offered some very unspecific but generally anti-American political rhetoric. Don't get me wrong here I don't mind the stereotyping of Americans, since we dish that out at other countries all the time. Likewise, I can accept anti-American sentiment, as long as it's expressed in the form of a valid argument rather than vague generalization. In any case, I think the former, and not the latter, is the only of the two that has any place in a romantic comedy. It was in fact a scene of the stereotyping of Americans that was one of the most enjoyable scenes in the film, while the other scene seemed to be almost a deliberate sucker-punch for every American watching, followed by an immediate retreat by the person who dealt it. It was in poor taste, to say the least.Beyond that The musical score, while very pleasing to the ear, was a bit intrusive at times The overall mood of certain scenes was apparently lacking, so the score tried to make up for it. Granted, it's a difficult line to place, but the score crossed it more than once.Most of the stories worked very well. Unfortunately, as a consequence of such a multi-threaded narrative, some of them felt unresolved at the film's end. The pacing was good overall, although there were times in which a story would be in limbo for a bit too long, leaving the audience wondering if the characters decided to take an early holiday (to borrow a British expression). But clearly, this is also a difficult line to measure, and for the most part, Curtis pulls it off. And in the end, in spite of its flaws, he leaves us with a delightful film to remember for this season.6/10",Love Actually

Was I surprised.The British are good in creating a movie with simultaneous storylines of which some have their typical off-the-wall humour.This was actually a fun movie to watch, especially when the Prime Minister (Hugh Grant)criticises the US President, and when the PM does a dance.After seeing this how many countries wouldn't want Hugh Grant as their PM.Anyway it is a fun 2 hours.

My only complainant was that there were so many stories, and I wanted to see more of some.  I especially liked the one involving the new widower and his stepson, the rockers comeback, the one about the porn stand-ins, the one about the long-time marrieds facing a crisis in their marriage, and the impossibly-handsome PM.  even some of the smaller parts were real standouts. The jewelry clerk who blocked for the kid at the airport, and Claudia Schiffer's cameo were charming touches.

It is a poignant montage of the many loves we encounter in life and it is delivered in a very funny and heartwarming way by the finest ensemble of UK actors lead by Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Kiera Knightley, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson and the very funny Bill Nighy who really knocked my pants off with his rendition of love is all around retitled :Christmas is all around'.  With a soaring soundtrack by Craig Armstrong there is really nothing you can hate in this movie.  It is a very modern view of love and relationships in the 21st century.  In this day and age when most romantic comedies are simply shallow,  Love actually delves deeper (but not to the point of being boring) into the more wonderful circumstances that surround the feeling of being in love in all its many forms be it puppy love, forbidden love, blind love, familial love, etc. its all here.  Indeed, when I finished watching it I really felt that love actually is all around

404,ciocio-2,"An annoying, cloying, self-indulgent, hackneyed MESS.",1,30 July 2004,"This movie truly is pretty damned awful. It's a shame, with all the talent in it, and high production values (it's often very pretty to look at, at least). Goodness knows, I'm just as susceptible as any romantic sap, to a good--even sappy or corny--romantic comedy. But this was mostly just annoying. It's like the film's makers had a big manual, filled with standard romantic comedy clichés and situations, along with a few new twists that are not improvements on the tried (sometime tired) and true. Then they stuffed the movie with 'way too many characters, and began assigning the various clichés to them, like assigning numbers in a crowded shop.The movie makers seemed intent on achieving heart-tugging moments, cutesy moments and other such moments, at prescribed intervals throughout the film. Unfortunately, they're just as fake as can be--no truth or genuine emotion in sight, other than glimmers some of the actors can evoke, which is only more annoying, given that the context those actors are in don't support or deserve those glimmers. Think little diamond chips sprinkled on dog poo. Yuck. Won't even go into all the misogyny, the needless swearing, crassness, ageism, lookism (let's all laugh at the heavy Portuguese woman, and cheer her father for being mean to her!)--oy, what a mess! Have these film makers never heard of the concept of ""character development?"" At moments like Colin Firth's march to the restaurant, and awkward marriage proposal, I really thought this might be a spoof, it was so bad and ham-fisted. Doing that with an actor of his caliber should be illegal.It all culminates in a ridiculous, over-the-top (and not in a good way) final sequence that puts all these characters (with possible exception of Laura Linney's--not sure. Was she not available for that particular shooting schedule?) in one place, supposedly tying up their various stories into ""happy ending"" cinematic Christmas packages. GAG! The main, big, unforgivable problem with LOVE, ACTUALLY is that none of these emotional moments is earned at all. They're just stuck on to the surface of the movie, like a big, pointless, ineffective mosaic. The finished product of this chaos is an annoying, cloying, self-indulgent, hackneyed MESS. Never have I felt so manipulated by film makers, almost as if they were commanding me to be moved, but I felt more like they were sticking their fingers down my throat! Dreadful.",Love Actually

I liked all of the performances, Grant is at his best in romantic comedies. Emma Thompson was excellent as the married woman that came to realize that things weren't what she thought they were in her marriage. She gave a very quiet heart wrenching performance, It wasn't over the top. When she went into her bedroom and looked at the photo's of her family, it showed us the history of this couple, and how it seems that the husband lost himself in his work, while she lost herself in her children.This is like the old cliché, it will make you laugh and make you cry. Sam played by Thomas Sangster was one of the sweetest characters. I also like the scenes in the airport.

It made me know that there are all kinds of love and although there were several stories bounding around I found every one of them interesting. I was not disappointed in the director or his material. I think that you have to let yourself go when watching this movie. One story showed that love can conquer all even if you ""don't know the language.""

It wants SO MUCH for you to like it, from the title to the sound track, that it falls over itself. Further more, it isn't really about love at all. What we see time and again is desire, plain and simple. Real love (self-sacrifice, constancy, selflessness etc) barely enters the equation. In fact, you could say the parading of this imposter does it, if anything, a great disservice.

I saw this movie in the movies back when it came out, and found myself laughing hysterically. I wasn't laughing because the movie was sweet, but because Richard Curtis has served up a ridiculous parody of these types of movies. The funny thing is that nobody gets it. Every story, however, parodies the idea of love as something that is superficial and based on looks, rather than something that is deep and lasting. There is not a single moment in any of the multiple story lines that offers a sentimental reason for characters to be together. In particular, I thought 1) the storyline where the British guy goes to America and the American women immediately fall all over themselves for him and 2) the storyline where the Prime Minister's girlfriend is called ""fat"" and ""plump"" over and over again by everyone that knows her were not meant to be taken literally. This movie is not about love and is not a popcorn movie! I just can't believe that so many people missed how subversive and twisted this movie really is.

I really loved this movie because of the message of love and the great feeling it gave me at the end. The next day, however, I thought in more depth and realized there are a lot of problems with the story. Some of the stories(this movie jumped around almost as if watching a soap opera) didn't make any sense and/or didn't resolve themselves which made me think, What was the purpose of showing us that?

The script is truly witty, The performances are outstanding. Emma Thompson and Bill Nighy are standouts, but there really isn't a weak performance in the piece. Colin Firth is dashingly romantic and Hugh Grant dances. Liam Neeson shows he has a very specific set of skills and they include comedy.And somehow the whole is just a hugely enjoyable confection. Even a moving one. If Laura Linney doesn't pull at your heart then feel your pulse.

There isn't really any need for spoilers but I'm going to include them because it won't make any difference in how you will enjoy or not enjoy the movie regardless.You know that action movie where the mild mannered man or woman is well, mild mannered until someone kills their entire family and then they go nuts because THATS. TOO. FAR? And you know it's coming, they just have to go through the motions of a quick set up on how a normally civil and law abiding person could suddenly snap like a freak bowl of Rice Krispies and lose their mind while on a spree of vengeance never before seen? Right, well this is that, but about love.Everyone loves this movie. Well. A lot of people do. And it sure does tug on those heartstrings and really taps into the old adage of love conquers all. Boy. Isn't love a great thing? Because well, it makes the world go 'round! Okay. Maybe a little heavy in the sarcasm but you get the picture.Its not a terrible movie, honestly it isn't. And there are a lot of good actors in it. Some have even won awards. I think. It's just that before the movie even starts, you already know what's going to happen. Gee, Colin Firth's character's wife is cheating on him? The Prime Minister is hot for Nathalie the awkward but extremely attractive assistant on the staff at 10 Downing? Hey, look at that, Liam Neeson makes a joke at his late wife's funeral service about meeting Claudia Shaffer and he meets....wait for it......CLAUDIA SHIFFER!But the movies isn't without its merits. Its not entirely transparent in what is going on with someone the characters. When the lonely catering dude goes to America despite the protests of his good pal and antagonist character to meet a bunch of hot American girls then actually does meet a bunch of hot American (and one Canadian playing an American, the eternally sexy Elisha Cuthbert) and it DOESN'T turn out to be a scam despite it appearing to be exactly that, its actually funny! And I didn't quite figure out what was going on with Klaus from Die Hard and Emma Thompson until the end of the movie when you realize that yes, they just ARE in a loveless marriage and his trampy secretary who couldn't possibly being THAT obvious is... just that. But otherwise no surprises.This movie falls into the same category as Notting Hill and Home For The Holidays, formulaic predictable mail in that are written to just work out and not use the good actors in them to the best of their abilities.But hey, Martine McCutcheon.

Of my group that saw this movie, I was the only one that realized at the end that ""Daniel"" (Liam Neeson) actually did end up with Claudia Schiffer -to some extent anyway!I think Hugh Grant was terrific as the prime minister. I loved how he handled the American president. Billy Bob was a real snake!The only thing we were disappointed in is that Laura Linney's (Sarah) story line did not get wrapped up like the others. Which might have been on purpose - not every problem is solved at Christmas. The other problem is -and it wasn't for us- but this is not a movie for young children. I would say not under 12, though it does depend on the child.

Too many good actors are going through the motions and fail to convince us that they are worth caring about. Only one or two strong scenes, not enough humour, all in all - drivel.If many people saw this and liked it, as apparently they did, it explains why so much mainstream cinema is lightweight and worthless.I suspect Richard Curtis is too busy - he should devote more time to the script and make sure that he is in the editing room so that he does not end up with a reputation which is surely much diminished by this film.",Love Actually

There is also the grieving widower, who happens to meet the lust of his life, a look-alike Claudia Schiffer...ha ha, end of story. There's also the shy porn actor who musters up the courage to ask out his co-star who he just shagged...ha ha, end of story. While these are cute little ""what if"" stories, this is where they start and end, each taking about 3.4 minutes of screen time, or actually wasting 3.4 minutes of my life.Other story lines are disturbing, and do not work well in a rom-com. There's Laura Linney who uses her emotionally imbalanced brother as an excuse for not having a life of her own. Then there's the little boy who, instead of grieving over his recently departed mother, only cares about being noticed by the popular girl at school who he's never even spoken to. There's also the story of the guy stalking newlywed Kiera Knightley by going to her home (with her husband in the next room) and declaring his undying love for her by flashing a picture of a decomposing mummy. And what rom-com would be complete without the exhibitionist, drug-addicted, washed-up rockstar who emotionally abuses his manager one minute and declares his gay love for him the next?

I guess there are more than a few scenes (especially of the couple trying to make a living as porn-movie body doubles) that would inspire such a question, but the real treat is when you sit down with the DVD remote in hand and really watch it all the way through several times.Every character is inspiring; every actor is top-notch. The closest thing to a ""villain"" is Alan Rickman's secretary, and by the end of the film, you're thinking ""Aw, let her keep the stupid necklace, who cares?""

425,Simlady,Quite possibly the perfect movie for me,10,9 December 2004,"I think it might just be my own personality, but this movie has everything I want in a movie. First of all, I knew almost every actor in it. Being American you would not think it, but I have BBC America and follow more British shows / movies than those made in the US. I watched this because of Alan Rickman and Liam Neeson, then recognized Keira Knightly for POTC, Thomas Sangster (from Miracle of the Cards, which had Brit Peter Wingfield) and the one who played Colin Frizzle, from My Family. It seemed like everywhere I looked, the actors were familiar.That was step one. Then, I watched the movie and began to LIKE them all. I can't find one character I did not like. Although not fond of Hugh Grant, I came to LOVE the Prime Minister, and though I had not paid much attention to Emma Thompson or Colin Firth (I am more fond of the younger brother, Jonathan) before, after seeing this I started renting their movies. Yes, Sense and Sensibility was a quick acquisition! My biggest complaint, actually, is that I want to see all of the 3 hour version Curtis talks about when he shows us the deleted scenes. That and I liked the soundtrack and not all the songs in the movie are on it! The movie itself covers every sort of love there could be. Not just male/female love, but love of friends for each other, parents for children, children for other children (in other words, young love - nothing sexual), and, though it is only on those deleted scenes, even homosexual love. There are two cases of hopeless love, but mostly the movie is full of hope, and the acting is just so high quality.I knew I was going to love the movie when I heard the opening speech, which was given by Grant's Prime Minister, David. In it he said he went to the airport to watch people arrive when he felt blue. Why? Because when people arrive, they show only love to the people meeting them there. You rarely find someone traveling miles to see someone and then start a screaming match as soon as the get there. Usually they hug each other. I had not thought of it that way, but think about it! And then, he says, as far as he knew, no one who called from the 911 airplanes called to give messages of hate. They all called loved ones to say goodbye.

427,madsbs,"Subtle and funny, but no cigar...",6,16 January 2004,"A patchwork of narratives about the love that is found in every corner of the world is, indeed, a beautiful plot. Thus, the outset of this movie is simple but meaningful, and the result is for the better part fine, humorous, and even touching at times. A few of the stories are devised in an exceptionally ingenious manner. One example: The whole movie is set in Britain, where an ordinary young man babbles away about going to the States, because there, he claims, he'll find girls who are willing to sleep with him. His friend is very skeptical about the likelihood of success in this project. The young man buys a ticket anyway, and the outcome of that trip is skillfully staged, though it should not be revealed here.
There are a few major flaws in the movie too: (1) You just don't choose Hugh Grant for the role as PM of Great Britain - unless, of course, your POINT is to avoid credible characters; (2) The fine understanding of everyday situations is generally ruined towards the end of the movie, when all the subtle portraits of everyday 'love situations' is hastily merged into a paradisiac mass hysteria.",Love Actually

Don't give me that rubbish about this being a fantasy : it's a compilation of the most sordid and vulgar aspects of city life in luxurious and godless decline, cameo'd together with slick , slimy and cynical one-liners that we are somehow expected to find funny.There is no justification for a film like this : ""American History X"" could justify its violence because it was necessary as a context to a powerful, ennobling message ; ""Eyes Wide Shut"" portrayed sex in such a way as to show us its dangers and to contrast it with authentic, self-sacrificing Love. Curtis' film has no such artistic purpose, except maybe to prove that no-one ever lost money by underestimating public taste.",Love Actually

I believe not. nowadays, its hard to see a film which has more than a story worth mentioning and more than a few character. That what i do love about this film, you've got all those people and backgrounds and classes and visions; also such emotions like hate, fun, friendship, trust, lust, lost and love melted within a cleverly simplified story telling.

431,rainegrewal,More relevant now than 15 years ago when I first saw it ... (spoilers),9,20 January 2018,"So I watched this at the theatres when it first came out, with my sister and our children (ages 7 to 11) and in the third row from the front. Obviously last minute pick. At that time, I enjoyed it, found it entertaining. Didn't care for the Martin Freeman (naked stand-ins) story line - then mostly due to the fact that we had our children with us! So now watching it at home, 15 years later, I'm floored by how relevant this movie is--I still don't like the MF story line though. The acting is superb, the writing is good, the direction is on-point. Re-watching it, what surprised me is the story line with Hugh Grant. When I first watched this, I thought the character of the American President seemed over-the-top and unrealistic, but as I watched it tonight, I could not believe it! Billy Bob Thornton as the American President was playing Donald Trump. Wow!Overall, I thought the movie captured the ""agony of love"", all its pitfalls, its joys, its mundaneness and its reality. If you have never watched this thinking it ""another rom-com"", give it a chance. It has aged well.",Love Actually
432,daryl_s,Simple a really nice movie,8,23 April 2004,"In terms of the romantic comedy I believe this one will stand the test of time. I am not sure if romantic comedy really is the best classification for it, it isn't your typical boy meets girl with goofy situations inbetween, it has more of a humanistic quality to it (as much as you can get and still make it marketable....hey, they do need to sell movie tickets after all!).This film is a mixture of several different stories about different people (each loosly connected to one another) and their experiences with love. It is surprisingly un-schmoltzy for the subject matter and does keep your interest for the full 2 hours.Watch for a great cameo by Rohan Atkinson doing what he does bestRating: ****",Love Actually
433,geneticjackhammer_316,"Love @ Christmas = A film that makes you feel ""Great Actually""",8,5 July 2005,"Apart from the sequence with Colin Frissell going to America in the hope of getting laid and Jamie Bennett writing his book in France, this film is set in Britain, starting five weeks before Christmas and leading up to it. Hugh Grant as a Prime Minister willing to stand up to the USA is a little bit unbelievable, but let's face it, he'd probably make a great PM in real life (especially if he can dance like that through No. 10). I found the storyline with Liam Neeson a bit depressing as he had just lost his wife, but every film needs strong emotional story lines like that one, and it effected me a lot because I have been through similar circumstances myself. Colin was fantastic, even though I'm sure Kris Marshall was similar to Nick in My Family and doesn't want to be typecast he still put on a great performance. Rowan Atkinson had a small part, but by god it was fantastic, especially with the ever talented Alan Rickman. Whoever cast Bill Nighy and Gregor Fisher is a genius. There performances from the start where amazing and you could see that they really where manager and client, but underneath it there was a friendship as well. Alan Rickman was superb especially with his secretary coming onto him, but although all of these performances in themselves were amazing, their all couldn't of worked without just one of the story lines being involved in the film. This film is ""Great Actually"".",Love Actually
434,MidniteRambler,Potentially great film ruined,2,25 May 2004,"Series of loosely connected love stories centred upon middle-class London. We are offered broken love, unrequited love, true love and impossible longing. The tales are funny and sad, bitter and sweet, and, for the most part, wish-fulfilling a la Notting Hill, another Richard Curtis outing.The numerous stories involve the Prime Minister, an ageing rock star, a writer, a widower and his stepson and various professionals experiencing diverse but well worn crises. The ensemble acting is peerless from all involved so it is the most endearing of the characters themselves should be singled out. In no particular order there are Laura Linney's American in London held back by her brother's illness; Thomas Sangster's ten-year-old with a crush on a classmate; Bill Nighy's rock-star-of-the-year-1973; Lucia Monez's Portuguese housekeeper; and Hugh Grant's bachelor Prime Minister.This is a chequered film and has very funny highs and a couple of extreme lows. The most touching tale by far is that of Colin Firth's writer falling for Lucia Monez, despite the fact that neither can speak the other's language; and the most pointless about two actors standing in for porn stars during a film shoot. This latter thread was unnecessary and prevents the film being suitable for young children, which is a shame. But even the porn stars did not find the depths plumbed by Hugh Grant's Prime Minister when he railed at the US President at a press conference. In a film about human emotion, this trendy and crass political interjection was uncommonly lame and totally out of place. With the porn stars, this scene ruined - as in ruined - what could have been a great film. Wiser heads should have ruled and the offending celluloid excised and ceremonially burned. Sadly, it is too late and some brilliant writing and brilliant performing have been tarnished forever by four or five minutes of gormless film which should have been removed at the editing stage. What were they thinking of?Please keep your politics out of my entertainment.I have not, to date, rated a film, but this is going to be the exception. Without the Prime Minister's tirade and the porn thread: 10 out of 10. With the porn stars added: two out of 10. With the tirade: zero out of two million.",Love Actually

436,MusicaEternal,Terrible but accurate portrayal of cringeworthy aspects of British culture,1,14 March 2009,"I wanted to see this after recommende by a friend but I found it so embrassingly bad that after 30 minutes I had to leave. The problems: all too typical British stereotypes, poor one dimensional characters, the over emphasis on sex, infidelity etc and not real love, and the cringeworthy subtle anti-americanism. Plenty of foul-mouthed characters who are superficial on every level (unloveable and a cliché). It's very soap opera-ish and not really a comedy. This film made me embarrassed to be British, it sort of highlights all the worst aspects of the culture here in some ways... if you'd like to see a real romantic film, try ""il mare"" or for romantic comedy try ""my sassy girl"" (Yeopgijeogin geunyeo).

437,KatieB181997,I actually loved this film,8,18 August 2014,"This is the perfect romantic comedy to watch at Christmas or, in my opinion, at anytime. The film is set five weeks before Christmas and tells several different stories that involve different kinds of love, so there is something for anyone. There is also a great British cast list, including: Hugh Grant as the new Prime Minister who falls in love with Martine McCutcheon's character who has just started working for him; Liam Neeson who, after losing his wife, helps his stepson to win the girl he loves; Colin Firth who, after finding out that his brother is sleeping with his wife, goes to France to write a book and falls in love with his housekeeper but there's a language barrier as she's from Portugal; Emma Thompson who has to stay strong even though her husband, played by Alan Rickman, is having an affair with one of his workers and Bill Nighy, who has just released a Christmas single based on Wet Wet Wet's song 'Love is All Around' replacing the word 'Love' with 'Christmas', and it's about him promoting his single but in the worst way possible. In my opinion, I loved each story, the actors were all brilliant, there were plenty of laughs throughout and I loved the random cameos from the likes of Ant & Dec and Rowan Atkinson. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that's a fan of romantic comedies and doesn't mind a bit of cheesiness.",Love Actually

But this movie has something about it that makes it a decadent pleasure every year. I've watched it at least 10 times and enjoyed it every time. It's a movie with real heart, positive sentiment throughout, oozing with love stories, laugh out loud humour and so many sub-plots and interesting characters that you're constantly swept along trying to keep up with the action.

Girl has a mentally retarded brother to take care of and doesn't have time for a relationship.2.  Guy has hots for his secretary and gets caught by his wife.Both of these people don't end up happy.Everyone else who lives in make believe land of Everything works out no matter how improbably.

That made me gag and then everything afterthat was really hard to choke down.  This movie has no real grasp on love just a commercial vision of what people think love is like...

445,Alea Intrica,Workplace love?,9,30 November 2003,"Having scanned over 60 or so user comments, I find it odd that I appeared to view this movie very differently from most people.It's not a typical romantic comedy, but obviously borrows heavily from the genre in terms of feel and what several have termed ""cliches"".  It self-conciously borrows those cliches and jokes about them more than once. 
Several people have complained of shallowness and lightness.  Most romantic comedies focus deeply on one, occasionally two couples.  We watch a long progression of their relationship and the various obstacles they encounter. Sometimes it's done well, but it's been done to death.  I sometimes wonder if Meg Ryan doesn't have someone in a backroom photocopying scripts and changing the names around.This movie pulled the camera way back to look at a ""sample"" of love. There's no time for drawn out development of each picture, but we see all the elements spread out over the whole set.  Not every love story in life is a tragedy and not every one a fairy tale, but you can bet all the possibilities occur in life.  I found this refreshing compared to the standard fare and loved it throughout, although there were some weak patches in there.*** VERY, VERY MINOR SPOILER ***Lots of people are complaining about how some of the stories (particularly the naked couple) are too silly, or insignificant or not funny.  They were jokes.  A whole sub-story.  One joke.  Bloody brilliant.  A bit expensive in terms of screen time, but I loved them.Finally, the thing that struck me very early in the film was that most of the stories were about situations where there is clearly some workplace relationship or difference in power that throws some uncertainty and tension into the situation.  In today's society, we're very worried about sexual harrassment in the workplace, and rightly so, but there's no doubt that the resulting restraints are probably killing some healthy romances that might flourish if people were a bit more relaxed and open.  I think Curtis was pointing this out (the naked couple is hilarious to me as the uttermost extreme) and suggesting that love needs to be given a chance, even if there's some risk.    Would you talk to your boss about love?  Your kid? The person who sits at the next desk?  Maybe you should.  I saw this as one of the main messages of the film.  Evidently I'm alone. :)*** NO SPOILER FROM HERE ***Looking for depth?  Try breadth instead, it can be quite as interesting. Looking for messages?

I saw this one simply because I had a coupon and I'm grateful that I did. At the holidays, some of us need to see a sweet, unrealistic, feel good movie and this is the ultimate sweet movie for me. I'm hardly a romantic. Maybe it's the fact that it's made by the guys from Blackadder, but it really hit a spot with me. It's cheesy and unrealistic, but damn if this isn't one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in ages. I'm an automatic fan of Bill Nighy after seeing this movie. I've heard the phrase ""scene-stealer,"" but never really understood it until seeing this guy in action. All in all, this is not a great movie.

448,sattaravy,A Truly Remarkable Film About Love,10,5 March 2007,"When I've saw the trailer of this film I thought it was going to be one of those typical Hollywood love films, especially since the fact that it involves actors like Hugh Grant and Colin Firth.But I was way wrong.This film look at love through another point of view. The plot is unrealistic yet it is believable, unlike many other romantic films. This film catches my attention from the beginning to the end, and although it has its flaws, I really enjoyed it and I am confident to say that I've never ever seen a romantic film so unique: It mix sweet love, comedy, tragic and bitterness all in one, with an overwhelming emphases on love, it's main core.The stories that are, in my opinion, the flaws of the movie are the one involving two porn-movie stars (what's the point?) and the insistence of love between two very small kids (un-touching and also unbelievable). But as these were relatively minors sub-stories, it doesn't destroy the movie. The other stories are simply fantastic and enjoyable. Bill Nighy did an outstanding job and he turned out to be one of the most enjoyable character (from an audience point of view) in the movie, and his story with his manager is both funny and touching. Hugh Grant is another scene-stealer and his little speech was outstanding, and although a real Prime Minister will not behave in any of the things he's done in the movie (unless he/she want to create a big international crisis), it does add hugely to the entertainment value of the movie (which is all I care). Emma Thompson plays arguably the only tragic story in the movie and did an outstanding job (she's so good that it's amazing she wasn't nominated for any major awards). Other stories were great too, I won't go over them in detail but this movie is a very under-rated yet an extremely well-made masterpiece. 9.9/10!",Love Actually

Therefore viewing the trailers and TV ads for ""Love Actually"" didn't quite resonate with this self-proclaimed pessimist.  But like George Constanza, the title kept singing out to me: ""By...Mennen.""  (""Seinfeld"" fans will know what I'm talking about.) Forgive me as I digress, but after the week I had, I needed some fluff to get my spirits up.  This movie absolutely did the trick.I like movies with pace.  However, multiple storylines can sometimes slow things down.  ""Love Actually"" kept paced with each plot point and there were no ""throw-away"" scenes.  (ATTENTION: PLOT POINTS REVEALED!!)I would like to have seen some resolution between Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman's characters.  Confronting infidelity is always tough.  And Laura Linney's romance needed to play out more of the awkwardness that can develop from a failed office fling.  But overall, I could take something, albeit light and airy, from each story.As stated previously, I am a pessimist.  But a movie like this makes me hopeful that people can find that special someone even if it is in an unconventional way.  This movie was worth the eight bucks, I'll probably see it again, and I will definitely buy the DVD.  Have an open mind and see the movie for what it is: an escapist's dream.Metrosexuals unite!!

452,ceche,Outstanding Christmas comedy.,10,10 October 2009,"I confess I've always admired Richard Curtis's typically British sense of humour and shoulder to shoulder story lines (""Four weddings and a funeral"" and ""Notting Hill"", amongst others) . This film is the ultimate finish line in that direction: firstly, because there is not one trace of soppy dialogue; secondly, because the restraints of political correctness are finally let go of, while the film retains a certain air of mischievous courtesy (the US president's visit to London is quite memorable); finally, because Curtis has always been a mastermind in bringing to the screen collective views on rather diverse themes, by allowing each character to have its own voice and portraying each one with the right dose of wit and affection, and, from this point of view, the film holds in perfect balance nine different story lines (ten including the one which was left on the cutting room floor). Some stories are funny, others sad, others happily resolved and all are, in one way or the other, related, heart-warming and memorable. The cast is solid and it includes some rather high profile actors, amongst others Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Bill Nighy, Keira Knightley, Laura Linney, Billy Bob Thornton and Rowan Aktinson (watch out for his cameo appearance, it's hilarious). Then of course there is also Hugh Grant, at this point one of Curtis's faithfuls, playing Britain's PM in a more disillusioned and less vacant fashion: his improvised dance inside official quarters, with the beat of Sister Sledge in the background, is outstanding.",Love Actually
453,suntorytime10,"Learn how to play the game, it's easy....",8,26 November 2003,"""Four Weddings,"" ""Notting Hill,"" ""Bridget Jones."" Is there anything else comic writer extraordinaire Richard Curtis has yet to accomplish? Well I suppose I could try directing. Seems like the thing to do. For his fourth, and ultimately most important Brit comedy, he treads on the directing techniques that have made people like Robert Altman and Woody Allen infamous, and tries to unravel the riddle that plagues millions everyday: Love. ""Love"" follows nineteen people living in and around London. We join them in the run up to Christmas (December, not mid-October), and all are at a crossroads in life, seeking their next step. However, before they can, the jolly, holly holiday proves that even falling for your tea lady doesn't mean all hugs and kisses, and as Santa gets closer, every one of them begins to wonder whether love actually is all around.So confident in this multi-layered, multi-characterised and self-penned premise, that Curtis decided that this would be his directorial debut. Even star Colin Firth was nervous for him when he announced he would be directing. Nevertheless, he discounts any such pressure by making this a rather impressive debut. Intelligently opting for an effective, rather than mesmerising direction allows Curtis to pay more attention to his script, than try to win plaudits for making the film look stunning, and could ill-afford to be over-ambitious on the flair front. With so many stories intertwining and running parallel to one another, it looked on paper, enormously problematic, but with his typical wit and heart, Curtis manages to orchestrate the bulk with surprising assurance and ease. However, there are those stories that unfortunately do not work because of this: Kris Marshall's `life-defining' trip to the States seems rushed; Linney's brother sub-plot is annoying, and tramples on an encouraging story with her and dreamboat Karl; and the love triangle involving Knightley lacks bite and real emotion. Nevertheless, the daring of the plot is not hindered, and the film does not suffer too much.It's the truly exceptional cast though who really make the film dazzle. Grant steals the film, his boyish charisma and impeccable comic timing as good as ever. In addition, Firth's typical magnetism is a delight; Nighy is hilarious as an aging rocker, and old timers Neeson, Thompson and Rickman are as accomplished as you would expect. In addition, Linney and Knightley are as luminous as ever, and Atkinson's magnificent cameo is the film's funniest moment. Even more surprising is the debuts of McCutcheon and young Thomas Sangster. Both look surprisingly assured and confident in their integral roles, and holding their own against the rest of this phenomenal cast.At times during the film, Curtis' does overdo on the `sickly' side, and at times teases his audience into thinking this will be your stereotypical Christmas flick. But he restrains himself, and never lets the love flood the astuteness and intelligence of the story, and in tandem with his unfailing cast, execute a warm, cosy, hilarious and perfectly performed film, which if not a main present for everyone, must a least be a stocking filler. ****",Love Actually

I could have done less with the two sex-scene stand-ins (cute couple though they were), and the Brit who went to America, especially given the 2 1/2 hour length... but the other stories were all fantastic.Glad i bought the DVD.",Love Actually
462,fieldy,worst movie ever,1,31 August 2007,"Conclusively, without doubt, undeniably, unmistakably, unquestionably and irrevocably THE worst movie I have ever seen in my life.The only reason I was able to sit through it is that I couldn't look away from this horrific car crash that injured so many fine actors (not to mention a handful of appalling no-names).On the few occasions that my nausea subsided, it was brought back with a vengeance by the unbelievably bad music selection, the piece de resistance being the primary school's blood-curdling rendition of Mariah Carey's 'All I Want For Christmas'.Every time you think the film can't get any worse, it somehow manages to, which is quite a mean feat I must say...",Love Actually

The movie Family Man tried to be the ""It's a Wonderful Life"" for the new millennium, and failed because it tried too hard to be value conscious, epic and mystical. Love Actually is not a sweeping epic about the value of kindness and compassion, it is a movie that just tries to be entertaining, but manages to remind us that no matter how alone we feel; there are people who care about us and that Love, actually is all around us.There are wonderful performances by Bill Nighy, Hugh Grant and Liam Neesom. And if it is important to you there is some female nudity.The score is great, it moves at a quick pace, and will give you joy no matter how tired and listless you may feel.",Love Actually
464,johnginn,"Actually, it's not good",1,10 June 2004,"Just caught this one on DVD. It's one of the most self-indulgent, overdone movies I've ever seen. A huge, nearly formless, undisciplined mess. There are scenes in here that, if viewed as short clips, are kind of funny and work fairly well, only to have every shred of their credibility leeched away by director Richard Curtis with some unbelievable and patently false follow-up moment.The result is that characters move from the realm of real, identifiable people to soulless plot monkeys in the flicker of a few frames and a music cue. This is not the fault of the actors, who struggle valiantly to connect to their characters, but they are all eventually undone by Curtis' desperate preciousness.How can Curtis be praised for his humanistic touches when he absolutely refuses to allow his characters to exist as real people?Horrible plot thread example No. 1: Within a five-week period, a writer, (Colin Firth) is betrayed by his girlfriend and brother, goes to France to write a book and falls in love with his Portuguese house keeper with whom he's had only the barest of conversations due to a language barrier; he finishes the book, learns enough Portuguese to ask her to marry him - all while never once seeming to be in any sort of anguish or psychic pain due to the betrayal...Wrong! False! LIE! This relationship is DOOMED! It's fraught with delusion and warning signs; and yet Curtis insists that its all cute and evidence of the wondrous mystery of love.Horrible plot thread example No. 2: Within the same five-weeks, Liam Neeson buries his wife, is told to `move on' by a friend, and apparently seems to have done exactly that in meeting a Claudia Schiffer look-alike (played by Claudia Schiffer, how precious) at his son's Christmas pageant. So any of you out there mourning the death of a wife or husband, the message here is that if you haven't paired up again within a few scant weeks, just get over it and move on. It's been a whole month already and you are boring us all with your `grief,' which Curtis would seem to define here as self-indulgent blah-blah-blah. And for you others out there, if a friend or relative is dealing with the death of a partner, you are, by Curtis' logic, probably entitled to start mocking them within a few weeks:`How's it going, Joe?'`Not so good. My wife died a few weeks ago. The house seems so empty.'Then you come back in that high-pitched mimic voice. `The house seems so empty. The house seems so empty! Well cry me a freakin' river!'I could outline more plot threads just as horrible, but why bother? Suffice it to say that it is a sorry state of movies when I can recognize deeper and truer levels of humanity in Ron Perlman's Hellboy character than I can in any of the people here (barring the Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson story thread; they survive relatively well).The more I think about `Love Actually,` the angrier I get. It lies and lies and lies about human nature. The fact that it is rated as high as it is on this site depresses me as deeply as the movie itself did.",Love Actually
465,Draykov,"""Feel good"" film that is funny, optimistic and grounded in reality.",7,16 August 2004,"Many of us have probably been fans of the writing of Richard Curtis for some time, though we might not have realized it. Blackadder, Bean, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, Bridget Jone's Diary...his resume is extensive.In Love Actually, Curtis takes the next step, as this film is his directorial debut and I'm pleased to say it doesn't show. I hate to use the ""feel good movie"" cliché, but this is one film where the description applies in a way that seems more sincere than the typical ""spend some money at the theater this Christmas"" pitch. Love Actually is a beautiful story with many interesting and lovable characters. It's full of humor, emotion and damn fine acting. The film boasts a star-studded cast that really is put to good use. All of the characters on screen have unique, human traits that make you truly interested in what happens to them. No one actor gobbles up the scenery, though this may merely be because each character has their own unique story to tell. The music in the film is top notch (both original score and tracks from well known artists), and really lends itself to the mood of the film.I'm a bit of an idealist at heart, but old enough to maintain some cynicism about things (especially the money grubbing bore-fest that modern movie making has become to a large extent), and I found this film to be honest, refreshing and positive without seeming to be served up as pap to satisfy the masses.

Much too long with at least three too many storylines, several of which are poorly developed and realized. Basically a silly movie poorly written by silly people way out of touch with the rest of humanity. However, one or two of the storylines [e.g., Liam's stepson] offer enough to give it a barely passable [thumb's up] rating.

467,blawson2010,A romantic comedy that does not suck,7,4 February 2010,"Love Actually is a British move about eight couples and their struggles with love.Like Valentine's Day, Love Actually features an a-list celebrity cast; Hugh Grant, Liam Neesan and Kiera Knightly to name a few. The plot of Love Actually is more real and down to earth than your typical American romantic comedy. Most of the character's stories are simple and you can see them in everyday life. The common issues some of these people are dealing with makes the characters more likable and makes the movie feel more personal.Grant plays the prime minister of England and falls in love with a member of his maid staff. Neesan is helping his ten-year-old stepson tell the love of his young life how he feels. Colin Firth just found out his girlfriend is cheating on him with his younger brother and moves to the country where he falls for a woman who does not speak a lick of English.At times the movie does feel a little rushed because of all the completely separate plots going on. At times it can get confusing and a lot of times viewers will be wondering why they haven't seen much of a certain characters in what feels like a long time.All the actors in this movie did a good job for how little screen time they had. Only a really talented group of actors could draw an audience into the characters and story as quick as that group did.Love Actually may not be completely realistic but it does what it aims for. It is a solid feel-good movie that does not make you cringe the entire film. This is not an artistically crafted love story, it's a simple movie meant to convey one simple idea; ""love actually is all around.""",Love Actually

It sounded like 'just another romantic comedy'... With the loads of mediocre movies my girlfriend usually likes watching (for example stuff like the wedding planner, or freaky friday) I didnt have my hopes up high. When the movie started, I heard Hugh Grant's voice and I thought ""well, this can't be all bad"". And it isnt! To be honest, it's absolutely brilliant. This movie, from the same writer as four weddings and a funeral, notting hill and bridget jones' diary, is the best romantic comedy i've seen in ages. It's quite easily better than the aforementioned movies and although the general theme (being 'love' ofcourse) is oozing from the screen, the movie succeeds very well in going beyond that. You see a lot of 'could have beens' and some sorrow as well. And that's what makes it great. Instead of just showing how great love is, it also shows the downside of making wrong decissions in love (and ways to possibly solve that)... This movie is just great and i'd watch it again today, if i could.. but that's the real downside to the movie... The DVD is still so far, far away :( It's highly recommendable for everyone though, with a great cast, good writing and directing and you will leave the theatre with a smile on your face!

That was until I forced them to watch it. They were all deeply touched by it and one even shed tears at the end because he was just so happy that so many people had had their lives enriched by that strange emotion called love. (Bless...) 'Love Actually' isn't just yet another romantic comedy which is along the same lines as all the others: two people meet, one is already taken or shortly will be, the other goes through severe emotional turmoil and they finally realise they're made for each other. (Although I must admit, I still love them...) Many different people, all connected in some way either through family or friends, are making their way through life as you do when along it comes: love. It smacks some in the face, it sneaks along beside others, slowly creeping out until it's fully emerged.I challenge you to name an actor or actress who did not pleasantly surprise us all by delivering a stunning performance in this movie. Even Keira Knightley who seems to insist on playing the same sort of character in every single movie, must have thought about characterisation.I only have one problem with it: WHY when this movie was released, was Hugh Grant not immediately appointed Prime Minister?!",Love Actually

Life is tough, and love is very complicated, and any good romance movie (i.e. ""When Harry Met Sally.."") knows this. ""Love Actually,"" on the other hand, going with the spirit of the Christmas season (during which the film takes place), places sentimentality over realism and over-simplifies romance to what could have been the point of nausea. But somehow, the movie works. It somehow made me turn my cynicism off and buy into its many implausible moments, and ultimately really touched me. ""Love Actually"" is, in fact, one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. Not since ""American Beauty"" have I been so affected by a film. And the funny thing is, this movie could have been terrible, because of the reasons I mentioned before.

Wasting the talents of Neeson and Thompson on this dreck was sad. There was absolutely no charm in any of the story lines with the possible exception of the Colin Firth subplot which actually made me think I did not waste 2+ hours of my life. The worst story lines were the Neeson and Thompson subplots - Was there any reason why Thompson's husband's secretary(?) was in love with him or did I miss something - she looked young enough to be his daughter. The storyline was so brain numbing that I thought at first Thompson's husband was gay.The Neeson subplot was so condescending and predictable it was sickening. It was totally unbelievable to me.,Love Actually
479,likop,A bus load of characters!,10,14 November 2003,"Watching this film felt getting on a crowded bus and having talk to everyone on it! Too many stories, each one of which felt like the initial draft of the first and last chapters of separate screenplays which had been stitched together, using the general idea of ""Christmas"" as a unifying theme and to coincidentally (I'm sure) goose holiday box office revenues. The way that many of the actors involved have been circulating on talk shows, en masse, to promote the movie makes me suspect that each was given a percentage of the gate receipts in return for their participation and promotion. The movie provided a few smirks and smiles but I never really got to care much what happened to any of the characters. The story line with Firth and his Portugese cleaning lady had potential but then Colin goes back to London, learns passable Portugese in just one week, which is typical of the flaws in just about every storyline. While the stories are all light confections, the only jarring notes came when the auther/ director introduces a little anti-American left wing cant by portraying the President as a cartoonish caricature combining a groping Bill Clinton and a bullying George Bush. If I was American I would have also been insulted by the typical ""middle America"" (Idaho, I think) girls who are portrayed as attractive but empty headed bimbos always eager for a shag or orgy with anyone at anytime, anywhere. Americans don't come off looking good in this movie which is a surprise considering that the US will be it's greatest market. But then, I guess the participants are smug in the belief that the average American theatre goer isn't sophisticated enough ""to get"" the inside joke.

However, recently I gave this film a second chance and I was glad I did.The film essentially contains eight different romantic comedies. The positive side of this is that there should be something for everyone. If you don't enjoy one story the film will skip to another one in no time.The most enjoyable storyline for me was also the most unbelievable one in the whole film. Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister and his love interest the sweet and fluffy South London maid Martine McCutcheon make an odd couple but if you suspend your disbelief they make a charming pair.If you have not seen this film yet you may or may not warm to it.

It starts out realistically enough, but then rather shakily spirals into several unrealistic love affairs. (For example, even a Yank like me can't swallow **SPOILERS AHEAD** that a newly appointed prime minister would dally with ""the help"" as shown or randomly knock on a neighborhood full of doors on Christmas Eve without the press appearing immediately.) The writers seem greatly conflicted between the realistic (Laura Linney's selfless decision) and the absurd (the Wisconsin bar girls) and have way too many relationships to tidy up within the film's running time.That said, there are moments of very clever writing and wonderful performances that make this film worth the ticket price. I would watch this movie again just to enjoy the awesomely talented cast (notably Rickman, Thompson, Firth, and Neeson) breeze through this fluff.

There's a lot of great films that have been made under this banner. Nor do I consider myself to be one of those 'serious reviewers'. But even pure entertainment needs to have basic standards, i.e. a story line, a plot, characters that you can relate to. The makers of LOVE ACTUALLY have basically thrown huge wads of cash at - and appealed to the more base instincts of greed of - some of Britain's finest acting talent: Grant, Firth, Atkinson, Nighy, etc. They have then commissioned a 2nd rate writer to concoct a collection of short stories, all of them so full of anomalies and inconsistencies that it almost beggars belief. However, it's the characters themselves that are the greatest failing in this veritable pile of junk. You can almost FEEL Mr Rickman and Mr Firth cringing as they deliver some of their lines - the terribleness of it all softened by the prospect of a very large cheque heading their way in the near future.

Comparing this movie to a lot of ""romantic comedies"" of recent times (Two weeks notice, Maid in Manhattan to name just a few), it is a welcome and positive change.

489,milareppa,Surprisingly Enjoyable,9,6 April 2004,"I hate romantic comedies. I detest them. You can list the actors I avoid watching: Hugh Grant, Sandra Bullock, Richard Gere, Julia Roberts. Romantic comedies make me cringe and I avoid them like the plague so you can imagine the foul mood I was in when I was forced to watch this film.And the introductory voice-over by Hugh Grant as we watch an airport full of people hugging made me want to commit an act of violence - either against the people who forced me to watch this film or against myself just to end the torture.Then the most unbelievably shocking thing happened. Bill Nighy and Gregor Fischer came on screen, mocking one of the most hated love songs in Britain, ""Love is all Around"" and I found myself getting sucked into the film.By the time I reached the end of the film I found myself facing the impossible, there was one romantic comedy out there that genuinely is a comedy and actually likeable. No-one was more shocked than I.Many different kinds of love are covered (although not all kinds), there's 8 storylines and the biggest cast list I've seen in a long time. Somehow, it works. You'd think it wouldn't, I know I certainly didn't.
If you're looking for a full-length story, this is not the film for you. It snap-shots the important events leading to the resolution of the couples involved, nothing more. If you want a classic romantic film, this might not be the film for you. This is funnier than most straight comedies I've seen in recent times, however (I'm just as harsh a critic of comedy films as I am of romantic films).It's not trying to be the meaning of life, it's not trying to look at the big picture. In fact, it's only trying to do one thing, and that's say positive feelings crop up in the most unexpected places or are more prevalent than people think. One of the storylines, one that is cited constantly in reviews as one of the failed storylines with a sad ending is actually bittersweet. It doesn't end with failure but the failure of one type of love in favour of a different kind.This film isn't perfect, I'll never find the perfect romantic-comedy because I hate the genre so much, for example, one of the storylines did annoy me intensely and yet ironically still made me laugh in places. However, the flaws in the film are vastly outweighed by positives. It's superficially complicated but is really a very simple film.  It makes a statement: ""love actually is all around"" then shows why it makes that statement and doesn't attempt to do or be anything else.And like the fact it covers different kinds of love, it covers different attitudes and portrayals of it - so a couple are realistic, a couple are classic fantasy, a couple are pure comedy and a couple are pure rom-com tradition.I have seen no reviewer give this film a middle-of-the-road review, and I've read many reviews. I think, in the end, Love Actually is up to the individual. It's like Marmite. You either love it or you hate it.Speaking as a cynical, misanthropic, Marmite-hating, Romantic-Comedy hating member of the human race, I actually liked Love Actually.",Love Actually

Bill Nighy's eccentric washed-up rocker is brilliant and makes a great opening scene. But unfortunately none of the other performances are in the same league.The film awkwardly straddles the divide between drama and comedy, and many of the scenes are painfully predictable. It's a rehash of Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill and Bridget Jones's Diary, with a bit of Friends cut in. There are some funny scenes, but overall the movie didn't satisfy me.

If not, I'd advise you to stay away as this was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The acting was decent and it was filmed well but, apart from that, it was terrible.The film is made up of several 'story lines' that somewhat come together at the end. Most of these stories are tired, old clichés and completely unbelievable. They have about as much connection with reality as Alien vs. Predator. A couple of scenes were fairly humorous which at least made about 2 minutes of this movie somewhat entertaining (though they certainly don't make up for the remaining 133). I've got nothing against love stories as long as they are believable and meaningful. The stories that make-up this movie are neither. They are trite, unrealistic and trivialize love instead of respecting it.",Love Actually

I admit I've seen  a lot of lovey dovey movies in my lifetime and I expected this to be no different. Boy, was I wrong. The movie is sweet and romantic without being overly trashy.  It was funny without being ridiculous. And it had a message without waving a finger in my face. Of course it is not the greatest movie of all time, and the  storyline is not really imaginative, but when all is said and done it will entertain  you and make you feel real good and remind you what's important in life. And to  tell the truth I can't remember another movie in 2003 that did that.",Love Actually
496,tukaima-2,My family's favorite,10,16 May 2005,"It's rare to find a movie that our whole family enjoys... with four amateur-avid movie fans of distinctly different age groups and tastes, we mostly end up minding our own business and politely nod to each other's favs. But Love Actually did actually got us all together on it: we loved it. You can never go wrong with love.I think what I am most impressed about this film is how it can be so diverse, so deep, so complicated and yet still keeps itself together and entertains us all. When you have a story surrounding 1 couple - sure, go nuts with their personalities inside out, go nuts with their soap drama, you got all the time in the world. But eight? eight?? Can the audience even keep up the number? Can they even remember their names?? Yet Love Actually actually still went nuts with their personalities, and their drama, and entertained us all... through an incredibly well-interwoven story and of course, the powerful acting of the great actors. Take all the money you want and try to make this movie; you can't.Most of all, with all these characters doing their own stuff, the movie's theme is unswayed - that love is everywhere and everywhere. The characters we saw during the 2 hour feature were non but a tiny subset of it all... And with so many different *kinds* of chemistries, so many different contrasting, even conflicting types of affairs, it makes a very rich experience that you cannot find in most other ""single dimensional"" romantic movies. Go get yourself some love today.",Love Actually
497,harinjani,One-Time Watch for People Not About Plots,3,6 January 2020,"A decent movie, with no huge ups and down. The movie basically explores different facets of falling into love or being in love with someone. If you are looking to watch something of consequence, then watch Interstellar which has a similar take-home message of ""Love transcends all"", but a solid plot, beautiful screenplay and an engaging adventure. This is probably an intertwined story which observes the relationship dynamics or love interests of a group of friends.I, wished to watch the film, because of the enchanting starcast with prolific veterans like Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson, Martin Freeman and Keira Knightley. But, I would say, the huge starcast actually backfired because the portrayal was not able to create the depth necessary to engage oneself to the grassroot levels as the screentime got divided. There was no profound music which I believe is an important aspect in engaging all your senses.For me, something which was fun and really amazing to watch were the relations concerning Liam Neeson and his son. There portrayal was pretty decent and it did pull some strings. Nonetheless, I am also a huge fan of Rowan Atkinson and albeit, just for a few minutes, his excerpt was also engaging for me.For fellow Anime Watchers, if you have tried Tsurezure Children, this is quite similar to that just that this is not about teenagers. But, the depiction in the Anime mentioned, is again much more engaging.",Love Actually
498,ChristmasMovieReviews,Christmas actually is the only time you'd get away with this,6,28 November 2020,"Way back in the mid-90s it was impossible in Britain to avoid Wet Wet Wet's saccharine cover of The Troggs' Love is All Around. Thanks to its appearance in Four Weddings and a Funeral, the breakthrough movie for writer Richard Curtis, the song spent an agonising 15 weeks at Number 1 on the UK singles chart. It's a piece of baggage that Curtis seems well aware is forever attached to his name, judging by how the song's opening bars are also the backing for the opening to his directorial debut here (a film whose title appears to be a shortening of the phrase ""love actually is all around"").Here the song is repurposed as a clunky festive single for Bill Nighy's over-the-hill rocker, now titled ""Christmas is All Around"" (the torturous need to cram in extra syllables is part of the joke). It's tempting, then, to see this opening as a slightly knowing metonym for the movie as a whole: an artist whose best work may be behind him, repackaging a past hit with new Christmas wrapping in the hope that the spirit of the season of goodwill will mean giving the laziness of the whole enterprise a pass in a way audiences might not at other times of the year. And, you know what? That would both be pretty accurate and something that Love Actually for the most part does manage to pull off.The film's ensemble is impressively starry (all the more so in hindsight, given stories such as that involving Keira Knightley, Andrew Lincoln and Chiwetel Ejiofor were made before those actors hit major mainstream blockbuster success), which is good because the very slight narratives in which many of them are placed rely heavily on the actors' charm and established screen personas to sell them.Top thesps Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson are given the only storyline requiring any meaty acting in a tale of
emotional infidelity and a poignant use of Joni Mitchell's downbeat Christmas folk classic River. Curtis's Four Weddings star Hugh Grant is on autopilot in the formulaic but relatively effective story of a Blair-esque prime minister whose romance with the girl who brings his tea inspires him to give a darn good telling off to the US president (Billy Bob Thornton, playing the part as an unholy melange of Clinton and the younger Bush). Meanwhile, Colin Firth, so perfectly cast as the repressed but romantic love interest in the Curtis-penned Bridget Jones, is stuck in a plot where he doesn't share a single conversation with his Portuguese maid before proposing marriage, something the movie does not successfully sell as romantic. (And, hey, don't a lot of these stories involve older men and younger female subordinates? Weird, huh?)Laura Linney has a storyline that's potentially emotionally complex, with no easy answers, so the film just kind of forgets about it in the third act and doesn't give it any answers at all. The film is, to be honest, actually better at the kind of one-joke storylines where it really can provide an answer in a couple of scenes. Kris Marshall's plot basically has him declare that he could score with women in America in a way he can't in Britain because they'd find his accent sexy (no doubt primed to do so by years of Richard Curtis romcoms!) And then he just does. It's just one scene of setup and one of pay-off, complete with cameos from hot-in-the-2000s American starlets Elisha Cuthbert and Denise Richards. It's a simplistic gag, but at least it manages to work as intended and quickly.When it comes right down to it, though, the best thread turns out all along to have been Billy Mack and his novelty single. Nighy is full of leathery old rock star charm in an utterly winning performance. And it's not hard to buy that, in a country that has more than once propelled a sausage roll-themed novelty cover version to the top of the festive charts on sentiment and underdog spirit alone, the dreadful Christmas is All Around really could steal the coveted Christmas Number 1 slot. In a film whose love stories are mostly romantic, it's the more platonic one between Mack and Gregor Fisher as his long-suffering manager that really lands.And, just like rooting for Christmas is All Around to make it to Number 1, real world audiences will probably forgive a lot of the crassly manipulative material in Love Actually because of the charm of the performers and the fact that, hey, it's Christmas and if ever there's a time for sentimentality it's now.At the end of the day the film's biggest sin is not in itself but in inspiring a whole genre of holiday-themed multi-stranded romantic ensemble pieces, from Valentine's Day to New Year's Eve, all of them uniformly terrible (unlike the hit and miss Love Actually).",Love Actually

She is an ardent fan of Colin Firth, with Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson, and Hugh Grant only slightly behind. Both of us enjoyed ""Four Weddings"" immensely, so our expectations were high. This movie fell short of the mark, but it's still worth a look while it's still in the theaters.The ""R"" rating is, unfortunately, well deserved. The sad part is that most of the nudity and intentionally simulated sex scenes could easily have been cut without hurting the movie. Indeed, the additional time could have been used to further develop the other story lines that left one hungry for more! There are only a few such scenes -- this is not a porno film, but... Well you'll see.There are many hilarious moments in this film, blended with other scenes that make it more than just a comedy. As usual, this production company has delivered a film that tells stories that, for the most part, buck the Hollywood tradition of overly shallow and one dimensional stories.Reasons to see this film: The stars and acting company are fabulous (as you would expect! In addition to the above, Emma Thompson was fabulous as usual as well), some great laughs coupled with thought provoking depth, wonderful story-telling technique (less the process gimmick at the end -- you'll know what I mean). A little subtle magic worked in as well...Detractors: Perhaps too ambitious re: the number of stories? More magic would have been nice (and you'll know who I mean...).Surprisingly, this film's fantasy aspects seem to be more from a male perspective rather than neutral or female. Good news -- this isn't a ""Chick Flick"" (although marketing almost makes it appear to be one). Bad news -- female viewers may find themselves a bit offended and embarrassed from time to time.Still and all, don't wait for DVD/Video for this one. See it on the big screen first, then you can make the decision to rent or buy later.",Love Actually

The objection to the movie is so obvious, so crushing, and so beneficial to a critic's image that it is hard for one to resist taking a shot. I could take that route and tell you that there are too many plots, that some of them don't work as well as others, that it is filled with clichés. However, to do so would be to completely ignore the fact that I honestly enjoyed this movie more than I've enjoyed a movie in a very long time. It is funny, sweet, poignant, and lovely. It tells every story in installments, and that's exactly how those stories should be told. The structure, while easy to object to in theory, is brilliant in practice.

504,ZweiBlumen,Much better than expected,8,11 November 2003,"I walked into this film thinking it would be a typical, sappy, holiday romantic comedy. I was not entirely wrong, but to my surprised I actually enjoyed this movie a lot. It follows the interconnected lives and misadventures of several couples around London, in an attempt to show that love exists everywhere. An impressive cast gives an equally impressive performance, the dialogue is well-written and funny (though there's a lot more profanity than you'd find in the typical Hollywood holiday fare), and the movie itself ranges from hilarious to heartwarming to sad. Strangely enough, this last fact is what has made my enjoyment of the movie less than complete; it seems that it doesn't quite know which direction to take. One moment it's a fairly standard romantic comedy (the Prime Minister's love interest), the next it's an oddball teen comedy (Colin's trip to America and the results thereof), and just when you're laughing and enjoying yourself, it turns all sad and serious with Emma Thompson's character confronting her adulterous husband, and Laura Linney's life being controlled by her mentally challenged brother. Some would argue that this adds depth, but I believe the movie would have worked better if it were more consistent in its genre and atmosphere. Still, this is one of the more enjoyable films I've seen recently, and it does end on a pleasant note, making it a perfect ""feel-good"" title for the holidays.",Love Actually

Well, I hit the nail on the head when I bought a ticket to see Love Actually. Love Actually is such a unique movie, with a unique script, cast, and even the way it is filmed.  Richard Curtis did an excellent job in both writing this movie and directing it. Hugh Grant is the man I hate to love.  In this movie he was on target as the lovable and down to earth prime minister.  This is one of Hugh's strongest roles in the past few years.  I think the thing that made this such a strong role was that he had such amazing chemistry with Natalie (Martine McCutcheon).  That was the love story in this movie that I most looked forward to seeing.  I wasn't that interested in the love story between the two porn star stand ins or the young man who travels to America to find girls.  But there were some really strong performances and plots in this movie I just fell in love with. For one --- I loved Daniel (Liam Neeson) with his stepson Sam (Thomas Sangster).  Also the relationship between Sam and Joanna (Oliva Olson) was cute.  Oliva Olson also had such a great singing voice for such a young girl too. Secondly --- the cameos in this movie are great without being shoved down your throat... like Denise Richards and Shannon Elizabeth's cameos. Third --- great acting from Grant, McCutcheon, Neeson, Sangster, Olson, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, and a few others.  Keira Knightley fans may be disappointed because she doesn't get much screen time for this movie. Overall, this film was just a great romantic comedy.  Yes, it's long, but it is worth checking out.  A chick flick, uh huh.  But even my guy friend told me ""this was one of my all time favorite movies"" and he wasn't being sarcastic.  He really really liked it.",Love Actually

I think that's one of the good points about this movie, ever story doesn't turn out perfectly in the end.  There is something here to appeal to everyone.  Some love-at-first-sight romance (Colin Firth), some young puppy love (Liam Neeson's character's son), a wedding (Keira Knightley), a best-man/best-friend who loves the bride, an almost affair (Emma Thompson), platonic love (character: Billy Mack), an unrealistic but hilarious bit about and English guy (character: Colin Frisell), who heads to America looking for sex/love, and a funny bit about two sex-doubles in meet on the set of a movie and get married shortly after, and a charming story about the prime-minister (Hugh Grant) who falls in love with his ""catering manager"". Personally I thought this was the best story and I wish there was more of it.  Martine McCutcheon was HOT and I got a bit annoyed that they kept referring to her as ""chubby"" in the movie.  Hugh Grant was great in this role.

I wish Curtis had been brave enough to simply let the stories play out--some happy, some sad, some devastating. Instead, it's all tied up with a big, shiny, unrealistic bow...not what I'd expect from him. My favorite subplots were Linney's, Kiera Knightly's and Collin Firths...until Firth's morphed into a Broadway musical act-ender. Ridiculous. Liam Neeson's tale started interestingly enough, but soon suffered the fate of Firth's. If you want a film with interwoven characters behaving as human's truly behave... rent Altman's ""Nashville"".

512,tracytucciarone,"Bad, and Not in the Michael Jackson Sense",1,29 December 2016,"What a cast, and what a waste of their talents and our time. Every single relationship in this movie -- but for one -- was not only shallow and outright inappropriate, but didn't ring true at all.A man who just lost the love of his life, his very wife, just days ago, suddenly falls in love with someone else. And his 7-year old son -- who, of course, acts like a world-weary 30 year old -- doesn't grieve the loss of his mother because he's too hung up on some chick he's never spoken to. The father and son's little recreation of the bowsprit scene from ""Titanic"" is so bad, so stupid and contrived, that I actually laughed out loud. ""How'd that bit come about?"", I asked myself. ""Now, son, you stand in front of me and hold out your arms. I'll stand behind you and hold out my arms. When Winslett and di Caprio do the same in the movie we're watching, we'll feel like we're flying!"" Chyeah. Pure goofery -- as was the father's saying to the kid, upon hearing that the boy is in love, ""Who is she? Or he?"" Shouldn't he have covered *all* the angles? It's almost 2017, man! What if the kid is a pedophile, zoophile, cougar-chaser, furry, or necrophile? And what about that oh-so-bigoted use of classical pronouns? Pops should've asked his boy, ""So, who is she, or he, or zhe, or zhim, or the mature woman, or the critter -- alive or stuffed -- or the corpse, or whatever is the object of your affections? Tell me all about zhem, son (you mind if I call you son? Is there another word you'd prefer?)!"" Our world is Brave and New, and the statistically rare must be treated as the norm these days or someone might feel left out and start carrying a sign! They might even cry! Eh, if they do a remake, they'll likely handle that already ridiculous scene that way. And the critics will thumbs-up it all, as they did with this piece of crap.The little kid's affair results in the standard ""chase her down at the airport before she boards that plane"" trope, too, with the kid flying by security and setting himself up for a serious smack-down by whatever TSA types are called in England. His Dad smiles. What a good Dad.Anyway, then there's the guy falling in love with a woman he was completely unable to speak a single word to because they don't share a common language. He didn't just develop a crush; he proposed to her -- without having exchanged a single sentence! That's some good thinking right there! Now, I'm very far from the type to throw the word ""misogyny"" around, but sometimes the word fits, and this movie is full of it. Women are nothing but bodies in this flick -- and a perfectly lovely woman is treated like some obese freak of nature just because she isn't a size 2. She's probably a size 8, but even that is just too much flesh for a woman to carry around and get away with. The same name-calling happens to another female character as well.Then there are social and power differentials in this flick's relationships that make them legally questionable and morally iffy. Bosses going after their secretaries, men going after their maids, etc., and worst of all, marital status means absolutely nothing -- not even when it comes to a woman who's been married less than a month! Seriously, this movie is nasty. All the men ended up happy and better off in the end, but any women who'd already celebrated her 30th birthday is S.O.L. One was strangely written off romantically because she has a brother who needs psychiatric care. Another was written off because her husband fell in love with someone younger, and it was his adulterous union that got the script's ""awwww, ain't that sweeeeet?""treatment. Never mind the forsaken wife. She'll manage, I guess. Lesson Learned: ""Cheating pays! (if you have testicles)."" The only relationship that wasn't nauseating was the one involving the rock star and his manager, and, thank God, it wasn't a romantic one. Love Actually Part II would likely change that.For realz, if you have a sense of decency and a low tolerance for totally unrealistic schmaltz, skip this load o' tripe unless you're in the mood to hate-watch something. And even then, please don't pay to see it. Don't support stuff like this and maybe they'll start making better movies someday.",Love Actually
513,shaifalihere,The movie makes you feel all cosy and cuddly from the inside. Love Actually is one movie you'll actually love!,8,5 January 2014,"With charming cast, beautiful selection of songs, sweet romantic stories of five couples, perfect background scenery, the movie makes you feel like any romantic movie is supposed to make you feel- cosy and cuddly from the inside. It's a story about different kinds of love, and how the lives of ten people move forward because of the spirit of Christmas, for it is the time to be with the people you love. It is a fun, cute and emotional movie. Love Actually (2003), directed and written by Richard Curtis, has a mix of feelings at places unexpected and all sorts of love explored. Love of companionship of a famous singer for his chubby manager, a craze of American girls for boys with an English accent, unrequited love for one's best friends' wife, agony of innocent love of a six or seven year old for his classmate, love of a caring sister for his unwell brother, the love between two people who do not understand each other's language, the movie is a great watch at Christmas time, or otherwise!The movie has a lot going on from the moment it begins, but manages to give time to and capture each story without making it seem hurried or cluttered, like New Year's Eve (2011) with a similar plot by Garry Marshall.Soothing and at the right pace, the background music keeps the romance, tension, urgency, love or fun alive at appropriate moments. Olivia Olson's ""All I want For Christmas is You"", ""God Only Knows"" by The Beach Boys at the very end, and ""Both Sides Now"" by Joni Mitchell are a few of the many perfectly-suited-to-the-scene songs in the movie. Also, when The Silent Night plays in the background, the movie reaches an epiphany, heartening moment. Another movie with an absolutely amazing playlist selection is Morning Glory. Any and every scene is no less than a picture-postcard picture. Beautiful scenery, Christmas décor and celebrations and the royal houses, etc would remind you of the picturesque scenes of Serendipity.One of the airport scenes at almost the end reminds me of the ending of Chalte Chalte, though there are more than a dozen movies with a cliché-d airport ending. But not to spoil it for you, this one is much different, and definitely better and comic, at the very least. The cast selection is profound. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth, the couple who reminds everyone of the most romantic and girly movies of all times, based on Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones's Diary raises the expectations from them even higher. Keira Knightley portrays beautifully a character of a girl unaware of her husband's best friend's love for her. Emma Thompson comes across as a very believable character and Rowan Atkinson as Rufus, is remembered despite just his two, but very important to the plot, scenes. Thomas Sangster as a small kid of just 6 or 7 years old plays the character beautifully and stays in our hearts. This one, in high resolutions, is definitely worth occupying a large chunk of your hard drive.",Love Actually

A film with an amazing cast that outperform their American colleagues from the mediocre film Valentine's Day.The characters are at some way all connected to each other and have their own love problems. Hugh Grant plays the most important character: the British Prime Minister, who fancies one of his employees. His sister Karen (Thompson) has problems in her marriage once she finds out her husband Harry (Rickman), has bought a necklace for someone else.. In the meantime she helps Daniel (Neeson), a father who has just lost his wife. His son Sam goes to the same school as Karen's children, and falls in love with an American girl. Colin Firth's character Jamie finds out his wife is cheating on him with his brother on the wedding day of his friends Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Juliet (Keira Knightley). This leads him to France, where he falls for his Portuguese housekeeper. In the meantime Juliet finds out that her husband's best friend Mark (Andrew Lincoln) has a huge crush on her. I can continue but it's way more fun and more clear when you find out yourself how everyone is connected!Because of the connection between the different characters, the romantic, dramatic and more comic story lines are woven through the entire film. Therefore the film is not overly romantic nor dramatic. The film is perfectly in balance and there are more than one funny moments. Almost every character gets their happy ending, and therefore Love Actually is the ultimate feel good film. Every character is different, is in an other life phase and his its own problems. It's because of this better to empathize with the characters. Love Actually is also timeless, since Christmas is of all times and a lot of people are celebrating this event. Like I mentioned before, the film starts three weeks before Christmas with a nice message from Grant's character: Love is all around. During this period the film works towards a moment when all the characters find their love and happiness. But before Christmas the adults still need to go to work, children have their school performances, Christmas parties are organized, presents are being bought, and there is a wedding. In the meantime singer Billy Mack (Bill Nighly) is working on a comeback by making a Christmas song. At the end of the film all seems to be well. However, the older couple has to work on their marriage but even that seems to end well. For variation, the film doesn't only take place in London. After Jamie (Colin Firth) learns about the infidelity of his wife, he leaves for his home in France to write a book. This is the place he falls in love which eventually takes him to Lisbon. Kris Marshalls character Colin goes even further, since he thinks America is the best place to find a woman. Despite of his buddy's doubts Colin leaves and eventually returns with two women!Love Actually is the perfect film to end the month December and start a new year with lost of self-confidence. It's a very romantic Christmas film, but because of the many characters and story lines, the balance between romance, drama, comedy is perfect. The characters are at some way all connected to each other, but are all very different and in other life phases. This makes the film more interesting and you can emphasize better with characters. Craig Armstrong's score - and in particularly PM's Love Theme - is truly amazing and touches the very soul.",Love Actually
515,Mckenzie_Voice,"Wonderful film, very British but the comedy is universal.",10,14 December 2013,"First of all this film has to be one of the best feel good movies ever in my opinion. All of the characters are realistic enough to be believable. You will find all of these characters or a double of them in UK. The comedy does not flow all the way through continuously and there are scenes of deep realistic and sad scenes. All of the scenes flow well into one another which is difficult when you are dealing with many characters and in many different locations. They couldn't have put the scenes in a better line-up and all the actors were well chosen for each role. The Christmas Office party, the unrequited love, the office vamp, the infidelity, the love, the childhood crush, many of the things that bring this film together. A true masterpiece, unlike Valentine's Day, which seemed to be an American stab at trying to make a US version of Love Actually that didn't quite hit the mark. That's because you need some British actors to play all the American parts, that way you get the humor and the accent.It is always hard to mold many pieces of film footage together to get a marvel like this film but the beginning and the end which I believe was filmed in the arrivals lounge in Heathrow epitomizes the act of Love, Love of a lover, love of a husband, a wife, love of a son and daughter, grandparents, friends, love actually live and real and not at all faked.The film will make your Christmas feel more special, make you feel more love in yourself and the world. We are all of the human race and love is a difficult and sometimes heart wrenching business but we all have the capacity to love and although the film is a comedy with tinges of sadness, I hope people who watch this film realize, ""Love is all around"". I am not usually like this about films with love in them, so I will now retreat to a quiet place and find myself a big bucket. But you guys feel free to love this film!",Love Actually
516,illusoryjane,Actually pretty disappointing,4,29 July 2004,"I remember hearing about this movie, and thinking it was a must-see, but upon watching it, I found it incredibly disappointing. The cast is excellent, and the movie wonderfully acted. Many of my favourite actors/actresses graced the cast. The idea was good as well. It was a depiction of all the different ways in which love takes form, including, but not limited to romantic love, platonic love, and unrequited love. The execution, however, was lacking. Some characters were not fleshed out properly, and others given far too little attention. There were a few characters whose stories I failed to see the point or merit of.Although there were some fine threads connecting most of the characters, the movie on the whole seemed disjointed and jumped around far too often. Too much was going on, and I felt as though it might have worked better as a series of short films, which incidentally would have also given a unique presentation for a feature film. All in all, ""Love, Actually"" is not altogether not worth seeing. I'd recommend tuning in if you happen to catch it on cable, but otherwise don't bother.",Love Actually
517,Gator1955,"Lighten Up! Being so Serious, One Will Lose Sight of the Fact That Love Actually IS All Around!",8,19 December 2005,"There was a time when movies were celebrated for their ""escapism,"" their Capraesque ability to show simple truths...for those who weren't so jaded as to be beyond help. Example: in ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" when George crashes into the tree, the man who comes out is concerned ONLY with his ""historical"" tree, not if George is o.k. after the wreck. The man is jaded in his world view or as a friend and I refer to certain people, he is ""hopelessly lost to the world."" Thus it seems with many of the reviewers of this movie.I was taught that movies require ""a willing suspension of disbelief,"" and that absent our granting that, ANY movie can, and will, be blasted into acetate dust for being ""unrealistic,"" ""maudlin,"" ""unbelievable,"" ""insulting;"" well, you get the picture.Is ""Love Actually"" one of the best pictures of its genre, the romantic comedy? No, it's not. Is it a fun movie to watch? Yes, it is. Let go of the ""necessity"" for character development (it is a comedy after all) and let your own imagination fill in the blanks. Have we all become so intellectually lazy that we cannot invest ourselves in a film to fill in the perceived ""blanks""? I think many minimize the importance of the 9/11 reference. In a nutshell, it points out the critical centerpiece of our lives that LOVE holds when confronted with a crisis. As someone who lost friends in the Pentagon on 9/11, I think it's wonderful to read stories of those in the WTC who were able to make those ""profession of love"" calls to their loved ones before they met their end. My friends in the Pentagon were not fortunate enough to have that blessing and those they left behind have a void left because of that.Capra believed in the true essence of man and ""universal truths"" like those expressed in another, modern movie that makes a valid point about love, ""Secondhand Lions."" The ""what every boy needs to know about being a man"" speech, or at least the small piece we hear, perfectly mirror Capra's ideals and, to my mind, these ideals seem to be what Curtis was trying to convey in his movie.If adultness in the world has become such that we must tear apart and parse everything we see, read, watch, hear or feel, then we are a much poorer civilization. If we fail to note that Love Actually IS all around, then we are in far more peril of losing our core selves than we are from the peril posed by terrorists. In fact, the case could be made we are playing into the terrorists hands by abdicating our basic rights to them by letting them dominate our fears.The story lines, to me, point out the universality of love and its unpredictability. Rickman makes an error; gets caught up in the fantasy and, too late, realizes his error. However, the movie ends with the possibility of a relationship that moves into a more mature phase. Does it require reading into it to come up with that? Sure, but that's what once was the charm of movies. They weren't expected to lay everything out for the viewer; they engaged the viewer and expected them to become involved in the movie. Perhaps in this day and age, we are all too busy to do that. Perhaps in this day and age, we are all too prepared and ready to view criticism as being, necessarily, negative when the traditional definition of critique is to be seen as both positive and negative.""Love Actually"" is not the pinnacle of romantic comedies; however, it does have many redeeming qualities and has enough of that magic that elicits from us the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" that can, if we allow it, open our eyes to the possibilities. Seems to me the movie does accomplish that goal. It's light-hearted with twinges of pathos in it...if we take the time to notice.",Love Actually

Am I the only one who's noticing that Hugh Grant and Colin Firth's characters (and I suppose Alan Rickman's as well) are all falling madly for women who clear up after them and bring them cups of tea?The moment when Emma Thompson tells Rickman to be careful is very real and I wish the rest of this movie had this kind of power.,Love Actually

Smug middle class trash and one of the most manipulative films it's been my misfortune to sit through. The opening 9/11 reference was unbelievably crass and offensive and it was downhill from there. The saving grace was Laura Linney but her character just seemed to be discarded when Richard Curtis couldn't seem to contrive a way to get her back into the plot. Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson have both shown how multiple storylines can be handled to amazing effect - evoking a genuine emotional response from the audience. Richard Curtis just strings together a few popular scenes from his other scripts, desperately trying to squeeze a laugh or tear from the audience. Depressingly this is one of the most successful UK films ever - despite having little or no resemblance to any London that actually exists.

After writing the scripts for the films Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary, and Bean it is about time Richard Curtis becomes the director he was meant to be. As a big fan of Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, Emma Thompson, and Colin Firth it is wonderful to see them all in the same film.

527,scottme,"Utterly formulaic, mindless pap",2,10 December 2003,"If you've seen any other films written by Richard Curtis -- Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, etc., then you'll know what to expect of this.
Except it's nothing like as good; Curtis knows how to write stories that tug at your heartstrings, but his direction lacks the necessary discipline -- there's no real unifying plot other than that implied by the film's title, and the overriding impression is that it's a flabby, lazy effort.
Most of the admittedly stellar cast cruise along on autopilot, rehearsing roles they are already well known for or even typecast in.  The few exceptions include Bill Nighy, who puts in a creditable performance, and Martine McCutcheon, who is awkward and unconvincing.If you do decide to go and see this, remember to check your critical faculties in at the entrance to the auditorium.2 out of 10",Love Actually
528,kostas papageorgiou,"Taking it a little too serious, actually",7,14 February 2009,"The sheer number of ""best-movie-ever"" and ""total-crap"" comments left me somewhat surprised, as I never imagined this movie to be polarizing. Myself, I find it to be an extremely charming romantic comedy with a fair amount of flaws, which did not destroy my viewing (and, dare i say, re-viewing) experience. I believe the mistake made my most people who hated the movie was thinking it's a movie about Love or Relationships, while it's clearly not. It's about Falling in love, Dreaming of love, Imagining love. And it does a pretty good job at it. I mean, comments like ""he hardly knows her"", ""it won't work"" completely miss the point: it's not about whether it'll work or not, it's just th falling-in-love part - although I could do without the wedding scenes in the end. The sexism criticism is way exaggerated: the movie IS about superficiality, and the powerful man - hot young woman pattern is the most common one, and one based on superficiality. The movie doesn't glorify it, it just uses it (eg. in the Alan Rickman - Emma Thompson story). The Hugh Grant story, however, really bombed. Grant is terribly cast, the Britain-America thing is awfully cheesy, and it goes too far to convince us it's a great thing that a Prime Minister's first priority is falling in love with his assistant. It totally lacks the simplicity and charming everyday-quality the other stories have. Btw, the Claudia schiffer thing: it's a joke, people!

530,kedunlap,I'm amazed at the high ratings,6,1 May 2004,"This is a pretty good movie considering that the director took a meat axe to his original creation because he had made it 80 minutes too long. Apparently, almost all of the scenes that were to introduce us to the characters were chopped leaving a very disconnected beginning. In addition, the ending was supposed to bring everything neatly together (rather than just having everyone show up at Heathrow) with Rowan Atkinson portraying an angel who brought all of the couples together (didn't it look strange that Atkinson just happened to be in line where Liam Neeson needed him?). Not only was the angel dropped, everything the angel did (which was supposed to make it all make sense) went with it. It is hard to believe that a director could leave himself in the position of having to chop one-third of his film. It is even harder to believe that fans would give the pasted-together two-thirds such high marks. The acting, which was almost uniformly top notch, and the outstanding music made the movie look much better than the director deserved, and perhaps the story he ended up with was better than the one he wanted to make.

The film does have some very funny moments throughout the first half but then it starts to deaden out.For me, the problem is that there are too many characters so it becomes hard to feel for those characters when they conclude their stories.   This film needed to be cut down at the script stage because the film is not long enough to do the job properly and is too long to appeal to the correct audience.   While I've enjoyed their previous work (and it would have robbed us of an enjoyable wedding scene), Keira Knightley and Andrew Lincoln are unnecessary and Laura Linney's character didn't add to the film at all. It's hard to decide what they were setting out to do here.   In amongst this sprawling mess, there is a good film waiting to get out.   Scrap that - there are two good films waiting to get out of this film.   Laura Linney's tale of a woman who puts duty to her family and work before finding happiness intrigued me and could easily have been a feature on its own. The Thompson/Rickman tale of a married man who is tempted by another and the wife who knows and tries not to say for fear of breaking up her family. However, in reading those ideas again, none of these are original and that brings me onto my next point.What we have is a diluted film, held together by an unoriginal, ""It all ties together"" plot that is not to dissimilar to that of ""Playing By Heart"" and Bill Nighy played a similar, burnt-out rocker in ""Still Crazy"".   On the whole, this film is horribly unoriginal, mildly saved by half-decent comedy writing and laughs.

All the stars (and there are plenty of them!) give brilliant, memorable performances.My advice: Watch Love Actually, and let yourself be absorbed...do not attempt to pick apart each storyline for hidden meanings or messages.

Like someone said in the boards, i think it should have been more realistic. It goes way to much over the top and it almost ruins the movie.There's some really good ""serious"" scenes though. My favorite story lines were the friend of the just married couple (the scene when she sees the wedding video-- so sad, so perfect--, the cards scene, again, so sad, so heart breaking); the stand ins (the contrast between the way they are and the job they do-- too funny).

543,selfluminous,What Fun! Observing People Falling In Love,8,24 January 2006,"I have been avoiding this film, as it has been all over Central Fl's HBO 18 times a week and besides that, I was not in the mood for love, actually! However, after stumbling across Richard Curtis' (writer/screenwriter) 'The Girl In The Cafe' (limited release) I decided to give 'Love' a shot at 5:30 one morning and I am quite glad I did. (I will confess at the dénouement I was all tears.) Mr. Curtis' 'The Girl In The Cafe' is so simple (on one level) yet so complex on other levels and the main character, Bill Nighy, plays his role so understated you will not believe this could be the same actor in 'Love Actually.' Love is well enough constructed to keep together 8 'love' stories of different sorts and will pull you in, in a way you will never expect. The acting is good all the way around with some 'bright lights' shining but you will fall for them all, I promise. You do not have to be a romantic to enjoy this well crafted, surprising effort at an emotion we all suffer and welcome at the same time. You will find yourself hoping certain characters do pull it together as it changes their lives forever as love is meant to do. Where Richard Curtis draws upon his story lines in the detail he does, I cannot imagine. He observes people is the answer. Other Curtis films Americans may be familiar with are 'The Girl In the Cafe' (superb), 'Notting Hill', The Bridget Jones series, and this one,' Love, Actually.' If you have a heart and allow your emotions to surface, I promise you will enjoy this film.Whatever you do, do not take professional critics words to heart. They all seem to have serious interpersonal problems. You know if you will like a film from the exposure you are submitted to. I'll read critics but only AFTER I view a film. This film is a good case in point. Many did not like it at all and here we have a wonderful, well acted storyline.",Love Actually

545,jim_ramsden,"9 stories, 2 worth telling",2,24 November 2003,"***NOT-MUCH-TO-SPOILERS*** Okay, one story at a time in order of ascending badness. The story of an american woman (the wonderful Laura Linney) living in London whose love for a collegue is thwarted by her being constantly on-call for her mentally handicapped brother is by far the most successful thing about this film. Linney is superb, and the scenes in the mental institution are pitch perfect. This story neither tries to depress or elevate, just show. 8/10.The story of a man (Liam Neeson) whose wife has recently died and whose son is in love with an american girl at school is very cheesy, not helped by the fact that the kid is scripted with adult dialogue, but is almost saved by the sheer joy of watching Neeson float through it. This would have been a good story for the kids, but unfortunately the rest of the film is filled with gratuitous swearing and nudity, so who this film is aimed at is lost on me. 5/10.Juliet has married Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) whose best friend Mark (Andrew Lincoln) doesn't seem to like her. At first it seems he is in love with Peter, but it transpires his unrequited love with Juliet is the cause of his aloofness. This whole story seems to be building up to one scene where he does something romantic and she kisses him. Great scene, but there's nothing else going for it. 5/10.Jamie (Colin Firth) is a cuckolded writer who moves to the French countryside to work on a new book. He falls in love with his Portugese (not Russian as someone from Holland says above) cleaner (this sounds like the Hugh Grant story) despite them not speaking the same language. Good idea, great comic potential, but Curtis makes nothing of it other than a tedius love story and ENDLESS, ENDLESS non-gags where one of them says something then the other 'accidentally' says something in reply. This was due a lot of jokes and has been let down. Highlights: Firth's usual charisma and a scene where his cleaner's whole village follow him through the streets on his way to propose. 4/10.John (Martin Freeman) and Judy (Joanna Page) are body doubles who spend their days simulating sex scenes with each other, but when it comes to dealing with their mutual attraction they're too shy, except they do get together in the end. Good idea for a comedy? I thought so. Not a single joke in the whole story. As with the Firth story above, this is another example of 'comedy genius' Curtis failing to develop a promising idea into a funny story. 3/10.Karen (Emma Thompson) discovers her husband (Alan Rickman) is on the verge of commencing an affair with an employee. And that's it. What should have been the dark side of this film has nothing in it that isn't in the premise of a hundred other films. The whole story just seemed to get dropped. Where was this idea going? And why didn't it get there? 3/10.Hugh Grant as prime minister. Nuff said. Why did Thornton do this? It doesn't accuse the american government; it just insults them. And who thought Martine McCutcheon could act? This is just dire! The highlight is Grant and some bloke singing a christmas carol! And that's in the trailer!!! 2/10.Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) is an aged heroin-addicted rock star trying to make a comeback with a soppy Xmas rendition of Love Is All Around (geddit?). The funny thing is, he's really honest about what he thinks of it and this drives his manager (Gregor Fisher) mad. But they love each other really. The even funnier thing is that this isn't funny, or even competently written or acted. It's just a waste of time. The only decent line is the Britney Spears one - and again that's in the trailer. 1/10.Annoying lad (Kris Marshall) can't pull. Convinced that his Englishness will do well for him in the US, he goes there to pull. He pulls. Four women. At once. That's it. No, it's not funny. Yes, it is retarded. 0/10.Which gives this film an average of 3.4, rounded down to 3 and minus 1 for these stories not being hung together properly (some of them seem to end around the middle of the film's running time). Total: 2!Nine stories, none of which are funny, and only four of which are in any way romantic. A waste of time and talent. Linney should get her kit off for projects far worthier than this in future.",Love Actually

The couples of the writer and the maid & the two little kids is realistic and sweet. The president's love is unnatural although it's cute. The two porn actor and actress's is just so gross. Unnecessary porn. They shouldn't be there. And the ugly guy went to the U.S. and just get 3 beautiful girl on his arrival. What has the U.S. become? A third country supplying ""hen""? The movie itself is too long because of these flaws. It deserve a 5 up to this point.Now its OST and the action of the casts save the day. The song is excellent and well-fit with the movie.

549,MusicPrincessLuv,Interesting,8,7 January 2007,I enjoyed this movie. Alan Rickman is so great in this movie. I thought there were a great amount of talented actors. This movie is full of humor! Yes there is quite a lot of sex-related jokes and nudity but in todays world thats not new.It does have many different story lines. Some conventional some...not but it's good. You get different points of view and see the life of many different kind of people. I wouldn't say it's a Christmas classic but totally worth seeing. One thing I must say is not to take it too literally. It's very different and not what I expected. Filled with humor and overall good.,Love Actually
550,wyldsyd2003,"Loved it ""Actually""",9,12 December 2008,"****Spoilers ahead**** 5 years after this movie was released, I still LOVE it. Having read lots of the bad reviews, I had to comment. Seems there are many 'critics' on IMDb, some harsh wannabe Eberts out there, imho. 'LA' is a romantic comedy. I'm not sure what those who rated it so poorly, expected? Realism? A documentary? I'm puzzled. Yes, your typical rom-com is going to contain fluff, cheesy story lines & dialogue, but with a rom-com, you have to suspend your common sense & just believe! This is a movie to extract from. It's a myriad of messages about, love. And what this movie shows is, love is 'all around, actually'. I rated it 9/10, not a 10, because, yes, a few of story lines were....er...silly? An very far fetched (the subplot of the so called 'cute Brit who goes to America' in search of 'cool American babes' & actually sleeps with 4, just by being a 'cute Brit'? Not so, sorry, what were they thinking in the casting dept with that guy?? not cute!) Not to mention the stand ins for the porn movie..?? if that story line was really necessary? To omit it & focus some more on Colin Firth's character's subplot would have been a wiser choice. But again, it's not a perfect movie. If you look at the movie & analyze it, you will find that there IS truth to the movie. How? *The love of a brother from a sister (Laura Linney's Sarah is fantastic) you can FEEL her turmoil. Her need for romantic love overcome by her love & responsibility for her brother. And yes to those nay sayers....sometimes we do give up love for familial love. That happens. You're in a fantasy world if you think not. -The unrequited love of being in love with your best friend's partner. Tell me there aren't people out there who haven't fallen in love in that situation?? I'm sure that has broken up a marriage or two, considering the divorce rate... *The comfortable love faced with a mid life crisis that crosses the line into an almost office affair. Oh yeah, that's NEVER happened either. Never has a man fallen for his secretary. Nope never heard of that happening. *Then we have the Cinderella story. Prime Minister falls for 'fat, help'. I suppose love has never sprouted across social class either? Sure some of it's a bit cheesy, the happy ending where the PM & Natalie DO hook up, but, hey it is a rom-com. Hugh Grant is hilarious in his own ""Risky Business"" moment. I personally thought it was comical. *You also get healthy doses of heartbreak. Neeson's character broken hearted over the lose of his 'perfect girl/wife', Emma Thompson's character who's emotional pain is SO palpable. I know, I've been in that situation & ever so clearly, remember a very similar time of shaking my hands trying to hide that intensely crushing moment of revelation at the worst possible second. Oh yes, that's VERY real. And what is ALSO real about that sequence IS THIS..sometimes a marriage does survive a betrayal...and it doesn't fold nicely, as in ever so happily ever after.... *Falling in love across a language wall? Could happen. IN five weeks, doubtful. But,I think the message is, yes, we love, are sometimes betrayed, but we can & do, find love again in the most unusual places. (a family member of mine met his wife in Spain, during the war, married her & brought her home, & SHE DIDN'T SPEAK ANY English, NOR DID HE SPEAK ANY Spanish - they were married 30 something years & had 4 lovely children) -As for the 11 yr old, yes, while us adults KNOW that it's not 'real love' most of us have a 'first love' tucked away in our minds and hearts. And while I will admit 99.9% of us ARE not with our puppy loves, we did have one. *You also find a bit of blended love. Love between a stepfather and stepson. Under horrible circumstances (But when is that blended love not under difficult circumstances?) That story 's ending may be sugary, but it serves its purpose in the film. This movie, while not perfect, comes pretty close. Its underlying theme, the theme that if we look around us, we will see that love is all around. Between friends (just like that of Billy Mack & his manager) between step families, between co-workers, between brother sister, man & woman, new 'strangers' who meet, husbands & wives, etc. And it doesn't always have a scripted perfect ending. THAT is life.. Oh & on the 'fat' comments...I think the meaning is...fat is so often distorted, it is so often not true, & a real dilemma for those girls who think they are, when they're not..so don't knock yourself. Just because you're not as skinny as the overrated Keira Knightley, does NOT mean you're fat. I see no offense by the reference to that in the movie. Nor do I see the insult to America. The president, wonderfully portrayed by Billy Bob Thornton. It is what it is. Obviously a reference to ol Bill. Not unjust in poking fun at that one, considering it was an embarrassing happening that dominated the news for quite some time....If Britain wants to stand up to America for once, so what, big deal. Remember again folks, it's a R O M A N T I C comedy! Fabulous acting by Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman, Laura Linney, (the young boy who portrays Sam, don't know his name), and Andrew Lincoln. Don't expect heavy character development, there isn't time allowed. But that's not the point. The point is, it's Christmas, pull yourself up by the bootstraps & take a look, all around. Love is, actually all around. Just open your eyes & you won't be disappointed!",Love Actually

I have never watched a movie before that actually made me say, 'that is the worst movie I have ever seen'. That is no longer the case now. This was appalling. Completely smug, vomit inducing, politically correct crap,devoid of any merit whatsoever crap. This was a vision of hell. That says it all, but unfortunately I have to write out 10 lines before I can submit this. When I think of the classics I've seen in the past year, I think of a film like Passolini's Accattone and the gulf in class, honesty and content is embarrassing.

In reality, it's just a simple fun movie, and in that regard it succeeds admirably.  If I have any complaint, it was that after so many grand romantic gestures I started to get a little overwhelmed by all of them.  But again you can't expect to see a romantic comedy without some sort of grand romantic gesture. Overall an excellent example of the genre, and a pretty good film in its own right.",Love Actually

Usually I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies. I never choose them when I go to cinema. But I saw this film at least three times on TV and it's a perfect film for a hot cacao and a blanket. I like the music in the film. It's nicely integrated to make an important part of the atmosphere. It's several stories interlinked among them with nicely made ties. Human relations, love and care are topics that are always actual and interesting. A since everybody loves and want to be loved, you find a piece of the movie that just touches you.",Love Actually
554,slr_image,Offensive...Actually,3,13 June 2004,"I could go on about all the things I disliked about this movie, but other extremely eloquent reviewers have done that for me. However, there is one aspect of this film that has not been commented on that I wish to: Richard Curtis' alarmingobsession with weight. I work with young women, helping them to build healthy self-images, and not to buy into the unrealistic ideals that the media portray. So along comes Mr. Curtis and writes a script that continually reinforces thosenegative images. The Martine McCutcheon character, who is a lovely, sexy,healthy looking woman is referred to several times as fat. The Emma Thompson character, looking like an average, well-cared for middle-aged woman, painfully opines about the size of her bottom. I find this kind of psychological abuse intolerable and offensive, and certainly does not demonstrate any love toward women.",Love Actually

Richard Curtis uses every clichéd, over-used, underdefined character from his big book of cardboard caricatures, then gets all his tired old thesp-chums to appear in it and churn out this sugar-sweet isn't-the-world-wonderful-even-when-you-think-it-isn't rubbish - and then has the audacity to stick it in the cinemas of the world and charge an entrance fee.

557,CC1966,a charming comedy,7,28 April 2005,"Overall, I'm really glad i purchased this DVD...The stories were wonderfully written and easy to follow...a superior 'chick flick', if ever their was one. Worth it for the few brief glimpses of Rodrigo Santoro, and for the stories involving the always welcome Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, and Liam Neeson.What I'm about to say has less to do with my being an American, and more to the fact that I'm a woman who was of the understanding that I was watching a romantic drama/comedy. Was it really necessary to have yet another 'I just want to thumb my nose in the face of the US' segment? Thanks so much Richard Curtis for your brief and all too transparent 'I've-got-the-power-to-show-how-big-a-bully-that-rotten- stinking-America-is' moment...it really served no purpose in the movie at all...except, perhaps, to make you feel better. It wasn't the attempt at expressing politics that I found annoying...just how childishly it was thrown out there; that, and the fact that you used Billy Bob Thornton to represent the Chief Executive...could you have picked a smarmier persona? The whole bit seemed mean and unnecessary.Oh, but wait: then there were the stereotypes of the American women being bubble headed nymphets that live this side of porno land, and the whole story surrounding the weight of the adorable Natalie, who didn't look fat at all. Now, unless there was some sort of subtlety I missed in that storyline, I thought it was tiresome to hear everyone talk about how heavy she was...none of that made any sense to me as she looked fine...sure she was shapely, but fat? Whaaaaaa? Those were pesky smudges on an otherwise perfect little movie.I know that sounds like a great deal of negative about the film, but in all honesty it was a fine piece of entertainment...thankfully, I now have the ability to fast forward through the parts that most irritate me, which truthfully, aren't many.",Love Actually
558,Movienut88,A truly wonderful film,10,24 December 2004,"From the trailers, this looked as if it would be cute, but not astounding. It seemed romantic but not original. But ultimately it seemed like a rehash of the past Working Title romantic comedies we have come to expect year after year. With this in mind, as well as the thought of the astounding cast, which includes at least 20 well-known actors in either leading roles or cameos, I went to see LOVE ACTUALLY, expecting to see a nice and easygoing romantic comedy. I was wrong about it. Instead of just being good, it was fantastic, and exceeded all of my expectations. This movie is so romantic, so clever, so funny, and so utterly sweet that it could truly be described as the perfect romantic comedy. And to boot, it has a storyline that is sure to make you feel good about the upcoming holiday season.LOVE ACTUALLY tells a truly original tale of several love stories that occur on the streets of Britain during the five weeks leading up until Christmas. It would take too long to describe all, but there are several that receive more attention than others. For example, one involves the Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) and his adorable and sweet secretary Natalie (Martine McCutcheon). Others include a married couple (Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman) discovering marriage problems, a hidden love between a newlywed (Keira Knightley) and her groom's best friend (Andrew Lincoln), a blossoming love between two people (Colin Firth and Lucia Monz) who don't even speak the same language, an aged rock star (Bill Nighy) hoping for a comeback while realizing what is important in life, a father desperately trying to help his 10-year old son reveal himself to the love of his life and many more. The movie is so filled with love and heart that you will almost be overwhelmed. It truly is a film that shows you what love is all about.The cast is astounding. Hugh Grant once again proves he is a talented rom-com lead, and he really is likable here. Martine McCutcheon is adorable in her first major film role, playing a very sweet character the audience immediately recognizes. Colin Firth and Lucia Monz both steal the show, providing great chemistry and sweet, adorable and touching scenes. Their love story was one of my favorite parts of the film and I felt like cheering at the end when they finally got together. Emma Thompson is ASTOUNDING here as the wife who discovers her husband's planned infidelities. I'm shocked she didn't receive an Oscar nomination for her work here. In one truly heartbreaking scene, she makes the audience cry with her as she makes the discovery. Alan Rickman isn't very likable, but he gives a decent performance. Liam Neeson is very good as the troubled stepfather who wants his stepson (Thomas Sangster) to tell the love of his life how he feels. The scene where the son finally does tell the girl is one of the film's most memorable sequences. Keira Knightley is great here, showing emotional range and adding depth to her character. Laura Linney gives a cute performance as a woman pining for her co-worker. All the other actors do a great job, especially Bill Nighy, who steals the show with a lot of hilarious scenes throughout the film.Director Richard Curtis has crafted a true work of art, from the astounding cast to the wonderful and beautifully written screenplay. He has truly proved himself to me as one of the most talented men working in film today. He brings a distinct and bright vision to the film, and this really adds to the heart and soul of it. Another thing that works here is the music. The musical score in this film is fantastic. It didn't stick out to me during the first viewing, but really got to me after that. It's sweeping and romantic, and really conveys the emotion being played out on screen. I'm shocked and dismayed that composer Craig Armstrong didn't receive an Oscar nomination for his work here.LOVE ACTUALLY is a fantastic romance, but in addition it is also one of the most joyous and heartwarming Christmas films I have ever seen, possibly the best one. No film has ever made me anticipate and realize the importance of a holiday more than this one.In closing, LOVE ACTUALLY is truly perfect. A perfect romantic comedy, a perfect Christmas film and a perfect cast of characters. It's a wonderful holiday experience that is one of my all-time favorites, and I look forward to watching it numerous times throughout my life, especially on Christmas 10/10 (A+)",Love Actually
559,micahks-769-261560,Love What?,1,5 July 2014,"This movie was dreadful. After the opening scene, I lost interest. There were sex scenes that had no purpose and were supposed to be funny, but were just disgusting. The movie dragged on and had too many subplots that didn't develop, and too many people whose lives who were supposedly linked. I was forced to watch the movie with some lady friends, and I was watching the clock the whole time. British and romantic comedies were never my favorite genres, but I have watched better films within the same genre than this one. The director tried too hard and the movie was too difficult to follow and was incredibly long. The movie contained so many clichés and offensive material that I didn't even know the movie had to do with Christmas. Also the movie taught kids that love is full of lust and you always get the girl you want. In real life, there is disappointments and guess what? A seven year old boy will get over a seven year old girl. It's not the end of the world. I would have liked the movie better without the cliché's and sex scenes, and if the film had focused more on three to four families instead of twelve. I'm not a greater writer, but I could have written a better film than this. I can't believe this film won awards. I'd rather watch old family videos than this rubbish.",Love Actually

I still cant believe how Bill Nighy wasn't nominate for the Academy award for best supporting actor on this year and how Richard Curtis for his beautiful and well done screenplay! Instead they put the boring Lost in Translation between the nominees. No offense but between the melancholic American dramatic comedy I rather prefer 100% the touching, funny, pure and true British romantic comedy. I guess the Academy didn't put the British film between the nominees for the critics that they show about the US government and saying that the American woman are ""easy"" to find. Watching Love Actually for the first time you will have a lot of feelings and you'll identify yourself with any of the characters. Is incredible how each story moves us in a way that we stay focus on the screen for 135 minutes enjoying each scene and each dialog. What is also incredible are the good selected songs that play along the film ending up with ""God Only knows"" by the Beach Boys. You wont regret in watching it and you will see that the cinema doest need melancholic movies thats ends up in tragedies or teenager romantic films.

My wife and I watched this movie the other night and we both enjoyed it; and that is saying something. But we both enjoyed it for different reasons and both took something entirely different away from the movie.My wife enjoyed the CONSTANT attention to love and all things love related; romance, fairy tale endings and whatnot. Honestly, the emotional side of me enjoyed this aspect of the movie as well. But it was the final scene of the movie that left me reeling (and this is in no way a spoiler).I'm watching the conclusion in Heathrow, with people coming together from all over the world. But it's the music that takes over my consciousness. The Beach Boys' ""Sloop John B"" and the purposely repetitious and sadly remorseful chorus ""I want to go home, I want to go home..."" And the irony hit me: an American surfer band communicating more emotion in 15 seconds than the entire gray, cold British movie could convey in 2 hours up to this point.Maybe the point was that underneath the cold, gray British posturing there was a heart. Or maybe the producer just liked the song. Whichever the case, it worked for me.",Love Actually

The film has absolutely no emotional depth and the writing is horrible. The ""jokes"" consistently misfire. The film IS well cast, but all of the actors, now looking well past their romantic comedy film sell-by-date, seem sadly down on their luck to have been acting in this horrible, vulgar film trying to cash in on the success of Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral.

There's no greater philosophical meaning of life in it. I don't know what you expected.I thought it was sweet, and witty in a lot of places. Sure, there were clichés, but I do think that in many cases they are intentional and just taking the p*ss out. Example: the guy who goes and finds girls in the US. I highly doubt the writers ACTUALLY thought that this would happen in real life. It's supposed to be funny. And man, I don't know where all this yapping about misogyny in the film is coming from.

568,chrisfewtrell,"Uncontrollable rage, if you must.",1,7 October 2005,"I've always known I'm out of step with most of the people I meet, but can I be the only person who not only detests this film with an intensity bordering on the psychotic, but who finds it utterly offensive, on every level, from first frame to last? Never have I experienced such strong emotions about a film, and it leaves me almost speechless with anger just to hear its title. To hear someone actually praise the thing causes me to weep with frustration and I often have to bite my tongue to prevent myself from delivering a tirade of erudite criticism to complete strangers. Why should this be? Could it be the well documented, revolting (and believe it or not, largely unnoticed, among UK cinema goers I have asked at least!)reference to 9/11? The illogical behaviour of characters for the sake of a cheap laugh? The gratuitous use of pornography, in a stomach-churningly smug 'hey, porn is just harmless fun' middle class liberal unthinking kind of a way? The casual anti-Americanism, the embarrassing dialogue given to 'salt of the earth' working class stereotypes, the utter, utter complete nonsense of the plot in every single one of the 'stories'? Don't get me started. I thought Notting Hill was bad enough, with its brave cripple and her eternally patient husband. Here we had Emma Thomson looking balefully noble as she endured not only her husband's infidelity, but the sound of Joni Mitchell cruelly betraying one of her own children.

569,staypuft2,Piece of S**t,1,31 December 2005,"After watching this film and feeling completely ripped off in every way imaginable, I had to look and see what everyone's comments on IMDb were... I agree with every one of the poor reviews.I was also surprised to see the average rating of 7.8!!! What are people thinking?! Firstly, there are far too many story lines, consequently lending themselves far too little screen time to develop any kind of feeling for character or plot.Pretty much all of these story lines, too, are painfully nauseating. In fact, anyone still in possession of their own stomach (I should imagine most of you) will find it tricky not to feel at least a little queasy after watching two hours worth of this overcooked, shamefully formulaic pap.I HATED IT! And yet.. My sister and her many friends found it to be delightful!! My sister saw it TWICE at the cinema!! How? I have no idea! She loved it! One of her FAVOURITE movies she says. I feel for her... I really do.It makes me soo mad to watch it. Is this the only thing we Brits can produce? We've made many films like it in recent years... light, passable British comedies... But this takes all of them, repeats them, and then shits all over them.The only shred of light I can cast on it, is that I enjoyed this one scene were 'Nick' from 'My Family' (can't remember actor's name) goes to America and picks up a collection of really hot women. The only reason I enjoyed this is that it is soo over the top and unbelievable, and such a dream like scenario (who wouldn't want three lovely ladies on there arm?) that it is actually quite funny -- but still completely pointless.In short: Only worth watching if you enjoy watching s**t films and then commenting on how BAD they are.Crap.",Love Actually

However when the film gets into the abomination of commercial Christmas and gooey-sweet completely unreal kids the bad taste is ladled on with a trowel and the gorge begins to rise. And what a waste of talent: never before in the history of the cinema have so many fine actors wasted so much talent for such a pathetic film. Slick and embarrassing - I showed the DVD to my Spanish wife, assuring her the film had been praised by critics (as it has by some, presumably the hard of hearing or visually challenged), and after over two hours of soppy saccharine she had added Love Actually to Brexit and the Royal Family soap opera to her list of things which epitomise the ghastliness of present-day Britain. And I had to agree with her.",Love Actually
571,intheaudience,"Actually, a lot of it better not be called ""love.""",3,29 January 2006,"I give some credit to this movie. The visual editing was creative, especially at the end. The acting my Emma Thompson was, as usual, excellent. The rest of the acting wasn't bad, either. And the movie tried hard to justify or find a rationale for an innately unconvincing argument, and goes halfway toward succeeding with me, until some of it just became so forced as to become preposterous. Thus the premise lost all credibility, and the movie became ridiculous in its shallowness and condescension.The premise of the movie is that impulsive lust is actually love. Most people will protest that such a premise is false, and that love is something more noble and deeper than just a stirring in the loins. And I am of that mind.But it seems to me this movie is arguing that such a stirring, based on nothing but something as superficial as laying one's eyes on a low-cut shirt, is actually ""love"" that one feels and therefore justifies, no, demands one to abandon one's home and family and break other societal rules or laws to satisfy that stirring. As though that stirring would last. As though that stirring were love.But love, the real thing, that is, does not evaporate when one lays eyes on another ""love"" object, which in this movie could be just a cleverly designed piece of revealing clothing or a glimpse of cleavage or flesh, or some other thing equally trivial and superficial. If this were love, then it flits from one object to another. That is not love. To call that love really defiles the word.",Love Actually

This is one of those flicks you can just keep watching and not get sick of it. I'll rate it high in the entertaining element.....tear jerker, humorous, and a laugh out loud fun.

This movie answers all those questions.....YES!! So the politician finds love, the housewife learns to reinvent love with her dying marriage, the washed up rock singer falls for his manager, the less than confident woman learns to feel good about herself again, a widower sees love as a reality again. So in the end we are all happy.....we are teary eyed and feeling a renewed sense of hope for our hearts. Isn't this the feeling we want to have after a movie or just in life in general.

574,ClaudeSchneider,Actually Lovely,9,25 November 2003,"A wonderful British feel-great film, 9/10.There are cynics who will label this film ""too sugary"" and unbelievable; and there are romantics who will love every second of this film, and come out brimming with warmth and happiness. Maybe it depends on your current situation (are you in love yourself?), or maybe it doesn't at all. As you will probably already know from posters/trailers, there are at least 9 couples/relationships in the film, and each relationship covers a different aspect of love. Many of these relationships appear to be based solely on desire (but how can you really build an impression of deep love with 9 relationships in 2 hours? And many relationships in real life ARE initiated by desire). My point: whatever your current situation, you'll find a character you can relate to.One thing I didn't realise before seeing the film was how much of a Christmas film it is. There's nothing wrong with that - after all, Christmas is a time when people come together, and express their true feelings of love and friendship. ""Love Actually"" is a wonderful Christmas film, which I look forward to watching again and again each Christmas. Do see this film in the cinema now, as it probably won't have the same impact if you watch it a while after Christmas.For lovers of British film and television, there are myriad well-known and loved UK actors to delight you (whether they have central roles or just cameo appearances) - I was pleasantly surprised to see Andrew Lincoln & Nina Sosanya from the UK TV Series ""Teachers"" taking good roles. I say pleasantly surprised, not only because I'm a fan of ""Teachers"", but also because Richard Curtis hasn't relied on big-name stars to fill every role - and that's a good thing. It's all well and good having great actors like Alan Rickman & Emma Thompson playing their part, but most viewers will be thinking of Emma Thompson playing a character, and not see just the character she's playing. It's also entertaining to see one or two of America's well-known stars making appearances in this film (Billy Bob Thornton, Denise Richards, Shannon Elizabeth) - I guess it just goes to show how much appeal Richard Curtis' films have (both for the audience and actors alike).I'm surprised not to have seen more (or any?!) reviews mention one of my favourite films, ""Magnolia"", which also weaves together the lives of about 10 people, and their relationships with each other. There are many similarities between the two (the intricate interweaving of many people's lives and their relationships, loving and losing), but also many differences (Magnolia is a great American drama, which shows several aspects of life; Love Actually is a great British romantic comedy, which shows aspects of love, making us laugh and warming our hearts).Love actually IS all around - it's your decision as to whether you choose to see it, seek it, feel it, and give it.",Love Actually

I love it when I get an excuse to pop to the airport and like to get there just a little too early so that I can feel all the emotions rolling over me like a love roller coaster. If you are an emotional fridge you need to watch this movie and then get down to your nearest airport. Focus your attention on one person and try to feel everything that person is feeling, try and guess by the look on their face whether they are meeting a business partner, lover, family member or just a friend, and then wait with them until the person they are awaiting arrives.

Half of the story lines should have been thrown out due to uninteresting characterization. Hugh Grant & Colin Firth should have swapped roles. Grant as prime minister is really stretching it. The US president confrontation is unfunny and badly written. Thank God for Thompson & Rickman who are the only ones that breath life in their underwritten parts. I rather had seen a movie alone about their marriage-on-the-rocks. Plus hats of for Laura Linney who does wonders due taking part in the worst storyline about the sole character who is severely punished for rejecting love. And this is supposed to be a feel good movie ?",Love Actually
579,BlueEyesDaniel,"Well It's All About Love, Actually",8,16 December 2003,"When a film has the creators of, and actors from, the likes of Bridget Jones' Diary, About A Boy and Four Weddings And A Funeral to its credit, it promises to be something quite funny. But in his directorial debut, Richard Curtis has done something different from his past works. While still creating a riotous comedy and including the usual provocative storyline, Curtis has made the latter far less subtle. In fact, he uses Love Actually as a vehicle for some very powerful messages. The film presents several different people, their various relationships and associated problems. These are all of varying qualities with married couples suffering from the complications of an affair, single people finding each other and even those suffering from simple sexual desperation. Through these variances, Curtis delivers the same message: that `love actually is all around'. This message and its use in the film can only be described as sentimental, perhaps even mushy, but Curtis' sense of direction and comic timing never let it get out of hand and even at some of the films saddest moments he injects the necessary humour reminding the audience that they are watching a comedy, albeit one with a message. Love isn't the only message, with others coming across as far more subtle, though the recent War in Iraq is also used to provide a strong message, that of peace, with Hugh Grant's British Prime Minister shown standing up to America's push for war.The actors respond well to their material with Grant providing his usual solid performance, full of quirky faces and eye-lid batting but his limited screen time prevents him from giving something of stellar quality along the lines of About A Boy and gone too is his new-found selfishness. Other noteworthies include a hilarious performance from Bill Nighy as the drugged-out ageing rocker and Rowan Atkinson's minor appearance. However, it is Emma Thompson whom really steals the show, providing one of the most solid performances as a mother struggling to keep her family together while her husband verges on having an affair. While the multiple story lines allow for some fantastic onscreen presence, the film does feel a little bloated at times. Part way through you can't help but wonder where certain characters have disappeared' as their own storylines haven't been looked at for some time. This is particularly true of the odd-sex-groping' couple (you'll understand that term should you see the film) who appear sporadically and the exclusion of such characters wouldn't have been amiss and always could have been saved for the films DVD release. And while such flaws exist, Curtis succeeds with his directorial debut thanks to a witty script and a brilliant cast, all able to inject something special into their performances. While there are attempts to avoid it, at times Love Actually does feel far too sentimental, but even with its sheer mushiness, and my natural desire to throw something at the screen in response, Curtis succeeds with his message of love. For I left the cinema more in love than when I entered.Don't you just hate that?",Love Actually
580,u2hanks,Crap Really,2,29 November 2003,"You must be kidding that this has a 7.9 (as of Nov. 29). This movie was such a piece of trash. Boring trash.

Let me tell you something, if you see the first five minutes, skip to the end and see them all get together. Oh, oh, did I give something away? No, there's nothing to give away. In fact, it's insulting that this trash was distributed in the United States. It political agenda against the US and its policies (hey I don't' agree but I don't go to a (supposed) romantic movie to get political agendas shoved down my throat....okay well there was ""The American President"", but still.) while it collects plenty of American dollars. Hey Hugh, come over and enjoy our American hookers, don't forget to leave US currency as a tip. This movie is so left wing it's obviously from overseas. Strike that. Anyway, it's a waste of time.

He's absolutely fantastic and his role here is quite different from the one in Pirates 2... Actually no one falls out of the line here, Liam Neeson does a great job, Alan Rickman is good as always.

In his directorial debut, he has delivered a movie shows the very best in people. In it's weakest moments, Love Actually was entertaining. In it's best, it was moving and capable of touching your soul. I really didn't see a weak performance in the bunch. I did feel the use of music was a bit overdone, particularly towards the end. Curtis delivers such fine dialogue, he should have let it carry the finale rather than pop music. All in all, Love Actually is a fantastic movie that shines because of the wonderful performances by an incredible cast that was given a great script.",Love Actually
584,revsonya,actually loved it!,8,12 December 2003,"I had braced myself for disappointment. After all, what movie could ever live up to the promises of such a stellar cast?  Emma Thompson, who may very well be the perfect actress...if not woman. Colin Firth, my not-so-secret latest crush. Liam Neeson, who always makes me think of naked guys since seeing him as Oscar Wilde on Broadway in The Judas Kiss. The always brilliant Alan Rickman. And no matter what his failings, I can't long resist the charms of Hugh Grant...often to my chagrin.  Yet, even with Richard Curtis at the helm, good romantic comedies are hard to find, so I dared not hope too much.Imagine my surprise.  Love Actually actually is a delight.  As the opening monologue relates, the prevailing wisdom in our world is that hatred and greed run rampant, overshadowing anything decent about humanity and its intricate relationships.  But when we stop and look around us, it's amazing how much love there really is- among friends, partners, family, and even colleagues.  Just watch the arrivals at the airport to see the joy we bring one another.  When faced with corporate scandals, bullying nations, and desperate terrorists, we too often we overlook the daily graces of life. Yet they continue...and even abound...for many of us.  This film explores such graces through a multiplicity of relationships:  a man (Neeson) and his stepson; an aging rocker and his manager; the new Prime Minister (Grant) and one of his staff; an aging, successful businessman (Rickman), his wife (Thompson) and his would-be mistress; a cuckholded man (Firth) and his cleaning lady; an artist struggling to adjust to his best friend's marriage; a woman (Laura Linney) torn between her commitment to herself and her commitment to family.the list goes on and on.  Like the intricacies of our lives and commitments, many of these plot-lines overlap.Admittedly, in spite of the challenges of their relationships, these characters spend vast amounts of time in the lap of luxury, enjoying privileges unknown in large sectors of society.  Without a doubt, they're delightful eye-candy.  Even so, like the rest of us mere mortals, they face personal challenges, disappointments, and even griefs...none of which are trivial...or trivialized.  But somehow these characters survive...with plucky courage, humor, and even joy.  In a world full of despair and degradation, Love Actually offers signs of hope both for creative transformation and for good's triumph - at least for those who can afford it.  Julian of Norwich would've loved it:  All shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of things shall be well.And a number of things in Love Actually actually are well. Near the beginning of the film we witness a wedding between a white woman (Keira Knightley) and a black man (Chiwetel Ejiofor), and no one even blinks. Undercurrents abound around this wedding, but they aren't about race.  How nice. And while the film doesn't demonize (or, god-forbid, glorify) Americans (thankfully), it does dare to poke fun and even point-out some of our worst failings at present...in an oh-so-polite-but-stalwart British way. How refreshing.But ALL is not well in Love Actually.  For a film of 135 minutes, there are an inordinate number of fat comments-an indication of laziness on the part of the writers who opt for cheap laughs at the expense of any woman larger than a size 6.  Driving the film's excessive attention to weight is its sexist undercurrent.  Perhaps that's part of the film's appeal - it doesn't threaten or challenge or call to accountability in any way the ""traditional"" world where men wield power in the public sphere and women are subordinate to them, both in the office and in the home.  In spite of the vast variety of relationships explored and the vast talent of the women in the cast, not one of the plot-lines is about a relationship between or among women. Ultimately, all of the stories revolve around the needs, wants and problems of the men in them - the women serve only as foils.  Important as the needs, wants and problems of men are, I suspect the women in their world have needs, wants and problems of their own.  Sadly, in this film, we'll never know about any of those except the ones that revolve around the men.  So although Curtis and Co. envision a world in which persons are judged by the `content of their character rather than the color of their skin,' they fail miserably even to question a world ruled exclusively by men with full support from `their' women.Like most romantic comedies, Love Actually abounds with the implausible and the outrageous. Such circumstances are part of the fun and easy to forgive. Would that its sexism had been portrayed as equally implausible and outrageous....still, for solid performances and reliable laughs in a romantic comedy, Love Actually actually can't be beat.",Love Actually
585,dshurz,Refreshingly good,8,2 November 2003,"So, it's from the team behind 4 Weddings, Notting Hill and Bridget Jones Diary, it includes the very same Hugh Grant and the 'theme song' is a take-off of the one from 4 Weddings. That said, it's the best of these by far, and the ensemble nature of the film and its intertwined stories make it a joy - Hugh Grant and Martine McCutcheon, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, Bill Nighy and his manager, Colin Firth and his cleaner, Liam Neeson and his stepson, Laura Linney and her brother and many more.The acting is good and the stories are not so sweet as to be implausible. Not everyone ends up in their preferred romance. But it's the more realistic nature of some of the stories that makes the film more enjoyable and the lack of reality in most Hollywood romantic comedies tends to ruin them. This film is very different. There are some strands that are weak, but most work well and I was particularly impressed with the acting of Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman and Liam Neeson. The cameos are good and used appropriately and the film never feels like it's being stretched. Best of all, we walked out with that genuinely happy feeling (similar to that when I saw Mostly Martha or Bend it Like Beckham). If you have a romantic bone in your body go see it.",Love Actually

The characters are engaging. The eight separate episodes are well worked out and come together very cleverly.It has good production values.It has a number of well thought through and original plot devices. These vary from the all-too-believable to the surrealistic. If Colin's experience in Milwaukee is real then I want to know when the next plane leaves!There are a number of strong performances. My personal favourites were Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Lúcia Montez and Bill Nighy but other people will have their favourites. Lovely cameo from Rowan Atkinson. Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister?

591,mstep-4,Very Kitsch,4,7 May 2009,"Please be indulgent with my English. My first comment here.First time I saw this movie, I was enthused. This idea to show the exit at the airport arrival and show the love behind all these people and at the end the same picture of people cuddling and kissing themselves is really moving: love is everywhere! A nice message! So I understood the enthusiastic reviews out here on IMDb.com quite well.But now I watched this film for a second time, it is part of my DVD collection, and I was really shocked. Some films win, watching them more times. Some lose. ""Love Actually"" is one of the biggest Hollywood crap and pretentious kitsch I have in my collection.Some reasons: the music is just terrible. It is like ketchup in every dish. The light is producing artificial studio atmosphere. To the figures of the film: Hugh Grant is charming, but always the same Hugh Grant in every film. This time as a English Prime Minister, and sorry, such a character with his mannerism in this position is only ridiculous. And these jokes about Natalie's (Martine McCutcheon) elephant thighs are very cheap and even not true. But the most terrible in this film is this sort of little adult in the body of a 13? years old boy. He is sitting there on papa's sofa, mother just died and he has nothing better to do, than to wine about a beautiful comrade in school, to whom he does not dare to declare his ""love"". He is speaking with the words of a Hollywood film scenarist, and father desperately wants to enter his children room, but does not venture it, because there is written with chalk ""keep out!"" on a slate. Is it like that, filmmakers are raising their children in Hollywood? Poor children! Poor America! And when the girlfriend - sixteen years old? - is singing in the school ""Christmas!""-celebration, imitating eroticism from show biz in television she grew up with, it is the summit of embarrassment in this film.OK, there are really good actors: first of all Emma Thompson. Great artist, great personality! I liked also the couple of writer and the housekeeper lady from Portugal. The English-Portuguese Dialogs are witty. Lúcia Moniz (playing Aurelia) would merit a carrier, but looking on IMDb.com she is not doing well. What a pity! Also the old Rocker was a great pleasure to watch. I love films in mosaic technique. My answer to this film would be the films of Cédric Klapisch, which use mostly this technique. Watch out for ""Paris"", 2008 and ""L'Auberge espagnole"", 2002. And one of my favorite films in this technique is from Danièle Thompson: ""Fauteuils d'orchestre"", 2007.",Love Actually

593,a_flynn78,A few too many story lines perhaps?,5,10 January 2010,"Recently I've been watching a lot of movies, happily sitting through them, and then at the end, well i realise that they weren't that good. Maybe the fact i didn't mind watching them is a better reflection on the movie then picking it to pieces but i think the second analysis is still valid. The first thing i thought was wrong with the movie is that after a 2hour 10minute movie the only characters who i can seriously say i knew anything about were Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, which i will say now was the highlight of the movie, very well executed. However you could probably remove some of the other characters that have so little air time it might as well be given to some other characters. Bill Nighy has to go, i love him as an actor but not only did they almost ruin my perception of him by portraying him as a potty mouth rock star, with no form of disguise to make it seem like it wasn't Bill Nighy, but i didn't feel like i knew him at all. The whole point of his presence in the movie was to make it seem like he was abusing his manager too much, which i thought wasn't very subtle at all and i couldn't grasp much else from his 10 minutes of on screen time. I thought the porn stars were an interesting couple but weren't given enough airtime, so give them somebody else's. Keira Knightley and her husband had promise but were given little airtime to make me think they were a worthwhile inclusion in the movie. One of the better points of the movie i thought was when the best man was in love with Keira Knightley but chose to back off completely because his best friend was married to her, and then they ruined it by making him inappropriately approach her and make her laugh at all his ridiculously stupid joke palm cards. Just too many characters, i didn't feel the plight of any of them, some of them should have stayed in the editing room, thats for you to decide. Im not writing this to encourage you to see the movie because obviously either you've already seen it or I've just completely ruined it for you, but id just like to see whether anybody else felt the same way about the movie as i did.",Love Actually

595,j_stromoski,"Wonderful, Charming, Funny, and Genius",10,4 March 2011,"First of all, I have to say that the entire casting for this movie was perfect. Bill Nighy as the aged, old school rocker, Colin Firth as the hopeless romantic who gets his heart broken, Emma Thompson as the betrayed wife and Alan Rickman the husband. Yet, out of all the stories told in this masterpiece, I found Liam Neeson's to be the most touching. The step-father who raises his step-son after the loss of his wife, and ultimately teaches him about the love his step-son feels for a girl at school.Every single story that pieced together this movie was brilliant, simply because it was relatable on some level. I would watch Hugh Grant stumble to make idle chit-chat with his assistant Natalie and would faintly remember my high school days where I would try and fail to talk to the quiet, pretty girl who sat next to me in nearly every class. It was funny when it needed to be funny, romantic when your heart was aching, and just sad enough for you to see how real it all is.If you haven't seen this movie, then do. I was instantly a huge fan of it. Partly because I like British humor, and partly because I love romantic comedies...when they're as good as this. The only problem I can see is that this movie should have been just a tad longer, and given each story more time for you to appreciate them that much more. Also, John Cleese was missing. All in all, I would strongly suggest seeing it and develop your own opinion.",Love Actually

It's Short Cuts meets Capra for the Cosmo generation and there's nothing wrong with that. (Warning! The previous sentence is only 75% as accurate and 35% as clever as it thinks it is).

598,Fredrika-Markstedt,Very English!,9,27 November 2003,"Another excellent production from the producers of ""Bridget Jones Diary"" and ""Notting Hill"". Personally this is yet my favorite of them all. Not just that my favorite actor Alan Rickman makes and extraordinary good performance of Harry, the home father with love problems. Many many love story's binds together with many many threads, and since this is not an American production, one can really connect the happenings to real life. Oh though you might wish it would, not all love is perfect, and not all love can be mutual. This is shown in an excellent way in this movie, one might think it got stories enough for several movies though. This movie is highly recommended to all whom has known love, in one or another way... and who hasn't?",Love Actually
599,nikeswim17,"I'm in Love, actually...",9,10 November 2003,"This movie was outstanding. Along the lines of Bridget Jones Diary and Four Weddings and A Funeral--Love Actually is quirky and humorous with a touching emotional side. You leave the theater feeling floaty and wishing you were in love, especially with Hugh Grant or Colin Firth. The only bad thing about this movie is that some of the plot lines are never resolved or are only touched upon briefly. We never see much of the turnout of Laura Linney's character etc. The appearances by Rowan Atkinson and Billy Bob Thorton were humorous and charming, and the movie contained the kind of humor I enjoy--quirky and off-beat, filled with the awkwardness of every-day situations. Perhaps the best part about this movie is that though it is dubbed a ""romantic comedy"" it is actually much deeper. It isn't simply ""cute"" it is about bigger things, it isn't just about ""love,"" it is about the imperfections of love and the humor, sadness and often times unfulfillment that all relationships bring. I would say this is one of the best romantic comedies of all-time, on par with About a Boy. Definitely worth a watch.",Love Actually

Richard Curtis has written and directed an awful movie. Don't waste your money! The best parts of the movie are shown in the commercial; everything else is rubbish. I expected more and was quite disappointed. Looks like Richard forgot to love this movie. It's not funny, it's not romantic, it's too long and it's misogynistic. They make fun of women especially those who are slightly overweight and older. Easy target. Why not make fun of bald or balding men? There seems to be an abundance of them on both coasts. Seriously, there were some cute moments but they don't make the whole worthwhile. In fact, there are some downright depressing parts.

The couple playing the movie stand-ins made me blush and the interaction between Liam Neeson's character and his stepson were lovely. Colin Firth is always great to watch and I enjoyed his journey. Unlike everyone else, I didn't enjoy Bill Nighys character.  I thought it was cliched and silly.

It churns on and on and on and on, meandering from one lame contrived story to the next. I rarely get this little from a movie, even with most bad films I can at least laugh AT them but this film just gave me stomach cramps and nausia.I am not the kind of guy that switches off or walks out on a movie so I regrettably watched to the bitter end. Thinking all along that there would be a point to it all, that there would be some sort of resolution, something to make sense of all the lamo, supposedly varied, love stories that are just simply awful.The writing was so bad too, as if it was written by spoilt eleven year old girl who has been sheltered from everything in life and handed anything she wanted by rich over protective and adoring parents.This film is like a big gooey sugary sweet mess of contrived and packaged imitation sugar, sprinkled with crap and delivered on a big plastic pink conveyor belt at the hope of tugging at people's heart strings.They should have handed out vomit bags in the cinemas.That this film was made is like an insult to anyone who has lived life for more than a day in their lives.The people who liked this movie are the people that open spam e mails, they're the people that vote in the Eurovision song contest, the people that stupid signs are made for, the people that don't know anything about the world, who read supermarket shelf magazines, the happy to be stupid people. It makes you wonder reading some of the 'reviews' from people who liked this are THEY from another planet or is it me?",Love Actually
604,lexie-bl,Terrific,9,25 April 2004,"I found this film to be terrific in it's genre. I thought the dialogue was witty and the plotlines very clever in their interaction. All the characters were believeable and I found myself empathising with many. It helps I suppose that I liked all the actors chosen for their characters in this film. I thought Hugh Grant's little dance scene was a show stealer although his portrayal of the British PM was a little far fetched. I also thought veteran actors Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman did a fab job as always. Honestly I would watch just about anything with Colin Firth in it, but I found his character to be a little irritating. The jumping plotlines kept the story interesting and it was good to see younger characters being incorporated in difficult storylines. This film made me laugh out loud in many places and that is enough for a stamp of approval from me.",Love Actually
605,mberker4-382-984374,one of the best British rom coms/Christmas movies of the last 15-20 years,8,17 December 2013,"The two best things about the movie is that A) it is set in one of my favourite cities London (which is always a nice city for filming these type of movies) and B) the ensemble cast. When a movie has a large cast of well known actors/actresses it can be a hit or a miss, but in my opinion we have a hit here. i like the opening scene the scene where kiera knightley opens the door and sees her friend declare his love for her in a quite romantic way. Also the scene where Colin Firth goes and gets his Portugese friend and declares his love with a broken Portuguese is also nice. Furthermore one has to mention the great Rowan Atkinson (aka Mr Bean, blackadder) in one of his funniest scenes to date (won't spoil it to people who have not watched the movie) even thought the movie is a decade old it is one of those movies that a person can watch once or twice every winter.

I was alone in a big city and felt lonely too at the time, but this film made me feel that Love, Actually is right in front of you on the Screen. Now you may call me a Fool, but this film actually does feel like a warm and fuzzy teddy bear you can hug and keep close to your heart...The plot is intricate to say the least: it evolves around the lives of about 10 or more people which are interwoven somehow. I know this sounds familiar, cliché, 'been there seen that'. But these stories contains so much heart and are filled with so much joy and hilarious moments you really don't mind anymore. It involves all kinds of people of society from the Prime Minister, a rock star to a writer and even a few stand in porn actors. It's about people living their lives around Christmas with the sort of British humor propably not even surpassed by Monthy Python. Because yes people, this movie is hilarious and extremely funny. Bill Nighy steals the show, but most of the credits must go to writer and director Richard Curtis for this witty, funny and especially warm film. Once again, this film feels like a warm blanket you can wrap yourself around in and it actually feels like Christmas. Go see it when you need it...",Love Actually
607,inkygrrl,"Typically English, typically Curtis",9,14 August 2004,"*****THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS IN THIS!*****This is a beautiful little piece about the loves and lives of about 15 interwoven characters in the lead up to Christmas. It explores love, lust, greed, jealously, betrayal and why humans get knocked down but they'll get up again all for the sake of love.The opening scene says all really (NO SPOILERS! :-) ) it shows shots of people coming from the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport, running from the barriers into the loving arms of the partners, friends and family. Hugh Grant (who I dislike but his performance is great!) says over the pictures ""General opinion is starting to make out that we live in a word of hatred and greed. But I don't see that. It seems to me that love is everywhere. Often it's not particularly dignified of newsworthy. Fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends. When the planes hit the twin towers as far as I know none of the phone calls from the people on board were messages of hate or revenge.They were all messages of love. If you look for it I've got a sneaky feeling that you'll actually find that Love Actually Is All Around""I cannot fault the casting or any of the performances in this movie but the outstanding members of cast are surely Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Laura Linney, Andrew Lincoln (who made me bawl!) Hugh Grant, Billy Bob Thornton and the young Thomas Sangster whose performance was surprisingly good for someone so young.Why should you see this movie? Because there's no cynicism, just a beautiful piece about putting your heart on the line for love and the lengths people will go to to get it. The humour and wit is very English (which, personally, I love) and it will make you laugh and cry  and with so many stories it's constantly fast paced and doesn't drag.

There is much evidence of this in the film and many have been commented in the reviews here. However, one scene that particularly made me angry was the notion that being in love with your best friends wife is romantic! We're supposed to find the ""Bob Dylan"" cue card scene cute and endearing. Really, this is the writers idea of romance? Glad I'm not his friend!The premise of this film is basically this:1. If you're grieving or have been rejected then:a) if you're a middle aged man, then ""love is all around"" in the form of 20 something subservient girls or supermodels b) if you're a middle aged woman then give up and find a hobby like costume design2. Its OK to ""stalk"" your best friends wife, as this is romantic and not at all creepy or disloyal3. American politicians are sleazy, sex obsessed bully's and American girls are tarts!4.

Not to mention that its completely insulting toward American culture, while simultaneously fulfills some warped fantasy that Britain collectively has about being a proud, sovereign, independent thinking culture, which it isn't. Britain mirrors American politics and culture nearly 100%. Finally, what is it with all of the shocking examples of nudity and sexuality that go above and beyond HBO. While the producers/writers try to make a movie that projects a proud independent England, they simultaneously try desperately to project their emulation of American culture.

610,AlexGrant83,Love Awfully,1,25 December 2013,"I'm genuinely surprised to see such a high score for this film. Even as a cheesy Christmas love flick it's truly terrible. Two hours of hackneyed clichés of British life interspersed with wholly unrealistic situations. Such as the writer who falls in love with a Portuguese woman he can't speak to or the misogynist Brit who goes to America to find easy girls, or worst of all Andrew Lincoln playing a guy who is borderline stalking his friend's WIFE Keira Knightley, and she's flattered by it. The film winds up being some sort of horrid self parody, making out that love is the true meaning of Christmas and mocking the Christmas cheese hits while commercialising the holiday period itself. There's so much talent involved that you start wondering what on earth went so wrong. Two hours of your life that you'll never get back.",Love Actually
611,Stirling00,"Pleasant, light fare with some obvious flaws",3,17 December 2004,"British romantic comedies are virtually indistinguishable from their American counterparts. This is a blessing and a curse. The characters exist in a sort of rarefied air of effortless upper/upper middle class sensibility. However, this is so endemic to films it's not really worth going into. ""Kid in love"" part taken a little too seriously. I had crushes when I was eleven too, but my father wouldn't spend two seconds thinking about my puppy love infatuations, kids need to figure this sort of stuff out on their own. The shy porn stars? Don't think they exist. This goes in with ""unsightly Brit gets laid in Wisconsin"" bit. I know the writer is going for a certain kind of absurdest sensibility in his humor, but it just doesn't play. Americans in general like British accents- it doesn't really work the other way, unfortunately, but I think the Wisconsin Tourist Board was behind this in an attempt to lure British males to the land of Cheeseheads and Lands' End. Hugh Grant was good as the PM, funny in that bit about the SAS. What was that visit by the US President though? Billy Bob Thornton was a sort of Bush-arrogant/Clinton-lewd hybrid? I think those criticisms are probably accurate, but even Clinton would never openly make a pass at a British Government worker at Downing Street on an official state visit. Oh, and the press conference! Please! Brits- you are not some put upon, bullied country! Stop acting like you are! Only one country in the world exceeds America in terms of national chauvinism and arrogance and that's the UK! I lived there, I know. I love your guys, seriously, you have a beautiful country with tons to offer the world culturally and politically. But stop your whining. By the way, it is no longer brave or risqué to be so openly anti-American, it's very trendy and fashionable. And the people that applaud this sort of ""Cool Brittania"" counter attack to American bullying I'll wager know the least about international politics. I wish Billy Bob would've given back in that conference. Something even Jimmy Carter would've done. And Hugh Grant had a picture of Thatcher on the wall. Was he supposed to be a Tory?

612,madwitch61,"Funny most of the time, but I didn't appreciate the America abuse",4,14 October 2005,"There were many moments in the film where I was laughing my head off-- mainly Emma Thompson's, but 2 stories gave me a sour feeling that completely ruined the entire film for me: the ""President"" and the ""3 Hot Wisconsin Babes.""Let's start with the President segment. OK; there are American presidents who have had affairs; to be honest more than you can shake a stick at. But if you're making a statement about current foreign policy (coughBUSHcough), don't make the current president out to be what he's not. Bush is many things, but a lecher isn't one of them. (Billy Bob Thornton, however, was a good choice.)The Presidential bit would not have ruined the entire film. I could have gotten over it. It was ""Wisconsin"" that made me HATE this film. With the rather sweet, but sex-obsessed dweeb who was going to the States to get laid, I was all geared up for him to be sorely disappointed in his hope that a horde of American women would jump him for being English. I hoped he would find love AFTER he realized this. I laughed my head off at ""A Magical Place Called 'Wisconsin.' "" But instead, his hopes and dreams are fulfilled by not two, not three, but FOUR women he meets the first night there. This ENRAGED me. I understand that there is a stereotype in Europe that American women are very promiscuous, but that... that was RIDICULOUS!!! Completely and totally ridiculous! I am offended on behalf of all American women. I am especially offended on behalf of the women of Wisconsin. They did NOT deserve that kind of insult.Yes, there were more realistic American characters. But those two stereotypes completely ruined the film.

Cue cliché after cliché of English romantic views of love that are about 30 years out of date. I thought horrible sentimental crud like this went out of fashion in the 80's. The only thing to make it worse would be having Bon Jovi on the soundtrack! The dialogue seems to be written by College students. On the plus side, the performances are good - the actors should have been given more to work with than a few minutes each at a time which was disappointing. Hugh Grant plays the one role he can do well the same as he did in all his other films. The story lines are just embarrassing and not heartwarming at all unless you're an old widow. The story about Bill Nighy seemingly leaving his mate out is the worst but the one with Martin Freeman is one of the worst ideas I have ever come across. Its not funny and even that gets stretched over the course of the film. The Emma Thompson/Alan Rickman one is the only interesting one but that follows a tired old formula too, as if the writer has no personal experience of love - just what he/she has read/seen. This film, is aimed at weeping housewives with nothing better to do than curl up on the sofa with a box of choccies. Best leave them to it.",Love Actually

The plot, if not incredibly in depth, never bogs down, and keeps you continually engaged in each character's life.   I found myself several times just as one event was concluding, wondering what was happening in another's character's life, only to be taken right to them moments later.Special appreciation to the wonderfully done relationship between Daniel and Sam, and Aurelia and Jamie.Two themes I've found in people nay-saying the movie:  political/social commentary and nudity.We must not forget that film makers and writers have the privilege in the free world to comment however they wish on the choices those in the political arena make, just as they do social trends.  The right to question and examine these things is what makes movies independent art and not just propaganda.  More specifically, the Prime Minister-U.S. President relationship issue in the movie may be a chance for Americans to get a very real look at how those on the other side of the Atlantic view the single man ""chosen"" to represent all of us.  You don't have to agree with it, but don't close yourself to its possibilities.As far as nudity, aside from the fact that there are a few scenes with frontal exposure, I've most definitely seen more sexually aggressive subject matter in prime time network T.V.  While perhaps superfluous, it was in no way pornographic, as reviewers and critics have lamented.  And don't forget - we now have a rating system that tells you point blank if there is nudity. The doe-eyed parent has no grounds to cry foul over an unexpected nude scene.It is absolutely the most engaging movie about all the various incarnations of love I have ever seen.

It could be considered a Christmas movie, as it takes place during the Christmas holidays, however I find it to be a refreshing movie to watch at any time. What's so great about this movie is the complexity of the story, and yet the simplicity of the overall message of the film- which is given right up front for all of those who miss it- ""Love actually IS everywhere"". I personally think the filmmakers did an excellent job in making the story come to life, and the actors a superb job at giving each character life. Favorite actors in this film, for me, were Bill Nighy, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, and most especially Emma Thompson & Alan Rickman. I must also sing praises for the production company this comes out of- Working Title has come out with some of the best films in the past few years, and they continue to seem light-years ahead of the major studios, perhaps because they are willing to take more chances. The only recent movie that ranks near ""Love Actually"" in my book is ""Last Holiday"", starring Queen Latifah. I think that romantic comedies like these two are what we need as a society- an escape from the everyday into something that seems sweet & more innocent. As time goes by, I think ""love actually"" will tunnel it way up from the recesses of film and become one of the most outstanding films of the decade.",Love Actually
629,Gillybean689,terrific,10,14 September 2007,"This is a terrific film which follows the lives of several people in Great Britain. It uses a witty script and fantastic acting to keep the viewer enthralled in the film. Its easy to get lost in the characters. You love some of them so much while hating others to the same amount. Its a very pleasing film, but it does stay true to its name as well as a movie could anyway, it is more like Love Actually. The question is who will be lucky enough to find it this time around. Some couples of course will find their dreams, while others may have to settle for a different kind of love. It opens with a brilliant line delivered by Hugh Grant that sets the stage for the film. Enjoy watching this great Brit Flick.",Love Actually
630,colin-406,So bad it's good,10,31 October 2008,No-one comes out unscathed from this horrific piece of garbage. I've watched it four times from behind a cushion because I'm that type of masochist. The most butt clenching story involves the cute kid who is in love. WTF were the actors thinking of when they signed up to this? The scripts for Trumpton are more sophisticated than the writing here. They're funnier too. With far more sympathetic characters and better plot development. This film is shown every Xmas and now I have a love/hate relationship with it now because watching it makes me feel blessed that I still have a modicum of taste and judgement despite being very old. This film was also my first introduction to actress Kiera Knightly. Her narcissism is infuriating enough to make me want to join Al Qeada. It says something about a British film when the least butt-clenching scene involves having to watch Hugh Grant dance.,Love Actually
631,queenanne,Enough bad language to sink a battleship!!!,1,24 May 2006,"This is supposed to be ""one of the best British films of the recent years""????!!!! Well, maybe only because just about every notable British star of today is in it. Yeah....and every single one of them has to say F*** at least once, even the Portugese maid (translated in the subtitles, naturally!) Is this much cussing really NECESSARY in a romantic comedy, and a Christmas one at that?! But then again, what else one might expect from a movie with Hugh Grant as the center of attention? It's one thing to put up with filthy mouths in a movie with a good story, like ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", and another to get a ear full of it in some corny, not funny and utterly overrated movie such as ""Love Actually"". My only regret is that this was the very first movie I ever saw with Colin Firth, and though at that time I had no idea who he was, his storyline in this movie was the most tolerable of them all. He is now one of my top favourite actors, and had this movie exhibited a little more class, he would have become my favourite actor much sooner.",Love Actually

633,seanbeansfingers-1,The worst movie ever made,1,25 June 2006,"I love most films but this sucked. It spent so long pumping the audience full of poorly-scripted sentiment it forgot it was meant to be a comedy and left out any jokes. I think it is a dreadful movie, the little boy striking me as particularly trite. I think Richard Curtis just said, ""Let's have a really sweet little boy who finds the love of his life and makes everyone go 'aaah'."" ""But will it have any jokes Richard?"" ""No! People will think it's funny because I co-wrote Blackadder. Oh alright, I'll recycle some humour from Notting Hill, no-one hated that film!"" For more touching, charming and funny films I would recommend the following: Se7en, Carrie, Braveheart, The Dirty Dozen, The Silence of the Lambs. I think deep-frying my own skin would be a more effective source of joy than this dismal piece of garbage. The only tears I cried were for Alan Rickman's dignity, and his magnificent descent from Die Hard. When did people decide that comedies should be more about plot and characters than about being funny (When Harry Met Sally... proved both are possible- in my opinion unquestionably the greatest rom-com of all time). Which is more enjoyable: Love Actually or Police Academy? I think the latter, because it is simply trying to make people laugh, unlike this steaming crapola, which was trying to do god knows what. P.S. Coldplay suck.",Love Actually
634,mari_jmjn_0728,You can find your favorite story!!,10,27 November 2006,"Love Actually is one of my favorite movie, so I want you to know why it's my favorite and why I love it so much! There are some reasons.First of all, the casts are wonderful such a Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Keira Knightley and so on. Secondly, I like the soundtrack. There are my favorite songs and famous songs, ""All I Want for Christmas is You"", ""The Trouble With Love Is"" and ""All You Need Is Love"", so everyone can enjoy it. Thirdly, I really like one of the story at this movie! The characters are Peter, Juliet and Mark. Juliet is Peter's wife and Mark is Peter's best friend. Mark is always cold manner to Juliet, but Juliet don't know why he is cold to her, so she want to become a good friends with Mark. At Christmas night, Mark visit to Juliet, then she notice his real mind that he loves Juliet. This story is very sad, but it's really touching story.I think this movie taught us that the joy of loving people, beauty of bright life by love, and something special! It's a really heartwarming movie, and you'll find a story that you can empathize. I hope everyone to see this movie!!",Love Actually

637,patrick_bateman_20,"Rubbish, actually",4,1 December 2003,"This film would have been a lot better had the number of stories been cut and each plot allowed to develop a little further. Often this film was cringing, the PM dancing to 'Jump' (sadly not Van Halen either) and the school boy who has fallen in love. There were some redeeming features, particularly involving Alan Rickman's relationship with his PA(?), Andrew Lincoln's with Keira Knightley and the story of Colin Firth's relationship, but apart from the latter, these stories were not allowed to develop. As with all Richard Curtis films the characters are so bloody British and upper middle-class that frankly it gets rather tiring and the formula of sticking Hugh Grant as a main character and having Rowan Atkinson in a small role is wearing rather thin.",Love Actually

Trite, offensive, cheeky, stupid, manipulative, unfunny....I shall not go on.But I will comment that the odd Lewinsky references were unneeded and probably went unnoticed by most viewers. Why were they in there?Who cares?Don't see. Ever. For any reason, even if you love Emma Thompson or Liam Neeson or anyone else in it. This is a tragically horrible film.",Love Actually
639,tb214,It's great... actually,10,17 November 2003,"As I watched the previews for Love Actually on the television, I thought that it would be cute.  I didn't want to go see a chick flick alone, and not having a girlfriend, I asked my sister.  She was busy, so I took my mom. We both loved the movie.  It was a little dirtier than either of us expected, but we still went away feeling good about having spent two hours in the most crowded theatre I have ever been in in all my life.All of the stories are intertwined, although I can't quite see how in all cases.  Just how the couple that met as stand ins on the porn film set fits in I still can't figure out.  But all the others are wonderfully written and acted.  I did think Laura Linney's character deserved a happier ending, but I was overall pleased with the movie.Guys, you might as well go see it.  It's not terrible at all.  Quite the opposite.  Ladies, make them go.  It will do them a world of good.
I say four stars.",Love Actually
640,nikkik1600,Freaking Awesome!!,10,1 November 2003,"WOW! I just saw a sneak preview with some friends, and we all came out with HUGE smiles on our faces.  The only comparisons we could come up with were Bridget Jones and About A Boy, not because plots were similar (or because there were overlapping cast members) but because it just had that smile-continuously-because-we-Brits-are-here-to-make-you-laugh feel.  The nine almost unconnected story lines managed to mesh together perfectly, and the cast was UNBELIEVABLE!  Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant, Colin Firth (AKA sexiest man alive) in one movie?!?!   Have I died and gone to cinema Heaven?  Seldom does a cast this phenomenal actually appear in a good movie...star studded casts are too often seen as a valid excuse for shoddily made movies.  This was certainly an exception to that rule!!  The cinematography was excellent--the emphasis on facial expressions was genius,--the music was, again, smile inducing, and the dialogue made every character real and relatable.  Talk about becoming emotionally invested!! As corny as this may sound: I laughed, I cried, and I actually CARED! Simply put, a BRILLIANT movie!  (PS- Bill Nighy is a genius and I LOVE him!!)",Love Actually
641,trashpicker,"Trite, predictable and excessively sappy.",5,1 June 2004,"My wife and I rented this a couple of days ago and we both found the movie to be embarrassingly bad, and actually painful to watch in moments. While I think the cast is excellent and the acting is generally good, the inclusion of tired plot devices and ill-conceived plotlines (such as the PM's public tirade against the President because of jealousy) really destroys any potential it may have had. Richard Curtis' sappy Disney-esque moments don't help lend the movie any credibility, either. I think one of the most telling things I saw on the DVD was the ""Deleted Scenes"" section where Curtis talks about how difficult it was to cut the movie down from 3+ hours to the 2+ hours it eventually became. Curtis takes almost 5 minutes discussing the import of each scene before the scene is played (some scenes are less than 2 minutes), and he is really excruciating to watch. If you were to believe him, each scene is a gem and should have made it to the final product. I beg to differ. The end result would have been a 3 hour mess as opposed to the 2 hour mess that we have been subjected to.Best avoided.",Love Actually
642,tojofriends,Too much love... but still works,7,26 September 2008,"Score:- 7/10Well I'm not actually a romantic movie lover but I watched this one. Main cause :- Laura Linney was in it. I must say I got more than I bargained for, Linney had very brief part but what I got is 7-8 parallel good stories with a less short of convincing acting by a few. The movie starts off with a common but effective and forgotten adage that despite of all the killing, hate, anguish there is still love somewhere. Maybe I sound too much of an optimistic but lately I have been watching or re-watching a lot of crime movies so this movie was a real satisfaction. Bottom-line if it is Christmas an if you have a true heart you will get what you want (or mostly you do). But this stupid quixotic idea was quite beautifully screen-played and it makes you believe for a few moments that you live in a perfect world (at least it made me almost believe for a moment). One main thing  you will see a lot of familiar faces around here. Severus Snape(forgot his real name, but his accent is awesome), Laura Linney, Kiera Knightly, Jedi Master QuiGon or Raaz A Gul(whatever you prefer) and of course Denise Richard and Hugh Grant(not convincing though as prime minister of England).These 6-7 parallel stories are merely related and while watching sometimes you forget who was with whom but again you don't have put strain to watch this movie. What actually amazes me most that how come a jerk got so many girls when he went to America. Jesus I always wanted to go to America but I think now I will go to London first, pick up a fake but charming accent and then go for girls in America. Christ that's so bullshit but it's Christmas who gives a damn, believe whatever you want to believe. But I never thought that prime minister of England will actually fall for a girl in that manner, that's really silly of the story writer but it's Christmas again.Overall LOVE ACTUALLY is a movie with poor acting performances braced and hushed by a good screenplay and directing with some help of Santa. If you are looking for a change and want to watch a movie just because you have nothing else to do I suggest you ACTUALLY watch it.",Love Actually

Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman...every actor in it (Keira Knightley) completely glowed. They want another two lines.

644,LadyFilmNoir,A Classic,10,24 November 2009,"This movie is a wonderful look at love in a light, fun, and heart warming manner. Other reviews which go into more negative aspects forget the purpose of this movie. This is not a story about ""perfect"" people. This is a movie whose characters have faults. They are not perfect. Love is not about being perfect or always ending cleanly. I believe people expect a movie to depict love stories in the same way always but this is new, its different, it is a new classic.Also, this is a movie for adults. Not that it is crude or anything, rather it is just mature. For example, there are two characters who are body doubles (not porn stars as some people have misinterpreted) and there is nudity in those scenes. However, with that said if you pay attention to the interactions and dialogue between the two characters it is truly an adorable situation.This is a movie that should be watched when you want to feel warm and happy inside. It is not the deepest movie, but it is fun and one of my personal favorites. I watch it every December before Christmas, but it makes me happy all year round.",Love Actually
645,MCCRJONE,Curtis sure knows how to do frothy. But its still good.,10,2 December 2003,"This film was a real surprise for someone who really isn't in to the rom-com, sappy-happy gook that i expected this to be. Richard Curtis is a fine director although his portrayal of England, particularly London is a bit far-fetched at times verging on an almost fairy tale representation.
However it is not the location that matters with this film but the stories and the complexities that surround them. They are issues that on the whole we can at one time in our life relate to, even if some seem at times comical in parallel to reality, most notably the body double porn stars and the almost remarkable advanced intellect of Liam Neesons' young stepson. I'll pretend that the chance of the British Prime minister falling in love with his tea lady is plausible for the purpose of my argument!Love actually succeeds in the comedy department too. Some brilliant turns are put in by Grant and the show stealing Bill Nighy. It is undeniable that this film is fluffy to say the least but does make a welcome change from some of the recent American films that seem worthless and unjustified- ""Cabin Fever"" springs to mind.Love actually should be seen by those who intend to leave the cinema feeling good about life, true the feeling may not last long but i bet it's better than the feeling you get after watching ""Cat in the Hat"", can't wait for that one!",Love Actually

Where you the viewer will be relaxing for almost 2 hours in a most excellent piece of editing and directing. The non-stars shine as good as the stars themselves. the movie is filled with punns and jokes that will make you want to see it more then once (on DVD). The movie will not bore you for one moment. The characters, and stories come together on several points and it is because of this that i regard it a top quality movie.I initially went to see Emma Thomson, Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth in action.

Stretched too thin among story lines, this movie scratches the already skimpy surface of cliché love plots. Shallow, shallow, shallow movie. I'm amazed I even finished it.I'm not an anti-romantic; some of my favorite films are Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Los Amantes del Circulo Polar, and Julio Medem films in general.

648,kiiroichan-635-638399,Why does this movie have a better rating than other chick flicks?,2,24 October 2013,"This movie probably only has a better rating than other movies of the same genre because it *desperately* stuffed, jammed and shoe-horned every celebrity in Britain. There were moments in this movie that I liked. I guess it was cute to have the Portuguese woman and Colin Firth dude to have that language barrier and fall in love. I really liked the Prime Minister's part of the story, probably the most. The naked couple with John Watson/Bilbo Baggins was cute too. Yes, there were many cute parts. The ending for the Laura Linney character was fine. It's realistic enough and I'm glad the movie gave a face to her situation so that we could understand it.Movies/shows are allowed to be cheesy, dumb, naive, fantastical and campy in my opinion. They can be all of these things and still be great. But there's such a thing as a movie that is all of these things, and happens to be *POORLY CRAFTED.* This is a pretty unconventional format -- stuffing tons of different stories into one movie, with some dozen high-profile actors and actresses. This movie did mainly 2 things to make this movie out of reach of being a good one:1. preaching its theme of ""love"" and taking itself too seriously 2. too many characters, 1 movie's-length of time to care about themInto the second half of the movie, I really didn't want to care anymore. Sure it was sweet that Colin Firth went all the way to Portuguese lady's place to propose (other than the fact that the Portuguese lady was the only option around), that's okay, but having a huge room full of people right there and applauding? What the hell else is supposed to happen? Was she going to say ""no"" and humiliate him in front of everybody? This movie didn't have to go that far to make the plot for Colin Firth's character a ""point-of-no-return-or-he-will-be-humiliated"" kind of plot.I didn't care about the dude who went to America when he first sprang the idea that the problem was his geographical location. I didn't care about the dude at all after that.The pairing I hated the most was the kid actor and the American girl. And Qui-Gon Jinn. I couldn't care less. It wasn't cute to me. It was just super annoying. It's not even about the fact that if I were a parent, I'd tell him ""You just grew your testicles, you don't know a damn thing yet,"" it's the fact that this is an R-rated movie and we're indulging this 11-year-old fictional character. Someone just decided to shove Mickey Mouse Club into the same movie with nude breast-grabbing and nude thrusting. Qui-Gon Jinn was like some sad guest on Elmo's world, trying to help Elmo chase his American love interest through the airport. The kid didn't even appear to have a care in the world about his mother who'd just died. Instead he was all down in a first-world problem 11-YEAR-OLD's ""hell-hole"" that is his shallow crush on some other girl, all just because this movie wanted to ""lovify"" *every* single character in the movie. This movie has little re-watch value to me. If there was a great piece of cake in your fridge, but 70% of it was moldy, would you eat it? Somehow this piece of moldy cake has a 7.7 on IMDb, while there's plenty of other WHOLE and FRESH tasty cakes of the same genre to relish more and are less realistic, but people have rated them much lower. Some movies with the same sort of theme (mainly chick flicks), and are pretty cheesy and naive, I'd include:Father of the Bride, Hitch, Mean Girls, Monster-in-Law, 13 going on 30, Miss CongenialitySomehow all of these movies are rated lower... but they're all fun to watch 100% through. They're all *well-crafted*. They're consistent in their tone and audience. They don't have moments like in Love Actually where I'd react, ""Wow, you serve me this on a plate and you expect me to eat it?"" This movie tried too hard to preach, and I could tell the crafting process of this movie was frantic and desperate by the ridiculous amount of casting. Could every part of this movie have been consistent with the objective of this movie? ""Love""?? Love in all forms? Shallow primal infatuation like the kid actor and the guy who comes back with some hot American girls? Even my favorite story of this movie, the Prime Minister's, was tainted. The American president was shoe-horned in there just to cheesily drive the plot forward. The president's come-on to Natalie and then the Prime Minister's come-back in return was incredibly contrived, and I felt it was very unnecessary, along with the collateral damage of some negative sentiments towards Americans (which of course isn't to be taken seriously). Was there no better way to create a rift between two characters in a plot device to ""tighten their bond""? A lot of this movie is great. Unfortunately it is thoroughly tainted by the most disruptive, disgusting parts of the movie. Shows, stories, MOVIES are *allowed* to have tons of different main characters. I'm sure it's possible for those kinds of movies to be great. But for me, the biggest flops in this movie flopped the entire movie miserably.",Love Actually
649,dodahdave,Drumroll please...,3,24 February 2004,"Another example of how a great cast does not equal a great film. There was a lot wrong with this film, and I think the flaws were overlooked by the (apparent) majority that praised it. This may have to do with the ""spirit of the season"" in which many people saw this mess. I saw it after Christmas, and I was ready to enjoy, if not love, this film based on the gushing reviews I'd heard and read, but was bewildered and confused by the end. Had everyone else seen a different movie? Was I heartless? Has Liam Neeson done ANYthing worthwhile in the last 5 years? Emma Thompson is excellent, of course, and the rest of the cast is passable to good, but there's never any real connection between any of the characters (I felt).

After peeling my mangled body from the floor of my apartment I crawled to the phone and called every movie buff I know and warned them about this foul-smelling debacle. Expecting at least good acting in a movie I knew would be a sappy British comedy, after the sixty-minute mark I begged my girlfriend to let me turn it off. I didn't even notice the misogyny until after the smoke had cleared from my head after watching two hours of bad lines, worse plot, and disastrous humor. I felt like I had been drug all over London watching stupid people doing stupider (sic) things, and drugged on a never-ending storyline that, at rare intervals, might have required a teaspoon of creativity. The portrayal of women was also completely inappropriate. It was a class struggle throughout: authoritative and powerful men and the lowly enamored women acting like they're at a Beatles concert. If you haven't seen a poorly made movie in a while, see this film. Even my girlfriend agreed that it was not at all good, and was as surprised as I was that it averaged above a 2 on the voting.

652,KyleTheGent,Love Actually is ever so bittersweet...,9,4 November 2003,"What a magnificent triumph this movie is.  In fact, it is so delightful and splendid that it requires your attention immediately.  As each holiday season approaches, blockbuster movies come with their gigantic budgets in attempt to dazzle the audience with groundbreaking special effects.  No CGI present here, this captivating movie is 100% entertainment with its wondrous dialogue.It is five weeks before Christmas in Great Britain, and love actually is all around, especially for ten or so citizens. Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) is a washed up cynical musician editing lyrics to his one hit song for Christmastime, hoping for success.  He appears on talk shows not only badmouthing boy wonder band `Blue', but himself and his manager Joe (Gregor Fisher).  Enter Jamie (Colin Firth) who admiringly tells his girlfriend (Sienna Guillory) he loves her three times before he leaves work, comes home early, only to see her cheating on him with his brother. Only in Amer.err.England.Meanwhile, Daniel (Liam Neeson) is struggling ever much so with the loss of his wife, and is trying to make a connection to his stepson Sam (Thomas Sangster). Helping him cope is Karen (Emma Thompson) who fears that her husband Harry (Alan Rickman) might be having an affair with his secretary Mia (Heike Makatsch).  Karen's brother, the newly elected Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) has seemingly fallen for his maiden Natalie (Martine McCutcheon).  Wedding Bells are ringing for Juliet (Keira Knightley) and Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) which crushes Peter's best friend Mark (Andrew Lincoln), because Juliet is his deepest desire.  I couldn't possibly forget Colin Frissel (Kris Marshall) who proclaims he is a sex god but is stuck on the wrong continent, and embarks on a voyage to America.The romances and twists in this movie are just as unpredictable as the human heart. The movie seems to have the right amount of relationships that intertwine, as it never rushes itself and is easily understood.  It is thoughtful and romantic, and hilarious at the same time.  Perhaps it is the movie's ability to never actually sympathize with any one character, allowing each person to stand out. You'll be surprised at how the movie goes the opposite direction at times, always keeping the audience wondering.  Mark seems to be infatuated with Peter for a good portion of the movie, and we relieving laugh when Daniel's dread turns out to be that little 9-year old Sam is tortured by the agony of love (what else?). Richard Curtis deserves much appraisal not only for writing the script, but for his directing debut. Whatever ends up happening in Love Actually might not be exactly as you had hoped for. It closes most of the doors, but leaves some open. One character in the film states, `Life is full of complications and interruptions.' However, after you see this film, it will help you realize what is truly important, even though it tells you in the title.(4 out of 5)",Love Actually

656,RickJones-1,A New Christmas Classic,9,29 November 2003,"LOVE, ACTUALLY holds the promise of becoming an evergreen Christmas special. The theme that love is all around is treated in a humorous and adult fashion that most people over the age of 16 can relate to.  The film has whimsy, pathos, mild erotica and some old fashion romance.  If you have ever been in any of the situations as portrayed in the film then you will come away from this film with some memories that have been once again re-energized.More than the stories is the spectrum of British and American talent on the screen.  It is really hard to beat Hugh Grant, Colin Firth and Alan Rickmann.  The performance of the Portuguese maid to Colin Firth's writer's role was winsome and very authentic.If you do not leave the cinema with a smile on your face and perhaps a tear in your eye then you might want to contemplate a monastic existence.",Love Actually
657,TasTigger,"Not Perfect, but worth seeing",8,10 January 2004,"Love Actually has something in it for anyone who has ever loved someone. And that's pretty much everyone, as this movie is not just about romantic love, but love in all it's forms. It also explores the love we feel for family and friends, and our attempts to reconcile that with romantic love.Some of the story lines were better than others. Hugh Grant, while amusing, plays himself again. And the thought of him as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, is not far short of farcical. However, this was made up for by the touching storyline played out by Emma Thompson of the wife who finds herself being overlooked by her husband, for a young flirtatious woman at his work.Also, the storyline about the body doubles standing in for actors in nude sex scenes. While this was pretty ridiculous on the surface, it was a great story for two reasons. Firstly, the fun it poked at the quaint English manners - it would be hard to think of a less appropriate setting for such formality. And secondly, I think it made a very interesting point which to me was the background theme of the whole movie - that what really matters in human relationships is not just the physical (that is easy to come by), but an emotional connection. Without that, we are just going through the moves, without really knowing the other person.The other thing I liked about this movie was the use of the airport arrivals scenes. It really tied together the fact that here was a series of stories about everyday people, and every single person has their own story. Next time I'm at the airport, I will be looking more closer at those around me, and wondering what interesting story has brought them there.All in all, I would recommend this movie. If you have ever loved, you will find something in it you relate to.",Love Actually
658,Sujana,Festival Spirit,9,26 December 2003,"'Love Actually' makes you want to make the festive season a very special one by being completely open and expressive about your heartfelt desires. And, even though love does not always end the way we want it to, the feeling of being in love and loving for the sake of love just adds to the spirit of the season.A movie worth watching for the Prime Minister's characterization & for a little child's emotions(Liam's son).There is no better time to let somebody know that you love them - than during this season..and the movie is full of that spirit.",Love Actually

It's not to say that there haven't been halfway decent or even good films coming from the Director (Donnie Brasco) or from the writer (Notting Hill) or even the typically smarmy star (Hugh Grant in about a boy) but Come on, no more dreary funerals and/or weddings, no more nine months of gestative agony and please no more films with that f**cking Natalie Cole song!",Love Actually

The dry, British humor, along with the crazed characters make for an absolute hit! I saw the movie on one of my movie channels several times, and finally went out and bought it! It is great! Perfect date movie, or even a perfect movie if you just want to sit back and enjoy a great laugh! See this movie.Beyond the great, lovable characters, Love Actually hits the deeper, poignant reference that even though the world is full of grief and despair, it is more full of Love.Great performances by Colin Firth and Hugh Grant (a pair seen often lately, Bridget Jones), unforgettable heart-felt performance by Liam Neeson, not to mention an unforgettable screen presence of Keira Knightley!I agree with the almost cliché reference on the front cover of the movie: ""The ULTIMATE Romantic Comedy.""

The same goal is set, and they're up and running but unfortunately they're not in the same picture, and the stories themselves are just not specific and structured well enough. The same comment goes for ""Magnolia"" as well. Each little story had much potential into becoming something else. Some of the ideas were actually very heart warming, some you can relate to, and some that were just plain silly but very lovable to watch.

662,mitchells,"I Love It, Actually",9,7 January 2005,"Love Actually is the kind of a movie that tells multiple stories with a common thread, in this case love (shocker, I know). The different stories give different perspectives on such a touchy subject in Hollywood. The love stories depicted in the movie are quite real and not just a romanticized view of a love that nobody could have as in ""The Notebook."" I commend Richard Curtis for making such a down to earth movie regarding the values of love, because let's face it, these days we have been exposed to a Hollywood romance that could never happen in real life.While it may run on the long side of things, I found the stories engulfing enough not to notice. The cast is all-star and some of Britain's best (including fellow American Laura Linney). It is a feel good movie, and it is the ultimate romantic comedy. It has the humor, it has the romance (including the gritty parts of love that people forget about), and it also has a nice holiday touch to it. It is the kind of movie you can watch any time of the year for a pick me up, and the kind of movie you can watch every Christmas because it has that magic quality to it.

664,takemeout,Fantastic Film,10,30 March 2006,"I am an 18 year old, pretty much average guy, and would never ever admit to enjoying a chick-flick, but there was something very different about this one. It was immense. I can honestly say that this is one of my favourite films of all time. It has a beautiful and very well written story line, and genuine characters. Every one of us could relate to at least one of the character in this film, and it is also very funny. It also has a star studded cast, with many household names, such as Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman, Emma Tompson and a cameo from Mr Bean (Rowan Atkinson) himself. As an added bonus Keira Knighly is absolutely stunning! I wish all romantic comedies were this good.",Love Actually
665,marilyncarnahan,A Movie With a Big Emotional Heart,9,31 December 2013,"I loved this movie. My favorite couple was Jamie(a writer) and Aurelia (his Portuguese housekeeper). These two are just so darned cute, and it doesn't hurt that I am a HUGE Colin Firth fan. I also loved David (Hugh Grant), England's newly elected Prime Minister, who finds himself attracted to his catering manager. Add the story of married couple Harry and Karen, played by Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson (Could these two ever give a bad performance?) Then there were some story lines I just didn't like. The ""boy with a crush on a girl who doesn't know he exists"" is too cliché, and a horny guy who travels to Wisconsin to meet girls because he is convinced they will fall for his British accent is just silly. The story of Sarah and Karl had potential, but I disagree with her choice not to pursue the romantic love she deserves. While some might see this as a deep, sacrificial love, it left me feeling sad. Overall, Love Actually is easily one of my favorite films. It was released in 2003, a time when many people, particularly Americans, needed a feel-good movie to make us believe once again in the power of love. Love Actually delivered.",Love Actually
666,PhilippaS,One of my favorite movies,10,19 April 2005,"I have watched this movie at least ten times and each time I notice nuances that I missed before. The story is a little confusing at the beginning but all the strands come together as the characters' lives intertwine. It is very romantic. One of the most moving love scenes occurs between the Colin Firth character and his Portugese cleaner. They talk to each other without being able to understand the other's language. They don't even touch but the passion is lying just beneath the surface. The movie covers most aspects of love, from unrequited love, selfless love and betrayed love to first love, optimistic love and shy love. The movie is funny but at the same time sad. It's serious but contains moments of farce. The pacing of the action works well, keeping the viewer interested. The musical score adds to the enjoyment. This is a ""must see"" movie",Love Actually
667,katinka1969,The only film that's ever made me feel angry,1,16 December 2005,"As a fan of Richard Curtis's previous material, in particular Blackadder, Four Weddings, Bridget Jones etc. I was sorry to miss Love Actually at the cinema, and finally got around to watching it on DVD months later. However, the film was so appallingly bad it's taken me some time to find the words to review it. I admit that I was immediately biased against it after the opening scene with the incredibly tasteless remark about September 11, however I was prepared to overlook this as an unfortunate lack of judgement and have faith that the rest of the film would make up for it. Sadly things just got steadily worse.So many story lines, so little substance, and so much complete tripe: the honourable British PM falling in love with his Eliza Doolittle clone of a tea lady, while standing up to the oafish American president (a dig at Blair and Bush that didn't work at all); Martine McCutcheon, in the role of said tea lady drove me to distraction (OK we get it  tough girls from South London say ""f*ck"" a lot  it really ain't that funny); the storyline with Liam Neeson and that scarily annoying kid was teeth-grindingly horrid; the porn stars smiling away and having a wonderful time at work was just plain offensive; and by the time the dorky guy brought back the stereotypically hot chicks from the US, I just wanted to yell at the screen in frustration. And in response to those who defend the film on the basis of ""it's fantasy, it's not meant to be realistic, you're missing the point etc."" - I beg to say it is you who is missing the point - some of the most brilliant films in the history of cinema have been unrealistic, however the problem with the contrived crap in Love Actually was the fact that it was unfunny and most of the plot lines totally pointless.Frustratingly, the few stories that had potential here were cut short: Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman's characters' marriage problems could have been expanded upon, giving the viewer more of a chance to identify and sympathise with them; it may have been interesting to have some explanation of Laura Linney's character's relationship with her mentally ill brother and the rest of her family; some background on Colin Firth's character and the Portuguese girl may have helped to explain how they came to be so attracted to each other - as it was their relationship didn't seem believable in the least. The only mild saving grace was Bill Nighy's ageing rocker doing his Christmas No. 1  however it was nowhere near enough to redeem the film from the rest of the drivel.",Love Actually
668,asailer,One of my favorites!,10,6 June 2005,"I bought this movie because it was buy one get one half off at blockbuster used. My best friend had said it was OK, so I figured, eh, it's cheap, I'll try it out. And I am SO glad that I did because it has become one of my all-time favorites. It's sweet and charming and sad and depressing all at the same time. It shows so many different sides of human emotion that no matter who you are or where you are in your life, you will be able to relate somehow. It's one of those movies you can watch over and over and find something new that you like about it each time. However, I think my favorite part was the scene with the posters and Kiera Knightly. Not only is she beautiful, but that part of the movie is so hopeful and sorrowful that it pulls you and grabs you into the scene with the actors, and they in turn make it feel believable. I think watching this type of fantasy movie is good sometimes. It sort of puts you in holiday mode and reminds you that there is love in the world, actually.",Love Actually

The casting is superb - Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson, and Emma Thompson are breathtakingly wonderful.. and Rowan Atkinson, and the kids who play Liam Neeson-son (and his his girlfriend too) steal the show.The two shy porn stars are fun to watch, but, alas, means I can't give this movie a blanket ""go see it"" recommendation.",Love Actually
670,LeonoraDamone,My favourite 'Love' themed movie!,10,27 February 2015,"I am usually not a sappy romantic movie sort of person, I like some Rom-coms but the comedic side has to be strong and the romance has to be realistic, not melodramatic. ""Love actually' fulfilled all the criteria for me, I like the fact that the ""love' portrayed in there covers all aspects of it, not just romantic love, but filial love, stale love, fake love, free love, love of fame, unconditional love, conditional love, unrequited love etc. They are not afraid to portray betrayal of love as well and the pain that comes along with it. The casting for the movie is excellent and every single scene in there is enjoyable for me, I like the way they edited and piece together the movie in little vignettes form. It helps keep you hooked and focus. And of course, the script and humor in there for me is amazing! A couple of stories in there are over-the-top exaggerated, but thankfully, they have other good stories woven in there to help offset the 'roll your eyes' moments. But all good tongue-in-cheek fun I think. All in all, a very well scripted, directed and acted movie. Still my go to on date nights and days when I am bored and in need of some light uplifting entertainment.",Love Actually
671,JackieBlu,"Misogynistic, actually. Smarmy too",1,8 October 2005,"Well now I know it's true. And I'm sad about it. British people aren't smarter or funnier than Americans. Although a higher percentage of them might be able to spell the word ""p...a...n...d...e...r"".But who were they trying to pander to? It really ticks me off to market a film as a ""women's movie"" when every female character over 30 ends up sad, alone, or dead.Where to begin: Well, the Liam Niessen story was unseemly. An eleven year old boy's mother has just died, and he's left alone with his step dad, and the boy's biggest concern is ""falling in love"" with a classmate? I know life goes on and all that, but honestly, life doesn't go on in this way, and I don't find the practice of projecting adult thoughts into eleven year old bodies humorous or poignant.And the bereaved husband, who is so torn up about losing his perfect wife that he can't complete her eulogy, ends the movie by falling in love with Claudia Schiffer. Perhaps this is realistic, if your wife dies, you should expect to end up with a Claudia Schiffer supermodel or her look-alike. But I don't find it charming. I find it smarmy.And Colin Firth (40 something) is going to meet and fall in love with a beautiful Portugese cleaning woman (20 something) with whom he's never had a conversation, but first, the filmmakers have to get rid of his wife, while turning Firth into a ""sympathetic"" victim. How will the filmmakers get rid of his wife so he can fall in love with a much younger woman without the audience realizing he's really just a cad? They accomplish this by having Colin Firth's British wife sleep around on him for no apparent reason in a really callous way. Then she leaves him and he's so so depressed, for about a week. He wonders why all the women he marries betray him. Perhaps, I thought to myself, it's because he falls in love with women who don't speak English and marries them?I confess I found the actress who plays the cleaning woman to be the most charismatic in the movie. And if the rest of the movie wasn't so godawful, I might have let this storyline pass, but then, the filmmakers have to stick in cheap shots at her oh so comically peasant-like father and her horrible fat sister. Incredibly, the fat girl's own father seems to hate her, and the filmmaker seems to expect the audience to sympathize with him while he is nasty to her. Wonderful chick flick, huh?. Clearly, Love is All Around. And Keira Knightley is so beautiful and she's all of 19 or something and she's going to marry a black man who is perfect and handsome and rich and completely incidental to the storyline. In fact, the perfect black man isn't important at all, except to signify that Keira Knightley is funky and liberal and has something to her besides her looks. Because we neither know nor care about anything else about her. She's young, she's beautiful, she has an overbite, she's going to be married. She might as well be Elizabeth Taylor in Father of the Bride.Laura Linney's story is actually touching. And she acts it well. She's got to care for her brother, who's mentally ill. But he lives in a HOME! Why should this prevent her from having a relationship? Probably, because she's over 30. Again, if this were the only story about a 30 something woman ending up alone, through her own fault, I'd buy it. But it's the confluence of all these anti-women story lines that I just can't take.Poor Emma Thomson and Alan Rickman work to save this movie. It's not unrealistic to think of an older bossman bonking the young female help. I don't mind this storyline, but...again...it's a little hard to see the witty and wise Emma ending up in a compromise of a marriage, while Liam Niesan's character ends up with Claudia Schiffer. Bill Nighy does best with his role as a star performer who puts out a cheesy single, promotes it shamelessly, and has the grace to prove his loyalty to his manager, rather than going out to a fashionable party. Good thing his manager was a fat 40 something man instead of a slim 30 something female, or he'd have been left alone in the cold too.I am a fan of Four Weddings and a Funeral despite the fact that Andie MacDowell couldn't keep up with the British cast, but with this new effort I am officially giving up on light British ""romantic"" comedies. I prefer the boys in the American Pie series to the cads in this movie, and the caddish screenwriters and producers who dared to market this film as a feel good fantasy for women.",Love Actually
672,the_skywalker,It was pretty crap,5,5 January 2008,"My feelings for this movie are ambiguous, to put it lightly.The characters couldn't have been more two-dimensional. There was no effort put in to make the characters believable. Instead of trying to expand on different aspects of potentially brilliant characters, several more uninteresting, 'flat' characters are shoved in our faces.So many story lines were pointless. So two people are body doubles in a porn film. And they fall in 'love'. So what? What is the point of that storyline, other then to have multiple sex scenes shoved down our throats? And what was the point of the 'secret admirer' of Keira Knightley? Admittedly there were a few good scenes in this storyline, but there was no climax. He tells her how he feels. Then what? Did the writers forget this storyline? I would include the Bill Nighy storyline here too, but there were several redeeming scenes. The story was pointless, but somewhat entertaining.The swearing was overdone. Yes, have swearing if you wish. Swearing can work well to develop characters, add tension to a storyline. When used in the right places it can also add comedy. But the writers don't take any notice of this-they include swearing for the sake of it. After the first scene it just wasn't funny anymore. Martine McCutcheon's swearing seemed very forced-if it seems forced, that indicates that it has no purpose there.I could go on, but for now I'll just give some credit to the actors. They worked with what they were given, they did their best (overall) to add characterization to the cardboard cutouts they were given to work with. Some were more successful then others.Five out of ten. But only because of the acting and one storyline. Anyone who watched the movie will know which storyline I mean.",Love Actually

But I took a pass on this one -- maybe there were too many other ""serious"" films around at the time, maybe it just sounded corny -- don't remember. But after much prodding from a girlfriend of mine I decided to rent the DVD last year. Two hours and some minutes later I was wiping the tears from my eyes and hitting the play button again. And again.Sure, this film is flawed. Not all of the stories work as well as others. Some of the characters and their actions may make even the most forgiving viewer cringe. But writer-director Richard Curtis has forged one of the most enchanting, heartwarming, humorous and ultimately moving testaments to the joy and pain of love that I have seen in years.Tonight, I was channel surfing and stopped to watch ""just a minute"" I told myself.

I mean, really, just how long would it take you to drop dead from alcohol poisoning after playing the ""Drink Whenever a Comment is Made About a Woman's Weight"" game? 10 minutes? I also thought that the (insert cute animal) known as the ""older man, much younger woman"" romance was officially beaten, buried, and reincarnated into an entirely different thing (I think it became a teapot, but I need to check on that)? I also enjoyed how practically all the female characters tore each other down - the character's comment about her ""fat"" and ""ugly"" sister is but one example. Whee! Self-loathing is neat! Please. I don't expect romance movies to be oh-my-gosh!-gushy and fake self-actualizing. However, when a movie purports to be about romance but uses such negative depictions of women to portray ""romance,"" I'm disappointed and more than a bit irritated.If you want a good romantic movie that won't make you totally vomit due to either ""drinking game"" alcohol poisoning or, conversely, saccharine overload, try ""Amelie"", ""Chocolat,"" ""The Princess Bride,"" or (a bit on the groovy-weird side) ""Harold and Maude.""Don't believe the hype.

The acting was OK for what it was, but I found that I couldn't care at all about any of the characters because I knew virtually nothing about any of them. If you like this movie it must be because you like the idea of love, any love, and don't much care for any plot to explain why you would care. Ugh. Really awful.

However the film includes a couple of inappropriate and unnecessary story lines which take away from the movie. The first of these story lines includes two stand-ins for a movie who meet and fall in love while doing stand-in work for what looks like a porn film. Lets just say there is too much dialog about nipples. Secondly is a story concerning a child who has just lost his mother and finds himself in love with a girl at school.

The beginning might be a little confusing with all the flashes about different people in different settings but as the movie goes on the pieces and connections between people begin to come together. Of course this is something that has been used a lot in the last few years, knitting short episodes together in to a full story, but this movie does it in a way that doesn't seem ""old"" as in some other films lately. I must say that I haven't been a fan of Hugh Grant, the second best male actor with only two slightly different expressions, (the best still being Steven Seagal...) but he really does it in this role. In the same time he is everything he has been since Four weddings and a funeral but also something more. Much less serious, less annoying and much more fun than before. Then there are the amazing other actors like Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Keira Knightley, Laura Linney and many more. Even Rowan Atkinson in a small but hilarious role. The music is in the same time genius and a bit too obvious. Of course this is something I would use myself if I ever was in charge of choosing songs to any movie so I like it. I would definitely choose songs where the lyrics meet the movie like in this one. The songs are well-known and that might annoy some people but to me they are just right in this movie. Also the music that is conducted for the movie is great, if you're interested in the musical part of the whole thing, just check the bonus materials from the DVD. There is a lot to talk about and so many great things in this movie that I'd better stop now before I go overboard with it. If you would like to see a movie that makes you laugh, makes you cry (specially if you're a girl), has a talented cast, good music and clever dialog, see this. Even if you're not a fan of the genre.",Love Actually

No, really, I mean it. I'm in a ""loving relationship"" and came out of this film really satisfied with the diverse way it handles different types of love -- family, unrequited, good old-fashioned seduction -- as well as the completely new take it manages to bring to the good old fashioned chick flick. Some cutting comments and amusing witticisms, many fairly subtle and definitely a treat to observe - I'll be going back a second time to pick up on the sub-sub-threads I missed. The ending is particularly clever as it brings all the mini-plots together, and although there is little backstory on the characters themselves, the situations are well-described (for example, instead of just people looking soulful, actually using a 'language barrier' to show feelings that the characters couldn't say to each other -- particularly clever, in my opinion).Overall, it's a fantastic film for anyone in love or who has been, and although it has a bittersweet ending, you leave satisfied that it could be -- and indeed is, in many ways -- very true. The timing of the release in England couldn't be better, and we've had a good old laugh at the cardboard stereotypical Americans time and again during this film - no wonder the IMDB reviews aren't brilliant.An excellent opportunity to see almost a Who's Who of British comedy all in one place.",Love Actually

699,dominich4,"A highly amusing film with only minor disappointments, thankfully overshadowed by the huge number of good points",7,30 December 2007,"In the evening after everyone but the spices had left, we sat around, looked at Grandad Arthur and Grandma Eileen's old photo albums and newspaper cuttings, particularly Dad's baby photos, and at nine o'clock we watched the film version of the history boys, by which I was suitably impressed. When everyone else went up to bed, me Katie and Jez stayed downstairs to watch Love Actually, which was also well done, its humour and fragmentary plot, not to mention the skillful interrelation of the characters, skilfully concealing and nullifying the few predictable elements of the plot. Despite my enjoyment of the film I was nevertheless disappointed that all the main characters who found love were 'beautiful people' and that all the ugly people were portrayed as basically being rubbish, all the shy people being portrayed as devoid of any merit entirely even beneath their exterior. The one shy character in the story, whom I was able to identify with on some levels, was basically ruined for me by the fact that he was a) a beautiful person and b) his character gave false hope to stalkers that rather than running away screaming and telling their friends what a weirdo you are, the stalkee is more likely to think it's sweet and be really quite sorry she's already seeing someone else.As for the casting, Kris Marshall was astounding as always, especially since (for instance with his role in Dr Zhivago) he has proved to me that although he is often typecast as a happy-go-lucky innocent chappy following his performance in MY Family, it is not the be-all and end-all of his acting talents.Bill Nighy was also spectacular. The casting of Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister and inclusion of a token 'chirpy cockney' were unfortunately disappointing, as although Grant's talent in RomComs is legendary, it does require one to forget that the delightfully confused, hurt, or let-down expression just shown by that close-up is the exact same one as in every other film he's ever been in. In contrast to Marshall, Grant has never shown me any kind of flexibility, and his inclusion as a stock character instantly recognisable not as his character but as 'oh there's Hugh Grant again in another RomCom' destroys the illusion for all but the most committed viewer. Perhaps a small change such as a beard or the removal of his apparently plastic hair, or some similarly superficial change, might alter this? Probably not. Granty, get into some film where you are neither the chirpy British love interest nor the evil British villain, or I will never watch one of your films again! Hands on the table, I also do not like Kiera Knightley in this role (although a big thumbs up on Atonement, eh?) but Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Bill Nighy and many others were extremely well cast.",Love Actually

703,baidurja_ray,A charming first-time watch,8,30 January 2009,"Love Actually is an out-and-out feel-good movie. It does not try to portray highly believable characters or an intense storyline.....however, it delineates the lives of people from various walks of life searching for love in their own ways, in a sweet, light-hearted and I must say,very enjoyable manner. The opening credits featuring Billy Mack's Christmas song sets the tone for the film.......sweet and funny. And throughout, it never loses that touch.......often producing surprisingly touching moments like the scene where Mark (Andrew Lincoln) expresses his love for Juliet (Keira Knightley) or when Billy Mack acknowledges his feeling for his 'chubby' manager. If you are in a mood for a light-hearted, funny, sweet and romantic musical, in my opinion, not many films can get better. I would not like to speak about the blemishes, because in the end, I believe these kind of movies want you to come out with a good feeling inside you, which this film accomplishes gracefully. Maybe I would never want to watch the entire movie again, but the first time watch was certainly charming and enjoyable.",Love Actually

Let's forget all of this Four Weddings and a Funeral crap because this movie was a better movie. Each individual storyline added something to the film. The almost seamless transitions from scene to scene make it quite easy to follow for a film with such a complex plot. I was unbelievably touched by the interaction between Liam Neeson and his stepson. The development of their relationship could have been a movie in itself. However, blended with the them ""Love actually is all around,"" their interaction strengthens this argument. I think some of the users have read too much into Hugh Grant being Hugh Grant because it fits what Curtis wants to do. he wanted Grant to be eccentric and odd around Natalie because although he was a powerful man he was uncomfortable in the dating setting. Knightly puts forth a stellar performance in her limited roll, and Rown Atkinson and Alan Rickman both are tremendous.this movie is a careful reminder that we are able to see love in our daily life as long as we look for it. In our troubled world, that idea has been lost. We are reminded to cherish friendship, act on love, and allow others to act on their love for us.SEE THIS MOVIE. BUY THIS MOVIE.

I particularly enjoyed Hugh Grant's portrayal of the British Prime Minister. His speech denouncing the actions of the President were wonderful. I really wanted to stand up and cheer. If only politicians could be so bold and eloquent! The interaction between the two characters who didn't speak a common language was really fun, and I thought it was refreshing that neither of them spoke the other's language fluently even after taking language lessons.

Maybe it was the expectation that Alan Rickman would be drop-kicked by Bruce Willis in an unexpected cameo...maybe it was the hope that Tony Blair would step in to rescue the poor secretary's reputation...and produce another dossier of Hugh's ungentlemanly conduct! The simulated sex scene was...well...for a moment I thought it was cinema verite of a typical British tryst, but that would be unkind.No, despite the disappointment that ALL of the scenes I saw were actors going through the motions, what finally caused me to flee the theater in disgust was the glimpse of...yes, you guessed it...the Love Boat along the Thames! Really! Go back and take another look! Just below the giant Ferris Wheel! Tell the theater owners that you'll take a free showing in exchange for my refund.Before I got up to walk out, I became misty, remembering all the 1970s actors who had found a new life on the decks of the Pacific Princess. The formulaic attentions of Doc, Isaac and Gopher. If `Love, Actually' had only been a musical, it would have been excellent fun.Had I known it was so horrid (7.9 rating indeed!), I would have looked for a double-feature with Rocky Horror, and brought rice. Or, better yet, would have given Love Boat alumn Ernest Borgnine a second look in ""Super Fuzz"" since, with his latest offering, Hugh Grant has nudged that performance up from the bottom of all time depths plumbed by an actor.Anchors away!1 out of 10",Love Actually

First of all the brilliant cast must be praised-these are real actors- who really make you feel for the characters they portray and are amazingly funny.  Many of the members of this cast have been seen together many times before and that's because they work- whether in drama or comedy.   First off, Hugh Grant who stutters his way through the movie to bring, as always, hilarious fun to a character who would normally be portrayed as a stiff and manages to show that love will always prevail.  Then of course, Collin Firth who manages to make every scene he touches hilarious and yet brilliantly truthful-and shows us how love is greater than even a language barrier. There is Alan Rickman-a brilliant actor who can make you feel for any character no matter how much of silly, and see a bit of depth whether he is supposed to be funny or dramatic-in this movie he manages to pull off both the light and dreadfully dramatic beautifully as always.  He shows us foolish love. Then of course the woman who plays his wife, Emma Thompson- who deserves praise, like many of her costars in this movie, for anything she touches.  She shows us how love should be forgive and yet still makes us want to tell Alan Rickman to sod off-even if we feel for him too.  Yet again hilarious and dramatic and showing us the true nature of love.Liam Neeson and his young costar who plays his son show us the bond between a father and son and how there development for step-father and son to father and son gives everyone a warm tingly feeling inside.  Both of these actors do a brilliant job of portraying this relationship.Altogether I could go on forever about the brilliant cast however, many of which I haven't even mentioned, all of which who should be highly praised but the truth is that this film was extraordinarily crafted on all fronts. The writing of these characters was beautiful. I went in thinking I would see a brilliant romantic comedy and saw a brilliant dramatic comedy about every type of love and the true nature of love.   It was a terrific reminder that love ""is all around"" and will in the end prevail and that even though it seems that only bad things happen now-in the end you're telling people that you love them not that you hate them. This look at all the types of love was an amazing insight in to life in general and what really matters.  Everyone should see this movie especially at a time like this when all one ever sees is tragedy.  Afterall it seems that we always forget that there really is love out there and good because we're so bombarded by the bad.",Love Actually

711,allison-lillquist,Love Actually Film Review,9,5 December 2013,"Love Actually is a romantic comedy that follows the lives of many different couples. Some of the characters are young, some are old, some are falling in love and others are falling out of love. The film is set almost entirely in London, England during the five crazy weeks before Christmas. The characters of the film are played by many prominent actors and actresses, which include Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Keira Knightley, Martin Freeman, Alan Rickman, Billy Bob Thorton and Laura Linney. These actors portray the roles of friends, family and strangers who either are falling in love or out of love, mourning a lost loved one, realizing they aren't with the right person or finding just what they were looking for.The movie starts off 5 weeks before Christmas and introduces all of the characters. We see how each character lives their life in London and what their personalities are like. The main character is the new Prime Minister David who quickly begins to have feelings for his new personal assistant Natalie. David's older sister is Karen who is married to Harry and begins to realize that he smitten by his secretary, Mia, who is always flirting with him. Harry's best editor is Sarah, who has a brother that is mentally ill. She is in love with her co-worker Karl and he feels the same way about her as well. Karen is friends with both Daniel and Jamie. Daniel has just lost his wife and has discovered that his stepson is in love with a young American girl. Jamie has just found out that his girlfriend has been cheating on him with his younger brother and decides to move to France to continue writing his novel. While there he starts falling for Aurelia who is a Portuguese woman who can speak neither English nor French. Juliet has just married Peter, but soon learns that his best friend Mark has been in love with her ever since they first met. John and Judy quickly fall for each other while on set of an erotic film. There is also Colin who figures out that in order to find someone that likes him or have sex with him he needs to go to America, specifically Wisconsin. Lastly you have Billy Mack who is a burned out rock star who is climbing back up the charts with a new Christmas rendition of his old song ""Love is All Around"", which in the end relates the characters all together. The movie follows each person and couple and shows how their lives change by Christmas time.Two aspects of the film that stood out to me were the editing and background music. The editing was a great part of the movie because you learn about each and every character and are submerged into their love lives. You get to see how people are related or how they know each other. There is so much going on in everyone's lives so you would think that would be hard to film but the way the movie is edited makes it easy to understand what is happening in everyone's life and who they are connected to. In movies we usually see and follow one love story, which can some times get boring, but the film keeps us on our toes and makes us want to keep watching to find out what is going to happen with each person and their situation. Another aspect is the music of the film. The main song is ""Christmas is all Around"", which is played throughout the film and sets the scene for the movie, making us think of love and Christmas. The song was originally ""Love is all Around"" but was changed for the holiday season. The song is played throughout the entire movie and leads up to Christmas, where we see how their lives and relationships played out. This song is a main theme in the movie saying that not only is Christmas all around but love is as well. Overall, this is a great film. Love Actually is one of my favorite films to watch during the holiday season. It is great to see that there are so many great actors and actresses in the film. It's always nice to see a big named cast, who in the end work great together and make a great movie. I think this is a great film for anyone who loves the holidays and Christmas. It makes me excited for the about spending time with friends and family. Also, I think this film is great for anyone who really enjoys romantic comedies. This film shows a lot of romance but not too much and there is just enough comedy to make it a good film to laugh at. The film gives us a message by saying that everyone has someone who cares for them and that it doesn't matter how old or young you are. In the end love is actually all around us, we just need to find it.",Love Actually
712,yellowdiamond,One of my favorite Fantasy Movies,10,2 December 2006,"I have seen this movie about 10 times and I will probably watch it another 50. The Brits are renowned for keeping their emotions bottled up. They agonize about embarrassing moments. They cringe at the thought of expressing their deepest hopes and dreams. Yet, one day a year, even the Brits will risk it all -- spilling out the truth - on Christmas. It's magic. Love Actually is about a proudly repressed culture that allows itself to erupt with passion, poke fun at itself, and for one day only - wear its emotions on its nation's sleeve. The story gently makes fun of America and Americans putting us on an equal plane so we can laugh at ourselves too -- and well we should. So many great scenes too.

714,BrianWatchesMovies,A fabric woven of happy and sad threads,8,19 December 2003,"What I appreciated most about Love Actually was that for the most part, it realistically looks at relationships happy and sad, successful and unsuccessful, with a future and without.  It addresses different forms and levels of love, sometimes straightforward and carefree, sometimes complex and contradictory.  There are schmaltzy happy moments and touching sad ones, moments of great strength and moments of foolish weakness.  The movie is made up of many threads, and of course some threads are stronger than others.The most interesting parts of Love Actually are the times when it addresses the tragic situations where love is self-sacrificing, contradictory, or fragile.  One character's unrequited love is revealed as a noble sacrifice made for another's happiness (the method of finally achieving closure and moving on, however, could only work in the movies).  Another character is shown to be caught between conflicting duties that will, we are led to believe, prevent her from ever being truly happy.  And the strength that a third shows when love is shown to be fragile and her world collapses around her is tragically inspiring.These noble, tragic threads are interwoven with lighthearted comedic ones to produce a fabric that holds together well.  While some characters have to fight for their love, others have simple, happy, straightforward relationships, with love (or whatever) falling in their laps like a parcel from Santa Claus.  And the purely comic moments, like Rowan Atkinson's appearances and Hugh Grant's Christmas-caroling bodyguard, are delightful in and of themselves.There are of course plenty of nits to pick.  Hugh Grant doesn't make a very believable Prime Minister, and even his very pointed speech to his American counterpart -- especially relevant in light of Bush's recent state visit to England -- don't redeem the odd casting.  Others in this forum have commented on the number of fat jokes in the film, and while I agree, I feel I should point out that the entire point of the first such joke is that the character who has fallen for the ""fat"" girl clearly doesn't think of her as fat, and doesn't understand at first who the other is talking about. It's true that calling her fat is ridiculous; she's only large in comparison to Keira Knightley, who must be carrying some vital organs around in her handbag because there's certainly not enough room in her torso!  But that one time would have been enough; the ""fat"" theme gets tiresome later on in the movie.  I also agree with those who have said that much of the nudity is completely unnecessary to the plot, and that at least some of the comedic threads in the movie are formulaic and unoriginal.In the end, I feel that Love Actually is for the most part a thoughtful and entertaining look at relationships, which does not shy away from taking the bad with the good.",Love Actually
715,fenn911,Feel good British film of the decade,10,6 December 2011,"Love Actually is an ultimate feel good movie with an all star and all age cast, including Hugh Grant who has become a Rom-com phenomenon. Bill Nighy is particularly good as the drugs, sex and rock and roll radio DJ. The film on the whole is of course about love, with intertwining stories all coming together in its feel good Christmas cheer finale. A sure tear jerker and as funny as ever, this film won't hesitate to please, even for those who think twice before seeing a Rom-com. The film delves deep into the idea of love and relationships, and deals with the good parts and the bad. The soundtrack fast became a sweeping success, with music from the beach boys and the classic 'all i want for Christmas is you' from the Mariah Carey, the cheese factor increases tenfold.

716,Oren_Ishi,"I loved it, actually (So sad, I know)",8,6 August 2004,"What can I say? I'm a sucker for the rom coms, namely British rom coms. Give me a Hollywood one and I may not praise it as highly. I really, thoroughly enjoyed this film. It makes you feel good about yourself, especially if you're with someone although I fear it could have the opposite effect on those who aren't. So what if it's a bit cheesy? OK, it gets to very cheesy when the boy-next-door turned Prime Minister Hugh Grant dances round 10 Downing Street to ""Jump for my love"". And well, the Heathrow scene at the end is a bit too much. However, all the little stories intertwined was in my opinion genius. We weren't stuck on the same characters for approximately 2 hours, but instead there was lots of variation. And the love stories weren't you're average boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, love is destroyed by something major, boy follows girl to airport stories. The representation of all the different forms of love was excellent, from affairs to love between a brother and sister. The cast in this film is certainly worthy of note. I'm a fan of Colin Firth and Alan Rickman, and to a lesser extent young Hugh. it was brilliant to see them in a film together. This film even stopped my life long hatred of Martine McCutcheon (oh come on, who didn't hate her in Eastenders?). Liam Neeson was fabulous, Emma Thompson her ever brilliant self, Bill Nighy as the hilarious, but quite frankly a bit scary, Billy Mack and a very welcome reappearance of T.V's Rab C. Nesbitt (Gregor Fisher). I just thought it all worked and it is the perfect movie for a night in.P.S. In homage I named one of my fish Billy Mack",Love Actually

718,RosieRose86,love is all around,10,19 March 2004,"Well, first for all we had many stories together, and rather very known english actors making love stories weeks before christmas, and presents rather many situations of love we have to live in our lives (the first love, when we lost someone we love, love for a person that doesnt speaks a language we dont know, love in goverment, when we have love in marriage and have to split up, the choose between love of family and an occasional lover, and many others) and here we see many changes through movie, but dont get lost, because faces are known. Like very much actors, we have many famous names (hugh grant, bill nighly, colin firth, laura linney) as well as new leading actresses (keira knightley, martine mcchucteon) and not very known people (lucia moniz, rodrigo santoro, abraham lincoln) presenting us that love can be in life always, in many ways, and that you dont need neccesarily to have a boyfriend or girlfriend to be happy. It was very criticated because it was english, and is universally known that in Britain they dont have to show love in many ways, but I really think that love has no countries and as movie says: ""love actually is all around"".",Love Actually
719,jameskelvin,Very nice!,7,28 March 2012,"""Love Actually"" is a wonderful story about a number of individuals all bound together, some tighter than others and some hardly at all, by their appearance at and use of Heathrow airport.This is not a typical love story in which two people overcome some obstacle to fall in love with each other. Rather, it provides an insightful look into today's often misunderstood world. In a world where hate and violence are all too common, this movie shows that in reality the world is a place full of love. The simple premise of the movie is clearly stated in the opening lines by the Prime Minister that ""If you look for it, I've got a sneaky feeling you'll find that love actually is all around."" The rest of the movie sets out to prove that point. Through the normal relationships of people's lives, such as husband and wife, girlfriend and boyfriend, friend and friend, father and son, and others, we see that the world is still a beautiful place and that love is one of the most important experiences that this world has to offer.Overall I loved this movie. Although it was slightly unbelievable at parts, this movie provided a breath of fresh air from the cliché type ""chick flicks"". Overall I gave this movie a 7/10 for its enjoyability, good acting, and moving storyline.",Love Actually
720,imdb-3448,"A ""Feel Good"" movie that makes me feel bad!",1,11 December 2004,"I only watched this film because it was the in-flight movie on a long trip to South Africa, and I have a fear of flying. I tried to use it take my mind off the terror. I have never had to use the sick bag on an airliner before, but I very nearly did here, on account of this overwhelmingly schmaltzy, vomit-inducing, more awful than awful, drivel. I don't know what has happened to Richard Curtis. Once upon a time he was one half of the writing team that brought us the brilliant, the very clever and imaginative BlackAdder series. And now he appears only able to produce harmless, clichéd, politically correct humdrum stuff, vaguely funny if you've been hiding in a hole for the last 80 years.This is the man who has brought us such not-funny turkeys as Mr. Bean and The Vicar of Dibley. And now he's gone a step further backwards and written and directed something that is so sentimental, so nice and cuddly that it's downright offensive! It insults it's audience, especially when they are forced to watch it in a metal tube 20,000 feet in the air.Bill Nighy plays a mature rock star who uses expletives a lot. That's an example of the highly intellectual comedic content. That's funny? Then there's the nonsense. Stuff that has no roots in the real world, no link with an intelligent audience. For instance there's a pre-teen kid, who's supposedly in love. We're supposed to believe in him? We're supposed to care about the deluded little tyke? Then there's a Prime Minister, who's attractive, single, and a really nice guy!! Ahhh, how lovely! Arrgghh, I can't stand it! Open the doors!

I see it as the original movie to try and intertwine multiple multiple stories- an increasingly popular idea today, and it does it so well. Reinforcing the 'it's a small world' ideal. It really restores my faith in both humanity and the true meaning of Christmas. Such fabulous use of an abundance of awesome actors. As usual Hugh Grant is awesome and wickedly funny.

727,skyegigi,"take that, bob the moo!",9,16 September 2004,"I think the film does a wonderful job of combining all the stories and relationships. I made a relationship web after I saw it, and the overlap was frightening in its complexity. It is in part because of this that it felt so real to me, despite the obvious hokeyness of everything turning out happily on Christmas Eve. The hokeyness itself is endearing, although it is also realistic that not everyone ends up completely happy: Laura Linney's character, for example. This reminds me of Amelie: Happy, but not sickeningly so. Those that do achieve it in a very humorous way (Colin landing the four hot American girls). And Billy Bob as president... my sides almost split. Other people seem to have different reactions, to some extent, than I did. I've introduced it to three other people, with a result of ""it was good"". They didn't seem to warm to it the way I did. As I am usually, I admit modestly, quite discriminating in my movie tastes, and refuse to see the crap that my friends are subjected to, it seems that this film is more about personal reactions than merely about quality. I love the warm feeling of a feel-good movie, combined with the faint stomachache of prolonged laughter. This is also a very important message for today: however disgusting things may seem, love is always there underneath. We just need to hope it surfaces in the end.",Love Actually

Colin was a total trip and so were the stand-ins. They were adorable. Hugh Grant, Colin Firth--hilarious. I felt so sorry for Laura Linney's character too. Her character was the one I admired the most. She sacrifices so much. Oh my gosh. OK it was just too hard to choose one story as a favorite. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastical!

729,ale82pineapple,"Lovely and easy to watch, full of hope",9,11 January 2005,"Richard Curtis was already an expert as far as romantic comedies are concerned (he was the writer of Marshall's ""Notting Hill"", for instance), but in this movie he manages to innovate the genre. First of all, there's no protagonist, and the story, rather than being centered around a character, is centered around a place, London, and a time of the year, Christmas. The viewer begins to love all the people that come on screen, and all the actors (among them Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson) are good; the music is absolutely perfect for setting the mood, shifting continuously from diegetic to non-diegetic and underlying the most important moments in each character's story. Some of the stories are realistic, others are definitely fantastic, but the film manages to be really uplifting, and even if sometimes too cheeky, it succeeds in entertaining the viewer. People want to believe that ""Love Actually is all Around"", even if sometimes it's not visible; dreamers are all around! Do we believe in things because they're true, or do things become true as we believe in them? Especially as far as human relationships, projections of our desires and fears build them day by day, more than actual events: falling in love is a pure and extreme act of faith. I like this movie, it makes me smile every time I watch it, and that's a lot; it conveys hope, even when showing betrayal and gloomy situations, and love needs hope. It doesn't tell everything about love, but what movie or what work of art, generally speaking, can be complete and satysfying about something so mysterious, so different in shapes and developments? A lovely movie, definitely.",Love Actually

This movie is sprinkled with cheesiness. And I loved it.As others have pointed out, it is a FANTASTIC date movie. Love, Actually not only plays to the sentimental-tacky love that women drool over, but it also plays to the more ""raw"" male humor.

733,ezppl,Sexist nonsense actually,1,21 December 2015,"I have never felt it necessary to write a review before. However I feel compelled to do so having watched this film last night. My wife and I looked on utterly flabbergasted as sexist stereotypes and 'awkward English' clichés spewed forth before our eyes. It's the sort of film I will be actively encouraging everyone I ever meet for the rest of my life to never watch, even for 'a bit of fun' - it really is that bad. Why? Several reasons, not least of which is the despicable misrepresentation of women throughout the film. For some reason all women are in a subservient role, for example secretaries, cleaners, housewives etc. while all men are powerful: writers, creative directors, photographers, Prime Ministers(!) etc. We witness many men lustfully pursuing women and manipulating them to their own end. Lessons to be learned here are for example that being a man and not being able to form a relationship in your own country is not a problem because you can go to another and women will throw themselves at you; a dad advises his son to take up drums because Ringo Starr has a beautiful girlfriend he's a drummer in a band; also, we are to look out for attractive 'femme-fatale' secretaries who will try to lead us astray from our middle- class English family unit. This movie is not a 'bit of fun' - it is a dangerous mix of off-the-shelf, ill-considered, misogynist fantasy which confuses love with sex, all from a disturbingly predatory male- centric viewpoint. When I give it 1 star, I mean it - it is utterly awful. Free-thinkers - avoid this movie and encourage others to follow.",Love Actually

I'm a big fan of this type of storytelling, where multiple stories intertwine. It's an all star cast of recognizable faces and much loved stars, but more than that it's filled with stories that will make you laugh, cry, and long to see that happy ending we all crave. I don't want to give away anything if you've not seen this film before, so I'll just say this; give this film a chance to enchant you and make you smile-but keep a tissue box handy!!

735,tub_master_flex,An Instant Romantic Classic: Without the Cheese,9,26 December 2006,"Whenever I see previews for a romantic-comedy involving Hugh Grant, usually I automatically make a mental note to not see that film. But this movie just felt different than the usual sappy smooch flick. That, combined with a high IMDb rating, provoked me to see this one.Love Actually is a romantic comedy that thoughtfully shows different people (of different race, age, etc.) that are all involved in some predicament with love during the time around Christmas (unofficially Valentine's Day's long, lost brother). Love throws so many twists and curve balls at every individual in this movie. Yet each character attempts to rebound and step up to get what they can.For one, it was fortunate to be blessed with a great cast with great direction. Even Hugh Grant (to an extent) is believable. There's some great character development which is brilliantly pulled off, considering the amount of characters. They all wonderfully demonstrate so many natural emotions that are a result of love- whether they are successful or not. There's bound to be at least one character that you'll find yourself relating to by the end of the movie.The writing is great. It lacks all that sappy cheesiness usually found in these movies. It's very sincere and true. Even clever, at times. It all seems to mesh perfectly with the acting- the mark of a good film.Music adds so much to a movie- and this movie got a huge help from the great audio selections. Everything from a in-movie cover of ""All You Need is Love"" to occasional Beach Boys tracks. These feel-good songs really put a lot of emphasis on how great love can really can be.This movie is a true gem and a must-see. I wish there could be more movies like this one; a movie that really finds a solid, pleasant subject-matter (in this case, love) and sticks to it. It never deviates from it. I usually stray away from most romantic-comedies because I'm single and get irritated at how much most movies from that genre rub romance in your face. But this movie does it in a way which leaves you hopeful and satisfied. You feel good about yourself. And therefore, I strongly recommend this movie to anyone.9 out of 10.",Love Actually
736,spellzbreaker,I can't describe it in words,10,12 June 2006,"I fanatically despise love movie or any kind of movie about love. At first, the reason I bought this movie was because I heard Elisha Cuthbert was in it. I watched this film from the most subjective point of view with no expectation or whatsoever and I felt no embarrassment after my perspective of romance film to make this statement. This film has astonished me from the minute I click the ""play button"" until the very end. There are several aspects and factors that made me considered ""Love Actually"" on the top of my list. The music was wonderful, the casting was superbly perfect and the story was beautiful, but what is most important is the message in this peace of art. I believe the film is trying to remind us of something which we thought to be very important but barely exist, love (which cover peace and all the other beautiful feeling of life). After 11 Sept (which was mentioned at beginning of the film)and following the other terrorists assault, hate has spread between Nations, Race and Religions. Many peoples include myself starting to assume that we live in a world of hatred and greed and we become disgusted our self and in my opinion this film have succeeded in giving a good example of what they are trying to tell by taking example of the life of several different people from variety social level, from a kid who just lost her mother to a new selected prime minister.

There are relationships you can relate to, ones you can't understand and others that make you cry. The movie explores all facets of love, physical, emotional, unrequited love, unending love, young love, forbidden love, etc. etc. Set around a background of Christmas, and some might call it a holiday movie, but I find it something to watch any time of year. It does have a R rating because of language and nudity, it does have a massive star filled cast. It is not a romantic movie, nor is it even close to reality. It is a Hollywood, over the top, almost everyone gets their happily-ever-after production. But for a small period of time, I can sit back, watch people blunder around like we do in real life, and then without all the normal life stuff that gets in your way, live happily ever after(mostly.)

Their lives, hopes and dreams of finding or keeping the love that so eludes many of us.The cast is superb. I can't single out one out of them all because they are just all terrific. The way that Mr. Curtis has used music is great. The music selection plays a major role for each character and is perfect. From ""Both Sides Now"" by Joni Mitchell to Kelly Clarkson's ""The Trouble With Love Is"" is both moving and haunting and I don't think I'll ever associate these songs with anything else except this movie.

741,helluva-1,Love Actually,10,9 June 2005,"Love, marriage, funeral Every real cinema-goer knows that it must be a Richard Curtis film. It seems his films are all the same. Same places, same actors and actresses, same topic. Somehow he always has something new to say.His latest film, Love Actually was released in December 2003 and all its plot is organised around Christmas. At the beginning, we see the people at the Arrivals' Gate at Heathrow Airport accompanied by the comment of the director. ""Love actually is all around"" he says as the arriving passengers meet their friends and relatives. Later on we have to watch attentively for the usual density of plot and the abundance of characters of a Curtis movie makes it hard to understand. Marriages, proposals, cheats and kisses dominate every moment of the story. Finally, of course everybody finds his/her true love.Curtis has a natural sense of surprise and humour. The film doesn't have a dull moment and the acting performance is outstanding. Apart from the usual stars of the British film industry (such as Hugh Grant, Rowan Atkinson, Keira Knightly) we get to know many other talented artists. Few film directors can be proud of such a crew. Grant's brilliant acting as the Prime Minister is something none of those who have seen the film will forget.",Love Actually

Her role in the love affair is simply to be looked at and act grateful when he tells her she's pretty. That's it.This describes most of the love plots. 2 in particular involve NO conversations between them, and in both cases the man is rewarded for professing his ""love"" to the woman he doesn't actually know at all and has never really talked to, and the woman is really flattered in both cases - even though one of the men behaved in a very stalkerish manner, ruined her wedding photos and betrayed her husband who is supposedly his best friend, and in the other case 2 characters are ""in love"" even though they don't speak the same language and their ""relationship"" mostly involves him staring at her body.The only female characters actually given the semblance of any personality are the ones that end up with sad endings/rejections. The message seems to be that women need to shut up and be pretty to be lovable/objects of lust.Also there are lots of stupid jokes relating to women's weight that aren't funny.I will never understand why so many women love a movie so full of sexism that portrays women so poorly.",Love Actually

745,afterthoughts,like dental work....,1,22 August 2005,"Since the film came and went faster than Mike Tyson's fortunes, I'm not revealing anything that will ruin it for you, because only the opening credits will fail to disappoint you.When one bills a film as a comedy, the crowd brings a certain expectation into the theater, and that expectation was not met by this clinker. Stephen King novels have more laughs than this film.Let's start off with the first big guffaw, the death of Liam Neeson's wife. Neeson is painfully incapable of finishing the eulogy then spends the next ten minutes trying to explain the inexplicable to his son. At that point I asked my date if this was a comedy or a modern remake of Hamlet with the loss of a wife inserted for the loss of his father? I was hissed into silence by someone wearing a black duster and an air of importance.Laura Linney was next in the docket. Her special agony was an institutionalized brother for whom she was responsible, whose constant calls and cries for attention kept her from ever having a relationship. The echoes down the emotional hall were so insistent that she couldn't even get a leg up after a boozy holiday party. She ached from disappointment, and we ached for her. I nodded to the know it all in the duster, because I just knew that Neelson' eulogy was not the funny part and Laura Linney's personal hell was not the funny part, the funny part was on the way.You know the English... their humor is subdued. I was being set up for a Monty Python second act. Or so I thought...It was Emma Thompson's turn take her fair share of holiday abuse. Blessed with this wonderful woman and beautiful children and a terrific job, her husband ignores all that and decides to chuck it all for an office trollop. He goes shopping and brings home a piece of jewelry that Emma discovers in his coat pocket, assumes it's for her, but there's no joy on Xmas eve... the jewelry is not under the tree, it's destined for another and Emma's heart ends up in the punch bowl. Her agony outstrips Laura Linney's. I could go on, but let's just say that the laughs never started.The writer/director lurches into his third act by calling a perfectly fine young lady a ""cow"" because she was not pencil thin - something my date bristled at - then tried to redeem himself by having Hugh Grant - as the PM - go door to door in a working class neighborhood looking for her. He accompanies the family to a Xmas play where he steals a kiss behind the curtains and gets caught in mid-smooch when the curtains open. What a device. What a surprise. I was more surprised the eighth time I saw ""Our Town"" at the middle school down the street.Did you forget about Liam Neeson's family? The writer almost did, then he realized that he'd needed to tidy up. He had Liam's son develop a thing for an American teenager in London, and of course he has a case of lock jaw when he's around her. Somehow the kid recovers his will and races through Heathrow to catch up to her and reveals his heart before the Xmas bells stop pealing. Bet you never saw that coming...To sum up, there was very little romance and even less comedy. For a romantic comedy, that's a problem.Four Weddings and a Funeral was a good film. With all due respect given to the writer's considerable and previously demonstrated talents, this was as poorly conceived and poorly written as any film I've ever seen.",Love Actually

747,cicjose,Best romantic comedy,10,15 October 2005,"I could say that this is a regular romantic comedy but if I was to say that I would be insulting Richard Curtis because this movie is by a long way the best romantic comedy I have ever seen. Many different kinds of love are covered (although not all kinds), there's 8 story lines. This works as a movie because of the chemistry between the actors and the way each of them affected the storyline. I don't normally like Hugh Grant because he is in 90% of English romantic comedies but this is easily the finest project he has worked on and he should be given credit to what he does best and star in romantic comedies. But this movie's highlight is the last 15 minutes when all of the characters are trying to get together. This movies values and attitudes on love and the exploration of the issues behind love should be congratulated.",Love Actually

It is also a beautiful, actual portrayal of love's twists, and should include a few threads that everyone can relate to. So I am sitting here at 4am, wanting to share the moment that I've just had with you all.One of the questions in the list was what was everyone's favourite love story. Mine is the one shared by Emma Thompson/Alan Rickman, - though of course this is not one of the nicer threads. But I have just watched a particular scene (will not mention it in case those reading have not yet seen the film) and I am sitting here weeping... that's really one of the finest moments I have ever witnessed on screen... and not a single word is said.This is a stunning little film.

From the ridiculous dialog (look no further than the precocious little boy), to the insulting ""plots"" (Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister is about as bad as John Wayne playing Genghis Kahn), this movie has no redeeming qualities; It's almost as if this movie was written as a dare to see how bad a film someone could actually get released.

753,jayms05,A beautiful film to be enjoyed over and over.,10,29 July 2006,"This is one of my favorite films. It really is as the tag-line says, ""The Ultimate Romantic Comedy"". In his directorial debut, Richard Curtis, writer of Knotting Hill, Four Weddings and a Funeral, and a co. writer of Bridget Jones's Diary, shows his love of good music and understanding of how to tell a good story. The all-star cast containing some of Britain's best and brightest adds to the beautiful way this story is told. The story of several loosely intertwined lives at Christmas in Britain, this film will make you laugh and cry, and if you're like me, want to enjoy it many times. The music in this film is fantastic and the sound track is definitely worth your time. The special features on the disk includes a commentary with Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy, Thomas Sangster, and Richard Curtis and is just as entertaining as the movie itself.

754,joshnault76,Love actually is all around,9,4 October 2006,"Simply put, this is a wonderful story about a number of individuals all bound together, some tighter than others and some hardly at all, by their appearance at and use of Heathrow airport.This is not a typical love story in which two people overcome some obstacle to fall in love with each other. Rather, it provides an insightful look into today's often misunderstood world. In a world where hate and violence are all too common, this movie shows that in reality the world is a place full of love. The simple premise of the movie is clearly stated in the opening lines by the Prime Minister that ""If you look for it, I've got a sneaky feeling you'll find that love actually is all around."" The rest of the movie sets out to prove that point. Through the normal relationships of people's lives, such as husband and wife, girlfriend and boyfriend, friend and friend, father and son, and others, we see that the world is still a beautiful place and that love is one of the most important experiences that this world has to offer.Overall I loved this movie. Although it was slightly unbelievable at parts, this movie provided a breath of fresh air from the cliché type ""chick flicks"".

The humor is more cutesy than anything. I suspect this is a ""chick flick"" because it features Hugh Grant AND Colin Firth AND Liam Neeson, and.. just about every British actor ever. Somehow, it manages to overkill with the cutesy humor and the sappy plot lines about relationships. Some great acting can be found in this movie.. namely, in Emma Thompson, whose character deals with something extremely heart wrenching that most people can relate to.

757,cathdoh,Best Feel-Good movie I've seen thus far!,9,20 April 2006,"I absolutely love this movie. When I hired it on DVD I had my doubts, especially since my hopeless romantic friend had told me to hire it because it was her favourite romance at the time (her knew favourite is now the notebook). I thought it was just going to be another typical romantic movie. The people meet, cant be together for one reason or another, but then they change their situation and make it work, living happily ever after. I was wrong.This movie contains many small love stories, each very different from the last and representing a different side of what we call love. It covers the effects of affairs, the harmlessness of childhood crushes, the obsession young males tend to have with sex, the older adults who just seek true love and the chance meetings that end up forging life long relationships.This movie may confuse some at first (I know I was confused) but once you get the idea of how it works, you will quickly understand the stories and the way that they're all connected. You will leave the lounge with a smile on your face. If there was ever a movie that was made to give hope to those in the world who don't have strong beliefs in love, this would be it.Watch this movie for a feel good experience! It'll work it's magic every time.",Love Actually

Not at all the case, it has a great cast, some entertaining if not entirely plausible story lines, but a wonderful flow and sensibility. As far as movie entertainment, a great resounding bravo!

762,RSTLOUP,Crap Actually,1,18 July 2005,"I had expected from this film a relatively undistinguished, harmless little romantic comedy. What instead unfolded was two-plus hours of the most unremitting, insulting, film clichés imaginable.The film consists of nine simultaneously-running subplots. Each subplot manages to be absurdly implausible, yet predictable at every turn. Among the worst: One tracked a geeky fellow who was convinced that the way to turn his romantic life around was to impress American girls with his English accent. Each scene of that plot consisted of something like the following: ""I'm going off to the US, where the chicks will think I'm a coolly sophisticated Brit!"" (His friend): ""You're crazy!""""California girls here I come!"" ""Stop!"" And so on.And on.In the ""payoff"" scene, at film's end, he does, in fact, bag three hot American girls in a bar. Why this scene was worth endless repetition along the way is a mystery.Another similarly repetitive plot involved two people performing together in a porn film. They strike up a conversation and start forming a tentative relationship. The ""joke"" is that these strangers are being sexually intimate, yet are acting like awkward teenagers as they stumble their way to going out on a date. They're porn stars, but they're shy! Isn't that funny? Ho ho ho! This might have an amusing one-five-minute-scene joke, but this film stretches into a film-long subplot, complete with the male rejoicing over getting a good-night kiss from his new love. Barf.Perhaps the worst one involved Colin Firth. Betrayed early in the film, he's heartbroken. He is assigned a non-English-speaking housekeeper, whom it takes exactly two seconds to discern will be his romantic salvation. This subplot builds to a supposedly climactic scene where he, with a big crowd in tow, descends upon a restaurant where she works, to propose marriage. He awkwardly declares his love, shots of all of the other diners looking confused and expectant, she says yes, then everyone breaks out in applause and there isn't a dry eye to be found. Argh. This film didn't even bother to construct a buildup to this climactic moment. The two characters have barely a few verbal exchanges prior to this scene. And the film uses all of the other clichés: her brusque Mediterranean father in the crowd, her sister egging her on, etc. None of these people were actually developed characters. They are just insulting stereotypes thrown in for the final set piece.In another subplot, Hugh Grant plays a newly elected British Prime Minister. He doesn't bother to act differently from the way he normally does, the same stammering, yet somehow debonair, Hugh Grant character that he always plays.He walks in off the street to 10 Downing, and is introduced to his staff, one of whom, again, can immediately be identified as his eventual love interest. Power Prime Minister falls for humble servant girl -- how romantic! Who would have thought?The Prime Minister's scenes seem to have scripted by a 10-year-old. It's hard to depict politics or diplomacy more childishly than most mainstream films do, but this film manages. Grant is shown meeting with his Cabinet, with dialogue along the lines of: ""Mr. Prime Minister, you really need to get tough with those Americans."" ""No, I don't think I will. Like it or not, America is the most powerful country in the world, so I think we'll just have to be nice to them."" Yes, it's about that sophisticated. But soon the evil Americans show up, led by Billy Bob Thornton, looking hickish and sinister, another example of the film's relentless caricaturing. There is soon a negotiating scene that goes something like: (Americans, haughtily): ""We will be continuing the policies of the previous Administration."" (Brits): ""But they are bad policies!""But the Americans won't bend, so ""bad"" policies it will be. (Ah, the simple logic of film. Let's have good policies instead of bad ones -- Brilliant!)Later, when in private discussions with President Billy Bob, Grant steps out and returns to find the Prez nuzzling his housekeeper. So, the Americans are not only unreasonable negotiators but lechers, too! At the next press conference, Hugh's backbone stiffens, he emphatically declares that the Brits aren't going to be pushed around anymore.Cut to shots of applauding, grateful Brits, wiping tears from their eyes. No kidding.The writing is adolescent from start to finish. Supposedly about romance, it was about anything but: It was about how many times the writer/director could haul out the same tiresome, insulting, manipulative stereotypes and syrupy music.The film begins with shots of people embracing at airports. It's a clue. The writer likes the image of love, but isn't terribly interested in what goes into it.We have a new plague among screenwriters: Richard Curtis. He also gave us Four Weddings and a Funeral, which was similarly, though not quite as spectacularly, awful.Is it really the case that filmgoers will find such dreck droll and clever if only it is dressed up with a British accent? There seems to be no other explanation for this man continuing to be given financial backing.",Love Actually

Love Actually actually owes its framework most to Mexican novellas which tell multiple dramatic stories with one cliché after the next. The eight stories in this film are so cliché ridden it's hard not to grimace, and are only accusingly saved by a clever turn of dialogue. The shy prime minster, the lovelorn writer, the sister with the troubled brother, it all adds up to tripe. Too bad a cast and a writer who have been known to do some good work, came together to make this.

770,rmorrisjr,Delightful romantic comedy,8,11 November 2003,"I just recently saw this film and I must admit that, (in as far as this year), this is one of only a handful of films where the pre-release buzz was on target (""Dirty Pretty Things"" being another).Most film enthusiasts would readily admit that the genre, while having notable entries proving otherwise, is full of asinine failures, completely devoid in reality; providing excellent examples of the pop phrase ""corny."" While ""Love..."" does ask it's viewers to suspend some reality (e.g. with all due respect, can you actually envision ANY head of government, let alone the Prime Minister, being as relatively young AND good-looking as Hugh Grant, remaining completely unattached, much less the party's leader?), the viewer never has to make a conscience attempt to do so; (s)he is emotionally involved with the characters, and the willingness to see their respective scenarios to conclusion is not laborious.In addition to my admiration of the film I must compliment the creative forces that be on two particular aspects of plot which, had this been a typical Hollywood production, would have made an unnecessary dive into socio-political commentary: 1. The ""makeup"" of two of the couples, although one of them is not paired until the end of the film (to reveal more would require spoilers, so see the film to find out). Suffice it to say that a great deal of stereotyping and/or additional social commentary concerning these individuals could have been made, and in the US this would have been the entire focus of the film, despite its multi-faceted plot line. The fact that we see all of these people as ""regular"" individuals, without any agenda to promote, allows the film to be jovial and keeps true to its theme. 2. The now-infamous ""leftist"" tirade from Hugh Grant's Prime Minister. Having just seen the film, and in reading several commentaries from other sources about it, I'm compelled to ask, ""What 'leftist' tirade?"" While political philosophies may differ, nothing mentioned in that scene could be considered anti-American, unless you're a DEVOTED Bush disciple. The message, while definitely pro-British, could not be viewed as anything but unless one is already disposed to viewing anything except the Star Spangled Banner as unpatriotic.Overall, while not a masterpiece, it is one of the best romantic comedies of all time, and definitely the best one this year.

Each actor is perfect just the way they are. And when you've got all these stories going at once that somehow meet, you can't say its a bad movie! The movie starts off a little while before Christmas, and you have the man who while at a funeral his wife cheats on him; at the funeral is the boy and stepdad who lost their wife and Mum; there's the rock artist doing a remake of let it show, the Prime Minister who's sisters has a husband who has an employee having a wedding, who is being catered by a man.

775,wbryanstewart-1,The only movie that ever gave me an axe to grind,1,27 June 2006,"Right off the bat, I will say that I have never been a Richard Curtis fan. 'Blackadder' I could take or leave, 'Four Weddings' made me chuckle, 'Notting Hill' had no merit whatsoever and 'Bridget Jones' almost had me at hello but then the movie started. The guy just doesn't write good stories. The only reason I get roped into seeing these films is because my girlfriends like them. I went to see 'Love Actually' because I like Christmas movies and my girlfriend at the time thought it would be a good date movie. Besides, with a cast like that how could it not at least sort-of deliver the goods? The best part of 'Love Actually:' the credits. Why? Because the credits mean that the film is over and you can leave. After walking out of the theater I never wanted to see another Christmas movie again, my girlfriend (who also hated the film) and I broke up a few weeks later (yeah, it was THAT bad), and every actor in the film is now on my ""well-they-used-to-be-good-until-they-acted-in-'Love-Actually'"" list.Where to begin? Plot lines: the film had way too many. Laura Linney's story would have been the first to go had I been the one in the editing room. Her acting was no good and her phony affection toward her office worker was contrived and lame. The story of John and Just Judy also needed to be introduced to the cutting room floor. It was neither cute nor ironic the way they portrayed that you can find love on the set of a porno movie. Not that it doesn't happen, but the movie's approach just to get some nudity on screen was weak.Could this film have had any more clichés? Awww . . . the desirable bachelor/Prime Minister falls in love with his fat, foul-mouthed secretary from the wrong part of town; the divorced struggling writer has the hots for his housekeeper who doesn't speak English; the triangle of the drifting husband, the shattered wife, the assistant who just wants to get in her boss's pants; the kid who learns to play the drums to get the attention of the most popular girl in school . . . where does it end? In attempting to cover every demographic the film presents itself as an insufferable mirage of one ridiculous circumstance after another. The guy who goes on the American-orgy rampage: 'nuff said.At least we had Bill Nighy to add some comedic lines (his radio and TV interviews were hysterical).

778,nancy-292,Highly recommended - if you have no taste or human decency,1,25 August 2006,"At first I was suckered in by this movie - cool British actors like Emma Thompson, swank shots of London, the British love/hate attitude towards America.But slowly, steadily, it began to dawn on me - this movie is incredibly bad and misogynistic to boot. By the end of the movie I was writhing with disgust at the waste of good acting talent and two hours of my life.I just saw it tonight on pay-per-view. Normally I won't pay for a movie unless I have a pretty good idea what it's about and a good sense that I'll like it. I threw caution to the wind and rented this one without all that. HUGE mistake.It's the perfect movie for evolutionary psychologists. The successful pairings are older powerful men and younger women, or a young guy and 4 women, or young guy and porn star. If you're older, like Laura Linney, you get no sex with a hot hot man because your brother's a violent looney, and your entire life is dedicated to nurturing him, or you're older and married with kids, like Emma Thompson and your husband is screwing his secretary and you just suck it up. Didn't you know you're a piece of crap older woman whose sex life is over? Now go make yourself useful by making a costume for your kid. I mean, I knew that evolutionary psychology was big in Britian, but had no idea things were that bad.And incredibly some people claim that this is a movie for middle-aged women. Maybe middle-aged women who hate themselves.And of course there's the awful awful plots. And the heaping piles of bad music and two stupid horrible scenes one after the other - the little boy on the plane, and the English guy in Portugal, with the stupid ""inspirational"" music pounding you over the head.Yes, love is all around, unless you're the funny fat sister. Then you get nothing and everybody hates you - and the filmmakers invite everybody to laugh at you.That's what really makes anybody with taste or sensitivity or humanity hate this movie. Because it keeps smugly patting itself on the back for its sensitivity and LOVE when in fact it's a woman-hating, schmaltz-churning, vomit-producing travesty.I'm so glad there is a site like this where I can not only get a chance to get some of the feelings of loathing and sickness induced by this movie out of my system, but I can see that there are other sane, discerning people in this world who also get why this movie is so deeply, fundamentally, soul-destroyingly wrong.And a shout-out to NYTimes critic A.O.

He said it was about ""love"", so i thought i'd give it a try.but sorry to say i just didn't get it. lets see; who loved who? or who was in lust with who? oh yeah- Emma T's character actually loved her husband and vica versa. Other than that, no one in this film portrayed anything close to real meaningful love. To me it was very uninspiring. Anyone can lust after a coworker, taking them to bed one time does not constitute love. 9 year old children don't fall in love with their pretty little playmates. She had a phenomenal voice though for her age, and I hope to hear more of her in the future.The films recurring, and annoying attempts at comedy and sexual innuendo (barf) fell flat. where is the humor in 2 disconnected porn stars faking it for the camera???? i failed to find it. I'm not a fan of British humor and this film reeks of it.don't bother to see this film unless you want to watch too many confused, uninteresting people sloppily lust after each other. Not really a feel good kind of movie whatsoever. i wanted to laugh and cry and i did neither. Left me kinda cold.",Love Actually
780,n-snell,Utterly dreadful.,1,1 October 2006,"Oh my goodness. This film was truly awful! I'm assuming it could only have appealed to the 10-15 yr age bracket or others with extremely limited film exposure and/or limited IQ. Utterly puerile and implausible stuff. Nauseating. I'm embarrassed for the British film industry.The Hugh Grant/Prime Minister story embarrassed me most of all I think - the romance with his assistant. The Colin Firth proposal was slightly amusing. Keira Knightly makes me cringe, I have to say and that whole scenario was also very unlikely. What else can I offer here to fill up the ten lines. I think you all get the gist judging from some of the other comments.",Love Actually
781,sophielee-43037,Good On a Surface Level but Increasingly Problematic When You Look Deeper,7,28 November 2020,"For whatever reason, there's always a general feeling of love in the air around Christmas, and Love Actually somehow captures this feeling and puts it on screen. With ten separate storylines, this film covers a wide variety of relationships and explores different types of love. I think that if this film had focused on one particular storyline it would not have been as effective in portraying an overall feeling. By delving into the relationships and lives of people who all seem to be connected somehow, the film allows the audience to feel like they are part of a larger community. It also should be noted that this film has an excellent soundtrack with several recurring motifs that add to the connectivity between the multiple storylines. The film also frequently uses music as a way to transition from one storyline to another, which brings the stories closer together and makes the film more cohesive and fluid.
While on a surface level I do love this movie for all the heartfelt love declarations and sense of holiday cheer, I do see the many flaws of this film as well, which is why I cannot give it ten stars. The biggest problem I have with this film is the obvious lack of diversity. There are ten storylines in this film with each one exploring a different kind of relationship, but even so, all the romantic pairings are heterosexual, and only one of the couples is multi-racial. While this film is successful in representing different types of love and love at different stages of life, it falls behind when it comes to representing the love between members of the LGBTQ community and in representing the love between POC. I understand that this film was made in 2003, and the media has become much more representative, but it is still important to look at older films with a modern lens so that we can work to keep improving the ways in which we tell stories like this. Another issue I have with this film is that there are several uncomfortable and inappropriate relationships that involve power dynamics in this film, and while Hugh Grant's character addresses the problem of being romantically involved with his employee, that is not the case for others. Both Colin Firth and Alan Rickman's characters become involved with employees of theirs and this is never addressed as being inappropriate in the film. While Colin Firth's character is no longer his love interest's boss at the time they get together, it still is uncomfortable how many of the relationships in this film stemmed from the male being the female's boss. Again, I don't think that a film produced in 2020 would include these kinds of relationships where a man has clear power over the woman, but it is important to recognize the problematic elements of any film, regardless of when they were produced.
Overall, I do think that despite the problems, this is a solid Christmas movie from a surface-level perspective. The cast is full of extremely talented actors and despite the content itself being fairly cheesy, the actors make the script feel very real and believable. I am always particularly impressed with Emma Thompson's acting in this film as she gives an extremely emotional and raw performance without seeming over-dramatic. With such a talented cast I don't think this film would be as good as it is, the performances by a lot of these actors are what really sell the love stories. The beauty of this film is that it does give off the feeling of real, genuine, love at Christmas-time. More specifically real, genuine, hetero-sexual love between attractive white people. But if you're looking for a little Christmas fluff that shouldn't be taken too seriously, this may be the film for you.",Love Actually
782,sfhlaursen,A must see on Christmas,10,18 December 2020,"It is a classic. The stories and how they are connected to each other, but still very independent. The mixture of the sweet, sweet romance stories and the heart broken stories are rare in movies.",Love Actually
783,dfshaefer,"Loved ""Love Actually""",10,28 October 2006,"I loved this movie. It was a great essay on various aspects of ""love."" The stories of the characters provided a nice mix of poignant and humorous moments. And the acting was superb, although it's hardly unexpected with performers like Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, and others. Another fine aspect of the film was the selection of music used to accent various scenes. Joni Mitchell's ""Both Sides Now"" was perfect with Thompson's emotional scene. The use of the Beach Boy's ""God Only Knows"" with the final airport scene and the closing shots of non-actors (yes, real people) meeting each other in the airport was superb. All in all, it's a great mix of story telling, music, acting, and directing.",Love Actually

785,Gem038,Severely disappointed,2,1 January 2004,"I went to see this movie on a rainy day in an attempt to cheer myself up. Judging by the trailers and reviews, I was expecting a great, feel-good film. What I got was a different story.I got a mangled plot, abandoned storylines, unnecessary sex jokes and swearing, boring one-dimensional characters... And only two people managed to make me laugh- UK TV presenters Ant and Dec. I cared nothing for any of the characters or storylines, save Hugh Grant, but he is wonderful at romantic comedy (pah! this film was not so much romcom as boringblurb) and I enjoy watching him. What of the porn-stars, who had plenty of time spent on them at the beginning, only to be abandoned for what must have been at least an hour? Kris Marshall, who is brilliant in the UK series ""My Family"", was given a plot and dialogue so ridiculous I had to shut my eyes and pretend it wasn't happening. Keira Knightley was wooden, as usual, but add that to a messy story and it was bordering on painful. Even the usually wonderful Alan Rickman was dull. This story seemed to be entirely about sex jokes, swearing and being unfaithful. After nearly 2 hours, I couldn't bear it any more and left the cinema.Love Actually would've been much better off with half the stories- in fact, no, it would've been better if this diabolical mess had never been made. Atrocious and outstandingly disappointing.2/10 (just for Hugh Grant's ""Jump"" sequence and Ant + Dec)",Love Actually
786,the_delaney,A perfect Christmas movie,9,4 November 2006,"I don't think there are many films which can sum up Britain at Christmas better than Love Actually. The films strength for me is it's concentration on mundane aspects of life in Britain in mid_december, i mean take a look at it-A school play -An office -A wedding -Someone writing a bookThese are the key moments in the film and highlighting these reminds us all, and in all the different ways, why we love Christmas so much. I found it so refreshing watching this and not seeing a glamourised American-stlye light fest of a holiday which simply is never quite the case here. It reminds me so much of what things are actually like, the hassle and the fussing and the waiting arn't left out. Some people are excited and others couldn't give a toss as they are too wrapped up in their own problems.The films makes the, admittedly, corny but very true statement that what is important at Christmas is who you are with and focussing on the ones you love. It's sickly, it's sweet, it actually works",Love Actually

Special Quotes for these Actors / Actress: Martine McCutcheon - Natalie / Laura Linney - Sarah / Emma Thompson - Karen / Joanna Page - Judy (the naked lady). I am really impressed with Thomas Sangster - Sam, this boy has a very good future acting, he is a born talented actor. This is a real ""must have"" DVD for people that respect the love as it should be. Curtis really knows how to write a good movie, UK movies has this big difference from Hollywood.

790,lillygimsen,Way too overlong and too much going on,1,11 July 2021,"At around 2 hours and 20 minutes this film is crying out for a pair of scizzors. I watched the whole thing on New Years Day, expecting some kind og masterpiece, from what I'd read on the internet. A 7.6 is a LAUGHABLE rating for a film like this. It's not even anywhere near as good as Notting Hill, and at times, it's actually really embarassing. Guy goes to America wiht an English accent and gets laid - end of story. Wtf? Is that supposed to be clever or funny? Kris Marshall manages to be unfunny for the first time ever, via Curtis's script. Maybe he should stick to writing and not direct in future as he doesn't have the skill for pacing. I heard he is more merciless when editing his directing jobs than he is when he writes, so God only knows how long this film would have been if he'd included everything he wanted!! Hugh Grant plays prime minister and does a cringy dance in Downing Street to the Pointer Sisters. He was embarassed to film that - yes I've watched the commentary twice now, so you can't say I haven't given this film a chance. The movie was advertised as a 'comedy', by Universal which makes me wonder if they actually knew what kind of film they were selling, or their marketing people are morons. I think it's the latter. There a multiple storylines and they simply don't work. They are either unfunny, or they don't fit - Laura Linney? Kudos to Bill Knighy though, who manages to steal every single scene he's in. Sadly it's not enough to lift this from a one star rating. And why is Martine McCutcheon even in this? Does anyone outside of the UK even know who she is.",Love Actually
791,tom-olander,Wonderful Film!,10,23 December 2006,"I am your typical male. I like sports movies, action movies, gore/horror movies. So when I sat down and watched Love Actually, I was a bit biased. The title gives the impression that this is a chick flick. It is. What the title does not tell you is that this is a fantastic film. Not just for women (or overly emotional men), but for everyone. If you've ever been in love, if you ever hope to be, if you never think it will happen to you, this film is for you.The relationships that are portrayed are so real. This film made me want to yell at the TV (yes, I watched it first after it came out on DVD). I wanted to root for some characters, yell at others, and cry for the rest.It has been a long time (maybe ever) since I cried during a movie. However, when Karen opens her gift and it is NOT the necklace, I felt her pain.

794,litzee57,Excellent Movie,10,25 January 2008,"After watching love actually I have to say it was great. The characters all had their own individual struggles or love interests and it came together beautifully in the end. I would rank this among the best romantic comedies I have watched. The one deleted scene in which the young boy and his father listen to the song Joanna and the boy has the love movies on his wall would have been a good addition to the movie and should not have been deleted in my opinion. This scene not only showed the relationship between the father and son, it also showed the boys love interest and the mutual love for the mom. This movie showed that love can cross the barriers of language and regardless of the circumstances true love can find a way. There were many different stories which allowed the viewer to feel anger, happiness, joy, sadness, etc. Certain characters incorporated comedy into the movie which was a nice touch but the movie is not only about love in a relationship sense. Love is also shown between families and friends. Certain characters are very loyal to the ones they love, while others betray the trust of those which they love. This movie is a must-see for anyone who enjoys romantic comedies and portrays the importance of love in our world as well as what relationships are most important.",Love Actually

799,silver_star_tears,Interesting Tapestry...,9,18 October 2003,"Just saw this at the Cork Film Festival. Definitely a good shot for 9/10. Very interesting film, all about the different types of human love. I thought that a lot of the actors were given definite space to work their magic in (especially Hugh Grant's character), though some spaces were small, it is amazing to see so much talent in one film and therefore one has to have a realistic idea of limitations.Some of the stories are not first class, but then you try to put together ten different stories in reality which are highly stimulating. Ultimately the weaker stories do their work by showing off the better chapters of the film. I do feel that perhaps one of the story lines was imperfect, you wonder if a couple of scenes were left on the editing table.
The film is very touching and if you just think the plot is too unachievable, go for the comedy (brilliant job by Bill Nighy) or the feel-good factor (perfected by Liam Neeson). All in all, not a film for breaking barriers but maybe thats its success. 'Love Actually' is a human film, and at this it is worth its weight in gold.",Love Actually

There is no 'main character' - the movie follows the love lives of some 8 couples (in reality it's a bit more complicated than that) during a few weeks before Christmas.Discover how the British Prime Minister (played by Hugh Grant) develops feelings for his tea lady, how an arguing rock star rediscovers his friendship to his long-time manager, what happens if your best friend marries the girl you love, how already a small boy can fall in love, and much more. There is even (rare for English language movies) a love story over a language barrier. All these stories are intertwined in a love cocktail.

The actors do a good job and the varying music represents the character's feelings. I loved Rowan Atkinson as the jeweler because he was so extremely funny I had to wipe my tears away. Keira Knightley was as cute and pretty as she always is (except King Athur and Domino) that's why I fell in love with her and her love story.

Realizing that it was really a Christmas movie, I watched it again that Christmas, and then again last year, and again this year. It's a great ""girls' night"" movie, but men seem to like it, too. I just love every character; the dialog is typically, bitingly, hilariously British (a droll sense of humor I've come to love), and the stories are all engaging.

They were not interesting at all. These people were actually one dimensional. Not even Alan Rickman (my hero) was able to save the blasted film. Everything about it was a very played out tired cliché and the ending did not add up. Particularly the relationship between the cleaning lady and the writer, they barely new each other, never had a REAL conversation, hardly even saw one another, how the hell did they end up getting hitched??? Another ridiculous problem with the script was that hideous dork that decided to go to America to get laid! Three or four really gorgeous girls in a dingy dive of a bar just happen to stroll in, and take him home for sex? I thought they were going to rob his naive tourist looking scrawny a** but it turns out that the writer actually thinks the audience is that naive because he did get laid on his first night in the states!

813,prosper54,Love Actually...Stinks (except for Bill Nighy),3,10 December 2003,"This movie, put together by the team who produced ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", had the potential to be a winner. It fails because it tries to be too cute for its own good, too whimsical beyond belief, and too raunchy to be considered a holiday flick. The result is a contrived script that is destined to the rental bin under the category of ""saccharine sweet"".Save for the wasted, picture stealing performance of Bill Nighy .This film had all the earmarks of a stinker and I am annoyed at myself for not heeding the obvious warning signs:Warning 1 - Any movie that touts all the stars head shots in the lobby poster (think Airport 1975, Poseidon Adventure, etc.) is a stinker.Warning 2 - The ridiculous promos that show Sarah (Laura Linney) jumping up and down on a staircase, flapping her hands in delight because the man of her dreams agrees to come up to her apartment on their first date is a scene right out of Gilmore Girls. One should have known, with that kind of cuteness, the rest of the movie would not be much better.Warning 3 - Anyone who thinks the sight of Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister of Britain, dancing and prancing all over 10 Downing Street to the beat of the Pointer Sisters is entertainment originality, never saw ""Risky Business"". And how about the inevitable appearance by a staffer who stands unnoticed in the background while Grant continues his dance, oblivious to her presence until he turns and is embarrassed? Done so many times on sitcoms too numerous to mention.Speaking of Mr.Grant, does he have any other emotion besides ""befuddlement""?And what's with all the sex and nudity? Serving only to distract the viewer from the plot lines, gratuitously bare breasted women abound throughout the film. Was it really necessary to show so many long scenes of breasts, when a fleeting glimpse or a well placed bed sheet, would have been more intriguing and less distracting.Bill Nighy's portrayal of an over the hill rock star who finds love was perhaps,the most original characterization in a movie this year. Too bad it's lost in this picture of unoriginality.",Love Actually

Watchsomething else on Netflix or Amazon. What is with this minimum number of lines? Let me say it again: this movie was trite, hackneyed, silly, and without any redeemable value.

This is a good first directorial effort from Richard Curtis and the cast are a pleasure to watch, with cameos a-plenty and some good comic acting.  It has a few moments of genius, although overall its probably not quite on a par with Four Weddings or Notting Hill.  Liam Neeson is excellent as a grieving husband and father and Thomas Sangster as his son is wonderful.

After his mother died, Sam got so sad, and then didn't talk with Daniel Damiel worried about Sam, so he tried to talk with him and his problem was agony of ardent love. Sam went to performance with practicing playing drum to be good to Joanna. However, he couldn't take attention from Joanna, but came back to Daniel. Daniel advise him to say confession of love to Joanna who was leaving, and Sam did. At last, his proposal succeeded and the relationship with stepfather gets better.

Had all the actors/actresses that I enjoy in it so I assumed I would love the movie. Bad assumption. Just a hodge podge of plots that were all boring. Only the old rock star had any humor. And little at that! I still cannot believe I made it through the entire movie. I cannot believe that the readers of IMDb gave this such high ratings. Perhaps being from the US I lost something in the translation?? I believe this is the first Hugh Grant movie that I would not recommend. My husband agreed 100% on how boring this was,Love Actually

I do not know, maybe because stupid happy ending love stories sell better. If I was the director I would not film the last 30-40 minutes and finished it the way it was started; like it is in the real world. Most of the times love stories do not have a happy ending for one reason or another. It could be the story of people who fall in love and cannot do anything about it. It could show the pain of love and carrying a broken heart.",Love Actually
821,bettyboo_5120,Slightly too over-sentimental for my liking,10,13 November 2003,"Love Actually is a hybrid of every romantic comedy that has been made. Each story is good enough that they could stand alone as good films but put together and they just don't make you care enough about the characters to really get to like or hate them.The focus is more on the famous names in the film (almost all the main characters are recognisable) rather than on the characters themselves although they do put in some great performances.Each of the stories focuses on a different aspect of love: unrequited love, puppy love, losing love and new loves. The characters are likeable enough but for some of the stories there are a lot of questions that remain unanswered.Love Actually is a film that does what a romantic comedy should do. There's romance and there's comedy. Some hilarious moments mainly provided by the brilliant Bill Nighy as a washed-up singer and watch out for Hugh's dancing. Slightly too sentimental for me but all in all a good film with something for everyone 7/10.",Love Actually

It's made better than most movies about love and romance by the variety of different people it shows, and the many kinds of love and situations it details.I highly recommend this movie, especially for the holiday season.",Love Actually
823,seemeesm,one of the worst movies I've ever seen,1,19 February 2010,"This was one movie I watched with lots of expectations thinking that a British romcom might be much better than a Hollywood one and had to sit through endless hours of watching every cliché unroll in the most excruciating manner. Thinking back, what annoys me about the movie are several things. 1)what stupid plot lines! The Brit P.M, for instance has only three household staff to meet, doesn't seem to care anything about diplomacy in handling international relations and seems to have more time on his hands than even a Minister has and should have.To top it all, the speech he gave on the merits of Britain boasting of Shakespeare to Harry Potter was so stupid that at first i thought he was having a dream.The little boy's love story was so annoying i don't even want to go into it. And don't get me started on the Brit who went to America and got all the American girls with his cute Brit accent. when that story started,stupid me, i thought ""oh this jerk is going to come back and fall in love with one of the Brit girls he so despises"". That would have been predictable, but not this stupid n pointless. The emma thompson- rickman plot had some promise, but such a waste of good actors. Adultery gets the""oh, just get on with it!"" treatment that the death of the wife in the other plot gets.2) why do when lovers meet, u need the whole world as the audience? when the p.m kisses the maid (conveniently on the stage), he has an audience to watch. so does Colin Firth's character when he proposes with the whole town watching anxiously and needing the ""Yes"" to be translated as well. How romantic! And the little boy has to confess his love in a crowded airport. How cute! Grrr!3)What was the need of even attempting to bring these stories together? There was no meeting point. Emma Thompson conveniently turns out to be Grant's sister, one about whom he doesn't seem to bother that much, going by the movie. In fact, in the last scene when Firth comes back with his girlfriend, and Keira Knightley, Thompson n all meet him, i was thinking, ""Do they know each other?"" and only then did the very convenient wedding scene (which could have done with a lot of editing) come to my mind.I know I am repeating the word convenient many times, but that was what it was, everything was so convenient and so clichéd. After watching the movie, i thought Curtis had unconsciously, in a sort of postmodern twist, given away the way the movie was going to be, thru that ""crappy"" Christmas song where the word ""love"" is replaced with ""Christmas"". Here was a movie, trying to talk about love at Christmas and turned out to be neither here nor there and was as the lines went, replacing the word ""care"" suggested by something so beautiful and varied as love by one stupid ""show"" of love.",Love Actually
824,tmichelet,disappointed in underlying themes,6,18 April 2010,"While the acting was splendid and the cast consisted of many of my favorite actors, I was quite disappointed in the subtext. I found it quite sexist and insulting. Several of the male cast chose to be with much younger women who were not their equals. The most overt statement was made by one man who said English women were stuck up. No wonder if the men only appreciate subservient women. The Prime Minister, played by Hugh Grant, chose to fall for a much younger, uneducated and insecure woman who was a low level member of his staff. (I found it incredible that such a person would be on his staff to begin with.) The writer played by Colin Firth, although suffering from an earlier betrayal by his partner, falls for a younger housekeeper who he can't communicate with due to the language barrier. Clearly a substantive relationship. The executive played by Alan Rickman falls for a much younger, blatant tart on his staff when he has the charming and elegant Emma Thompson at home. What does this all say about men's choices? They don't want an equal, they want sexy staff at home. In other aspects, this movie seemed to contain forward thinking. However, the overall message was unenlightened and depressing.",Love Actually
825,letsgotothemovies93,One of the best Christmas movies,9,17 November 2006,"I tend not to be a sappy person but this movie gets me every time I watch. I enjoy the diverse cast. My only complaint would be too much cheesy music in the soundtrack (read: Mariah Carey). I enjoy the stories of love, the setting of London and humor presented. I consider it a must see for those who enjoy the holiday season and romantic comedies. IMDb says I must write more, OK. I particularly enjoy the Emma Thompson/Alan Rickman story. They seemed the most realistic to me. A long time married couple who must deal with one spouse's flirtation with infidelity and the consequences of people's actions. I enjoy how their situation is handled. Also, I really enjoyed Hugh Grant's story line. When I say I enjoy the diversity in the film I mean the ethnic, age and size diversity that the director incorporates. It's hardly represented in many movies and the reality is that there are many types of people and they do all fall in love. I'd say to all the naysayers about romantic comedies that you may be surprised by this movie. It's actually heavy on the comedy as well.",Love Actually

827,fankha02,"""Love Actually"" is a film about love. It is a romantic comedy that expresses that ""love is all around.""",9,18 September 2010,"With the help of many elements, ""Love Actually"" is successful as a cinematic film. Each storyline has a unified plot. At each point of the film, the characters, although may not be in similar situations, are connected by similar points within the plot structures. All of the story lines move in unison, as they move through the stages of exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and denouement. The theme is what holds the film together because each story lines plot is focused on the major theme. Richard Curtis also uses irony of situation to support the theme of love. In the scenes between the storyline of John and Judy, the process of getting to know one another happens, not over dinner or coffee, but during work, as they fill-in as doubles in a sex scenes. John and Judy are shy yet they are completely naked in front of 30 people. Their attraction, which is more emotional than physical, toward one another is instant but their relationship takes time to develop. This ironic situation shows that genuine love is all around, even in the most unlikely of places; just as it is ironic that two shy people are in the sex double business. Lighting, set design and cinematic point of view also helped to perpetuate the film's theme. In the many scenes between Jamie and his new housekeeper Aurelia (Lucia Moniz), who also turns into his new love interest, the lighting is bright and fresh. The setting oozes romance with the French country home in the background and the cool colored flowers surrounding the grounds. The lighting and set design help to show Jamie's new, fresh start to life after learning about his wife's infidelity. The surroundings seem to capture Jamie and Aurelia, holding them hostage with the fondness that they have developed for one another. Cinematic point of view also proved successful for theme relevance. The feelings between characters are felt by viewers because of the use of indirect-subjective point of view. In all story lines, the characters are faced with either heart-stopping shock or heart-thumping excitement. The audience is brought into each scene with this point of view, making it clear that what the characters are feeling is real, and that we have felt it too. This film has a lot going on throughout its 129 minutes but the many things occurring on screen are all very important in carrying the theme through to the end of the film. And each storyline (all 10 of them) represent the theme in its entirety, ""Love, actually, is all around.""",Love Actually
828,greena21780,Love is all around,8,16 September 2010,"The theme of the movie is love. According to the plot summary on IMDb website, ""The characters are falling in love, falling out of love, some are with right people, some are with the wrong people, some are looking to have an affair, some are in the period of mourning; a capsule summary of reality. Love begins and love ends."" The film has many characters which are important to the film. The first couple are Keira Knightley who plays Juliet, and Andrew Lincoln who plays Mark. The next couple of characters being focused on are Hugh Grant who plays the Prime Minister, and Joanna Page who plays Judy. The next couple whose life is intertwined with the others are Colin Firth who plays Jamie, and Lúcia Moniz who plays Aurelia. As we begin the movie we see the first spark of the love theme with the marriage of Peter and Juliet with Mark as his best man. The song being sung starts with the theme of love, or all you need is love! You can see from the look in Mark's face that he is in love with his best friends wife. The next theme of love goes into the funeral of Daniels wife and Sam's mother. The missing of a loved one is eminent through the pain of Daniel as he stands and gives his last good bye. The movie continues through many different aspects of the theme of love. Love between a boss and his secretary, a father and son. The theme continues to the scene where Juliet tries to persuade Mark that she isn't that bad of a person and doesn't know that Mark is really in love with her, she thinks he just dislikes her. She watches the taping of Mark did at her wedding and realizes he is in love with her as she watches the video of only her on her wedding day with nothing of the husband/best friend there at all. We continue to see the theme of love throughout the movie through many different scenes till the end when Mark shows up with cards and tells Juliet how he really feels. Love, Actually can also be closely related to the movie Wedding Crashers. The theme of love is also throughout that movie as well with a little twist of comedy and friendship along the way. I feel the directors motif behind the film is to show people that love comes and goes in many different ways in our everyday lives that many of us may not be aware of. I think another aspect of the film is the irony of all the different individual stories. Most of the time when you hear about stories with love as a theme you think of people falling in love. This film has some people falling in love, some people getting hurt with love, some people finding love in the most unusual places, and others finding love for their children. We all perceive love differently and find it differently. We see throughout the movie that there are endless possibilities that people have in their lives that does make the saying true, ""Love is all around us!""",Love Actually

Uplifting, not too sappy.",10,9 November 2003,"Love Actually follows the painful, joyous and silly course of loves lost and found among disparate characters in London during the five weeks leading up to Christmas.  In the tradition of Four Weddings and a Funeral, this film portrays falling in love as an anxiety ridden, painful, horrifying event which somehow mutates into ultimate bliss when that love is returned.  The Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) falls for an underling.  A widower (Liam Neeson) encourages his young stepson to attract the attention of the girl he pines for.  A pair of body doubles fall for one another while simulating sex acts for the camera.  Loves lost and wasted also figure less prominently in the picture.  Overall a funny and surprisingly moving film.  Don't expect realism but do expect to hear the ladies in the audience sigh in pleasure at the many beautiful men in the film.  There's no shortage of lovely ladies either.  One small warning - at 128 minutes this movie outlasts the usual romantic comedy.  And many bladders.

Your eyes will hurt unless you like multiple story lines that do not seen themselves to completion and do not explain themselves and contain characters that are unnecessary to the plot (which was nonexistent) and because of the multiple layered storyline do not expend sufficient time to actually allow the audience to develop any kind of affection, affinity, adhesion to the characters.Also, I watched this with my Girlfriend who is beautiful and very intelligent(She's sitting here right now).

Emma Thompson's subdued breakdown scene is perhaps one of her best moments on screen. And the storyline with Colin Firth and the Portuguese girl is perhaps one of the cutest things ever.

It seemed like it would be too sappy or sugary. I liked Notting Hill, but didnt LOVE it. I liked Bridgett Jones quite a bit, but this sounded too commercial and middle of the road for my tastes. I am glad we went to see the sneak, because my husband and I both LOVED the film. We don't often agree on films either. I do have some small complaints which I will get to next, but the good is way above the bad. The characters are wonderfully expressed and played, and the storylines are very unique and even sometimes surprising. It moves fast so you are never bored, but there is meat to it as well. I really cared about the characters I was seeing. [ except for 1 or 2] I felt as if I knew them for the most part. Liam Neeson and Thomas Sangster are incredible in this film. They were so funny and moving. That kid is going to be a big star soon. He is so realistic and endearing without being smarmy. And speaking of smarmy,  Bill Nighy is a fantastic character in this film. He got and deserved most of the real laughs here. I would see it again just for his scenes. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman moved me to tears and my criticism would be that I would have liked to see more of them. There are a few characters that are so briefly seen , just for quick laughs basicly, and they take the time from ones like Colin Firth and Alan Rickman, whom I would want more of. I would say to people, do not let the title or the boring trailer keep you away from this fantasticly funny and moving film.

The Liam Neeson stepfather character, his short-lived grief aside, is creepy and casts a pall over the entire film. There were plenty of laughs and some enjoyable characters in this uneven pastiche, but the coarse and silly kiddie romance--- replete with a most unfunny breech of airport security at the end--- left me feeling as though everyone involved in creating this film is not only childless, but also clueless about the events of 9/11.",Love Actually

The message of this movie, behind all those great stories, is one of the best messages a movie can send. Love is all around, even in this violent and ""modern"" world. The stories are all great, they are funny, touching, emotional, but above all real...perhaps they don't all end happily, but thats life, and in a way, they do end happy if you see behind them. The performances are great, everybody shines in their way, you will laugh with all of them because stories are treated equally and none outcasts the others.Sometimes I think its unbelievable that such a simple movie can show the best of humanity, which is love in every way, not only couples, but friends, parents, children, partners, brothers. This is the kind of movie I really enjoy because apart from the fact that is really really  well done, and makes you laugh a lot, it leaves you a brilliant sensation and, as I said, its message its so simple, but yet so true and so necessary these days.Please, go see it!!

849,gilbertthedragon,Short and to the point!!,10,21 November 2003,"21/11/03 I saw this film last night and enjoyed it so much I felt I had to comment on it. I had heard lots of reviews before seeing it saying that it was too soppy and too much like other movies by the same director but I think it stands alone as a really happy, feel-good movie. I think there is always a place for this kind of movie as I'm sure the viewing figures will show. I laughed, i cried and i laughed some more!!!",Love Actually
850,webcowgrrl,The Golden Turd,4,24 October 2003,"""Love Actually"" was exactly the kind of product described by the washed up rock star character we first meet as he is butchering his classic oldie by turning it into a money-making holiday song: a golden turd. While the audience I was with got a lot of chuckles out of this story, the whole thing felt really cobbled together and insubstantial. So many simultaneous stories made each one of the fabulous actors felt wasted - kind of heartbreaking, really, since there were many truly magnificent folks getting screen time, but not one got more than 15 minutes (I think). It wasn't awful, but it just felt like ""product,"" with focus group approved emotion-inducers: the ""sexy"" nude scenes, the ""sad"" funeral scene, and the ""heart-warming"" kiddie scenes. Poor Richard Curtis - has he truly lost his ability to create something that feels the least bit fresh? Save it for a rental.",Love Actually
851,smooore2,"Cheesy, but with a few crackers you can stomach it..(spoilers))",7,22 November 2003,"This film, although having only been out for a short time, is getting the 'too sugary to stomach' rap, which I can understand but think is unfair. I saw Love Actually this morning and had purposely ignored as much review information on it as I could, so I could have an honest reaction for myself. I came away having laughed and cried (a little) and wanting to hug my best friend and my Mum (cheesy I know).  The film makers, were obviously trying to cover most aspects of 'love' as possible while not making it too intense. I liked the Laura Linney storyline that didn't cop out to a happy ever after and the Andrew Lincoln aspect that covered unrequited love nicely. It was Emma Thompson that really got me in the end however, there had to be some raw honesty in that performance, as it really hit home.  In this era where movies can be as violent as you can stomach without anyone batting an eyelid, surely a little sugar is acceptable and perhaps even needed, to keep the balance and remind us that, we have good things to turn our focus to after all the bad.  I'd give it a definite thumbs up.",Love Actually
852,TopRamen,Very Delightful Experience,10,7 November 2003,"I read about some negatives comments before I saw the movie.  Sure, some of the lines may be cheesy and the plot not very realistic, but those things do not break a movie.  After all, do we need to go to a movie to get our daily dose of reality?  It is nice to take a break from violence, which is the major constitution of many films nowadays, and just indulge for a moment in brighter side of human nature.  I came out of the theater quite happy, and to me, that is a good movie going experience.  The movie has many mini-plots.  Each plot gets only a share of the time.  Some may say that the characters weren't given enough time to fully develop.  I wasn't really bothered by that.  The movie isn't scripted to deal in depth of human nature.  The collection is good enough as a rough sketch of love in different circumstances.",Love Actually
853,brent0055,what's not to LOVE about LOVE ACTUALLY,9,25 December 2004,"I watched the first 20 minutes of this movie last month and shut the TV with boredom. Then, I watched King Arthur last night and fell in love with Keira Knightley. I decided hey, why not give this movie another try because it's hard to believe that so many people and critics praised this film to the Oscars. So on Christmas day, I had to choose a movie, so I chose this love story taking place during Christmas. Again, the first 20 minutes was boring. I wanted to shut the TV, but nothing else was good to watch. So 20 minutes later, I liked the movie. 20 minutes later, i enjoyed the movie, 20 minute later I praised the movie. 20 minutes later I saw Elisha Cuthbert do a cameo and was she beautiful. 20 minutes later...later...later.... the movie ended. And my final verdict surprisingly is that I LOVED LOVED ACTUALLY. funny how thing come to be. great story, great directing, great comedy, great emotion, great acting by everyone(keira, Hugh grant, Emma Thompson, Liam Nielson and the adorable son, Mr.bean, everyone................",Love Actually
854,jlhp0405,Actually in love with Love Actually,10,3 November 2003,"Once in a while, a movie comes along and restores faith in love.  Love Actually does it so well.  It tickles the soul, and like the feeling of being in love, the movie makes you fall in love.  You feel the rush of a first kiss, the anger of being made a fool of by a spouse, and the joy of discovering that you've fallen in love.  You also realize that love is just love--between man and woman, father and son, friends, siblings, etc.  The cast of actors in this movie make you feel these emotions.  You forget the Colin Firth of Pride and Prejudice and instead see a bumbling writer falling into the trap of love. Each actor owns his or her role wonderfully.  And this results in perfect comic timing and depth in acting.  Richard Curtis as the writer and director of this movie has given the audience nine vignettes that show different aspects of love.  And it is not necessarily ideal love--some it is unrequited, and some of it is sinful.  The dialogue is witty and clever.  Together, the acting, the writing and the directing have created a movie as complex and as heady as love itself.My only disappointment is in the lack of closure for two vignettes.  But maybe that is intentional.  Watch Love Actually and be prepared to smile for days.",Love Actually
855,juliencorrs,BE HAPPY,2,29 November 2003,"Don't go see that movie if you are alone and if you have a lack of any love. It's horrible. I need a therapy now.

An all star cast to die for!  They make you laugh, they make you cry and they make you laugh all over again.  I will recommend it to all my friends and strangers on the street!  I can not wait to see what he does with ""THE EDGE OF REASON"".  This is one movie I am going back to see again and again! It is definitely one for the movie library.  Great job Mr. Curtis!  You have outdone yourself again!  By the way, I fell in love Colin Firth and Hugh Grant all over again=)",Love Actually
858,maxernst7,"The audience laughed, cried and applauded at the end",10,8 November 2003,"Richard Curtis's best movie. There's so much in this film, you have to see it a few times to get the full impact. Most of all it's extremely funny, touching and filled with an unusual mixture of cleverness, sappiness and unabashed joy set in both realistic and farcical scenarios. It works so well because beneath it all we feel that Curtis and his cast are sincere about showing us that ""love is actually all around."" We don't see it because we're not looking for it in this very serious world after 9/11. The second time I went to see the film it was even better. This isn't one to wait for the DVD. Make sure you see it in a theater with other people. It's a cathartic experience, all the hilarity, sappiness and profundity wrapped up in a strange mixture that's hard to explain. All I know is, both times everybody in the theater, including myself, was crying and laughing throughout like unashamed idiots. Curtis and his British cast are just the best. The few American actors have juicy parts, however, including a sly role by Billy Bob Thornton as the American President, and the 12 year old ""dream girl"" Olivia Olson who sings like an angel, and bursts out of nowhere like a young superstar at the end of the film, in a scene which ties many of the love stories together. (Olson, a phenomenal talent discovered by Curtis and flown to England to sing in the film, also belts out one of my favorite cuts on the soundtrack album, Mariah's ""All I Want For Christmas."")It's hard to analyze why this film succeeds so well, because in the telling it might sound like just an ambitious Christmas chick flick. But I think it transcends its manipulativeness and crassness because, at its core, the film shows the reality that love, ultimately, is the most important thing to all of us.This is also probably the greatest date flick ever made. Simply a beautiful, uplifting, weird, hilarious, magnificent movie.",Love Actually
859,amandafaith621,Great!!,10,9 November 2003,Despite all of the critic's reviews I thought the movie was fantastic. British humor is the best!  Most of the acting was great although I was not so impressed with Keira Knightley.  I love the side plot with Jamie and Aurelia.,Love Actually

And I didn't know what to come.. When I saw the trailer I thought this was just going to be another load of laughter, after all, Hugh Grant is in it. So, I sat down with my coke and chips, and as the movie was going, I was more and more impressed about the story, and not at least the actors. As I said, I've seen a lot of movies, and when it comes to Christmas-movies, this one is the only one that I remember that actually just fall into one another perfectly, just a great feeling to have been a part of the audience wich have seen it. To all of you that didn't had the time to see it yet; make time! I'm not saying it's the best film I've ever seen. But, however, a movie that you don't want to miss!

861,ggmm928,a lovely movie that makes you smile and cry,10,11 November 2003,"My daughter and I went to see this today and we both laughed and cried so much we cried our makeup off.  The movie does have a few too many story lines going for it.  I would have preferred they spend more time on the Rickman-Thompson story, the Colin Firth story and the Hugh Grant story. All the actors were wonderful in their roles and the little boy who played Liam's son was adorable.  The aging rocker story was hilarious (but a little sad too).  We both left wanting to see it again and anxiously awaiting the DVD release.  We went straight to a record store and bought the soundtrack which is OK but left out some of the songs they used in the movie.  They did a great job matching the songs to the stories on screen.  See it with someone you love!!",Love Actually
862,renee77,Great Romantic Comedy,10,17 November 2003,"Love Actually is one of the, if not the best romantic comedy I have ever seen. There are many characters in the movie and they all have their own storylines & they often cross paths with the other story lines. All of the acting is well done in the movie & I especially loved Hugh Grant in his Prime minister role & Liam Neeson in his relationship with his young stepson. I laughed throughout the entire movie & there were also moments when I was on the verge of tears (eg. Emma Thompson's moment alone in her bedroom). I was in a sold out crowd with people of all ages & it was equally a crowd of men & women & everyone seemed to love this film. I give it 10/10 & recommend it to anyone who wants a good laugh.",Love Actually
863,timothy_davenport,Dire Actually,1,12 January 2004,"Cynically made film to appeal to the Notting Hill brigade. Hugh Grant took huge steps backwards with this role. Is reprising the song Love is All Around clever or a chronic lack of ideas?!?The only redeeming feature was the Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman storyline, it was like an oasis in the middle of a desert of banality.Having said this, the box office doesn't lie and lazy filmmaking of this type seems to attract audiences - I assume Curtis' next film will be on the lines of Four Weddings and a Singleton in Notting Hill, Actually.",Love Actually
864,meghanindc,"love pleasantly, not actually.",7,20 November 2003,"This movie starts off with a bad Hugh Grant voice over, but a good idea. That being the Heathrow airport, and comings and goings, welcomings and goodbyes, of course, just as this moment forgets the time oriented indiscretions of the airport, it forgets reality for a good portion of the film.I have to admit that I'm ok with the irreality of this film.  We've chosen a Richard Curtis, we know what we're in for.  despite my penchant for subplots, this was a few too many.  Some of the more interesting points are left undeveloped while we are brought to others that would be better dropped: for instance the adult film performers.  Prime Minister is a stretch, too.Bill Nighy is great, and the film despite it's romanticness does sustain a fairly good level of humor.  Colin Firth is at his great uncomfortable best as usual.The ending is a bit long winded and demanding on the viewer, but if you're in a sentimental frame of mind, this film won't fit you too poorly.  I'd take a good friend and not my date though, or in my case, mother.",Love Actually
865,rkgoodman,Actually Very Bad,1,23 November 2003,"Two romantic comedy / Hugh Grant fans were disappointed last night. After we saw Love Actually, my wife and I both thought it was a waste of money but more importantly we thought it was a waste of our minds and an insult to our humanity.The movie, although acted well, takes the premise that love is erotic sentimentalism. Everyone has an animalistic sexual urge that they can't control. And that superficial, physical attraction is lifted up and sold to us as the best kind of Love. Very little about commitment or making good choices or putting family first. Of course we rarely find that in Hollywood, but what we also don't often find is such over-the-top, blatant distortion of loving relationships. Every storyline in the movie glorifies a dysfunctional relationship: sleeping with your brother's wife, adultery in the office a couple of times, a couple who gets together because they do nude scenes in the movies, getting together with your housekeeper, best-man in the wedding falls for the bride, etc.Another aspect of the movie that keeps me wondering why I continue to send money to Hollywood is the obvious anti-Americanism and liberal agenda that comes through. A small role by the American president (played by Billy Bob Thornton) portrays a sexual doof who bullies the British Prime Minister (Hugh Grant). One of the supposedly most rousing scenes in the movie is when the Prime Minister stands next to the American president and shames him for not being nice to England.Also, subtley, several of the characters work at an organization called Fair Trade, and the poster backdrops in the office herald the plight of the 3rd World and how we should ""help shoulder their burden"". Liberals always seem to love globalist organizations like these that decry our capitalist system as exploitative when it is this very system that gives them the economic freedom to make movies such as this. Why do we often have these political ideas injected into movies that should just be good romantic comedy?All in all a very disappointing movie. The gratuitous nudity, ubiquitous foul language, and lack of any sense of real love instead of the erotic urges that is passed to us as Love, keeps me from recommending this movie to anyone, actually.",Love Actually
866,early8ball,pants actually,1,23 November 2003,"There are directors who can hold together a film containing several narratives (Robert Altman, Woody Allen, Ron Howard, to name but three) but Richard Curtis fails miserably. There's a good film in there somewhere struggling to get out but Richard Curtis the director has employed Richard Curtis as writer and his partner Emma Freud as script editor, so there's no one to tell him that actually so many strands don't work. The Hugh Grant/Martine McCutcheon story is charming if implausible, but didn't Rob Reiner do it so much better in The American President? And Curtis seems convinced that swearing itself is funny. The Colin Firth story works much better and provides the film's best laughs. Emma Thompson is brilliant as the wife discovering her husband is at least contemplating an affair, but Alan Rickman isn't convincing. Surely such an intelligent man wouldn't really be interested in an affair with the cheap as chips office girl. Keira Knightley is beautiful and charming in the touching segment involving a nicely understated performance from Andrew Lincoln as the doting unspoken admirer. Bill Nighy camps it up in fine style as the ageing rocker, but the comedy is laid on with a trowel. The worst strands of the film involve the bereaved Liam Neeson and his stepson - the airport scene is particularly emetic, the out-of-place simulated sex scenes featuring Martin Freeman and the ludicrous section that implies that any English nerd would be viewed as a sex god in America.",Love Actually
867,Lkiao,is awful.,2,23 November 2003,"I am sure ""love"" actually isn't awful, but this film is. It is full of those cringing moments in which you hope to high heaven that some alien life form is not, at that moment, monitoring the people watching the film, in which case it would include you as one of the mind numbed masses. People will try to tell you that it is ""entertaining"" or ""lovey-dovey"" and even if it does have some valid points at its heart, the film remains awful. Hugh Grant, playing a good looking PM, prancing around only to be, shock of all horrors, caught by a maid is one of the lowest form of cinema I have personally seen since  Matthew MCconaughey's hand was ""accidentally"" glued to a statue's ""willy"" (see wedding planner....or don't see wedding planner..please..) The dialogue was often ""full blown groan"" worthy...see ""it has all the dark corners""...and ""it's all for you""....and almost everything said between the writer and the Portuguese girl...whether it was in Portuguese or English.This film is bad. Very bad. If someone were to start up an world competition for bad films...and my say meant anything.....it would be up there with...the aforementioned Wedding Planner, American Wedding, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Legally Blonde 2 et al.

It features a wonderful cast of British actors--and Laura Linney as a great American addition.  This is a lovely, positive, funny movie--just what we need when things in the US are so depressing.  I've notice the ""anti-American"" comments of some IMDB reviewers--and they are way off key.  If anything, the portrayal of the US President reflects what many of Americans think about our current government.  The writing is witty and the acting is great.

869,l-locke,"Fairy-story, actually",8,26 November 2003,"Having had galloping indigestion all afternoon, teen problems and TTOTM I really wasn't in the mood for much. I had seen so many bits of the movie I didn't think there would be much left to see!!As the well-known British advert says ""It does exactly what it says on the tin"". It's labelled Romantic Comedy and it is. It is also sentimental and a fairystory. In CurtisLand everybody is gorgeous (allowing for token fatties, quaint old folk and a disablement of some kind). London shines and twinkles (it doesn't) and every scene sparkles. This is the land where all problems are solved or summed up with a witty one-liner.But hey, this is the movies so why not?The story line was complex and I could have done with a couple less threads. You found yourself wanting to see more of one story and then another popped up just as you were getting all involved with another one.The Keira Knightley didn't seem to amount to much and Kris Marshall just played the same brainless idiot that he plays in the British sitcom My Family.The Laura Linney story just faded away too and although the porn stand-in couple were cute I thought they took up too much time.I enjoyed the Colin Firth story especially the sub-titles and of course once you had accepted Hugh Grant as Prime Minister(!!) well, Hugh was just Hugh and although not a HG fan he does what he does so well and he gave me some of the biggest laughs.Through all this the wonderful Bill Nighy popped up regularly like a naughty deed in a good world and stole the film.Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson's story brought a bit of well deserved depth to all the fluff but sadly there was no time for their development and I was left wanting to see more of that story (and not just for the obvious reasons!!) Emma T is, I think, one of the finest actresses of her generation and brings a special quality to all her parts. Alan was great too, I especially like the scenes with Laura Linney and the Selfridge one with Rowan Atkinson which I hadn't been (or should I say Bean?) looking forward to!!Well, if you can suspend your disbelief there is something for everybody to relate to in there. For me, it was the AR/ET storyline, thankfully not given a tidy ending as there are no tidy endings in real-life. The other scene strangely enough was the Laura Linney character dancing with Karl summing up that wonderful feeling you get when you finally get your hands on a crush!!LOLWell, when all's said and done I left the cinema happier than when I went in and that's got to be worth the ticket money for any film!!",Love Actually
870,99h0ward,Makes me embarrassed to be British,1,26 November 2003,"This film is simply terrible. It tries to be romantic, and fails miserably. It tries to be funny - ditto. There are a number of key failures - One: do we really need this many characters, of which only one moved me to any degree, that being the American women with the mentally disturbed brother? Two: the cliche-o-meter almost hits the roof. Say no more. Three - maybe its because I'm a bloke, but i just didn't care less what happened to anyone - there was zero character development. And finally, there was no reason whatsoever why the characters they all need to be somehow interrelated, as it adds nothing at all to the film like, for example, Pulp Fiction succeeds in doing.

871,CAA11212,Why Love Actually Sucks.,2,26 November 2003,"Love Actually is an English movie about  people in  relationships.The previews make it look like a cute and funny film that you might see with family or friends. However, it is nothing but a corny, unoriginal waste of time that makes Bridget Jones' Diary look like a masterpiece.  Everything about this complete mess of a romantic comedy has scenes that have been done many times before. For an example, there are too many movies to name where there have been foreign love affairs and relationships involving older married men with young women. As a matter of fact, the movie does a bad job of indicating whether the two even had an affair. Another thing about this movie is that it is trying  too hard for laughs. So there were a few funny bits but other than that I was laughing at the stupidity. I saw this with my family and we all agreed that Love Actually shows you how you can make an absurd movie with a  good cast. I was disappointed that Keira Knightly did not have a better or a more interesting role considering she is very talented. However I am giving this movie 2 out of 10 because Bill Nighy saved the movie for his unique character as an older rock star. One of the first lines is ""Love actually is everywhere"" which is true. However on a different note my quote is ""Love actually sucks.""",Love Actually

I just hope you read down this far and look at THIS one.I have seen lots of rom-coms, my wife lives off a diet of them, from While You Were Sleeping, to How To Loose A Guy In 10 Days.. etc etc.. and some of them are ok. Most of them are pap. What they all have in common is the same story line. Man meets Woman, falls in love, a misunderstanding/argument leads to break up, then getting back together. Mostly the main stars are blank people with funny friends, apart from When Harry Met Sally.. I love that film! And they are mostly American..I went to see Love Actually a couple of days ago and I LOVED it. I loved it for the acting, I loved it for the scenery, but I loved it most because it was different! There was no stereotypes or wasted talent, there was no stand out performance, there was just a bunch of people who were falling in love, being in love, having unrequited love, and wanting to be loved...It was perfect.

880,tennisguru,"If you want to turn off your sense of reality, then lights off and hit play",5,27 July 2014,"""Love Actually"" was recommended to me by many friends as a singular example that there are still good romantic movies out there: Movies that do not seem to repeat the usual Hollywood pattern to this type of genre but provide a new way of telling a sweet story that will make you feel good in the end. To come straight to the point, Love Actually tries his hardest to do so and succeeds some of the time while at other times it continues to stumble into the deepest pitfalls of kitsch and cliché that you have seen since Titanic. The first surprising thing about this movie is the sheer number of well- known actors that star in it: Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Martin Freeman and Keira Knightley, to name only a few. There are in total ten different story lines, all of which circle around the topic of love. These lines, while overlapping at several times, are still kept rather separate from each other, meaning that there isn't much interaction between the actors. The prime minister and his employee, the writer and his maid, the step-dad and his son, the married couple and the best man, they are all connected somehow but basically never cross paths, instead telling their own separate stories. This of course means that the movie's 135 minutes have to be split up into ten parts, leaving on average only about twelve minutes for each story line. Furthermore, Director Richard Curtis insists on squeezing as many sweet, heart-warming moments into these twelve minutes as possible while serving virtually every romantic-comedy cliché you have ever seen: He chasing her across the airport to proclaim his love, the dramatic proposal in front of a crowd of people, the sweet kid who falls in love way too soon and basically a lot of him-finally-telling-her-how-he- really-feels-in-a-dramatic-gesture. This along with the above mentioned lack of intersection leads to the fact that the plot of each story line could be summarized in only one or two sentences. What remains is a strong effort to make you love or cry, mostly achieved by turning up the music volume to a maximum. And while Craig Armstrong has created a great soundtrack for this purpose with a lot of piano-and-violin pieces, the conveyed emotion remains mostly artificial: The characters and therefore the scenes simply lack depth because of their little on-screen time. This is above all disappointing since the cast contains so many actors who we know to be capable of amazing performances.The general feeling of artificiality in these scenes is further enhanced by the fact that most of them are done without any trace of realism: A prime minister like this would never exist in real life, a marriage proposal should be neither made nor accepted if you have never had a conversation in a common language before and no kid can learn to play the drums that good in a couple of weeks. Things just aren't that simple in real life.Another disappointing aspect is the movie's lack of diversity: In ten different couples whose love story is told, the script apparently did not have room for one homosexual or even a bad-looking couple. What's most aggravating about this is the fact that the movie approaches the topic here and there, but immediately dismisses it later on, for example: After being told that his stepson is in love, he asks him what her or his name is, whereupon the kid instantly replies that HER name is Joana. The singer leaves an award party after realizing that the love of his life is his ""fat old manager"" yet their love is only depicted as a strong male friendship without physical contact. When the writer flies to Portugal to propose to his former maid, he arrives at her parents' house and asks to see the daughter. The father then calls upon his other, obese daughter and the writer tells him that he is there to see his other daughter who of course looks ""normal"". To be fair, there is also an interracial marriage and the portrayal of a love between siblings, one of whom is mentally handicapped, yet all in all the relationships are mostly between attractive, heterosexual white people. To summarize, ""Love Actually"" does not tell a typical movie love story – it tells ten of them. While this is somewhat unprecedented, it does not immediately validate the movie. The actors are not given enough possibility to show their abilities and the script lacks ingenuity. If you want to be swept off your feet and drowned in emotion, this is the wrong movie. If you want to just turn off your sense of reality and be served a large number of clichés, however, then lights off and hit play.",Love Actually

If the cast hadn't included folk like Emma Thompson and Alan Rikman, I would not have been inclined to see it. By the age of ten, I'd already seen more cliche romantic comedies than any person should have to endure in a single lifetime. I was very pleased to discover Love Actually is not another.The film is technically very good with excellent scripting, acting, directing etc. etc., but what impressed me most is its socio-political relevance. In another time and place this film might just be a nice, amusing, upbeat film. But here and now, it's a powerful story that beautifully counterbalances the daily propaganda barrage of terror inflicted on us by the news media. Not since American Beauty have I seen a film that demonstrates that rare but wonderful quality of being able to recast the viewer's world in a new, more accurate light.Love Actually is a credit to its media.

I enjoyed every scene - some were familiar, ie the necklace being given to a mistress, to the unfamiliar, ie the British Prime Minister kissing a member of his staff.I loved this film from the beginning to the ( unfortunate ) end.

However upon seeing it for the first time I was simply stunned. The cathartic feeling i experienced at the end of the film was so great and difficult to describe that it has placed the film into a very select inner circle of films that ever impressed me so much. Upon viewing it for the second time new details and connections made sense, and this made me feel like I'm watching a whole new movie, not a review of the same. But mostly I am surprised that in an era of commercial flicks and overrated box office hits there exist such movies that really deserve the time you dedicate when you watch them, and give more to you than the ticket money you give to the producers. Its a daring film about the most universal theme of them all, love, and it hits its mark bullseye!",Love Actually

I went to see it at the cinema twice and have watched the DVD 4 times since it was released.  The inter-twining relationships is nothing short of genius and the all-star cast are perfect. Bill Nighy and Emma Thompson without doubt play my favourite characters as the ageing rockstar and the betrayed housewife.  Hugh Grant is superb as the Prime Minister with a fantastic speech I would love Tony Blair to have given!!The opening and closing scenes at Heathrow Airport Arrivals made me cry, infact, I cried and laughed out loud at every viewing and have still not tired of it.I am astonished to see the bad reviews on the IMDB website - what a bunch of grumpy people there are out there!

886,lavender-cutie,Alright,4,29 January 2012,"Love Actually is a 2003 British romantic comedy film written and directed by Richard Curtis.This movie was really boring at first (first hour). In the middle, it got a little more interesting and the ending was actually nice. I wouldn't recommend this movie because in the end, I wasn't really satisfied. It was also quite long which was not what I was into. The best part for me was when the kid ran through the airport just to find his true love. Yes, this is a fantasy ( A BIG one) but aren't all romantic movies that way?

The only negative thing I would say is that because there are so many story lines going on at once, some of them didn't get a chance to develop as much as they could have.  There were one or two couples where I really thought they could have been left out.

There's something great about getting to know two people and watch how their relationship unfolds through the inevitable highs and lows of dating, particularly when the stories are grounded in real-life in a way we can all relate to.Unfortunately, Love Actually is not one of those films.I can only imagine the writers sat down one day and decided that it would be a great if they didn't have to worry about story lines, or character development, or emotional depth, and instead could simply cram as many different ""happy endings"" into a single film. 20 minutes later, Love Actually was born, hoorah!",Love Actually

Through a great haze of individual relationships we become aware that they are all connected by love. Sisterly love, neighbourly love, love between a husband and wife, love between father and son, love beyond language boundaries and love repressed because of love... love between friends.The cream of british (and Irish) actors are included, along with a few new faces.

It might take quite some time to sort out who´s who in the beginning because there are so many different characters and it´s hard to find connections between them. The whole idea of the film is that love is stronger than hatred and greed. It may be a little hidden, but it´s always there. It´s a nice story. It´s funny, it´s sweet and it´s beautiful. And the film has lots of brilliant actors and actresses in it. I especially liked Emma Thompson´s appereance. They´re all very talented and have made a good work and so has the director. It´s only such a pity that it got no oscar nominations.",Love Actually

892,jfenjves,A film which pleases the public but not the art critics.,10,14 March 2004,"As usual, the film gets a rather so-so review from the movie critics. We moviegoers might be simple souls but basically we are going to  the movies not to admire art, photography, the raising sun, posters of cities, say like Tokyo (Lost in Translation) but to be entertained. If we can have a joly good laught at it, the better and even a somewhat sugary happy-end does not turn us off, like the professional art critics. This film fully fulfills these expectations: it is entertaining, humorous, very well acted by all, quick-moving and has the happy end, which maybe is somewhat unreal and does not belong to the stories. Essentially it is also a new twist> how boy does not meat girl and vice-versa. Is that bad? The point is, you leave the moviehouse with a smile on your face and the pizza and beer taste better after it. So what else should one ask more from entertinment? For me, it was an absolute ten and would love to see more of the genre.",Love Actually

Emma Thompson...the scene in her bedroom as she comes to term with her husband's infidelity...gut-wrenching. And yet it's sandwiched between so many hilarious scenes. Hugh Grant, best performance, apart from About A Boy. Has Keira Knightly ever looked more beautiful? It's sooo much better than Four Weddings and both Bridget Jones combined.

The Hugh Grant Prime minister & the assistant scenes as well as the Liam Neeson character scenes towards the end were particularly painful. Richard Curtis stereotypical Britain at its very worst. If it were to get anymore artificial sweetness to it then it would surely have to come with a health warning for being to light and fluffy.The only true highlight for me was the the small role given to Gregor Fisher.

I began hoping, someday, like Natalie, I will find my own PM!Further, I like the scene with the cue cards.

And I loved Notting Hill so it's nothing against Richard Curtis, or romantic comedies : whatever. It's just a really really bad film. You want gags? There's very few here, except for the odd Hugh Grant scene. You want romance? All you get is a snap-shot of about 10 different couples, and with only one exception you couldn't care less about any of them. This is a simply awful screenplay, and although there isn't anything wrong with the direction, I suspect now that the only reason Richard Curtis directed it himself is because no-one else would have touched it. And yes, it is anti-american, which a lot of people may not care about, and bizarrely enough anti-airport security as well, which most people probably would. However ... Colin Firth's scenes with the Portuguese lady were okay, actually (sorry) : as these were also predominantly set outside London / the UK it makes me wonder whether the writer might hit the mark again if he dared to write next time about something / somewhere a bit different to the imaginary London yuppy sapville he seems to rely on so strongly.",Love Actually

This film shows exactly what's wrong with the world today. When this film was released in the UK, it was slated by critics. Yet, these very critics are clearly people who have no emotions. Because, of course, it is not ""cool"" to show your emotions. There was a time, when I was a macho cop carrying a gun, that I would have called this film trash.

Thank goodness I waited. Every aspect of the script is cloying, from the strained marriage between two middle-aged parents (Thompson and Rickman) to the stomach ache-inducing romance between Firth and his Italian housekeeper, to (finally) the entirely unbelievable storyline of the prime minister (Grant) and an aide. This movie doesn't just employ every cliché known to the romantic comedy genre, it revels in them.Worse, the acting is strained by the actors' knowing they've committed to a sub-par project. They try desperately to evoke something gracefully; only Nighy treats this job with the derision it deserves--slurring all of his lines in what might be an attempt to get them over with faster rather rather than a character cue.",Love Actually

It is however completely inoffensive, apart from Martine Mcwhateverhernameis, as she can't really act to save her life.

With the line up of top ""box office"" stars, this film falls down on some ridiculous stories and bad language. By adding the bad language it suggests that this is an adult movie, but the theme is based upon love and Christmas family togetherness, which is both confusing and annoying. Confusing because this film abandons it's aim to be a seasonal family favourite for sensationalism and the usual British idea that to make a good film that will appeal to Americans, you have to add shock tactics, that a good script and top actors are not enough. Annoying because with the bad language it doesn't qualify for the seasonal Christmas Day family film, sitting around the telly after dinner. Annoying because the story plots are so poor, with only one exception. That exception is the story with Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman. They act everyone else off the film. The lost opportunity is that the film makers didn't abandon everything else and just concentrate on their story. This is one of Emma Thompson's finest moments. Such a shame that it is buried beneath such ordinariness. I would have gladly given 10 out of 10 if the film had been centred entirely around her's and Alan Rickman's characters.",Love Actually

I think the nine separate story lines weave together well. This is definitely a chick flick. It is funny, touching and heartbreaking. It's hard to pick my favorite storyline, but I can narrow it down to three. Jamie and Aurelia- Love knows now bounds, not even a language barrier. Daniel and stepson Sam- ""The total agony of being in love"" Mark and Juliette- The love that can never be. She belongs to someone else but he'll love her till his dying day. I think what makes this movie so appealing is that most of us sometime in our lives have found ourselves in at least one of these scenarios or at least something similar, I know I have.

I'm almost embarrassed to admit it, but I watched that scene about 5 times - and cried each time! Also, the scene where Emma Thompson breaks down after finding out her husband didn't buy that necklace for her was just heartbreaking. I've been there and the emotion she showed was real.

905,willimagine,Please. Don't Waste Your Time.,2,1 January 2013,"I am going to be honest. For a movie that is supposed to be about love, I felt sick the whole way through. The character development was superficial and shallow and the mash-up of numerous haphazard story- lines was sporadic and distracting. I was given no real reason to care about any of the characters, no real reason to believe that the characters actually felt some form of love that extended beyond their bluntly scripted ego-motives, and I was given no real indication that any of the relationships actually had real substance. We were shown a wacky and contrived selection of insecure puppets blundering through life and 'love' like they were on some kind of...movie set. And the blasting pop music really didn't help with the 'ambiance'. Great music, sure, but not while I'm trying to make sense of this desperately driven dialog. And yet...even with the movie-'magic' set-ups and the ever manipulative 'twists' of plot, some people commend the movie for being 'realistic', and for showing the 'bad with the good'. OK, first of all, it is far from realistic; secondly, the purpose of art is not to show you reality. Scientific reports are the only things that can even get close to representing reality. Art, however, tells a creative story that generates some sort of effect on its audience. Disgust is not my preferred way of being 'inspired', and I am still doubting whether the time it takes to write this review is worth it. So regardless of what the movie-makers were aspiring to, all I see this movie doing is encouraging the ill notion that love is some kind of messy sh*t-show that is impossible to understand or enjoy, but we're all suckers for it anyway. It hurts to say this, but I think the movie-makers were going for 'relatable'. Gosh, aren't we all a bunch of desperate suckers? Yeah, great feeling hey?

Hugh Grant as English Prime Minister - He tells off the US President because he is sexist. I don't expect films to be completely realistic, but somehow grounded in reality. This prime minister is going to put US-English relations in jeopardy because the President hits on Hugh Grant's love interest, please. I know the film is trying to make a political statement, but this is just idiotic. 2. Keira Knightly and her husband's best friend love interest just doesn't make any sense. She marries a man and then immediately has some sort of interest in a guy who never would talk to her. The plot line just doesn't ring true. 3. They take the little kids love interest a little too seriously. 4. Are English people capable of ""sealing the deal."" or are they all too shy to actually go in for the ""kill."" The movie is frustrating in this respect. 5. Emma Thompson is dressed in a gray sweatsuit. Then in the end she wears make-up to show us that it really is partly her fault that her husband nearly cheated on her. Please don't treat me like a moron.

910,tombutton15,Painful,1,8 December 2017,"I watched this film recently, mainly as my partner absolutely loves it. But I must say it is one of the worst films I have watched, for many reasons. One of the story-lines involves a man (Peter) getting married to his fiancée (Juliet). This guy has a best friend (Mark) who is in love with Juliet. She eventually finds out when she sees the footage of the wedding Mark took which features her. And just her. Instead of being creeped out, she is flattered. Later on there is this romantic scene where he confesses his love (because ""It's Christmas""). How is this romantic? On the other hands another story-line features a WOMAN wanting to get it on with her (married) boss. Yet, it seems when a man does it it's romantic. But when it's a woman, then she is treated by the film as just a relationship-ruining, walking, talking vag**a. I'm not saying the secretary was in the right in any way. It's just the double-standard that gets to me here. Plus you have Colin Firth's character falling in love with a Portuguese woman. Despite neither of them being able to communicate because of the language barrier. Yeah, yeah, it's all romantic because they went and then learnt each others languages, but still, by the time they meet up again, both dual-linguistic, so Colin Firth can ask her for marriage, they still haven't actually spoken to each other yet. Then you have Colin. A guy who can't seem to get himself with any lady for some reason. I dunno, you'd think calling a woman you don't know your ""Future Wife"" would have her throw herself into your arms. He decides he'd have more luck in the US. Turns out he was unbelievably right, it a scene so completely over-the-top ridiculous and just utterly dumb, I was (and am) still convinced it was just Colin having some sleazy dream, because even in a fictional movie, it was just that ridiculous. And I haven't even got to the fat-shaming, the poor writing, the general sexism, the stupid airport scene (where the film went from completely cheesy to vomit inducing), the concept that the woman who worked at that office lost her chance at love because she has to care for her mentally ill brother, Emma Thompson's character telling a guy grieving over the death of his wife to get over it, Emma Thompson & Alan Rickman's story-arc...i could go on.Overall, I would not recommend this to any one.

""All you need is love,"" the closing refrain begins, and I heartily agree. Try finding it in this film, and you'll be miserably disappointed to the degree you'll begin to question whether or not true love, the love of Shakespearean sonnets and classic tragedies, even exists at all. So bleak is this film's representation of human existence that at times I wondered whether or not the film was made as an intentional, existential mockery of our lives. Alas, I don't think it was. This leads me to the mortifying conclusion that all those who produced the film, and those who enjoyed it, are fixated with pitifully infantile definitions of human relationships. It's pap, actually. Unadulterated pap.",Love Actually
912,liafullynn,Favorite movie ever!,10,30 August 2004,"Some spoilers.This is absolutely my favorite film of all time. It's funny, sweet, and sad with many different relationships woven into the plot. It sounds really confusing, but it's not. Most of the actors I knew, but never expected them in a role quite like theirs in Love Actually. (Alan Rickman, Keira Knightly, and Rowan Atkinson). Seriously, even my dad liked it! Some characters were stupid while others were touching, but I think it carries a nice message. It is rather unlike any movie I have ever seen before. The funniest part by far is the scene where Alan Rickman is buying the necklace and the whole thing with Rowan Atkinson wrapping up the gift. Hilarious! Anyway, I think it's a great movie and I highly recommend it.",Love Actually

Love Actually is one of a select few that make me angry.I didn't need to write this but I can't believe it got such a good review. Filter the 'hated it' comments on here so you can read other's far more eloquent comments of why this film is so awful.I thought it was the most poorly conceived, manipulative pile of rubbish I've had the misfortune to sit through. I had no empathy for any characters and the interlinking was unconvincing, predictable, and pointless. Shallow two dimensional characters. Virtually no plot.Self congratulatory nonsense.

Espacially these days as the spirit gets lost more and more, and everyone tries to take profit out of the festive days, this movie shows us the other way. That it's not about spend money get money having total stress in the process. It's about getting in contact, being honest with your loved ones. Give the best part of yourself and you will receive so.

One moment you laugh and the next you almost cries because you feel so sad for the people. The way the mix it all up, it's lovely. So if you don't have seen this movie go see it now, beacause it's Christmas and it's get you a warm feeling. Hugh Grant is doing his part very well, being the primeminister. Emma Thomson feels so real in her role. Colin Firth is very funny when he tries to learn Spanish...

916,crazyfiary,Don't expect too much,5,20 June 2014,"We all know why we came around to watching this film. We were blinded by the all-star cast and the foggy summary of the story and decided ""Why not?"". It's a weird thing because there really isn't much to be said any further than ""follows the lives of eight different couples"" - you see bits and pieces of those very different relationships but in the end you aren't fully satisfied with any of them. All the time I felt like a writer was given a list with the actors that should be included and was made to write a bearable script for them. And the result was a movie that feels incomplete in not one, but eight ways (well, maybe 7 1/2). There are some good sides to it, though. The actors do their job well, the stories are simple but enjoyable and it's enough to keep you entertained without making you feel like you have been robbed of two hours of your time. Love Actually isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one. If you catch it on TV and there is nothing else to watch it's a good option, but otherwise I'd say skip it.",Love Actually
917,peterthetrunk,what a beautiful story,10,17 January 2006,"From the view ""out of Hollywood"" LOVE ACTUALLY is a true gem and one of the most underrated pictures of the past years. HBO seems to agree with me because the movie is shown there on a regular basis. Congratulations to Richard Curtis, one of the most sensitive (movie script) writers (and now also directors)of our time. Compared to most of the big, dull Hollywood movies, Richard Curtis did not forget the art of telling a heartwarming story. As in Four Weddings and a funural and in Notting Hill, Mr. Curtis manages again to makes us laugh, cry and feel good at the same time. Love Actually is a heartwarming true piece of phylosophy that many of today's movies lack. Mr. Curtis can do without any special effects because it is the story that matters, nothing else.",Love Actually
918,lorenzaccio,long commercial,3,12 January 2005,"typical conformist British comedy, love actually has no taste, or the taste of a commercial for vodafone or cisco systems... There are a lot of characters and the rhythm is high, so you can't be really bored by love actually. There is a character and a story for each type of viewer: the sexy story for the young cool guy, the ""adultere"" story for the 50 years old woman..., and some anecdotal or ridiculous stories (the prime minister and his waitress...). The movie respects some rules, those which made successful other British comedy's as Bridget Jones. If you liked Bridget, love actually is really pleasant; Some scenes even seems to be part of the sequel of Bridget. but you remain with a question: has the writer-director Richard Curtis ever been in love? his way of thinking is closer to a responsible of advertising agency than a scenarist: before talking about love, a writer could be able to show some love or tenderness for his characters; but Curtis respects sacred rules of actual British comedy: niggardliness toward characters, sociological plot, and morality hidden behind broad jokes... The film is made for TV: what could be the interest to see on a big screen this little characters, described with so much meanness, and without personality? The resemblance with commercials is frightening, more than in major part of Hollywood movies: European films can surpass American ones in putting a maximum of marketing in cinema.",Love Actually
919,mukamas,An entertaining pastime,8,18 January 2005,"A very predictable romantic comedy, in the ""white anglosaxon protestant male"" kind of way. Bill Nighy's blatantly clichéd rocker and Rowan Atkinson's divine touch save a lot. Curtis was obviously playing it safe by his choice of cast, although Hugh Grant as the PM is as believable as - well, as believable as many other things seen during the film.*** Start of Spoilers *** While most of the story lines are rather cringeworthy, while there are chubby jokes calorie, and while the main cast is predominantly white and male, there is a certain entertaining aspect to the flick. Perhaps this is due to the (preciously few) darker, more bitter and less sweet story lines - although these too become diluted in the end, in a true Christmas fashion. It is a shame that Rowan Atkinson's angelic role was not exploited to greater extent; his final line is probably the best one in the film, in its dry, understated glory. *** End of spoilers *** I guess the film could be viewed as a satirical take on the traditional romcom formula, so overdone are the gender typecasting and certain story lines. That's my rationale for giving it an eight out of ten.",Love Actually

921,pablosamuelcastro,Worst movie I've seen in a long long time,1,26 December 2013,"This is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There are (maybe) two scenes which made me chuckle a little, but the rest made me want to throw up. Cheezy to the point of being ridiculous, unrealistic but without any of the charm of fantastical realism. To top it off, I simply cannot stand Hugh Grant. His role as prime minister is absurd. He attempts to play it as a ""cute"" and ""charming"" guy who just wants to do the right thing and can't get his mind off his maid. The speech he gave with the US president was probably the lowest point of this movie. I don't know why I continued watching after that, but it's probably only because my wife wanted to continue watching it.There are a lot of really great actors in this film, but I don't understand how they accepted to star in it. They must have been paid a hefty sum.If you really like cheesy feel-good movies and don't care if they're good or bad, then I guess you could watch this. But I'm sure there are other options out there which are not as bad as this garbage.",Love Actually
922,mkost,great movie!,8,7 March 2005,"Never having been a huge Hugh Grant fan, I had always passed this one up walking the aisles of Blockbuster. However it was during the pre-Christmas run on HBO, during which it seemed like it was on at least 5 times a day, that I committed to sit down and watch it at LEAST once. WOW is all I could find myself thinking as the credits began to roll - after going through the roller-coaster of emotions that it brings you through. Not only did I watch it that once, but then once again an hour later on one of the other HBO channels!!! I can honestly say I have NO idea how many times I have watched it since then, but I would definitely say it is well into double digits!! As previously mentioned here in another note, this is definitely a movie that withstands multiple viewings, mostly because it seems that with each one, I uncovered another sub-plot or twist that had slipped by me up until then. (I strongly recommend that you watch it at least twice to catch what you missed - more than a few times in the first run through I caught myself reversing a few frames on the DVD trying to figure out how the characters were tied together!) I really felt so many connections with the different characters & situations, and think that everyone has had these same situations occur at some point in their lives too. It is set during the weeks leading up to Christmas, but I think it is a great ""feel good"" choice any time of the year... I have recommended it to all of my friends, who have all shared the same feelings after watching it - any of whom could have written this! ENJOY!!!",Love Actually
923,kathleenkw1,"brainless, ridiculous representation of women, shallow",1,18 February 2007,"This movie was a disappointing representation of love, though it had its cute moments, like the puppy love expressed by the little boy and encouraged by the dad. All the women but one appeared brainless, attraction between all was based on shallow physical attributes that were really nothing more than infatuation, and women were demeaned to the point of nausea. That said, the format and non-linear story line were clever, with paths crossing here and there and some coming together in the end. The characters were so implausible, however, it was almost like a cartoon.

924,nompular,Please tell me this was meant to be ironic...,1,19 June 2005,"So.. is it just me or was anyone else greatly offended, if not outright appalled by everything this movie had to ""offer""? Not only was the acting simply awful with its cheesy lines and its predictable scenarios, but there were also so many different stories it made each one lose any meaning it might have had in the process. On another less general note, I was offended by the fact that Colin Firth only started to really find his Portuguese maid attractive once she stripped down to her underwear, Liam Neeson's kid, right after his own mother's funeral, claimed he wasn't distraught over her at all - it was LOVE that was tormenting him, and the comment made by the father of the Portuguese maid to his other daughter - the ""fat"" one - saying ""oh shutup, dunkin' donut 3000"".... is this supposed to be funny? Because if it is, i think i may have lost hope in humanity forever. What would possess anyone to nominate this movie for not one, but TWO golden globes? There is far more to be said about this pathetic attempt at redeeming love and people in general, however it might cause me to feel ill so i will discontinue. My overall vote?

Furthermore it turned out to be quite clever and unpredictable at times. Here's a picture - for once - the plot of which is NOT drawn up at board meetings and based on demographic surveys. It does have its weak moments - what film doesn't - but the pleasing variety of plot keeps the viewer interested throughout the movie.Casting is brilliant all round; somewhat predictable at times, but not annoyingly so. And most familiar faces managed to squeeze an ounce of fresh performance from themselves. I've always liked Rickman's grumpy style, but here it got some new dimensions.

-There is neither love nor the spirit of Christmas in this movie. Why it was billed as both in 2003 was simply a marketing gimmick to try to extend residuals paid to the producer into perpetuity when unsuspecting people flip it on every Christmas into 2018.
-The story is jammed with 10 sub-plots, which is too many, so they have to toggle through repeatedly, giving little screen time to character and plot development.
-Some writer thought he was clever for writing parallel stories, but forgot to intertwine them, so they became totally unrelated.
-Because the lack of screen time per sub-plot, those stories can't possibly show enough depth of interaction between two actors to get the audience to buy in that there is actually love there.
-The 'love' stories are: two porn stars who film together start to like each other, another porn star flies off to the US to have threesomes, a guy is infatuated with his best friend's wife, a middle aged married man is seduced by his secretary, a woman and man who work together have awkward tension, a writer falls in love and proposes to his housekeeper and neither of them speak the same language, a little boy has a crush on a little girl, the Prime Minister falls in love with his waitstaff, who he has had one or two very brief conversations with regarding where she lives
-Let's not overlook the drawn out sex scenes and nudity (in a ""Christmas"" movie??) between porn stars and this one pair who are about to have a one night stand, until her mentally I'll brother calls twice and you listen to a detailed coversation between them for two minutes, while the guy sits there on the bed feeling as awkward as I did. Said sex scenes don't even change camera angles and are from fifteen feet away, so you feel like a voyeristic creep looking through a peep hole.
-The production is horrible, so you go from quiet scenes, abruptly into ear splittingly loud musical scores.
-Someone out there who thinks I've missed the point of the irony of the title, Love Actually, which is meant to point out that people don't have story book encounters of love in real life vs how they're portrayed in movies, will be disappointed to know I've already thought of that, which is the point of this review. People in real life aren't actually this impossibly weird or awkward. So this isn't ACTUALLY how love goes.

930,fireside999,Actually a fine piece of movie-making....!,8,4 June 2005,"(This comment has been written by a Swedish guy suffering from a serious hangover. So I hope you will excuse the poor English...) Firstly, for me as a common guy the genre ""romantic comedies"" doesn't rank high. Fairer to say, I try avoid them as much as is humanly possible. However, when my girlfriend brought home Love Actually and threatened with a sex-free relationship the coming weeks if I didn't watch the film with her left me without much of a choice.So I sat down with her and muttered something about ""pathetic chick-flicks"", but almost as soon as the film started I found myself mesmerized by it. And believe me, no one was more surprised by this than me! It was really that kind of film you don't want to end and which you find yourself to think about long after you have picked out the DVD from the DVD-player (the opposite to mindless, branded Hollywood action-movies). The film is really funny, highly romantic (in the best sense of the world), has a great soundtrack and very well-acted by the many famous British actors.The film portrays the many various aspects of love and how it affect people's life and destinies. The story follows a bunch of people living in London the weeks before Christmas whose life's are intertwined in different ways, with the common nominator being love, and a Christmas play at the end of the film...The film has many peaks but I would like to especially mention the scene where Keira Knightly's character discovers her husbands best friends feelings towards her. The expression on her face together with the guys inability to stay in the same room as her as he leaves his apartment to the tones of Dido is really heart-breaking. At this point of the film I was having serious problems not the let my girlfriend see how much the film was affecting me... And even though Keira Knightley has a face to die for (I can't imagine a guy who wouldn't describe her as extremely gorgeous in this film) the strength of this scene is that the feeling of unrequited love is something most people can relate to.Finally, this is a film I can highly recommend, both to guys and girls. However, if your notion of great film-making is the latest Van Diesel-movie you might get disappointed. But on the other hand, then you either have passed the point of no return when it comes to good taste in movies or you're 15 years old....",Love Actually

The characters all had their own individual struggles or love interests and it came together beautifully in the end. I would rank this among the best romantic comedies I have watched. The one deleted scene in which the young boy and his father listen to the song Joanna and the boy has the love movies on his wall would have been a good addition to the movie and should not have been deleted in my opinion. This scene not only showed the relationship between the father and son, it also showed the boys love interest and the mutual love for the mom. This movie showed that love can cross the barriers of language and regardless of the circumstances true love can find a way. There were many different stories which allowed the viewer to feel anger, happiness, joy, sadness, etc. Certain characters incorporated comedy into the movie which was a nice touch but the movie is not only about love in a relationship sense. Love is also shown between families and friends. Certain characters are very loyal to the ones they love, while others betray the trust of those which they love.

936,werchos,A classic example of the lengths that people will go for Love!,8,13 July 2005,"Rarely in a movie do we see several story lines interwoven perfectly with the right amount of balance and complexity as we do in Love Actually. In this magnificent portrayal of real life love we see eight love stories unfold over the festive Christmas season. Never before have I fully seen captured people who are willing to go for the all consuming thing we call love.Viewers experience these great lengths when they see the love story of Collin, actor Kris Marshall, who is willing to fly across the world to find love. Then there is the endearing story of Sam, actor Thomas Sangster. (Who does a superb job). Sam is willing to learn a new hobby in order to obtain his hearts desire. These seem to be real life stories which are not all fluff and happy ending like we see in many movies such as The wedding singer. The type of realism used makes the audiences sympathize with the ups and downs of obtaining, keeping and losing love.Director Richard Curtis does a great job in bringing attention to several elements that is pivotal to the plots. Often lust accompanies love. Curtis used the element of color to bring attention to a lustful situation. By making use of the color red throughout the movie, he gives a physical color to seduction. A scene which illustrates the use of the bold color is when Harry, actor Alan Richman, and Karen, actress Emma Thompson, are at Harry's work Christmas party. We see a vixen from Harry's office enter the scene wearing a slinky red dress and red devil horns! The clever minx is trying to seduce Harry in front of his own wife! Curtis also uses clever dialog to get his point across that no price to great at the chance of Love. It is never clearer than in the scene with Liam Neaseon as Daniel, a widower trying to raise his stepson, and Sangster as Sam. Daniel conveys to his son that love is indeed worth all the risk which may come from a broken heart. Sam sums it all up when he says "" Okay  lets do it Dad. Let us go get the (crap) kicked out of us for love"".The combination of an award winning cast, great direction and theatrical elements viewers will not have to go great lengths to actually fall in love with this movie.",Love Actually

943,cloudy58,Contrived nonsense.,1,2 August 2005,"This is exactly the type of movie that gives all men the shudders when the phrase ""romantic comedy"" is uttered. Although made in England, this drivel exhibits all the worst aspects of the contrived nonsense that the Ephron sisters, and indeed many others in Hollywood, have become so adept at providing. After being forced to sit through it by my (no longer) girlfriend, I wanted to punch something in order to release the stress built up by the 90 continuous minutes of intelligence-insulting twaddle that this film presents. The worst aspect of the experience was seeing many of the best actors on the planet wasting their talent along with my time. The only mildly amusing character is Bill Nighy's rebelliously aging rock star, whilst the rest of the cast merely struggle bravely through this unfunny cliché-ridden disaster.",Love Actually

Chirpy ""classic"" pop songs populate every third scene. It has no structure, just a jumble of interconnected stories -- some little dramas, some little comedies -- about love, flirtation, courtship and heartbreak, all of which will pay off just in time for a lovely London Christmas.It's the kind of pandering, populist movie in which Hugh Grant, playing the prime minister of England, joyously shakes his booty to The Pointer Sisters' ""Jump (For My Love)"" until he suddenly, to his great embarrassment, realizes he's being watched. It offers no real surprises except in how and when it reveals the inevitable six degrees of separation between each anecdotal yarn -- none of which has enough substance to ever stand on its own (nor would you want them to!).",Love Actually

This one was different, however, because of the lightning performance by Bill Nighy. His portrayal of Billy Mack, the has-been rock star and ex-heroin addict ""struggling to make a comeback at any price"" is, for lack of a better word, priceless. His character is deeply developed, beautifully intricate, and sorrowfully realistic, not to mention hilarious. I found myself coasting from scene to scene, waiting with baited breath for more appearances of the quirky rocker. His obvious loneliness and attempted cover-ups were touching, and his epiphany at the end was gorgeous.This isn't the first time Bill Nighy has saved a movie. He did it before in Underworld, and he's done it again here.Bill Nighy is undeniably one of the greatest actors I've ever seen. I've never known anyone else to be so completely unrecognizable from film to film, not because he actually looks different (in fact, he almost always looks exactly the same) but because he melds with his characters so perfectly, he makes each one breathe with its own life.If you're not all in to the romantic comedy scene, but want to see an awesome performance by an amazing actor, do what I did: watch all the Billy Mack scenes, and skip the rest.~CucumbermoonP.S. Incidentally, Billy Mack has one of the funniest lines I've heard in a long, long time: ""Hi Kids. Here's an important message from your uncle Bill. Don't buy drugs."" Pause.

951,vpathy,Disappointing but occasionally entertaining,5,25 September 2005,"Well I felt moved to post a comment on LA after just seeing it on DVD. I had heard so many good things that I actually went & bought the DVD and was really looking forward to it but I was very disappointed...actually. After watching I looked it up on IMDb & checked out a sample of other viewers' comments...and was hugely surprised by the fact that the majority were very positive ones with a high score! I would have expected an absolute slating on a discerning movie site like this to be honest...OK so for the positive - the film was entertaining in places, had great production values (the London scenery shots were very attractive). Most of the large (and well-known) ensemble cast were good actors and did their best with the material. I laughed (very) occasionally.But overall the negative prevailed and I came away feeling like I had wasted my time on a film that hadn't ""added"" anything to my cinematic experiences. The main negative IMO was that there were far too many stories, all of which were given too little airtime to make any of the them involving or interesting. I presume it was the director's deliberate intention to give us snippets of many ""love"" stories to expound on the theme that ""love is all around""! This can sometimes work but here it really didn't...the bad stories should have been dropped and the good ones should have been expanded so that we come away feeling some kind of affiliation with at least a few characters.So IMO the best stories were:- Laura Linney's 2 year unrequited love - finally reciprocated but unconsummated due to her personal responsibilities for her brother, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman and the near-derailing of their marriage by a potential affair, Colin Firth and his cleaner gradually getting attracted in France However these were not developed properly - we saw fragments and then abrupt/uncertain or melodramatic (see Colin) conclusions, which was a shame as I had (eventually) actually started to care about these characters.Some of the rest were clearly rubbish - English guy in US gets 4 girls, Andrew Lincoln loves best friend's wife despite never having spoken to her (OK I know she's Keira Knightley but still!), little boy fancies American girl. Surely nobody could have found these stories involving! Even the supposedly headline story of PM and his assistant was so underwritten as to be inconsequential. I like Hugh Grant and Martine McCutcheon and they did their best...but we'd only seen a couple of scenes between their characters where they had barely exchanged 2 words. So when Hugh read Martine's Xmas card the viewer could scarcely be expected to believe in their sudden mutual love!! Again if this fledging relationship had previously been explored a bit more I too would have been rooting for Hugh to find her in Wandsworth!And there was no credible or consequential tie-in between characters (unlike say Crash or Magnolia) which I think is a must if you are going to have this type of multi-layered story-telling Some of them happened to attend the same school play?! And then some of them happened to be at Heathrow arrivals on the same day?! These were for the most part unrelated characters.Apart from this mishmash of quantity not quality and unrelated stories, the whole film just felt too slick. It felt like Richard Curtis was following a checklist of ingredients for ""Successful English Comedy"" and though I know he probably did the same for 4W&AF and NH for some reason both of those felt more substantial and I enjoyed them. This one really really felt like we were all (director, actors and viewers) going through the motions one more time. In a similar vein unlike the previous romcoms when I had got caught up in the mush, I really noticed here when the director was giving us ""reaction signposts"" and it irked me enough I stubbornly refused to follow his directions! Ie this bit's silly (English guy meets 4 hot American chicks), this bit's funny (PM dances around No 10), this bit's moving (Liam Neeson bonds with stepson) etc etcSo overall then not terrible but a bit of a wasted opportunity for an interesting idea and some top-drawer talent.",Love Actually

There is something in the movie for almost every person or family or couple or almost couple to relate to. And it is refreshing that there was not necessarily a predictable ending for every subplot. Emma Thompson and Liam Neeson put in excellent performances as did many of the actors who are not as readily identifiable by American movie goers. While the writing is not completely unique in content, the movie overall is a breath of fresh air, at least for American movie goers, given the uniqueness of the British location and the slang and language.

Of course it is girly and naive sometimes but it also addresses to more complexes issues and deals with some controversial themes. The movie is also really funny and the cast is fantastic.

959,elena-lanz,Love is what really matters,8,2 February 2006,"The first time I have seen this film it was some months after it was out on the screens because -as often it may happen- the title ""Love actually"" can be misjudged as another superficial comedy without nothing to give us. And yet, after I watched it I felt it had transmitted me the warm feeling that Love is what really matters. None of the subplots is major to the others, and actually one could say that none of the subplots is really relevant to the development of the story. And that could be it true, but there's a deeper reason behind it: be it a child love, a widower love, an affair or a brotherly love, it doesn't need to be odd, eccentric or spectacular to matter. The best line of the film (Hugh Grant's/the British PM's), and the summary of it all, will help you realise it.""Prime Minister: Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world, I think about the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport. General opinion's starting to make out that we live in a world of hatred and greed, but I don't see that. It seems to me that love is everywhere. Often it's not particularly dignified or newsworthy, but it's always there - fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends. When the planes hit the Twin Towers, as far as I know none of the phone calls from the people on board were messages of hate or revenge - they were all messages of love. If you look for it, I've got a sneaky feeling you'll find that love actually is all around.""",Love Actually
960,mbrenn5,Don't know which review to look at? PICK MINE,8,11 December 2005,"""Love Actually"" is a romantic comedy about a dozen love stories whose lives are all loosely connected to each other, all rolled into one, slightly over two-hour movie. Although it is a very touching movie which leaves you feeling warm inside, there were a few scenes that could have been cut and some other alterations to the movie could have been done to make it come together better.This movie shows all different types of love from love at first sight, as in the story about the Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) and his tea maid (Martine McCutcheon), to Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) who sees that his love lies in his best friend and manager, and to Jamie and Aurelia (Colin Firth and Lucia Moniz), whose only language is love. Yes that sounds cheesy, but it is true.Richard Curtis, the director of this film, who has also done work on ""Notting Hill"", ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", and ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", does not seem to step out of the box with romantic comedies and casting Hugh Grant.Hugh Grant plays a lovable, awkward, young Prime Minister, who falls for the chubby, who probably weighs about 115 lbs., instead of the rest of the cast who weigh about 98 lbs., Downing Street maid. Although all the girls swoon over him, I have seen this character many a time before in all his other films, such as in ""About a Boy,"" nothing new in my eyes.There is also the love is forever story with Emma Thompson's character, Karen, who has been married to her husband Harry (Alan Richman), who is a potentially cheating husband. This is the story that, if I cried in movies, I would. Karen was expecting a very nice Christmas present only received a CD. She then went into the bedroom and cried. They showed about five minutes of her just standing there with a sad song in the background. It was depressing, sad, and it make me want to go in the movie screen and hug Emma Thompson.The next love match is Jamie (Colin Firth) and Aurelia (Lucia Moniz). He is the character who was cheated on in the beginning and then falls for the Portuguese housemaid and both of them can't speak the same language. Although this also does not stem far from his character in ""Bridget Jones' Diary"", I like this love story. I think that it is innocent and shows that there can be love without language. You then have Bill Nighy's character Billy Mack who's on-going joke about his cheesy Christmas hit ""Christmas is All Around"" finds out that the love of his life is his best friend and manager- strictly platonic. I thought this was one of the more touching stories because it includes a certain love that everyone knows about at every age. The other stories that are more touching is about the love story between Laura Linney's character Sarah and her mentally challenged brother and the story about a step-father, Daniel (Liam Neeson) and son (Thomas Sangster), whose mother and wife had just passed, and apparently the son is in love with a girl at school. These are the more touching stories that people can relate to: brothers and sisters, dads and sons, elementary puppy love. These are the small stories that make this movie more realistic and like you know the characters.Billy Bob Thornton plays the U.S. President in this movie and there is an anti-American feeling slammed in our faces during a few of Grant's and Thornton's scenes together. Thornton seems to be compared to a suave Bill Clinton. In the beginning of the movie, it also talks briefly about the war and the security at airports.There is also one comic relief character, Colin (Kris Marshall), a young , college- aged student, who can't seem to find love in the UK, so he believes that if he goes to America, he will get tons f chicks because of his cute British accent. Inevitably, it turns out that it is true. This is another on-going joke throughout the movie.The movie ended up being just over two hours long, a little too long for just a romantic comedy. And although this movie has 3 dramatic scenes with the man chasing the girl in a public, odd place, there is a deeper meaning behind this movie. It shows many different kids of love, besides romantic, and I think those points shouldn't be over looked. In the end, everybody still likes Hugh Grant and shy guys getting the girl. It is a good movie to curl up with a bunch of girl friends. Your classic chick flick, and I, being a chick, like it.",Love Actually

My friend says that him and Billy just realized that the went through their whole lives just to realize they are best friends and that sense Billy Mack tells Joe that he's the love of his life. I think they finally realize, after all that time, that they do deeply love each other and at that moment become gay. Another things that leads me to believe this is at the end when Billy Mack brings that girl home in the airport and Joe doesn't even know who she is. I think it's a cover-up for their homosexuality.

I think the time line (all of this happening in 5 weeks) is unrealistic but I think that the actions, reactions and thoughts of some of the characters are very realistic and amusing (like Laura Linney covering her face after she almost literally runs into the guy she's in love w/)! I did find the scene where the British young man goes to American and meets the women in a bar somewhat confusing (at least from the perspective of an American). I'm not sure if this was supposed to poke fun at the stereotype of Americans loving guys w/ British accents or if the British actually believe that the average American woman will meet and sleep w/ a British guy just b/c he's British (or b/c he's there).Also, I think the American president role was intended to be based on the actions/personality of Clinton given the way the character seemed to attempt to seduce the woman in the Prime Minister's office.All in all though, a great movie if only b/c it shows that love is never free from struggles and problems but that makes it all the better when it's obtained.",Love Actually

Well although it is predictable, sweet and happy-ending, it is however not boring, very original, and surprisingly pleasant. Yet I've never been a big fan of British movies. They talk too much and not much acting. Their jokes are so light, a slight grin would be a possibility but not a laugh out loud. This movie is not a 'must-see', but it's a classic ""cult"".

964,mageesa,self-reflexive romantic comedy,5,2 January 2006,"I'm not a big fan of the chick-flick genre, but this movie is interesting if you watch it as a critique of 'cinematic' love...As others have complained, the power relationships between the male and female characters were disturbing; (hard to imagine a world uninhabited by simultaneously ambitious and attractive women). But this is a world constructed by the filmmaker, not a picture of reality, and in this world there is no passion for anything but passion. Work, art, intellectual activity... these things are as uninteresting to the men as to the women. The men are in power not because they have a passionate interest in their field (politics, acting, business), but because they have been placed in a position of power by the writer. We have to ask ourselves, what was the filmmaker was driving at: why such a flat, unengaged world?In this particular world, people fall 'in love' based on nothing, and longer relationships are devalued (the Liam Neeson lack of mourning, the Alan Rickman marriage...). I've seen complaints that the men love the women without speaking to them, only for their looks, but the same could be said of the women, who love the men only for their power... the modern romantic dilemma in a nutshell!These superficial relationships are intentionally constructed to offer a contrast to the main story line: that of the aging rock star. This ironic character initially represents the crass commercialism and superficiality of Christmas, but unlike the others, he is self-aware. His public self-mockery draws attention to the pathos of the holiday, and to the emptiness of his life. And he is redeemed, not only in the charts, but through his revelation about the true nature of Christmas, and his discovery of 'True Love'. Unlike the other characters, he acts against his own self-interest (to leave Elton John's party, where there are attractive women in lower positions of power), in order to be with the real 'love of his life'. (Only the office woman shows similar self-sacrifice, leaving the hunky programmer to care for her brother, but this relationship lacks self-awareness, and therefore offers no redemption in the end.)I'm not a Christian, but I think it's no accident that this story of contrasts (between the 'real' and the appearance) takes place in a de- Christianized Christmas, with no mention of Christ, or what his message was... the lobsters at the nativity play highlight this disconnect between the 'real' holiday and how it is celebrated today (in portrayal), just as the stories illustrate a disconnect between 'real' love and how it is shown in movies (or how it might be experienced by many people today). I don't think the person who made this film wants us to idealize its vision of romance... on the contrary!(I am going to assume all this is intentional on the filmmaker's part, because as an artist, I know every decision in a work is made with intention. )One clue that there's more going on here (in terms of self-reflexiveness) is the romance between the porn stand-ins; that seems a little cue for us to consider the film-making process, and the falseness of portrayal. Also, after the revelation of 'True Love', the rock star suggests they watch porn... another constructed contrast between real love and 'film love'. But I think I'm running out of space here, and those who will understand what I'm driving at have already gotten my point... re-watch the movie thinking of the rock star as the hero, and you might enjoy it in a different way!",Love Actually

966,msisidora,Love Actually Is All Around,9,26 April 2018,"Love Actually is one of the few ensemble cast, multiple storyline films that seems to have pervaded popular culture in recent years that actually--pardon the pun--works. Unlike Valentine's Day or New Years Eve (just to name a few), Love Actually manages to create a cohesive film with an all-star cast and just enough story lines for watchers to be invested in each characters hardships and happiness. Perhaps the greatest success that Love Actually can boast is the expert use of the multiple storyline structure to bring more than one kind of relationship to the forefront of this romantic comedy. Liam Neeson portrays a recently widowed stepdad, coming to terms with the loss of his wife while learning to care for his love-lorn stepson; Laura Linney plays a lonely ex-pat, unable to invest in her own romantic life because her responsibilities to her mentally ill brother; Bill Nighy demonstrates the love a washed up rockstar has for his manager and his constant and only companion throughout his career; Andrew Lincoln, who plays Mark, shows us the bittersweet side of an unrequited love with his best friend's wife. All these relationships--father to son, sister to brother, friend to friend, and lover to almost lover--come together to create a beautiful collage of varying human relationships. Of course more typical love interested are also included with Colin Firth's cross-cultural relationship with his portuguese employee or Prime Minister Hugh Grant's love for a member of his household staff. However, the inclusion of these varying types of love all echo the very opening lines of this movie, that ""love actually is all around"" in the form of ""fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends and old friends"". Love Actually is truly a tribute to the human experience, as it honors all the different forms that love comes in. 
It's easy to categorize Love Actually as an overdone, overly sugary and cliched film, but this would ignore all the complications that the movie tackles. The heartbreak, sadness, unrequitedness, and grief that inevitably come with loving--with being so invested in another human--are not only included, but heavily considered through out this film. Emma Thompson, a dedicated friend and devoted mother and wife, discover that her husband, Alan Rickman, has gifted another woman jewelry for Christmas. The scene that ensues is impossible to forget as she stands in the bedroom she shares with said husband, her children and husband just on the other side of the wall. The scene is so touching and so evocative because her dilemma is so clear; she's been betrayed but as she stands in the home that she's built with her husband, with the family they share together, she cannot let go of their life together. She still loves and it's because she loves that she was able to be so broken. Laura Linney's character, mentioned above, is perhaps an even sadder tale. She sacrifices her love for her coworker Carl, for the love and wellbeing of her mentally ill brother. Love Actually is full of moments, like Laura's stuggle between her own interest and her brothers, or Emma Thompson disillusionment with her marriage, that grapple with real problems, real emotions and real struggles. Death, infidelity, mental illness, sexual harassment in the workplace and unrequited love are all serious issues dealt with in Love Actually that one would not typically associate with a movie that markets itself as ""the ultimate romantic comedy"". However, despite these darker issues, a talented cast manages to create comedic moments even in the face of more serious issues. Of course, there also moments purely created for comedic effect, seemlessly woven in as a result of the multiple storyline structure. Rowan Atkinson's cameo as a store clerk allows for a lighthearted break from heavier material while the sex-driven Colin's search for love in America also provides comedic moments. 
So many ensemble cast films fall flat in their execution despite being littered with classic tropes and ample star power. Love Actually avoids this failing by making use of a talented cast, evocative emotional scenes, comedic relief and the mulitple story line structure that highlights all the kinds of love that exist.",Love Actually

This movie revolves around the pithy love lives of eight couples and spends two hours making you not care about a single one. In fact, the drawn out ending is a blessing because it tells you that you don't have to spend any more time with these horrible cardboard people. The birthday card isle at Hallmark has more intelligence and craft then this star-studded feature film. In short, do not see this film at any cost!",Love Actually
969,garcia-22,To believe again...,10,17 February 2006,"Love Actually is movie that helps you see how life redefine's it self.Common and extraordinary lives are mixed together with such good taste that you tend to believe that you were probably wrong the last time you were angry because of someone else doings.The cast gave us outstanding performances by Hugh Grant, Liam Neesom and Emma Thompson and characters (the rock star and his manager are just persons to love!).Special chapter for the charming Keira Knightley that just have away herself... and that is to say probably a person very similar to the general and popular idea of what angel's are.A movie just perfect to believe in love again.",Love Actually
970,gorkemunel,Love and Laugh,9,5 June 2006,"Now, I gained strongly belief about love AGAIN. The music and scene of film was very impressive. The love of a little boy or passion of prime minister does not differ each other. Your feelings and reactions probably same, it is hard to explain but when you watched the film; you are very close to live such kind of love. In most case, you smile and laugh even most romantic scene. There are too much stars in the scene but they had little roles as it was in ""Crash"". I find it is enough for comment but IMDb does not let me to finish here. I am sorry about my poor English, I only want to cut my comment as possible as short. Thanks.",Love Actually
971,rogerjohnbuck,Is there a genuine moment of true human feeling in this movie?,1,21 September 2020,"If so, it is hard to find.Fake, fake, fake, manipulative, cheap and I'm depressed that comparatively few reviewers seem to recognise what real love, real humanity is.On the plus side, there are a few good jokes and some decent actors.But that can't make up for the sheer, appalling artifice here.(And I find it depressing, too, the actors consented to participate in something so utterly false.)I suppose it is a symptom of the world that becomes ever more fake, propelled by entertainments like this.Or maybe it's the Anglo-American world. I can't say I've ever seen a French film, for example, as inauthentic as this . . .",Love Actually
972,bizzyboy-36000,Excrement actually.,1,4 July 2019,"It's the sort of intriguing film one never tires of watching, when one needs to relax after a full frontal lobotomy.",Love Actually
973,jenniferpayne-47411,This has been my absolute favorite movie since I saw it in the theatre 15 years ago.,10,2 December 2018,"I fell in love with this movie 15 yrs ago the moment of saw it. I love the actors and the storyline. It's funny and lighthearted. I love Christmas time and especially British humor and the two together make, in my opinion, a remarkable movie.",Love Actually
974,bernie_lockwood,They don't make them better than this...,10,2 March 2006,"I really didn't know they made movies like this anymore... it's been a long time since I could honestly say that here is a movie worth seeing, renting, owning. They really didn't leave anything out. They covered all their bases on this one. As a Romance Novel Reader, and as a Romance/Comedy Buff, I say I AM IMPRESSED. And I thank whoever wrote the script and hope he's a happy man, as he has made me happy every time I watch this. It made me laugh, and cry, and hope, and dream. There was love actually everywhere. Not to mention the fact that I am Portuguese and so did not need to read the subtitles to understand those beautiful scenes in Marseilles. How beautifully written this was!!! I applaud. My co-workers applaud, my family and friends to whom I recommended this movie to applaud...",Love Actually
975,thumb246,Missed the mark...badly,3,5 March 2006,"This was one of the most disjointed movies I can ever remember watching. The acting was fine, even outstanding in some cases, particularly Liam Neeson and Emma Thompson. But the stories had no real meaning. There did not really seem to be a point to any of them other than the one with Neeson and his step-son. Each of the other tales by themselves could have made for an interesting movie, but jammed together as they were, they lost whatever punch they might have provided in different circumstances. It was like watching a visual rough draft of a novel-you could see scenes with potential while others made no sense. The naked couple scenes seemed to be thrown in just so they could have some nudity and had no connection to anything else. If they had concentrated on one or two stories this would have been a much stronger movie.",Love Actually
976,erik0234,The most heart warming movie ever!,10,9 March 2006,"The entire movie was so amazing, absolutely the best film on love ever made! I absolutely love John the sex double! ""I'm really quite shy about this sort of thing..."" Love it!!! I really thought that the message of love and its many forms was conveyed so beautifully! It was NOT by any means just ANOTHER LOVE movie. In fact, the idea and concept were startlingly original. One would think, ""Oh, rubbish! It's only a movie about love, C'mon now!"" This however, is heart warming, sensational, emotional... I was actually jumping up and down cheering for love to prevail. It's truly astounding and I suggest you watch it. Whether you are looking for a good laugh or looking for love, this is the movie for every one.",Love Actually
977,apiispanen,positive message,10,9 March 2006,"I really liked this film. The opening scene at the Heathrow airport was excellent. Such a positive message about love. I very much agreed with it - although the news is usually full of bad and negative stuff and you can easily get depressed about it - in every day life there is a lot of love around us that is not news worthy, although maybe it should be. Also I had this feeling of realizing some deep truth or message when the narrator said that when the twin towers were attacked nobody in their final moments sent messages of hate - but all messages sent were messages of love. Obvious, but still..This is a film that you should see if your are feeling a bit gloomy and need something to cheer you up.",Love Actually
978,playstationhomer,"This is actually literal garbage, if you like this movie, you are human waste",1,20 December 2019,"I couldn't help but think ""What a bad movie this is"" throughout the entire film. Its filled with so many cringy dialogues and subplots with no build up at all.
To put it in example : One scene you may probably see two people hate eachother and barely talk, in the next scene, they are somehow in love with each for no actual reason but for the name of love."" Words can't describe how good this movie is.... but numbers can, 1/10.",Love Actually
979,gunnarlarson,The Brits are fully back,9,14 March 2006,"Be willing to be confused during the first half of the film, and then watch the characters and story lines come together. Fantastically gifted cast, lots of non-imposing good natured morality, superbly written intricacy, oozing good-natured humor and charm (be quiet, I know this is not technically a sentence). Bill Nighy has all the range in the universe, the child actor Sangster is low key and excellent. Britain is so fully back in the film world, and I hope it goes on to kick California's bottom (I'm from Chicago - 'bottom' is edited for appropriate language). Avoid the film altogether if you are a cynic, cynics would detest it.",Love Actually
980,vigofree,So good movie,10,14 February 2019,I see that movie and it was a very good and I loved it,Love Actually
