0,TheLittleSongbird,"Worthy and entertaining, not as good as the first film, but this is a sequel worth watching!",7,10 June 2009,"The first Ghostbusters was a feel good, silly and entertaining film. The sequel is certainly a worthy one, and I really enjoyed it, though it seemed a little more serious in tone. Bil Murray, Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis, Annie Potts, Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson all return, and all of them do a very credible job. I especially liked the fact that Ramis, Ackroyd and even Hudson were given more to do. The sequel, set 5 years later, shows that Dana and Peter have had a baby named Oscar, and he was really cute. As I've said already, it doesn't quite have the feel- good nature of the first film,(the ending was a bit of a letdown)due to a rather contrived plot and some of the dialogue was a bit clunky. Peter MacNicol does his best, but he is given little to do, and towards the end, I didn't see him particularly threatening. Aquitting himself better, much better in fact, is Wilhelm Von Homberg as Vigo, creating quite a sinister villain, if not quite memorable. Also there were some excellent special effects, a hilarious court room scene and the spirited performances of the entire cast, making this an enjoyable, if not entirely successful sequel. 7/10 Bethany Cox.",Ghostbusters II
1,bkoganbing,Their Number Is Still In The Book,9,22 October 2009,"All the principal characters and then some have been reunited five years later for Ghostbusters II. If you still have an ectoplasmic problem in your home or place of work, who you going to call? Why Ghostbusters II of course.New York City has a river of ectoplasmic slime running underneath it and its feeding the sick desires of a long dead Carpathian count with delusions of grandeur to come back and rule. But first to find a host body.Poor Sigourney Weaver, there's something about her that the spirits just can't resist. In the first Ghostbusters she was the target, now it's her infant son. Her's and Bill Murray's that is. If the no account count can get his spirit into the infant, he will be reborn with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Or does someone else have those?As usual Ghostbusters Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson see the problem, but to convince the rest of New York that their general misanthropic behavior is what the nasty spirit feeds on.Joining the gang is former victim Rick Moranis. In many ways Moranis is the funniest one in the film. He and Annie Potts make a delightful couple and great babysitters for poor Sigourney, especially since she can't get them to leave.Ghostbusters II is every bit as funny as the original. And in addition the second film retains that famous and catchy theme that you won't get out of your head for weeks after seeing this film.",Ghostbusters II
2,Leofwine_draca,Serviceable follow-up,6,18 April 2013,"Yeah, it's not as good as the first; who thought it would be? But I find, in retrospect, that GHOSTBUSTERS II is a perfectly serviceable sequel that offers more of the same with a slightly different spin. While it seems trendy these days to mock this film (Bill Murray hates it, but I don't see why; he gets a fair bit of screen time) it's certainly no worse, and a lot better, than similar modern fare.The film has two ingredients that help it entertain: the cast, and the supernatural elements. Cast-wise, all the big-hitters are back: Ramis, Ackroyd, Hudson, Murray, Weaver, Moranis and Potts. They share a good camaraderie, and lots of funny quips and one-liners. Nothing to dislike here.Secondly, the ghostly stuff. The river of sentient slime flowing through the sewers is a FANTASTIC idea; I only wish they'd made more of it. Vigo isn't as an imposing a villain as in the first film, but he's not bad, and there are some good effects of his forehead bulging from the canvas. Okay, so Peter MacNicol is awful, and there's a slightly rushed/shoddy feel to the last third of the film, but for the most part I liked this one...not loved it, like the first, but liked it well enough.",Ghostbusters II
3,SnoopyStyle,the gang is back and I want the old times,6,26 October 2013,"The gang is all back. Ghostbusting business has gone under. The city won't pay and the guys got sued to oblivion. Ernie Hudson and Dan Aykroyd are left doing kiddie parties. Egon (Harold Ramis) is doing weird psychological experiments. Venkman (Bill Murray) is doing a lowly paranormal TV talk show. Sigourney Weaver had married, got a kid, and got divorced ... not with Venkman. When strange things happen, the gang regroup.It's a comfortable watch. The people you loved before are back. It's like seeing old friends at a high school reunion. The problem is that we want to talk about the old times. The new stuff isn't adding to the comedy. Peter MacNicol does a very annoying voice as the new Louis Tully. I don't like it. Luckily the old Louis Tully is still funny in this movie.",Ghostbusters II
4,gavin6942,"Pretty Much Just as Good, In a Different Way",7,14 July 2013,"The discovery of a massive river of ectoplasm and a resurgence of spectral activity allows the staff of Ghostbusters to revive the business.While the second film is not as scary as the first and clearly pushes itself to the comedy rather than horror category, it is just as good in many ways. Not better, but just as good. The movie is just such a different animal in many ways that it is hard to compare.I am still trying to figure out why someone would name their baby Oscar... and it amazes me it took me over 20 years to figure out that Max von Sydow did the voice of Vigo or that the baby was John Denver's nephew... such interesting little facts.",Ghostbusters II
5,lee_eisenberg,I'm still ready to call them.,6,9 August 2005,"I guess that usually, we have to wonder why they make sequels. If nothing else, as long as the sequels aren't boring, obnoxious, pathetic, embarrassing, insulting, or otherwise bad, then they're acceptable. ""Ghostbusters II"" passes. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, Annie Potts and Rick Moranis reprise their roles from the original. This one has the title characters battling a river of hostility-based slime that's possessing a painting. Peter MacNicol plays the man who brought the painting to New York, and subsequently gets possessed by it. ""Ghostbusters II"" is pretty ridiculous, often gross, but never unpleasant. So who you gonna call?",Ghostbusters II
6,jboothmillard,Ghostbusters II,4,17 June 2005,"The first film is a great supernatural comedy, and I remember seeing this sequel maybe twice before the original, but thankfully I didn't remember anything about it, so that's okay, from director Ivan Reitman (Twins, Evolution). Basically it has been five years since the events of the previous film, and the Ghostbusters, the once-lucrative paranormal removal business has become bankrupt, plagued by court orders and lawsuits, they are almost a laughing stock. Dr. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) hosts a little-watched psychic TV show, Dr. Raymond 'Ray' Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) owns a bookstore, Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) is conducting laboratory experiments on human emotions, and along with Ray, Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) is an unpopular kids' entertainer. Soon enough though divorced Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) has something strange happening in her New York apartment, and it seems that she may have a ghost trying to do something with her eight-month year old baby Oscar (twins William T. Deutschendorf and Henry J. Deutschendorf II). While Peter, Ray and Egon investigate the strange goings on in Dana's apartment, involving a high amount of ecoplasmic slime, there's something weird going on at the Manhattan Museum of Art where the painting of Vigo the Carpathian (Wilhelm Von Homburg, voiced by Max Von Sydow) has possessed gallery boss Dr. Janosz Poha (Peter MacNicol). The Ghostbusters eventually get the chance to prove themselves before the freaked out court Judge Stephen 'The Hammer' Wexler (Harris Yulin), and they are back in business ready to help hundreds of people. The slime, which reacts to negative vibes from people, e.g. shouting, has spread all over the city, but Egon has invented a way to use the slime with positive vibes. In the end, after bringing the Statue of Liberty to life and crashing into the museum, the Ghostbusters, with a little help from Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) the evil spirits are defeated, baby Oscar is saved, and the whole city is safe. Also starring Annie Potts as Janine Melnitz, Ace Ventura; Pet Detective's David Margulies as Mayor Lenny, Scary Movie's Kurt Fuller as Jack Hardemeyer, Bobby Brown as Mayor's Doorman, Cheech Marin as Dock Supervisor, Ben Stein as Public Works Official, Philip Baker Hall as Police Commissioner, Kevin Dunn as Milton Angland and Twins' Chloe Webb as Elaine. The cast still do pretty well in their roles, there are some reasonable jokes in amongst the lame story and not as interesting special effects, it might not be as good as the predecessor, but not a bad supernatural comedy. Okay!",Ghostbusters II
7,ccthemovieman-1,"No, It's Not The Original, But It's Still Very Funny",8,11 March 2006,"This was another sequel that was fashionable to knock when it came out. It got panned because it couldn't live up to the first Ghostbusters. Well, what could? The first one was so original, so enormously popular than any sequel was bound to fail as far as matching it.This second Ghostbusters was just fine, very entertaining and it was nice to see all the main characters back. It had a little nicer feel to it and was more family-friendly language-wise, so it even had some things going for it the first one didn't have.The other major different in this sequel was watching Peter MacNichol, who reprized his ""Renfield""-type character from Mel Brooks' ""Dead: And Loving It"" comedy with Leslie Nielsen. Here, MacNichol plays ""Janosz Poha,"" another wacko with a thick Eastern European accent. He is hilarious, and elevates the enjoyment of this film. Otherwise, the rest of the cast plays and acts just as they did in the first film, which means you'll get a lot of laughs out of them The story just isn't as intense, that's all. No, it can't equal the original, but.....The bottom line is this: Don't try to compare the two films. If you enjoyed the first, you'll like this.....period.",Ghostbusters II
8,Tweekums,A decent enough sequel,7,12 March 2015,"Five years have passed since the first film and the team have been banned from hunting ghosts due to the damage they caused. Venkman is now hosting a show talking to dubious psychics, Spengler is still a scientist, carrying out experiments that some may consider unethical and Stantz and Zeddemore have been reduced to performing in front of unimpressed children. Meanwhile Dana is working at a museum where a painting of Vigo the Carpathian of Moldavia, an evil sixteenth-century ruler. When the pram containing Dana's baby runs out of control and stops in the middle of a busy New York street she suspects evil forces and contacts the Ghostbusters. They dig up the street and discover a river of slime running through a long-disused subway tunnel; slime that feeds on the negative emotions of the city's inhabitants. This isn't their biggest problem though; Vigo is back and he needs a baby for his spirit to inhabit; Dana's baby Oscar. It won't be easy; the team will have to deal with officials at city hall and take control of a New York icon before they are victorious.After the success of the first film a sequel was inevitable; it is just a surprise that it took five years. While I don't think this is as good as the original it is still a lot of fun and it was great to see the characters back again. No time is wasted introducing the characters to it really would be wise to watch the first film before watching this. In some ways it is more of the same; the team must fight against the authorities, New York is invaded by ghosts and Dana is in trouble; although this time it is her child who is in danger rather than her. This isn't too much of a problem as the formula works. The cast do a decent job; not their best work but still solid enough. There are plenty of good laughs to be had throughout the film as well as quite a few child-friendly scares. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of the original but don't expect it to be quite as good as that classic.",Ghostbusters II
9,BA_Harrison,It's crap. Y-Y-Ya know it!,3,20 October 2017,"With the evil spirit of a Carpathian tyrant feeding off the Big Apple's negative energy (which takes the form of a subterranean river of pink goop), and numerous spooks running wild in the city (including Slimer, of course), the Ghostbusters are called upon to kick some more supernatural ass, much to the chagrin of the mayor. In other words, Ghostbusters II is virtually identical to the first film in terms of plot, only it's a lot less funny, far less creepy, and features not one, but two terrible theme songs (Bobby Brown's forgettable 'On Our Own' and the horribly dated 'Ghostbusters Rap' by Run-D.M.C.—no match for Ray Parker Jr.'s catchy 'Ghostbusters').The stars of the first film are all back, obviously happy to take a great big pay check for reprising their roles, no matter how lame and uninspired the script is. As if to see just how much garbage Ghostbusters fans are willing to take, the movie closes with a nauseatingly jingoistic Stay Puft-style finalé in which our jump-suited heroes bring to life that symbol of American greatness, The Statue of Liberty, in order to defeat the evil foreign threat, much to the delight of cheering New Yorkers. About the only positive thing I can say about Part II is that it isn't as bad as the recent remake. Nearly, but not quite.2.5 out of 10, rounded up to 3 for the decent special effects, which have held up pretty well.",Ghostbusters II
10,moonspinner55,Whatever charm or vitality it has is due to Bill Murray...,5,24 September 2005,"Sequel to the overrated 1984 predecessor about a team of New Yorkers in the extermination business--busting ghosts instead of bugs--has the same jovial cast, another elaborate production design and some funny jokes. Most of the time, however, the money just sits there on the screen, but Bill Murray's performance provides occasional amusement. Plot has the Ghostbusters discovering poltergeists living underneath the Big Apple, and the final showdown is admittedly full of marvelous special effects. Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson have been made so intentionally straight and low-keyed that they practically hand the picture over to groovy Murray, who wrings laughs out of even the flattest dialogue. Sigourney Weaver, back as Murray's love-interest, is more relaxed here and also has some good scenes. Tolerable, though most audiences decided they had had enough. ** from ****",Ghostbusters II
11,Quinoa1984,This film shouldn't be panned,8,9 October 2000,"I say that one line summary not in the meaning you should watch this film in widescreen, but in that this film isn't as bad as some people say.  Sure it might not have the ultimate originality of the 1st (of course), but it is still entertaining, one of the best of 1989.  This time, we see 5 years later where the Ghostbusters parted ways (Venkman to a Talk show, Spengler to a child psychologist and Stanz as a book store owner) but are put back together because of new activity in the paranormal that could end the world (courtesy of a painting named Vigo).  Then, comedy ensues with great visual effects to match.  Still pretty funny (the talk show scene with Chloe Webb is utterly hilarious), but maybe just a tad lesser than the first. A-",Ghostbusters II
12,BandSAboutMovies,Fun sequel,7,13 June 2020,"After the end of the first film, you'd think the Ghostbusters would be heroes for life. However, they've been sued out of existence and are barely able to get back together in time to stop a whole new evil, Vigo the Carpathian, who is trapped inside a painting that Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) is restoring along with her boss, Janosz Poha (Peter MacNicol, a bright spot here).Yes, Dana went from playing the cello at a high level to being an art expert of the same caliber. Obviously, we're dealing with a Buckaroo Banzai level individual here.This film never lived up to the original for audiences, critics or the people who made it. It took five years of rough gestation to even get to the screen, which needed suits, agents and even a lunch for the stars to decide whether or not they wanted to work together.Vigo is pretty great though. While his voice comes from Max Von Sydow, he was played by Wilhelm von Homburg, a German boxer, wrestler and weight lifter who also shows up in The Last of the Secret Agents?, Die Hard, The Wrecking Crew and In the Mouth of Madness. This Deadspin account of his life is pretty astounding, telling the story of a man who lived for excess and may have even fathered his own half-sister.Remember how I said in a past review that Ghostbusters has no hero's journey for its characters? Well, they've done the third - and hardest - act off-screen, as now Ray (Dan Aykroyd) owns an occult bookstore and works a side job with Winston (Ernie Hudson) doing kid birthday parties, Egon (Harold Ramis) works in a lab and Venkman (Bill Murray) hosts a ridiculous psychic TV show.Luckily, everything works out despite a river of slime. Rick Moranis returns as Louis Tully and Annie Potts comes back as Janine Melnitz, ready to fall for Egon.Sure, this is nowhere as good as the first, but that Bobby Brown song sure is catchy. Actually, they could make several of these films and I'd watch them all. I even made it through the toss away the past reimagining.",Ghostbusters II
13,Coventry,Gooey underground rivers of pink blubber that make people cranky,6,28 January 2021,"Amazing how opinions can change, and perceptions can even turn upside down, over time! 30 years ago, when yours truly was still an irritating little brat, I thought the original 1984 ""Ghosbusters"" was brilliant and nearly flawless, whereas I found the 1989 sequel a weak and redundant attempt solely meant to generate cash and organize a cast reunion. Now, upon seeing them both again after many years, the first film seems hopelessly dated and too hectic, while the second one suddenly seems a lot better (or at least on par with the original).The plot of part II is largely similar to the first. New York is on the verge of doom, this time due to the rapidly strengthening spirit of an ancient & evil Carpathian warrior. It wants to possess Sigourney Weaver's baby, while the rest of the New Yorkers grow increasingly cranky because of pink gunk that feeds on negativity flooding underneath the sidewalks.The most successful elements of the first are shamelessly copied, like giant statues walking in between the skyscrapers and the skies turning into all sort of ominous colors. On the bright side, there a handful of really imaginative ideas as well, like the arrival of the ghost-Titanic (""Better late than never never"" says a still unknown Cheech Marin), Aykroyd and Hudson as entertainers at kids' parties and mayhem in Harris Yulin's courtroom. Also, and admittedly they are five years ""younger"", but the special effects have remarkably stood the test of time better than those of the original.",Ghostbusters II
14,sunwarrior13,Underwhelming Sequel,7,10 December 2019,"The sequel of ""Ghostbusters"" is starts with the statement ""Five Years Later..."" with the cast - Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson - together with Sigourney Weaver coming back to reprise their roles. Ivan Rheitman directs once again.The story starts with the ghostbusters resuming their other respective activities rather than being paranormal investigators. But when the evil Vigo comes back, each members of the ghostbusters to stop him.As expected,we expect comparisons to be made from its predecessor. But unfortunately, the sequel turned out to lack charm and energy. Even the acting particularly from the spectacular Bill Murray was anemic. Overall,it was underwhelming and not as good as the original that is why to took awhile before another film was released.",Ghostbusters II

16,hitchcockthelegend,Who you gonna snore?,4,26 September 2010,"Ghostbusters II Is directed by Ivan Reitman and stars Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis & Ernie Hudson. Ramis & Aykroyd c-wrote the screenplay and it's a sequel to the hugely successful Ghostbusters from 1984. Plot follows on from the first film but five years later and sees the Ghostbusters disbanded after being derided as frauds and handed a bill for the damages incurred as they saved the world! However, a new supernatural threat is bubbling down in the sewers of New York and now more than ever the Ghostbusters are back in vogue.It was probably asking too much for this sequel to be as sparkling as the first film. More so when one considers that there was a 5 year gap in between and a new decade was soon to arrive that firmly had no place for 80s nostalgia. Oh Ghostbusters 2 was a success, very much so, but after the rush of fans wanting some more from the kooky parapsychologists had died down, the feedback was very mixed from fans and critics alike. Understandably so since everything about this sequel is tired. The characters look bored and lack the expresso timing that was once evident, especially Murray who is badly underused here, and more troubling is that his Venkman, the best thing about the original film, is reduced to being a normal type bloke. That's criminal, because the spirited stuff falls to Aykroyd and co and tho they be solid pros, they ain't got Murray's wit and mannerisms.The story too is weak. Featuring a seventeenth century tyrant and the inevitable rise of spooks unbound. Thankfully, tho, the effects are at least of the high and gloopy standard set first time around. And there's some tight gags in there for the knowing Ghostbuster ear. But repetition hangs heavy throughout, Ramis & Aykroyd seemingly not grasping that what worked in 84 will not totally transfer well to a new crowd who are now older and wiser. There's also the distinct feeling that this film is more about a cast get together to make some easy cash than enticing in a whole new audience. Peter MacNicol is a welcome introduction to proceedings as Janosz Poha, while more of ""slimer"" (who is now real cool) is never a bad thing. But the magic is gone and Ghostbusters 2 just comes off as shallow and dangerously close to soiling our love of the first picture. 4/10",Ghostbusters II
17,Theo Robertson,A Good Start But Then Goes Nowhere,4,27 March 2004,"If I remember correctly GHOSTBUSTERS 2 performed rather badly at the box office and recieved rather poor reviews on its initial release in 1989 , and strangely it wasn`t until 15 years later that I finally got round to seeing it .Like the first movie this sequel is fairly impressive and amusing for the first 15 minutes as we find out Ray and Winston are now employed as childrens entertainers - "" Who ya gonna call ?  HE-MAN "" and Bill Murray`s character now has his own chat show for oddballs , and talking of Bill Murray he plays the dead pan humour for all it`s worth . Very good he is too , but then we see spanners in the works , nearly all of them to do with the script . Remember in the first movie NYC was over run with spooks ? Well this seems to have been forgotten as the boys are in court facing charges of false pretence ( Ghosts don`t exist so you don`t need ghostbusters ? ) , and it`s difficult to explain the plot because the script feels more like a series of sketches rather than a cohesive story . I know the first movie wasn`t all that tightly plotted either but at least it felt original and entertaining where as here it just feels like a belated movie made to cash in on the success of the first one . It should also pointed out that since it was made in the 1980s we`re treated to pop songs over the action for no real reason except to get the audience to buy the official soundtrack album. This was a very common technique in cinema from 15 to 20 years ago but now comes across as cynical and datedSo if you saw GHOSTBUSTERS in 1989 you might have enjoyed it more than I did in 2004 . I give it 4 out of 10",Ghostbusters II

19,Doylenf,More of the same as the parapsychologists try to deal with pink slime beneath the city...,5,30 June 2009,"I honestly can't say I'm a fan of these ""Ghostbuster"" movies--but this lame sequel makes the first one look like a masterpiece by comparison.The unfunny business struggles to find a few laughs in the same old situations but it's pretty hard to work up any enthusiasm for staying tuned in to this movie. Whether it was more spectacular on the big screen I can't say--but I understand that it did well at the box-office.Well, I could just about absorb the first thirty-five or forty minutes without wanting to turn it off. BILL MURRAY, DAN AYKROYD, SIGOURNEY WEAVER and RICK MORANIS do their usual stuff with meager results. The script is full of puerile nonsense that would give any actor a hard time to make work in this sort of goof-ball comedy.It left me with the impression that I've seen enough of these silly comedies for the time being. Way overrated by fans who flocked to the first of the ""Ghostbuster"" films.",Ghostbusters II
20,poolandrews,"""It's slime time."" Good but not quite as good sequel to a classic.",7,17 February 2007,"Ghostbusters II starts 5 years after the events of the original Ghost Busters (1984) again in New York City where Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) contacts former Ghostbusters Raymond Stanz (Dan Aykroyd) & Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) after the pram carrying her young son Oscar develops a mind of it's own after coming into contact with some pink slime. They investigate the strange occurrence & along with the other Ghostbusters Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) & Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) discover a huge river of the pink slim running under the city, a pink slime that feeds off negative emotions & there's plenty of them around New York. This discovery coincides with a huge resurgence in supernatural activity in New York which allows the Ghostbusters to reunite & reopen the business, they discover that an evil 16th Century tyrannical sorcerer named Vigo (Wilhelm von Homburg) is about to be re-incarnated so he can take over the world... Who ya' going to call to sort it out?Produced & directed by Ivan Reitman this is to date the only sequel to the huge hit that was Ghost Busters & while not as good is still a fine film. The script by stars Dan Aykroyd & Harold Ramis reunites all the old cast although the inclusion of Rick Moranis' nerdy character Louis Tully seems rather forced & unnecessary. However on the whole the film works very well, is good fun & provides plenty of light hearted entertainment. Obviously the scare factor isn't high as to appeal to he kids but there's still plenty of ghost's, ghoul's & slime to go around. The comedy elements are amusing enough, the interplay between Stanz & Spengler is quite funny & Murray's sarcastic Venkman still raises a smile. The story this time around is what lets the film down I suppose, there's not really enough here to pad out the almost 2 hour running time & the connection between the pink slime, Dana, her baby & Vigo & how it all ties to the Ghostbusters is somewhat thin to say the least, it never comes together with any great conviction but the film moves along at a nice pace & as I've said it provides lots of good, clean entertainment that's fun to watch.Director Reitman does OK but I got the feeling while watching it it borrowed a lot of ideas from the original especially the end where the Statue of Libery walks through the streets of Manhattan which is almost identical to the end of the original with the Marshmellow Man causing havoc. Considering this was made in the 80's I was actually rather impressed with the special effects & thought they were very good except the ridiculous scene where the villainous Peter MacNicol is flying through the air dressed as a nanny complete with pram which looks awful. There are some good scenes, the fur coat that comes alive, the ghost train, the Titanic arriving & lots of other ghostly goings-on.Technically the film is great & has that big budget Hollywood polish about it, the effects are good & the famous Ghostbusters theme is used once or twice. The acting is fine although I'm not sure about MacNicol's performance as he has a highly irritating accent & he annoys.Ghostbusters II is a good sequel that I enjoyed a lot although it's not as good as the original but there aren't many films that are in my opinion. Well worth a watch if your looking for some scary light hearted supernatural fun, definitely recommended.",Ghostbusters II

It just feels like the guys got back together to goof off and get paid for it. Bill Murray seems alternately amused and bored throughout the film. The rest go through the motions. As for new faces, Peter MacNicol is extremely annoying, basically playing the role Rick Moranis played last time. Moranis actually reprises his role but has nothing to do and is shoehorned into things with irritating results. It's not a bad movie. It's enjoyable enough due to the likability of their stars but the story is weak and there's nothing memorable about the whole thing.",Ghostbusters II
22,Boba_Fett1138,They are still fun.,7,29 September 2005,"Good thing about this sequel is that basically all the actors from the first movie also reappear in this one. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson but also actors that portrayed some smaller parts in the first movie; Rick Moranis, Annie Potts and David Margulies. They are all back and they all still have the same chemistry they shared in the first movie.Strenght of the movie is that it has a very high fun level. Mainly the scene's with the three Ghostbusters Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are extremely fun to watch but also the Rick Moranis scene's are highly fun, also thanks to the dialog he had been given.But no, it's not the perfect sequel. The movie and its story take itself a bit too serious at times, especially towards the ending. The movie is also a bit too much horror like. The movie gets quite scary at times, also due to the seriousness in the movie. A movie like this one should be mainly fun to watch and shouldn't pretend to be more than that. The movie also lacks a great spectacular finale. Vigo is a cool looking villain and this perhaps is a bit underused in the movie, he doesn't really get an awful lot to do in the movie.But sure, compared to the first movie, also improvements have been made. The special effects look far better and also the dialog has become even more better and fun.Best performances of the movie are given by once more; Bill Murray, Rick Moranis and Peter MacNicol in a fun 'villain' role.It's not the perfect sequel but that doesn't take away that this is a good and certainly fun movie to watch.

24,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,A mixed bag,7,19 March 2019,"5 years after the '84 film, the team are broke, have split up and are working separate jobs. Basically the idea was to try to make the structure of this similar to that one. While I'm not sure it was the best choice, they get there. The majority of the supporting players return, even if some of them have to be crowbarred into what this needs them to do, particularly Dana and Louis. Sequels are often a case of diminishing returns, moreso when it comes to the genre of comedy. I haven't watched the TV show, however, I'm told it's why the tone is so different. This definitely does have more kid friendly jokes, and even gets very childish at times. At more than one point someone literally hits the top of the head of someone else like they're The Three Stooges. I would say at least half of the material is genuinely funny.A lot happens that involves the baby. Some of it is awkward pandering. But that's also where this scores serious points. Can you imagine many things more terrifying than to lose your infant? That is something this uses well. When this goes for horror it almost always nails it. The slime and its gradual buildup is genuinely immensely creepy. This time the evil force has a face from the start, and it is genuinely an effective element. You can't possibly tell me that you've never looked at a painting of an awful person and thought that there was something innately malevolent about just the representation of them. That it never felt like it was watching you somehow. The climax is equal parts corny and cool. All of the ghost designs and effects are incredible. The character of Hardemeyer is a poor substitute for Walter Peck. Run DMC's version of the main theme is superior to Ray Parker Jr's original, which was already great.I recommend this to fans of the first movie who are willing to adjust their expectations. 7/10",Ghostbusters II
25,view_and_review,Superb Sequel,8,13 February 2020,"""Ghostbusters II"" is a superb follow up to a classic. That is very rare. It's not better than the original, but it is darn good.The movie starts with some unfortunate circumstances for the Ghostbusters. They've been run out of business due to numerous lawsuits stemming from their last ghostbusting escapade. It seems that the ghosts weren't gone, just dormant. A river of pink slime running underneath the city is feeding off of the negative New York energy allowing a super ghost to grow stronger.It was good to see the old gang back together. The Ecto 1 got some upgrades and so did the music. I mean, nothing can replace Ray Parker Jr.'s masterpiece, but Bobby Brown's ""On Our Own"" and Run DMC's rap version of ""Ghostbusters"" were as brilliant as follow ups as ""Ghostbusters II"" was to ""Ghostbusters.""",Ghostbusters II

Picking up where the original film left off, the boys with the proton packs are being sued for city damages and are reduced to making appearances at birthday parties for children. A purple slime of physical evil forms underneath the city. A figure in a painting attempts to draw power and emerge but he needs a child sacrifice and Sigourney Weaver's child seems like the perfect target. This obviously puts the Ghostbusters back in business again. Basically a recycling of the first film only instead of a giant Stay Puff Marshmallow Man we are given a walking Statue of Liberty. Director Ivan Reitman returns and does what he can with special effects to boot. He obviously isn't matching previous success with Ghostbusters or with other superb Reitman films such as Stripes or Twins. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis recite what they previously made great in the first film, and Sigourney Weaver returns once again with her kid fixated upon by a demon in a painting. Rick Moranis is also coasting on fumes here as well. The special effects can be complimented but they do not save the film, which is basically a pointless sequel that sinks like the slime in the sewer. Score: 2 / 10",Ghostbusters II

Their fortunes would turn around after Dana Barrett(Sigourney Weaver) once again finds herself the center of spectral activity, this time centered around her baby, who is coveted for possession by an ancient warlock, who is also responsible for a resurgence of ghost appearances, originating in a river of angry slime flowing beneath the city in the sewers. Only the team can stop this menace, and save the city once more.Disappointing sequel has an even more jumbled plot than the first, and isn't anywhere near as funny, though the cast is still appealing, and film remains semi-watchable, just a step down from the first.",Ghostbusters II

The cast as always are fantastic, and ramis in this movie is more of the one liner spouter than the serious Egon we had in the first one. Hudson gets a little short changed in this as he really doesn't get much to do.The last fifteen minutes ruins the film a little though with all the good will and singing, and then after all the possession and trouble with stealing Danas baby, Vigo just walks out of the painting intact and picks up the baby.But you can forgive the films short comings, because the element of nostalgia is still there,and it's just good to see the cast back together again.",Ghostbusters II
30,Aaron1375,Followed the first one too much.,6,7 April 2003,"This sequel to the successful movie Ghostbusters was itself, pretty successful.  In the end though it did not do as well and just seemed a little flat.  The story of the slime was pretty good and it was funny seeing them do kid's birthday parties (though I doubt a kid at that time would have watched He-man cartoons).  In the end this movie suffers from the fact that it follows the basic structure of the first movie so there is nothing really different about it.  You have them investigating something, you have them dispatching a ghost, then you have the musical interval, then you have them locked up (in a loony bin this time), then you have a building taken over by the head ghost, and finally you have a giant thing walking through New York. It just seems to me that with ghosts and other things, you could come up with a totally original and funny script without having to follow what worked in the previous chapter.  It is a shame too, that another Ghostbusters will probably never be made.  It would be interesting to see it, considering all the advancements in special effects.",Ghostbusters II
31,Mr-Fusion,"Sequel has its issues, but still a fun watch",7,19 September 2013,"If you look at ""Ghostbusters II"" strictly as a sequel to the original movie, you're asking for disappointment. It relies too much on retreading familiar plots, and the wit isn't as edgy. But the key to appreciating this movie is knowing that it exists in a post - ""The Real Ghostbusters"" world. Slimer's a pet, there's now a whole new kid fanbase, and the trajectory just feels changed. To me, that cartoon has done far more in making this a full-blown franchise than anything else, and it makes sense (in a way) that it's bleeding into the live-action movies. Both movies are two very different beasts. This just happens to have a very late-'80s feel to it; closer to ""Scrooged"" than the original.That's just my way of looking at things. But even without that, you still have a great Top 40 song, and I always get a charge from seeing the guys suit up after being reinstated. And even though the scares aren't as aggressive as they were in '84, this movie plays up the creepy factor a lot more than you might think. Plus, Rick Moranis steals the whole thing.And really, how many New Year's movies are out there? 7/10",Ghostbusters II

Sigourney Weaver is back as well, and Rick Moranis has a bigger part than in the first film. While ghosts remain the subject, and defeating them the work of the Ghostbusters team, the plot here is about defeating a demonic takeover of the Big Apple. So, the boys with the proton blasters have their work cut out for them. The only way they can win this one is by having all the citizens of New York City be happy and kind to others. It's an uphill battle, because, as the Mayor of NY says (David Margulies), ""Being miserable and treating other people like dirt is every New Yorker's god-given right."" That's the best humor in this film. To enliven the folks a bit, the ghost fighters turn the Statue of Liberty into a floating appearance that makes everyone happy. Well, it still has some humor, but one can see that another sequel probably wouldn't do too well. The idea has pretty much run its full development with this film.",Ghostbusters II

35,MovieAddict2016,"Good, underrated sequel.",8,12 June 2005,"There's an extra fine line between recycling material and straying from material. When sequels are different from the original, people complain. When they're too close, people say they're just remakes. This is why I think people generally don't enjoy the thought of film sequels.But I'll admit it. I like sequels. When they are deserving or done right, I enjoy them. When I meet likable characters I don't mind seeing them again. Now, sometimes there should never be sequels to movies with likable characters. Sometimes there can't be (what would ""The Usual Suspects II"" be about?). But sometimes, like with ""Ghostbusters,"" sequels can be a good thing.Sometimes they're done very well (""The Godfather Part II,"" ""Aliens,"" ""Terminator 2,"" ""Toy Story 2,"" ""X-Men 2""). Sometimes...not (""Braveheart 2"" -- oh, wait, never mind, that doesn't exist).To make a successful sequel, you have to be a truly great filmmaker. It takes a genius to be able to continue a story with the same characters without straying too far from the original source material, and without losing sight of the original's purpose. (That's why so many die hard fans of ""Terminator 3"" were upset by the ending -- me included -- but hey, the rest of the film was pretty darn good as far as action sequels go.) ""Ghostbusters II"" is, I feel, a very good sequel, because it continues the story of the four Ghostbusters, while still sustaining the sights of the first film, and the humor, too. It got bashed by critics and audiences alike when it first hit theaters five years after the original, but what can I say? I enjoy it. In fact, if memory serves me correctly, I saw the sequel before the original, which may have something to do with my love of the film.The Ghostbusters (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson) have been plagued by numerous lawsuits since the opening of their prosperous business, and a court has ordered them to close down their business. But when a mysterious slime haunts Dana (Sigourney Weaver), they come back out of retirement to investigate. Unfortunately, they are arrest, right after discovering that New York City is about to be taken over by an ectoplasmic purple goo flowing beneath the city's highways. And Dana's newborn baby is becoming possessed by an evil spirit -- could the two incidents be related? Surely not.As the end of ""Ghostbusters"" had a giant Stay Puff'd man, ""Ghostbusters II"" has the Statue of Liberty. Yes, that's right, the good IL' boys enter the Statue of Liberty and walk around New York City extended high above the ground.This sounds corny, yes? Well, it is, but so was the first film. It's meant to be. Corniness is all part of the fun, after all, isn't it? Bill Murray is just as funny as he was in the first film, while Aykroyd and Ramis continue their great co-star roles. People who thought that there wasn't enough black in the original ""Ghostbusters"" will be happy to know that Ernie Hudson is in this one from the beginning.I enjoyed this film. I liked the purple goo lurking beneath New York City -- it adds the distinct silliness to the film that the first had. People can complain about ""Ghostbusters II"" all they want, but I -- for one -- think it's a great sequel to a great comedy.",Ghostbusters II
36,OllieSuave-007,Ghostbusters II is double the ghouls and fun!,9,19 January 2014,"""Ghostbusters II"" picks up five years where ""Ghostbusters"" left off, adding more pesky ghosts, goblins and poltergeists, and more humor, adventure and laughs, making it another full-filled, enjoyable and entertaining movie of the 1980s. It still stands out as one of the best films overall and one I would watch over and over again.Five years after the events of the first film, Dr. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd, Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) and Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) have been plagued by lawsuits and court orders, bankrupting their Ghostbusters business. After Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) witnesses an unseen paranormal force and goblins start to form from a river of ectoplasmic slime beneath the city, the citizens rely on the Ghostbusters again, getting themselves back in business. Mixed in with this new horror is the evil spirit of an ancient sorcerer, which comes alive from a self-portrait on display at Dana's museum; the spirit wants to possess Dana's baby and be reborn into the world, spreading his work of terror.All the supernatural aspects in this film are brilliantly displayed, generating creepy moments to the audience. I've always thought that the mean-looking self-portrait of the sorcerer, with its eyes following Dana wherever she goes, could send chills down your spine. I just wished the filmmakers could have let the origin of the portrait remain unknown during the first part of the movie and let the tension built-up, rather than revealing it as a ghost so early in the film. The special effects for the ghosts were again nicely done. Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Rick Moranis did another great job on the story - exciting, adventurous and humorous. And, Ivan Reitman did another great job in the director's chair, providing us with a movie with a solid, fast-paced and exciting plot. The subplot about Dana and her baby was blended in very well with the story.Composer Randy Edelman provided a catchy music score. One of the scenes that I thought was memorably done is when secretary Janine Melnitz (Annie Potts), in her first appearance in the movie, answers the first phone call about a ghost on the loose, with the ""Ghostbusters"" music theme playing the background.Overall, like it's prequel, a great movie overall and one of the best movie sequels out there.Grade A",Ghostbusters II
37,thesar-2,Block Their Number,3,16 July 2016,"Allow me to take a few moments to come up with at least comedy sequel that was funnier than the original and worked on its own while still honoring the original. Since I'll never come up with one, let me reflect on this sad and unnecessary mess.Talk about advertising. So many scenes in this movie were shot looking like the director had the trailer in mind the whole time. The number of one-liners telling the audience they're back and scenes of them lining up and posing for stills made the movie feel more like them giving the preview editor a break plus the audience ""a reason"" for them to just remember the first one. Heck, even the movie's poster with the ghost's two fingers up is not only all over this movie, but oddly on their uniformsfor no reason other than more advertising.Admittedly, some jokes worked. I did find myself laughing out loud a few times. But those were so few and far between. Even the comic genius, Bill Murray, didn't phone it in and gave it his all. Sadly, most of his attempts were obvious and fell flat.The over-complicated plot which felt like a future Spider-Man sequel, involves a bizarre love-triangle, sued and disgraced heroes, a demon magician, the Blob's emotional cousin, Christmas through New Year's anger and a baby in so much incredible peril CPS would report the film ten times over. It boils down to the same set-up as the first one with no one believing what they should've easily remembered from just five years prior and the Ghostbusters getting everyone to literally stand behind the Statue of Liberty and all-but sing Kumbaya. Wait. Stop there. First off, this sounds far too familiar: this exact setup was used for 1985's Fright Night and 1988's Fright Night II whereas the same people are now unbelievably back in their comfort-zone in not believing in either vampires or ghosts in a span of 3 to 5 years.Secondly, this is NYC, so the comparison (now) is easy to 9/11. Not even counting the world or the rest of the nation, how many people just in the five boroughs would forget what happened in their city a mere five years after the attack? I've never actually been to the city, but I doubt one person forgot it. So, why or how would a single New Yorker forget what happened in 1984's citywide ghost attack just five years later. Impossible.But, then, the writing was lazy. The jokes were almost completely off, but the setup needed a lot of work, as well.These last couple of days, I re-watched the original and this movie I hadn't seen in more than two decades in prep for the 2016 Ghostbusters ""remake?"" in a couple of hours. My hope is that the ""reboot?"" will be more Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade than 2011's Fright Night.I wouldn't recommend Ghostbusters II even with the random funny jokes or one's curiosity to see what happened to our beloved heroes from the classic original. That's sad because these leads are/can be comic masters and even with this cast that should've struck gold a second time, they couldn't joke their way out of this wet sack of slime. ***Final thoughts: Ahhh, back in 1989, that was my year. Actually, beginning in 1988, movies became my life. I saw everything and anything I could ride my bike to and spend my allowance on. When my (to date) favorite summer of all time came up, I relished in all the 1989 summer blockbusters, one right after another. In this case: Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, Ghostbusters II, Batman, Lethal Weapon 2, etc. etc.Back then, I wasn't much of a hard-nosed critic as I am today. Maybe because I've seen 10,000 more movies since and the same old plots wear on you after a while. But, in 1989, my mind was fresh and I pretty much loved everythingand still thought this movie was a disappointment. Funny enough, I hadn't even appreciated the original Ghostbusters quite yet. I might have only seen it once or twice by the time I saw this sequel. At least I got a cool Glow-in-the-Dark Ghostbusters II AMC cupthat still, unbelievably, works today, July 16, 2016. I guess, there's that.",Ghostbusters II
38,ElMaruecan82,Just like the original... and maybe that's the problem...,7,6 May 2016,"Five years have passed and you can tell from the opening with Sigourney Weaver, as Dana Barrett, holding a carriage, but this isn't Peter Venkman's baby (that, you can also tell from his face, the father must've been of Scandinavian ascent). Anyway, a strange incident happens, the carriage is controlled by an invisible force and drawn into a road intersection. So, when something strange happens in your neighborhood, who you gonna call? Well, not Ghosbusters, they are out of business since the town sued them for property damage (talk about gratitude!). So, Dana goes to Venkman who's a hosting a psychic TV show (was there a reference to the first film where she told him he sounded more like a TV host than a scientist?) and we get the explanations we needed (beware many commas are coming) they went along together, then they broke up, she married a violinist, had a child and then he left her to pursue his career, and now she works in the Manhattan Museum of Art.You think this is just banal exposition? No, there had to be the baby and the Museum, as they are the two primary ingredients for the whole plot. Dana works on the painting of a malevolent figure of sixteenth century, named Vigo the Carpathian. And her colleague Janosz Poha, played by Peter MacNicol is so absorbed by the portrait that he falls under a spell, his mission is to bring a baby to Vigo, so he can finally take a living form, in order to control the Earth. So Dana's baby is in danger, but apart from that, it's the same plot than the first, with the same starting points: misfits Ghostbusters and a chance to win Dana's heart (again).I was born in the 80's, and as a kid, I saw the sequel first and I enjoyed it, I guess, as the first viewers enjoyed the first. But of course, I'm mature enough to see the differences between the two, or in that specific case, the non-differences, which is the biggest problem. And from the way Ray and Winston are shown dancing to the Ghostbusters theme in a kid's party, you understand that the film is too meta- referential for its own good. Indeed, the first opus created a phenomenon made of a logo, a song, classic uniform suits, Bill Murray, it became a classic in two genres: comedy and Sci-fi, so it's the kind of shadow you can't get easily off.But the main problem with the movie and that's something you can actually figure out even without seeing the first is that people are extremely angry and bitter toward them, even though they saved the day five years before. I know a lot of things can happen in five days, but there are limits for suspension of disbelief. I could accept anything, the river of slime in New York sewers, even the fact that it was nourished by the angry vibes that fill the City (after all, if NY was the wacko city in the first, how about the angry one in the sequel), the psychic reaction of slimy matter, but the one thing I couldn't get is that a judge would say ""I don't believe in ghosts, they don't exist"". That served as a plot device in order to show them washed up before reconquering their fame and prestige, but that was too much asking. They even had to come up with another evil bureaucratic whose motives were too far-fetched to be acceptable. And basically, this is where the film sins: laziness in the writing. Of course once people believe in ghosts, it's hard to turn the heroes into outcasts, but why not using this constraint as a a source for creativity and push the concept even farther. TThe film was released the same year than ""Back to the Future Part II"" and although the visit to 2015 was a clever way to go over the top, the most creative bit was the second visit to 1955 and have Marty living the same situation than the first film, and trying to avoid his other self. That was clever. ""Lethal Weapon 2"" had the introduction of Leo Getz. One year later, ""Gremlins"" would feature mutant creatures, including a talking Gremlins, not that it helped the film to be a box-office success, but at least they tried. For ""Ghostbusters II"", they could have come up with anything, imagine a successful company and Venkman as a cocky CEO having all the women he wants, they could have the same concept with the negative vibes of New York being the antagonist and digging deeper in the material, and they could have gone further in the little romantic subplot between Moranis and Potts. But at the end, it's still a matter of evil forces to triumph over with the use of positive vibes. Well, that doesn't dismiss the film, and it offers some great bits of dialogs and an unforgettable climax that is the best tribute New York City could ever have in a film but it's a pity the film doesn't hold up to the level reached by the end.It's still top notch in terms of special effect, I especially love the train ride over poor Ernie, the fur coat returning to life, and the return of the Titanic passengers with this comment ""better late than never"" one-liner said by one character was such a cool trend of the 80's. A the end, the good guys win and we can finally sing Ghostbusters"", well, no it's another song that foresees the end of the 80's but at least it gave them a last opportunity to play together and have a little fun. There's noting the film has better than the first, except maybe the logo.",Ghostbusters II
39,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Who you gonna call... again?,6,4 July 2020,"It's often said that 'Ghostbusters II (1989)' is markedly worse than its predecessor. To an extent, that's true. The plot isn't as tight, the characters aren't as defined, the special effects don't delight, and the narrative sort of hits all the beats that the original 'Ghostbusters (1984)' did but in a less innovative or interesting way. Still, the movie isn't bad at all. For starters, it's funny. It isn't hilarious but it's funny, frequently provoking a chuckle and keeping a smile on your face even when makes its strangest choices. It's also just enjoyable, a dumb but fun adventure that's slightly too baggy but isn't a bore. A large part of the picture's success is Moranis, whose affably unfortunate character is a pleasure to watch bumble around and, finally, get his turn in the spotlight. There isn't much more to say about the thing, really. Sure, it's sort of unremarkable and it isn't a patch on its predecessor, but it's an entertaining time that basically does everything it needs to. 6/10",Ghostbusters II
40,bowmanblue,Don't believe the hate,7,22 December 2017,"I think it's fair to say that the original 'Ghostbusters' is a classic. Very few people will disagree with that. Therefore, due to its success, a sequel was inevitable. I remember watching 'Ghostbusters II' at twelve years old back in 1989 and absolutely loving it! As did every other one of my friends. It was only as I grew up (and possibly coupled with the rise of the internet) did I realise how - apparently - hated it was.Since that revelation, I've watched it a few times and, every time, tried to see its flaws. And, even after repeated viewings through older, more cynical eyes, I still love it! It has all the original actors from the first film and they play off each other perfectly. The story has literally moved on and the characters have grown as a result. The special effects still look better than many that are overly-CGIed nowadays and best of all, it's funny.If I was really trying to be critical I could mention that it does seem a bit odd that, by all accounts, the city of New York has completely forgotten about how the Ghostbusters saved the world (and, sometimes, it's even debateable whether the populous even BELIEVES in ghosts!). Plus it is a bit of a re-tread of the first movie's plot, beat for beat (but no one seemed to mind that much when 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' did that many years later!).I'd never say it's better than the original. That kind of praised is reversed for the 'filmic elite' and rarely happens at the best of times. However, just because it's not as good doesn't make it a bad film. It's a perfect compendium piece to the original and, if you accept that, you should have fun with it. Now, if you REALLY want a bad and extremely pointless film, then check out the Ghostbusters remake (actually, don't - stick with either of the originals, the eighties cartoon series or even the game on the PS3 when it comes to your fix of ghostbusting!).",Ghostbusters II

42,Cineanalyst,Making New York Great Again by Sliming the Foreigners,4,30 September 2018,"The original ""Ghostbusters"" wasn't merely an original comedy; it had an edge to it. Besides the more adult jokes, the film was open to interpretation of homoeroticism and paraphilia, what with the electric-shocking of a male subject, the dream of a ghost performing fellatio, the phallic handheld wand of the proton packs, the crossing streams and the gooey mess involved in ghostbusting. ""Ghostbusters II"" cleans a lot of this up, presumably for a more family-friendly mass appeal, despite the first film's box-office success. Heterosexual coupling (between Peter and Dana and between Louis and Janine) is even more in the forefront, there's the centrality of the baby--the result of heterosexual sex, and there's even a children's birthday party. Ray, Egon and Winston still get up to some shenanigans, with Peter remarking at one point that they're ""scaring the straights,"" as they show up in a public restaurant in their underwear flinging slime on the heterosexual couples on dinner dates. But, that's quite tame compared to the first film.Then, there's this paradoxical xenophobic plot involving Dr. Janosz Poha (Peter MacNicol), who is an ambiguously-coded lascivious foreigner. He's under the spell of a living portrait ghost, which is triply foreign as a painting, as the subject and as a ghost. Of all the ways to combat this foreign menace, the Ghostbusters turn to the Statue of Liberty, the symbol of America's welcoming of immigrants, which they literally displace and employ to rouse New Yorkers into a jingoistic fervor. These aren't good vibes; it's merely slime.",Ghostbusters II

But, they get another chance when a sinister force in Vigo decides to wreak havoc in the Big Apple and one of his plans is to capture and possess a young infant, Dana's child.The acting is great once again. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis put on more great acts. The guy with the weird Romanian accent kind of creeps me out.I liked the music. It's cool to hear the 80's music once again led by the theme song by Ray Parker Jr. The special effects are also pretty good.Overall, this is a good film. I recommend that you should check this out if you liked the first film. It still delivers laughs while trying to do some spooking. I rate this film 9/10.",Ghostbusters II

45,CuriosityKilledShawn,A tepid sequel that should have been much better,5,31 October 2000,"First of all...where are the ghosts? We have the Scolari Brothers and Slimer but there is an agonizing lack of spooks and spectres in this sequel and the bustings of required. Ghostbusters II should have opened with a huge set-piece (ala James Bond) and then launched the title screen. We have seen these guys set-up, we have had the origin story, they were cheered by the city after saving the world from 40 years of darkness, earthquakes, volcanoes, the dead rising from the grave, human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together mass hysteria!Get the point?Instead the movie stumbles over the starting line by announcing that they were sued by everyone in New York for blowing-up Spook Central and were labelled as frauds. Yeah, because conjuring up a very tangible Marshmallow Man and Gozer's voice booming all over Manhattan is easy to pull off when you're a conman. Not only that but the team have disbanded and Dana has married someone other than Peter. In five years she dumped him, married someone else, had a kid with him, and was dumped herself when he left to go to Europe. That timeline seems a little tight.A portrait of a gruesome medieval warlord being brought to a New York museum coincides with a viscous, psycho-magnatheric river of slime materializing beneath the streets. All of the hate and anger in New York has became tangible and is giving Vigo the Carpathian power from his painting. He wants to inhabit a newborn on the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve and thus take over the world some time later. He's hardly Gozer. Vigo does pretty much nothing for the whole movie and his motivation to become a 90s baby doesn't exactly frighten us.Where is the darkness? This movie is far too light-hearted, helped none by Randy Edelman's lame score which is absolutely no match for the power of Elmer Bernstein from the first movie. Lazlo Kovac's is gone, by Michael Chapman does a fine job in his place, with some truly wonderful wide shots and camera blocking featuring up to six characters at once. GBII has great anamorphic photography but the darkness is not there and it is needed.It satisfied me as a kid, but I can't help but be disappointed at the numerous missed opportunities when I watch it as an adult. It should have been more. It should have been much, much more.I also find it odd that for a film that has a climax set on New Year's Eve there is not one mention of Christmas. And what's twice as weird, or just plain lazy, is the fact that the real life building that became Spook Central in the first movie is visible during the montage scene. All the had to do was point the camera in another direction or use a matte painting to alter it back to its fictional appearance.",Ghostbusters II

47,The-Sarkologist,A movie that did not really need a sequel,5,2 October 2011,"Like most sequels, this film has a lot to be desired. It simply cannot compete with the original movie, which, while similar to many films, still had that air of originality that this film simply lacks. Ghostbusters did launch a franchise of its own (with T-shirts, toys, a computer game, an animated series, as well as two sequels) but there does come a time when a concept falls flat, and there are movies that simply do not need a sequel.As can be expected, after saving the city the Ghostbusters have been forgotten and relegated to appearing at children's parties and dodgy TV shows. Dana has moved on, had a baby, and been married and divorced, and basically the city now considers them a bunch of frauds. It is amazing how quickly people forget, especially since ghosts were running about the city, but I guess that as time passes, people relegate these things to delusions and dreams.However, such is a city like New York, that there are always going to be more dangers, and when some force attempts to steal Dana's baby, the Ghostbusters are called back to investigate. However, during their investigations (which involves digging a hole in the middle of a New York Street) they are arrested and brought to court (and a court that refuses to believe in the supernatural) to face trial. It is then when the ghosts reappear, and suddenly those whom people had rejected are brought back to the forefront.In one sense, this film continues the theme of science trumping faith, however it also shows the nature of the fickle society, and the Ghostbusters are fools to accept it (or maybe they are simply good hearted people). After being stuffed around by all those who suffered losses after the last event, they are more than ready to come back and help their city in need (and one wonders if they will reject them again once the bad guy is defeated). There is a further concept of the positive and negative vibes of the city. It is mentioned a few times that the city is full of bitterness and hate, however they come with the symbol of liberty to break this cycle and thus dissipate the energy that is driving the bad guy.It is a bit like that in this world where hatred and bitterness tends to swell up making life ever more unpleasant for people. It takes a life time to build a reputation and a moment to destroy it. However, as anger and hatred build upon each other, forgiveness cuts through it like a knife. I have seen, and even experienced, how the desire for revenge corrupts you on the inside, but an act of forgiving those who wrong you can free you from those chains to enable you to move on and grow.",Ghostbusters II

This was beyond stupid (especially the dialogue). It was like an amateur school play. The humor is downright slapstick and silly.So, they replace the iconic Marshmallow Man with a walking Statue of Liberty. Oh, how patriotic. How utterly stupid and terrible. The joke about the Titanic ""better late than never"" was distasteful and inappropriate.I had absolutely no fun whatsoever watching this garbage!",Ghostbusters II

51,filipemanuelneto,A sequel that worked well,6,26 March 2016,"This movie is the sequel to the popular film ""Ghostbuster's"", released four years earlier. The main cast it's unchanged, with Bill Murray playing Dr. Venkman, Harold Ramis as Dr. Egon (more geek than ever), Dan Aykroyd as Dr. Stantz and Ernie Hudson as Winston. Sigourney Weaver keep's the role of Dana and Rick Moranis continues to give body and talent to the bumbling Mr. Tully. In this film, the company will be re-activated to face a new danger, the evil Lord Vigo (Wilhelm Von Homburg), a medieval warlord who resurfaces in New York with the darkest intentions.As expected, the booming and highly profitable ""Ghostbuster's"" quickly spawned a sequel. However, contrary to the bad reputation of this kind of films, this sequel reasonably maintain the level of the previous film, despite being sentenced to didn't become so popular. It's the curse of any sequel to a film that reaches such popularity. In fact, both the technical team and central cast are inherited from the previous film, holding the responsibility very well, although Murray can't have been so funny such we already know how he will behave. In addition to the natural predictability, perhaps the smaller laughter guilt is also the politically correct, a barrier that shouldn't be exceeded in family comedies, but that was tight in this film compared to the first one. In addiction, Peter MacNichol comes in the role of Dr. Janosz Poha, a completely new character that gave a breath of fresh air to the film. Years later, MacNichol will redesign this character in another movie, in Leslie Nielson's company (Dracula: Dead and loving it). The special effects continue to be important part of this film, although apparently become more subtle than the first one. The soundtrack is, perhaps, one of the biggest disappointments. Apart from the leitmotiv ""Ghostbuster's"" ever popular, it doesn't bring almost nothing remarkable.Although this film suffer from common ailments to most sequels, especially those that were made to resoundingly popular films, it manages to works well and please the majority of the public who saw and liked the first movie. It's a film for all audiences, familiar, fun and popular even today.",Ghostbusters II
52,leplatypus,Already a reboot? (screen) (vhs),7,25 August 2016,"Don't make me say what I don't have said: GB2 is not a bad movie nor a so-so one. It's a good movie but truly not reaching the classic fun of GB1. For me, there is 3 huge defects in doing this sequel: 1) the soundtrack! Here there is no more inspired score, only songs: some are good (if my memory is correct, it's how I discovered Oingo-Boingo) but the rap ones are really puffing 2) the already seen scenes: the mayor office, their arrest, the big walking thing in the streets,.I just wanted to see something else! 3) The too much auto-centered events: In GB1, the supernatural was believable and serious! Here, a bit like in gremlins 2, it's fun for fun and whatever the credibility: the opening scene with the cradle have no explanation, Slimer is iconic but inappropriate, Vigo is not really frightening and the slime not really convincing. If you can forget all this, the movie is indeed enjoyable: the cast is really excellent and this team is among the best for comedy! Whatever the scene is about, they always find a funny line for that! The movie is also a good depiction to the way of life in a big megalopolis and the beginning when they have new jobs is original. In a way, this movie illustrates the limits of sequels: it's always the same ideas that are played and replayed!",Ghostbusters II

54,Vartiainen,Bad case of sequelitis,6,14 December 2019,"Ghostbusters 2 should have been amazing. The whole team is back, from the actors to the director to the screenwriters. Sure, five years between movies is a tad long so most of the hype had died down, but this could still have worked.And there are good things in this movie. The world is still eminently intriguing and as cool as frozen hell. It's no wonder that this franchise is still alive and kicking. There's just something viscerally and effortlessly appealing about it.Furthermore, all the main actors are back, from Murray to Weaver to Ramis and so on. And they're still great actors who give us great performances. Okay, Murray is clearly not bringing his A-game this time around, but he's passable even at 60 percent.The special effects look amazing, the score is nice and there are cool scenes to be had.So what went wrong? Well, unfortunately the script and the directing, which seems ludicrous because it's the same guys that struck gold the last time around. But there's just no denying that this is very much what a sequel shouldn't be. It's pretty much the exact same story with the outer layer swapped to create an illusion of difference. None of the characters have grown since the events of the original and in some cases they have backslid right to where they started. Like Venkman (Murray) and Barrett (Weaver). Why these sequels believe we want to see the exact same romance all over again, I have no idea, but it's very annoying. Why can't people just be a couple if they got together in the first film? There's jokes to be had in that as well.The pacing is also all over the place and it's just not as tight as the first film where pretty much every scene was iconic. This meanders around, wastes a lot of time simply getting the team back together and is simply not as captivating as the original classic.Still, I can't say I didn't enjoy it. It pales in comparison to its predecessor, but if seen in a vacuum, it more than passes as a fun science fiction horror comedy.",Ghostbusters II

56,FiendishDramaturgy,Every bit as good as the first!!,8,31 December 2003,"I made my own edit of this movie, right behind the first, with no credits between them. I watch them back to back, and almost forgot that there were two movies there. This movie is the perfect continuation of the first, with a whole new story, and a bunch of new ghosts, ghouls, and bad guys.I thoroughly enjoy this movie as much today as I did when it first came out. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis all reprise their roles as our favorite ectoplasm extracators, with Sigourney Weaver returning, along with Rick Moranis and Annie Potts.You will find that the story is wonderfully treacherous and darkly delivered, making this an amazing addition to any horror/comedy collection. If you like these movies, I suggest Candleshoe, The Ghost and Mr. Chicken, Transylvania 6-5000, Monster Squad, Haunted Honeymoon, Young Frankenstein, Second Sight, Vibes, and/or High Spirits.It rates a 7.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",Ghostbusters II
57,freemantle_uk,They're Back,7,29 January 2010,"In the 80s sequels were becoming more popular within studios, offering instead brand recognition and a promise of a good box office return. There were some successes which were both critical and financial, like the Indiana Jones and Back to the Future series. Seeing that Ghostbusters was on of the best loved films of the 80s and forming a spin-off cartoon then a sequel was inevitable.Five years after the first film the Ghostbusters had gone out of business after being sued by the city and state of New York. The gang had gone their separate ways. But there are called back into action after a threat emerges to Dian Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) and her young son. Our heroes discover a strange river of paranormal slime that feeds of negative emotions (a bad cocktail when mixed with New Yorkers). Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) and Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) come back together and fight the forces of the paranormal for the good of New York. The also investigate the smile and the possible link to a strange painting in the New York Museum of Art.The first film was a classic to generations, the sequel is a decent effort, but nothing compared to the first film. Bill Murray and Harold Ramis still do a good comic job, particularly Murray and the director Ivan Reitman offers a steady hand behind the camera. The special effects were brilliant and storywises, there are worst and it does offer a commentary of New Yorkers. But what happens is this film falls into 2 traps. The first was going for easier visual and slapstick which was avoided in the first film. Bill Murray tries to keep his deadpan humour, but the film isn't as the first film. The second is the trap most comedy sequels fall into, repleting some of the same gags and scenes from the previous films. It shows a lack of originality.If you seen the first film you may as well watch it, but it's not as good as the first.",Ghostbusters II
58,dee.reid,They're back!,8,30 October 2007,"I could lie and say I think ""Ghostbusters II"" is an inferior sequel to the original 1984 ""Ghostbusters,"" but ""Ghostbusters II"" is an entertaining film in its own right. Nothing can come close to the gleaming perfection of the first film but damn it, the sequel works in most places. It's chiefly because the movie is just so damn entertaining! It's still mostly watchable despite its flaws and misjudgments about what the filmmakers may have seen as an apparent mean-spiritedness in a lot of people during the late '80s.True, comedian and star Bill Murray still steals the show whenever he gets the chance and he also gets some of the best lines, and he's just so gosh-darn funny as a leading man. Screenwriter team/co-stars Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are also in top form, and it shows in their wily and hilarious script. Unlike the first picture, though, it seems like they took the family-friendly route and didn't feel like building up to the oh-so-apocalyptic tone of the first film (even though ""Ghostbusters"" was still pretty funny aside from the occasional dark tone).And also, director Ivan Reitman knows their material and it looks like the filmmakers made the wise decision of bringing back everybody from the original film, including Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis. It's been five years since the first film (a title card confirms it), and it seems that most of New York City doesn't even remember who the Ghostbusters are and what they did for the city. Everyone in the city is miserable and the opening moments confirm that as well. After being almost bankrupted by countless lawsuits and being unable to practice their trade because of a judicial restraining order, the boys are reduced to moonlighting in other fields, such as catering to the needs of spoiled yuppie children at their birthday parties, a task that neither Ray Stanz (Aykroyd) or Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) take pride in.Egon Spengler (Ramis) is the only one of the original Ghostbusters who seems to have actually moved on with his life. Peter Venkman (Murray) hosts a television show called ""The World of the Psychic,"" a show that apparently draws in modest ratings but no respected psychic will appear on his show because they think he's a fraud. Anyway, things get underway when the boys discover that nasty pink slime of supernatural origin is discovered building up underneath the city, something that old friend and Venkman's old flame Dana Barrett (Weaver) realizes first hand when the slime attacks her infant son, and it's an investigation they have to do on the down-low because of their current legal situation.This slime, they learn, feeds off the misery and stress of a downtrodden New York City, and it's only getting stronger as the holidays are approaching. But because no one believes in ghosts anymore, their task is even more difficult. Well, after ghost-busting the two ghouls that crash in on their trial hearing, we have no choice but to be ready to believe them. They're back in business, all right - with cynical Janine Melnitz (Annie Potts) answering the phones and Louis Tully (Moranis) on the books - tracing the source of their ghost-busting investigations to a 17th-century Moldavian tyrant named Vigo the Carpathian who wants in on the 20th century, and has possessed museum curator Janosz Poha (a hilarious Peter MacNicol) to go out and kidnap Dana's son so he can have a body so he can live again.One thing ""Ghostbusters II"" provides for the viewer is solid entertainment, which is what any good sequel should do. It would be impossible for this movie to any way live up to the original, so you can't blame the filmmakers for at least trying (trying is italicized). It would be pointless to say that the acting is good from our players, but my God, they're good and again in top form. The special effects are still pretty impressive, even from their early ghost-busting capers, to a finale where the boys are actually able to walk down the streets of the city in an animated - yes, animated! - Statue of Liberty (yes, Lady Liberty has sprung to life, and good thing she's on our side!). And even the R.M.S. Titanic (don't ask, just watch) pops up too.""Ghostbusters II"" hasn't been particularly well-received, even despite its more family-friendly tone and message about the folly of mean-spiritedness. But it's just a good sequel, nonetheless, not bad, not superior to the original, maybe on par with the original, but it's just really good fun.8/10",Ghostbusters II
59,smatysia,Pretty decent as comedy sequels go,6,30 December 2015,"Pretty decent as comedy sequels go. Many commentators are lamenting that this film is not as good as the first one. Well, that is almost always the case. The audience does not get the experience of discovering the characters, which is usually a big part of the charm of a movie. While good at times, at other times Bill Murray seems to be mailing it in. But Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson do very well. Sigourney Weaver also puts it all out there. I really like Annie Potts, but her role (in both films) doesn't really suit her. Neither does Rick Moranis'. The plot is okay, and the gags and effects are fine. If you liked the first one, you'll like this one, too. Just don't expect it to be better than the original, as that is rarely possible.",Ghostbusters II
60,snoozejonc,Enjoyable enough sequel,7,29 July 2020,"The Ghostbusters are back in business dealing with a river of slime under the New York streets and a ghost looking for rebirth into the body of a young child.It's a decent film in its own right but as with any sequel it suffers from the inevitable comparison with the original. In this case it does not quite reach the desired standard.The same support cast returns with a few additions. Rick Moranis' character is on par with his previous strong effort, some might argue he's even better. Sigourney Weaver is more of a damsel in distress than before and Annie Potts character has changed into someone a lot more light hearted and sillier than her first incarnation. Peter MacNichol unfortunately plays a highly irritating character that made me want to skip forward most scenes that he appeared. The main antagonist is not very imaginative. He looks like Michael Portillo with a blond wig and offers very little credible threat to the proceedings.As for the Ghostbusters, the actors still have excellent chemistry and appear to be enjoying their moments on screen. The children's party, the dancing toaster, the courtroom scene are all classic franchise moments. Bill Murray lights up every scene he's in and raises the movie from being distinctly average to one I'm happy to rewatch with my daughter multiple times.The effects and spectacles are as good as the original and it contains a pretty good soundtrack.Entertaining sequel but doesn't match the enjoyment of the original.",Ghostbusters II
61,lukem-52760,The Most Feelgood Film Ever. My Fave Movie Ever. The Film That Defined My Childhood.,10,19 July 2018,"I love both Ghostbusters films as i grew up watching them both & loving them to death. Ghostbusters made me fall in love with New York City from what i saw on screen in these movies & both films introduced me to the greatness of Director Ivan Reitman & the great cast of fun performers such as Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis (R. I. P) & Rick Moranis plus other greats such as Sigourney Weaver, who i loved from Aliens & Ernie Hudson.No other movie gives me a sense of comfort viewing like this fantastic sequel does!!! A Nostalgic piece of beautifully feelgood filmmaking. Also Randy Edelman's beautiful score is one of the elements that makes this movie so special. Randy brings the movie to life with gorgeous score that compliments every single scene & is my favourite music from any film ever, the soundtrack is a MASTERPIECE too!!! There's a Magic to Ghostbusters 2 that i haven't experienced in any other movie (not even the first film) it's like Ivan Reitman wanted to create something that was full of Hope for the dark times of it's era & so crafted a movie that has a sense of real friendship, love & hope that is at the films very core. The makers (Aykroyd, Ramis & Reitman) knew that bad things are happening all around us every day but we must still carry on & try to be positive or we too will become like those that are creating the Negativity & darkness that is engulfing us all. Ghostbusters 2 prepared me for the crazy, dangerous & extremely Negative adult real world.I adore both films but overall the Sequel wins easily as personal favourite because of lots of better things, such as the villain VIGO, He's a great villain & alot more sinister & interesting than Gozer!!!'GHOSTBUSTERS 2' is so beautifully 80's in everyway possible & i adore it for that as its a lovely Nostalgic time capsule & the most important movie of all time for me growing up. In this misunderstood Masterpiece our Ghostbusters guys are more like Super heroes in this superior sequel or that's how its always felt to me, these guys were my Super heroes growing up. Also this movie is so beautifully Colourful & the colours are so striking like the pink of the river & the blue of the Scolleri Brothers & the glow of green slimer & so on, Beautiful use of bright vivid colours to catch the attention & imagination of kids. I do believe this sequel was crafted with kids in mind because of the hugely popular Real Ghostbusters cartoon & it's a better film for it. Another plus for this superior sequel was the better looking grey outfits that wasn't used enough, actually they only got used in the montage sequence but they looked better in my opinion.Yep the gorgeous look of this sequel is better as it's really clear & as i said very, colourful & that gives it a nice safe, clean & comforting feel with its imagery. There's just something so delightful about seeing these 4 guys together even just them hanging out together like in the Classic ""Toaster Scene"" or at Ray's Occult book store for example. A proper sweet story of Good vs Evil that gives a comforting feeling of everything will be alright!!!I just love the whole River of Slime story here in part 2, its so smart & interesting that the idea of how Nasty everyone has been in the dark & gritty City has an actual effect & leaves a physical pink slime residue that is rising up from the sewers, such a fantastic idea & the sewer scenes are beautifully done & the imagery is so iconic to me like the glowing pink river & i love the big old beautifully Gothic Vigo painting & all the scenes at the museum, all masterfully shot & beautifully Nostalgic to me along with the Amazing Court Room sequence with the Awesome Scolleri Brothers & the fun, dancing Toaster bit & many more. GB2 will always hold a special place in my movie loving heart along with it's 1984 Classic.Ghostbusters 2 is my all time favourite movie ever, nothing comes close to how much i love & treasure this film, i have such strong Nostalgic love for this movie that made me love movies!!! Best soundtrack ever to a movie too in my opinion that is happy, bumpy & just feelgood. Everything about Ghostbusters 2 has an overall tone of Happiness & positivity within a dark Supernatural story, these four
Four guys want to save their gritty, dirty & nasty city even though the City hasn't been good to them, a positive message of Hope & doing the right thing.The characters are back & that's the most important thing about a Ghostbusters movie, the boys are back & in away even more fun than the first film. I love the 5 yrs later beginning scenes, it's a perfect way to start the movie & catch up to where our heroes are at now & the flow of the film is so nice & there's a real sense of friendship between our guys & that's at the core of this film, the niceness of the characters & the positivity that they bring to a dark & miserable City, it's generally nice to see these warm characters back together ready to save their City. I always get such a nice cosy feeling watching Ghostbusters 2 & each time is like seeing my friends again & that's because of how much we love these characters & because us fans grew up watching them so they mean alot to us fans.Murray is more restraint this time as Venkman but is still charming & funny & has lovely sweet chemistry with Sigourney Weaver's Dana, their scenes are all really nice together.Aykroyd as Ray is sweet, fun & more thoughtful this time around. Ramis as Egon is still full on smart but i feel he gets more warmth & humour than he did in the first film. Hudson is actually even more underused & left out than he was in the first film, Winston could have all his scenes deleted & it wouldn't make any difference to the movie & that's a shame but whenever he does pop up here he's good.Sigourney Weaver is great again as Dana Barrett & this time with her baby Oscar who is a big part of the movies story. Weaver is lovely in her role & always seems like a such a nice & decent person & she has many nice bits with Murray's Peter. I found Dana to be much better as a character this time around. Dana is a strong woman & a good mother who is raising little Oscar on her own & Sigourney delivers a really nice & comforting performance & lots face it that Sigourney is a legend of Cinema with her Ripley role from the Alien franchise & having her in this ensemble cast just adds to the quality of the overall movie. Sigourney, like Jamie lee Curtis, was always there in my childhood from her films i grew up watching on video & she means alot to me. Dana Barrett is a great character & better in this sequel.Peter MacNicol is great fun as the possessed Yanosz of the Museum & is having so much fun you can tell, he steals most scenes & is the funniest character in the film.In fact all the cast is having so much fun & that's why it's so enjoyable to watch. Annie Potts & Rick Moranis are fine back in their roles but do come across abit too silly at times but nothing distracting just if they wasn't in the film they wouldn't be missed.GB2 was my first ever Cinema experience, the first film i ever saw in the pictures so it means alot to me & is a very special childhood Classic of mine & is my most watched film of all time. This sequels imagery of the old painting of Vigo & the glowing pink river of slime are etched in my brain. Love this pleasant, feelgood fantasy film so much & is a lovely piece of Escapism from our messed up & often dark & Depressing world. I found with both Classic Ghostbusters films that each has some bits better than each other but both have memorable & iconic scenes & imagery that is life lasting & burned into my brain.In my opinion that if you loved the first film than how can you not love the sequel? Our heroes are back & just as much fun.Ghostbusters 2 is the best Sequel ever to me, it's a Classic movie in it's own right & a very uplifting & comforting film that has been there for me since i was little, a MASTERPIECE in my opinion.No film beats Ghostbusters 2 in my opinion, no film!!!The music is fantastic & soooooo Feelgood especially The Classic Bobby Brown song On Our Own & Flip City just pure beautiful bouncy 80's pop Classic'sThe Courtroom scene is a Classic. The Road Digging scene is a Classic. Lots of memorable scenes, lines & imagery that truly makes this a perfect sequel & a Classic of the late 80's & the most impressive & defining film of my childhood.No other movie captured my imagination like the Ghostbusters films but it was this superior sequel that made me fall in love with these characters & my interest in the supernatural.Ghostbusters 2 is definitely my most watched movie of all time & i just love it more & more with each viewing & find more subtext in it's fabric & makes me appreciate what Aykroyd & Ramis was writing into what is basically a silly-fun Blockbuster Comedy but there's alot more bubbling under it's surface. The whole concept of all the bad feelings, Nastiness, Misery, Hatred, Crime, Sadness & Anger that people were feeling in the darkness of the City (Real life too back then in New York City) could actually manifest into a physical sludge that is made of pure concentrated Evil & could destroy the city from within with their own doing is a fantastically smart idea!!! A genius idea actually. Still relevant today in 2021, probably more so with the new version of the River of slime being ""Social Media"" & the ""Internet"" the evil sludge is now digital but just as effective with it's spread of hatred & evil. GHOSTBUSTERS 2 is a misunderstood Masterpiece.The subtext of Ghostbusters 2 & how it remains relevant today in 2021 is as deep as it's River of Slime!!! Dig deeper & you can see the genius of this misunderstood Masterpiece.A supernatural family Comedy Blockbuster with so much deep relevance & political statements of out times is a big achievement for a ""Sequel"" to a film that neary everyone loves more!!! Not me though, it's GHOSTBUSTERS 2 all the way.",Ghostbusters II
62,hu675,Argeeable sequel to the 1984 blockbuster.,8,28 June 2008,"Five years has passed, the ""Ghostbusters"" (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson) are living different lives and somewhat difficult. Since after they saved the city, they were sued by the city (Which it certainly shows New York City could love you and then spit you out). When Dana's (Sigourney Weaver) baby son Oscar's (Played both by William T. Deutschendift and Harry J. Deutschendift) carriage pushes itself wildly in the streets of New York. There's no supernatural presence for five years, they find themselves back in business. When there's a river of smile (!) under the first avenue of the city. Which this smile does feeds on negative energy that brings supernatural haunting back in the city. But the trouble doesn't stop there an mysterious painting has a life of his own, where Dana does work at. Since this painting is called Vigo the Carpathian (Wilhelm von Homburg), a cruel 16th-century Moldavian ruler. Which Vigo has possessed Dr. Janosz Poha (Peter MacNicol) is been restoring the painting. Now this ruler wants an baby so he could re-live again, since Janosz has his eyes on Dana and her child.Directed by Ivan Reitman (Evolution, Meatballs, Twins) made an entertaining sequel that has some of the charm of the original but not much of it. Which it is probably a good thing, since this sequel tries to go on his own. As usual, the cast from the first one returns and it is a delight to see them again. Murray certainly shows his charming side of Peter Venkman. Since his character tried to allure Dana's character and her son in the picture. Rick Morains and Annie Potts are back as well. Aykroyd and Ramis, who wrote the script for this one as well. They written some great comedic moments and some great visual moments as well.DVD from the double-feature gift set. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD only special features are two episodes from ""The Real Ghostbusters"". It would have been great for the DVD... if it includes an new commentary track from the filmmakers, an retrospective documentary and deleted scenes (Which they were plenty of scenes that hit the cutting-room floor before it was release). Perphas the one of the few problems in this sequel that it is not as inventive as the original and the third act seems to be a bit forced. But still ""Ghostbusters 2"" manages to be a good entertaining sequel. There's plenty of funny moments early on, especially the uncredited cameos of Kevin Dunn and Chloe Webb. Harris Yulin, who appears as the Judge has one of the best scenes in the sequel. ""Ghostbusters 2"" is certainly more entertaining than most sequels has to offer these days. Panavision. (*** ½/*****).",Ghostbusters II
63,slokes,Revisiting Old Haunts,6,30 March 2010,"A decent sequel to a clever if oversuccessful comedy, ""Ghostbusters II"" doesn't shake things up in the slightest. It's fairly amusing and likable in its own right, but given the gonzo comedy minds behind it, uncomfortably safe and commercially-focused.Five years after the events of ""Ghostbusters"", our intrepid team of spook-chasers have moved on. But when a 16th-century Carpathian tyrant tries to take up residence in the infant son of Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver), it's time for them to reunite and save Manhattan once again.It's really a reunion, too, with all of the Ghostbusters back from the first film, along with Weaver, Annie Potts, and Rick Moranis as uber-nerd Louis Tully, now over his dog-like infatuation for Dana. Director Ivan Reitman plays to the crowd more than he did in the first film, with flashing lights and goofy scare scenes. Even Slimer, the ever-hungry poltergeist, is back for a couple of cameos.What matters most is that Bill Murray is back as Venkman, the smug and wisecracking Ghostbuster still pining for Dana. Murray's fastball was as sharp as anyone's in film comedy at the time, and if he overplays his ironic detachment, he also throws off killer facial gestures or line readings with ridiculous ease.""Don't put any of those old, cheap moves on me,"" Dana tells him.""No, no, no,"" he assures her. ""I've got all new cheap moves.""Venkman was also the prime focus of the last film, but not so much as he is here. With more special effects to deliver, more nods in the direction of merchandising (the ghost in the familiar logo now holds up two fingers), and a concerted effort at giving Ernie Hudson something to do other than be black, the scripters cut way back on Ghostbusters Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) and Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), defined roles in the first film but offering only exposition here. Since Ramis and Aykroyd were the screenwriters, I guess it was an easy call.The only scene not showcasing Murray, and the best in the film, has the Ghostbusters on trial and represented by Tully, who hilariously shows how wrong he is for the job. As a comely prosecutor played by Janet Margolin in one of her last film roles runs circles around him, Tully whines: ""Give me a break. We're both lawyers.""I laughed more in that scene than I did with any scene in the first movie. But the film's plot, once established, is a strained retread of the first movie, complete with the Statue of Liberty subbing for the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. The special effects don't hold up well, a real failing for such an FX-driven feature.Was ""Ghostbusters II"" designed for the kids, for the merchandising, or both? It delivers plenty of Murray at close to his funniest, and stitches together enough good lines to keep me amused. But it never risks rocking the boat, and its efforts to reference He-Man and rap music are weak stabs at relevance that date the film today. (Exception: Bobby Brown's ""On Our Own"" is a terrific improvement on the tone-deaf ""Ghostbusters"" theme.)If only Aykroyd and Ramis were inspired to use their comedy brilliance to dig a little deeper, the result could have been a ""Gremlins 2"" or ""Evil Dead II""-style improvement on the original. Alas, while entertaining, a paint-by-numbers feel predominates.",Ghostbusters II
64,gcd70,Complete Flop,3,28 June 2008,"The original team of director Reitman and writers Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd returned five years on to bring us this complete flop of a sequel that finds the ""Ghostbusters"" out of work and out of favour.The unfunny, stupid plot tells of an evil spirit who is trying to re-enter our world through the male baby of Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver). Sadly the audience will rarely laugh and never care whether the ""Ghostbusters"" kick butt or not. Murray, Aykroyd and Ramis never recapture the old chemistry, and Weaver looks totally disinterested. The outrageously stupid finale kills the pic off.Thank goodness for the return of Rick Moranis and Annie Potts, as well as the introduction of nutty art historian Janusz (Peter MacNicol). The special f/x aren't a great deal better than the first, though the original soundtrack makes a welcome comeback.Despite all these weaknesses, ""Ghostbusters II"" made a killing at the box office thanks to the phenomenal success of part one.Sunday, September 28, 1997 - Video",Ghostbusters II
65,Jonny_Numb,"""It's something strange, and it could have looked better""",6,11 September 2006,"The inevitability of a sequel to the pop-culture landmark ""Ghostbusters"" (which remains one of the highest-grossing films of all time) should have come as a surprise to no one. And even with the reputation most sequels have (at least nowadays, when they are cranked out with the soulless annual consistency of the ""Saw"" films), I think everyone expected something a lot better than what they got. As an 8-year old kid weaned on episodes of ""The Real Ghostbusters"" 6 days a week, and an ardent fan of the original film, I wasn't doing any complaining in my local theater back in '89; and I'd be lying if I said it didn't have a special place in my childhood.But after nearly two decades of depreciation, ""Ghostbusters II,"" well, just looks plain inferior to its predecessor. While making an earnest attempt to be an authentic sequel (catching up with the boys 5 years after their duel with Gozer), the film is afflicted with several missteps that smack of desperation: 1) the inclusion of a weird-accented gallery owner (Peter MacNicol--""Bean""); 2) the expansion of Rick Moranis's gawky accountant character; 3) the placement of a child in peril (in this case, Dana Barret's infant); and 4) an 'up-with-people' theme that feels more than a little silly.Granted, the film has Ivan Reitman's assured direction, Richard Edlund's superb FX work, and the presence of the original cast on its side. There are, as in the original, some comedically inspired sequences: Ray, Peter, and Egon doing a construction-worker shtick; a courtroom scene presided over by the bellowing Harris Yulin; and the Statue of Liberty walking through downtown New York, powered by an old NES controller.As for the plot: a portrait of a Carpathian ruler named Vigo takes possession of MacNicol in order to obtain a child so that he can be reincarnated on New Year's Eve. And while the original ""Ghostbusters"" had a plot that was just as--if not more--ridiculous, we went along with it anyway, because the flipside-world presented on screen was so damn convincing (as were the performances). In this sequel, we are constantly snorting in full awareness of how damn ridiculous it is. The writing, insofar as comedy and plot is concerned, is regrettably slack and underwhelming (and isn't helped by the high standard the original set).I don't know...there are good things in ""Ghostbusters II."" It has a great cast (Bill Murray's delivery is always good for a few chuckles), the visuals are still cool, and it gives purists some candy to chew while holding vigil for ""Ghostbusters 3"" to be greenlit. If you're like me, it will coast along on nostalgia value alone--a quality diversion that won't leave much of an impression.",Ghostbusters II
66,adamjohns-42575,Just good and easy.,8,3 August 2021,"I think this is as good as the first one. It's got all the jokes and the fun with all the ghosties too, so I can't understand why it gets slated by some people. You could make the perfect sequel and people would still moan, just because it is a sequel though.There are a number of obvious plot holes where the ability to suddenly steer a huge piece of metal is not made clear among other things, but this isn't the sort of film that needs to get bogged down in minutiae and it is technically aimed at kids too.The characters are all given a chance to shine and no one takes over. Rick Moranis is good fun and Peter MacNicol makes a brilliant creep even before he's possessed.There really isn't much more that you can say about it, except bring on the new one and forget the Melissa McCarthy one exists.",Ghostbusters II
67,vertigo_14,There's something strange in the neighborhood...again! (spoilers),7,22 February 2006,"I have just completed a Ghostbusters binge, watching for most of the week (while working on assorted papers) just these two films. The first, made in 1984, which had introduced to filmgoing audiences somewhat orthodox scientists and a parapsychologist who seize upon getting their grant revoked for study on Columbia University's campus to go into business for themselves as well, the guys you call when you have a paranormal pest problem to be taken care of. It continues to be an everlasting staple of pop culture, especially of 80s pop culture. And the sequel that followed, released five years later, did much to keep up with the humor.We return five years to New York to find that the Ghostbusters business is defunct, thanks to numerous lawsuits that had ensued after the four guys combated the massive evil of the underworld and basically saved New York City. Ray (Akroyd) runs a bookstore when he's not performing as a Ghostbuster with Winston (Hudson) at birthday parties, Egon (Ramis) is doing human tests (that oddly, would not likely pass and IRB review) of some sort, and Peter (Murray) has a cable access show on the paranormal and more. Dana (Weaver) brings the group together again after an incident on the streets of the city with a runaway baby carriage reveal a river of paranormal slime flowing underground in an abandoned train tunnel. Oddly, the mayor of New York wants nothing to do with this (again, surprisingly) and it is the threat of suit that brings Louis Tulley (Moranis) back into the picture as both their accountant, attorney, and future amateur Ghostbuster. Meanwhile, the river of slime is conjuring up something bad as a painting being housed in the museum where Dana works as a restoration artist is possessed by a spirit who in turn possesses her boss, Janosz (pronounced like Ya Nosh), played very hilariously by Peter MacNichol (who suspiciously may have been the inspiration for Chris Katan's character, Mango, on SNL). Oddly, the future of the city rests with the city, who's notorious aggressiveness (at least in generalizations) may only further the evil as the slime is responsive to certain moods and will act accordingly.If you watched the first one because you enjoyed much of Bill Murray's humor, I would definitely recommend catching the sequel. It does tend to repeat much of the story flow, obviously (isn't Dana at all surprised that this is happening to her again?), and during the reformation of the Ghostbusters team, does capitalize and is aware of itself as a sequel (beginning with Janine Melzner's (Annie Potts, my favorite) ""yes...we're back""). The end is fairly corny considering the ""all for one and one for all"" morals and the gathering of city pride by bringing to life the statue of liberty. But nonetheless, the Ghostbusters sequel does have a lot to offer by way of humor that fans of the first may continue to enjoy.",Ghostbusters II
68,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Same As Ghostbusters (1),8,26 December 2011,"Ghost Busters II is the only sequel I have seen so far where I feel my review is for the most part the same. To me, this movie wasn't really like a sequel. It was like Columbia Pictures decided to reinvent Ghost Busters (1984) by changing the visuals. Yes there are different things in the plot, for example, it's set five years later, Sigourney Weaver's character has a baby, and the Ghost Busters have to restore their names to New York by saving the city like they did five years before. But none of these minor changes made me feel like I was watching anything new.For the cast of this movie, all the same the actors reprise their roles. That is a good thing, because replacing actors for the same character doesn't end well most of the time; but this is not the case. You would think though the writers to this film would do something extraordinary with the characters, but no. Instead we seem to get a rehash from the first film. I enjoyed the original Ghost Busters to a point. It was funny but I did not think it was AS funny as everyone ""claimed"" it to be.As for the special effects, I felt that director Ivan Reitman had an ambitious concept and used it well. Although it still did not raise my interest of the movie to a higher level, it definitely kept me paying attention to what was happening on screen. Much of the effects in this movie deal with slime. Watching the slime ooze and sludge all over town reminded me of The Blob (1988), but in a less graphic sense. I'm curious if Dan Aykroyd borrowed this idea from that movie. I would like to know how they even cleaned the mess up. I can't tell which would have been more difficult; cleaning the mess in the first movie with the ""Stay Puft Marshmallow Man"", or the slime. I'd pick the marshmallow, at least you can eat that.Finally, the parts in the movie that were supposed to be funny did make me laugh, but still, not enough. And although I cannot count exactly how many times I chuckled, it felt like the same amount of times as I did for the first film. It still was funny but I was hoping Ghost Busters II would have turned my opinion around on the first one. Instead, it left me in the same vicinity as the first one. I did like the musical score in this film. I might've even liked it more than Elmer Bernstein's soundtrack from the Ghost Busters (1984). I really can't explain why but it has a different feeling than the one before. In the end, Ghost Busters II was not two hours wasted, but it could have been done better.Ghost Busters II will satisfy fans of the franchise but it's almost too close to the original. All the original characters are back, but it seems like nothing new was added; besides more slime.",Ghostbusters II
69,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,A soulless Hollywood product,2,8 October 2015,"This sequel appears to have been watered down for the kiddies who watched the Ghostbusters cartoon show for the previous half decade, while simultaneously selling cinema tickets to their parents for nostalgia (and a soundtrack album).The now disgraced (after the destruction of Manhattan in the first film) Ghostbusters are called back into action, when a sea of slime is found running under the city, feeding on negative energy, and while a fictitious former warlord attempts to re-enter the world of the living, via a haunted painting.Goofy and inane, silly plot - at its core, it offers a generic ""be nice"" message, and it tries to top the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from part 1 by giving us the ghost of Titanic. Seriously? Film seems like what would now be called cos-play with original film's cast, most of whom return, but none of whom seem interested.",Ghostbusters II
70,brando647,"Fun sequel, not too different from original...",7,9 January 2006,"Five years later, the Ghostbusters are back. And this time, they're unemployed. The sequel to 1984's ""Ghost Busters"" begins with the team disbanded and gone their separate ways after their money runs dry. They are reunited when Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver reprising her role from the original) is once again plagued by the dead. At this point, it begins to seem that her role in life is that of supernatural punching bag, or maybe the ghosts have had the hots for her since seeing her in ""Alien"".""Ghostbusters II"" captures the same humor and fun as its predecessor and brings back all of the major players as well. It is great to see Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, and Hudson together again. Peter MacNicol is brought on as the lackey for the ancient evil spirit bent on resurrection, providing some great comic moments. The only problem is that at points it feels too much like the first, as if it reuses some of the same jokes and situations. Fortunately, the movie never feels stale and still makes for an entertaining two hours. I'd even go so far as to say I like this one a little better than the first. It's a shame they never made a third, but, in a way, I am glad they didn't. By stopping after II, they gave the series a nice close and avoided over-killing the franchise.",Ghostbusters II

72,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Ghostbusters II""- A troubled but entertaining and even often frightening follow-up.",7,27 November 2016,"One of the more divisive sequels of the 1980's, ""Ghostbusters II"" is in many ways a very strange but generally fulfilling watch. Released five years after the iconic original, the film became a minor hit but was met with a lot of apathy from audiences, who were wise to the fact that in many ways, the film was a slave to that classic first film and unable (or unwilling) to try to do much to set it apart. But looking back so many years later, I do think there are a lot of hints of brilliance here beneath the surface faults, and I firmly believe that it's a far better film than most will give it credit for being. It might be a bit of a retread of familiar territory. But it's a very fun and entertaining retread that also boasts a number of very well- constructed sequences of both comedy and pure, atmospheric horror.Five years after saving New York City from a vile epidemic of spirits, the Ghostbusters have fractured following copious lawsuits and public backlash. However, when Peter Venkman's (Bill Murray) former flame Dana (Sigourney Weaver) comes to the team concerned for the well-being of her infant son, the Ghostbusters reassemble to help their old friend and client. And soon enough, Venkman, Egon (Harold Ramis), Ray (Dan Aykroyd) and Winston (Ernie Hudson) will discover that a new wave of terror is about to take the Big Apple by storm, and it all ties back to a mysterious haunted painting of an ancient tyrant known as ""Vigo the Carpathian"", whose spirit is hatching a plan to be reborn at the strike of midnight on New Year's Eve...What salvages the film and helps it to fundamentally succeed is the continued charm of the returning cast and a surprisingly well-constructed and atmospheric tone. There's just an inherent joy to seeing the guys back together, and it's definitely infectious. The one-liners and in-jokes between the teammates makes for a lot of laugh-out loud character beats and plenty of highly quotable lines. I particularly admired Ramis and Aykroyd's banter throughout the film, which supplied much of the heart and humor here. Hudson is under-utilized once again, but he gets a few good moments peppered in to make you feel like he's a worthwhile teammate. And though he seems somewhat lost, Murray is once again gold as Venkman, and his wonderful chemistry with Weaver gives the film a much-needed emotional core. I also really enjoyed Rick Moranis and his somewhat expanded role as Louis Tully, now having become the team's new lawyer. He's got some really great material. New cast member Peter MacNicol is also a blast as a co- worker of Dana's who is entranced into becoming Vigo's familiar in the world.Director Ivan Reitman crafts a much darker tale here, and injects a lot of pure suspense and eerie sequences of horror that give the film a good sense of dread. I've always been fairly shocked by the common misconception that this sequel is more ""kid friendly"" than the original, because I frankly always found it more mature and frightening. In addition to his trademark wit and sense of character, Reitman seems far more focused on creating and constantly building a sense of tension here in comparison to the original, with a much darker and murkier aesthetic and a bigger leaning on freakish and Gothic imagery. While the original film played it more cool and used the horror more to build entertainment, here it dives full-on into pure suspense with numerous sequences whose existence is predicated solely on scaring you half to death. And I love it because it gives the film a tonality that both compliments and contrasts with the original, which I appreciated as it helped to mask some of the issues with the script.And that script is the biggest hurdle. It's been said constantly, but I do have to echo the most common complaint... it's too focused on re- creating the original film, almost coming off as more remake than sequel. While individual elements may differ, the film follows the first's structure near beat-for- beat, to the point that anyone with any knowledge of the original will be able to guess what's coming and when. It's a massive issue not only because it robs much of the suspense, but also because the film itself has to occasionally contrive nonsensical story developments to justify retelling the same ideas over again. And thus, you have sequences that often make little sense. Why does everyone in the city seem to forget that ghosts were demonstratively proved to be real just a few years ago? So that way there can be doubters yet again for the story, that's why! Why did Dana and Peter break up after the last film? Because we had to have them repeat a similar love story here, duh! It all serves to just rinse and repeat what worked last time, but without that freshness that came with seeing these characters for the first time.Still, I can't help but feel the film succeeds in no small part thanks to its darkly unique tone and for the excellence and entertainment value afforded by the excellent cast. It's just too hard not to enjoy yourself when you have a talented group of individuals on display while the film repeatedly makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up high. Is the film really just a cash-grab redo of what was done better, before? Yeah, more or less. But that doesn't change the fact that it's still a ton of fun to behold. And I'll always get a kick out of it.""Ghostbusters II"" gets a pretty-good 7 out of 10. It may not quite measure up to the outstanding and now-classic first entry. But it's a serviceable and often entertaining follow-up with just enough laughs (and screams) to make it a fun watch.",Ghostbusters II
73,m-47826,Fun sequel.,6,14 June 2020,"Just like Gremlins, Ghostbusters was a cool mix of horror and comedy, with a great cast. Only on a higher level, lots of big name actors. I love all of them, especially in this sequel. Where they give their best, regardless of things that may have happened off set. The storytelling is pretty much the same as in the original. Only with more focus on regulars (plus a baby) and a whole upgrade on everything that changed between both movies, and the time it was shot. First movie had hell dogs and an androgynous entity with feline moves. Sure to give your kid's self at least a couple of nightmares. But this one is the worst, nightmare inducing wise. Thank you comic reliefs, Bill Murray, Peter MacNichol, Annie Potts and Rick Moranis. But even they couldn't make me forget that Vigo character whom backstory was a lot similar to Dracula's. And that tunnel scene. People who saw it know what I mean. Maybe studios wanted another level on everything, but personally I think they went a little too far with the big vilain and how scary it was meant to be. It also has the most memorable moments/lines, and is more of a cult classic than the first movie, in my opinion. The opening, the talk show, the trial, the bathtub, the slime attack all over town, the liberty statue saving the day, to name a few. This one is filled with talked about scenes, often mentioned on the movie franchise documentaries, discussions.

The first time, he was Renfield in Dracula: Dead and Loving It (which actually came out a few years after Ghostbusters II). In both he's a hypnotized slave of the big bad guy- the difference being that here, he has a German accent or something.Alas, I have to agree with some of the other user comments that this isn't the only reason for déjà vu- Ghostbusters II is closely modelled after the original. There's another song indicating the ghostbusters are in demand; there's another jerk from the government giving them grief; they're arrested again; there's another apocalypse; they're New Yorkers' heroes again. Add to that some cheap repetition of the line ""Who you gonna call?"" and it starts to look not good.But wait, there are some honest laughs. Early on, we have a woman on Venkman's talk show talking about an alien she met- obviously a joke of a guest. There are more ghosts, and the Titanic finally makes it to New York. Winston has a bigger part ('cause he wasn't introduced half way into the movie this time). Finally, we have the villain- not a Sumerian god/goddess. This time it's a dead European tyrant named Vigo who lives in a painting of himself, wanting to escape by taking possession of a baby. I was impressed by Vigo as a kid- I mean, this guy was a bona fide scourge of Carpathia, a sorrow of Moldavia! Oh, command me, lord!

78,hall895,Should have left well enough alone,5,28 August 2006,"We all know how Hollywood works. If a movie makes piles and piles of money there will be a sequel. So here we are with Ghostbusters II which was never going to measure up to the original. The sequel has its moments but not nearly enough of them and it leaves you with the sense that you've seen all this done before and done better. There's really nothing new or compelling here. Same premise. Ghosts in New York City, Ghostbusters called in to deal with the problem. Been there, done that.All the principal characters from the first film are back and we pretty much just start all over again. At the start of the sequel the Ghostbusters are out of business but they will soon find themselves back in action battling, I kid you not, a river of pink slime oozing beneath the streets of Manhattan and a ghost trapped in a painting. The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man it isn't. Anyhow this pink slime and our not-so-friendly painting ghost get their power from the negative energy in New York City. If people would all just be happy everything will turn out just fine! The heck with blasting ghosts, let's just have a contrived musical number and make all the New Yorkers sing and then everything will be great. Hoo boy. Can't we just go back to blasting things? Please?There are a few good comic moments here with Bill Murray again providing most of the highlights. Aykroyd, Ramis, Hudson, Potts, Weaver, Moranis...they're all back and their performances are fine. It's just a shame they didn't have a better story to work with. All the charm and originality of the first movie is missing in this paint-by-numbers sequel. After the success of the first movie a sequel was inevitable. Unfortunately as with most sequels a failure to live up to the original was inevitable too.",Ghostbusters II
79,vip_ebriega,Giving up the 'Ghost'.,7,8 July 2008,"My Take: Not as good as the first, and often repetitive, but still a fairly decent sequel with its share of laughs and good effects. After reaping a great deal of Box-office attention (and more than millions of bucks), the ghost-busting team of the original GHOSTBUSTERS are back, and while the product inevitably falls short of its predecessor, the result is still a charmer and has more than enough share of entertaining moments. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson are back as the Ghostbusters, who comes out from their retirement to face-off against another batch of supernatural spirits, an goo (a lot of goo). Sigourney Weaver, Rick Moranis and Annie Potts are back providing supporting roles. Director Ivan Reitman probably knew that this product of his has very little competition with its predecessor, of which it will fail in comparison, but he really deserves for dishing in a whole lot of new elements whilst sustaining the much used formula of the original. The film also seems to be a retread of the original film, but there's fun to be had about some enjoyable special effects. Better-than-average decent viewing.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",Ghostbusters II
80,one9eighty,5 years later,9,8 August 2017,"They're back!Ghostbusters 2 picks up five years after the first film and brings back a great cast to live out a fun and entertaining feature. Sidelined and forgotten by the city the Ghostbusters have to once again come together to fight the threat of Vigo the Carpathian (or to give him his full title; Vigo, the Scourge of Carpathia, the Sorrow of Moldovia, Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy), a powerful magician and tyrant from the seventeenth century who has survived by trapping his spirit in a painting, for ""Death is but a doorway, time is but a window"", and now he's back. Of course, while they are doing this they are fighting supernatural menaces around the city as well as a stigma imposed on them by the people and politicians of New York, a city in which it's every citizens god given right to be nasty to one and other.After the success of the first film this follow up is equally magnificent. Once again the cast and crew deliver a memorable performance weaving humour with scares and adventures. Let me be clear though, you don't have to have seen the first film to enjoy this sequel, it can stand on it's own two feet and it's still able to run with audiences to both entertain and delight. Some of the movie was shaped by the success of the first film and indeed the spin off's, for that reason some of the characters have developed like their cartoon and comic book avatars have and are less dusty than what was introduced in the first film. The effects are brilliant and aren't that out of place against modern films. The score is hip and cool, well placed for the time of the movie. If you liked the first film you'll enjoy this too. If you haven't seen the first film this is as worthy an introduction as the first film so don't worry. Sit back, relax, prepare for a fun adventure.",Ghostbusters II

And Dana has a job at the museum restoring classic works of art. Both Dana and Peter soon cross paths again, paranormal paths.Peter MacNichol costars, and uses an accent, you'd never know its the same guy from Ally McBeal. Rick Moranis also returns as Louis Tully, now an attorney defending the Ghostbusters. Towards the end of the film, in the dock harbor scene, you can spot Cheech Marin. He's the dock supervisor that sees the Titanic arrive in New York. The statue of Liberty also makes an appearance to help fight the evil.This film is a riot, and it's fun. It's up there on par with the original Ghostbusters. Aykroyd and Ramis pulled off a great feat, an excellent sequel.",Ghostbusters II
82,ivo-cobra8,A Good Solid underrated sequel!,9,25 December 2015,"Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take an underrated supernatural horror flick comedy from the 80's, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Ghostbusters II (1989) is very underrated and hated by so many people and fans of the original movie, including Billy Murray him self. After this movie was released Billy Murray was very disappointed and not happy how the movie turned out. I know this movie is not a comedy like was the first one, it was more dark than the first movie it was scary. Bill Murray had a terrible dialogue in here. Which I understand him, why he is upset over this movie and he said he will never make any Ghostbusters movie ever again. Anyway I enjoyed this movie and like it a lot. I still found some fun moments in it. I don't think it is that good as the original! The original will always kick-ass for me. Unfortunately I don't think, I still have the VHS tape anymore in my video collection. I still and lucky have the original flick on Blu-ray. This is the film that introduced me into becoming a fan of the Ghostbusters and the animated series The real Ghostbusters (1986). I am sorry about a lot of fans been upset and Billy Murray, but still I think he could have made a potential in the third sequel, that Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis come up with! R.I.P. Harold Ramis November 12th, 1944 - February 24, 2014. I respect the actor, he wanted to play one more time Egon Spengler, which I think my favorite character of all time.I was reading the reviews people had left and I think that this was a great movie. Not only did you have the same humor and elements from the first film, you had all the same actors reprise their role. I remember seeing some sequels where some of the good characters weren't back and it was not just as good. I thought the effects were more crisp than the first film as well and I remember this one seemed to creep me out when I was little (see Subway scene). Overall, an excellent film and I will always cherish my proton pack! I think this was more scary than the first one. I remember as a kid I could never get to sleep after watching it. I would always have nightmares of Vigo The Carpathian. I heard Murray crap on it as well which is a shame. This definitely holds up as a solid sequel the same way Wayne's World 2 did.Things I didn't like in this movie: I think the bigger problem with the movie is it's kinda a reboot/sequel. They have to get their business back, Peter is trying to get with Danna. I kinda wish they just kept them in business but half of what they make goes to paying off the damage they did at the end of the first one since they got sued. This movie shouldn't have been scary, a baby been kidnapped from the ghost. It should have been a comedy like was the first one, I do agree with Bill Murray about it. Because the first one was not a scary movie, it was funny too and it is my favorite all time flick ever! The movie also has parts that kinda leave you scratching my head saying, WTF were they thinking. The ""Ghostbusters"" are forgotten in this movie, the only, only person that does have a heart in this movie n my opinion is Billy Murray. In my opinion Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson did a wonderful job on acting and playing on their respectful characters. I didn't like that Ghostbusters where thrown in to nut house, Vigo throw the baby on the floor, Ray was possessed by Vigo, the bath tub wanted to eat Dana and Oscar. The movie has a plot holes a lot in and too much slimmer and does not make any sense. Sorry guys those are the problems I just don't like in it.Things I like: Rick Moranis as Louis Tully I think the actor did a great job, but his role was completely different from the first movie. In the original classic movie he was an accountant, but in this movie he is lawyer who on end of the film transformers him self in to a Ghostbuster and I love that he went there to help his friends to defeat the slime.The courtroom scene is awesome and The Statue of Liberty walking through New York to the tune of Jackie Wilson's Higher and Higher is undoubtedly one of the best scenes in the movie. Despite what people say, the gags in the 2nd film are aplenty. Sure, it wasn't big of a classic as the original film was, but it wasn't that bad! It was very different! It had a new villain that came from a painting, more screen time for Janice and Louis, more funny dialogue, good special effects and a great soundtrack. It was definitely better than it's reputation has gotten from the fans and critics. The movie is good on it is own, but does not beat the original film! 6 out of 10 for me.Ghostbusters II is a 1989 American supernatural horror comedy film, produced and directed by Ivan Reitman.

Equalling its predecessor in many ways, Ghostbusters 2 shows the alternate history of the team apart from the cartoon series. Everyone reprises their characters, especially the wildly enjoyable Annie Potts and are even joined by Peter MacNichol whose talent and brillance we all know now on ""Ally McBeal."" The plot is almost the same as a long dead forgotten madman and sorcerer from the time of Vlad the Impaler tries to come back in our modern age only to be defeated by the strength of good will (the Ghost of Christmas Present must have wrote the script). On a sidenote, there's gallons, and buckets, and rivers of ooze and better ghost effects than the first movie. My favorites are the phantom train and the Titanic.

84,russem31,Funny if not original,7,30 December 2005,"Ghostbusters II is a good sequel to the classic first film, however it's not as original. Again, Ivan Reitman successfully takes the helm with all of the main cast making a welcome return while adding a delightful new addition (Peter MacNicol as a funny Dr. Janosz Poha) and an interesting villain (Wilhelm von Homburg as Vigo living in a painting of all places!). However, this time around, the script isn't as original - because of this, every other element was bound to suffer since the script is the backbone of the film - this unfortunately includes the dialogue. Regardless, it's nice to see the Ghostbusters back on the silver screen. I really hope they make Ghostbusters III soon!",Ghostbusters II

However, they decide to investigate a weird occurrence surrounding a runaway baby carriage and find a huge river of slime (that reacts to human emotion!) underneath the city. Trouble really starts to brew when they suspect the spiritual return of an old medieval tyrant from Eastern Europe.The film is a lot like the first one so if you didn't like the original then you have absolutely nothing to see here. However if you DID like the first one this movie is worth checking out and it is one of the better sequels - it retreads of familiar territory but just differently enough to be enjoyed. However there is a surprising lack of ghost throughout. Though the special effects that are included are particularly amusing, especially in wide shots, where you can see that the industry was still in an era that is seemingly ages upon ages older then what is now. 7/10Rated PG: mild profanity and ghastly goings-on",Ghostbusters II

There is still the disbelieving mayor, the suit who wants the Ghostbusters discredited, and some bad quasi-rap songs. Despite this, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis are still quite good with Murray bringing most of the good one-liners. There is always room for Bill Murray. The best reason to give this one a look is Peter MacNicol, who comes in as one of those men with the indistinguishable accent. Says Murray, ""Hey Johnny, where do you come from?"" MacNicol replies, ""The upper west side."" While it may not be as cool as a rampaging marshmallow man, it's still a blast to see the Statue of Liberty walking the streets of New York to Jackie Wilson's ""Higher and Higher"".

In this film the Ghostbusters have all broken up and gone their separate ways. Dr. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) is a talk show host (that sounds just like what Peter would do.) Dr. Ray Stantz (Dan Akroyd) and Dr. Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) preform at children's birthday parties. And Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) is still a scientist. But Peter, Ray, Winston, and Egon are called back into action when a river of ooze that feeds on people's negative emotions starts to negatively affect people in New York, New York. The same kinds of jokes are used here as they were in the first one, but not done as well. But to be fair, how could they have? The jokes here are still good.

The first act was really promising. It had a couple of funny spooky moments, some hilarious gags, and the cast seemed to be even more charming and energetic than it was in the original. Also, the premise is quite good (and served the humor quite a lot); but the execution is rather embarrassingly messy and nonsensical, and the laughable, scrappy third act is a case in point.

I certainly enjoyed it. Both were different movies too.The story was very interesting. It looked serious, and at the same time, funny. If I were to watch Ghostbusters again, I would watch both the movies together.The amazing thing about Ghostbusters is just how classical it is - truly eighties stuff.I like the catchphrase: ""Who you gonna call?"", that's one of the first things that will come to mind whenever we hear of the Ghostbusters.

100,harryplinkett14,Meh,5,13 January 2014,"Perhaps too many things inexplicably turned out so great in the first film that hoping to generate the same emotion next time around was unrealistic.But I do think that the script needed a re-write.This is no 'three men and a baby'. This is Ghostbusters. The last person to be a father is Venkman. And no, I don't think that the humour resulting from his inability to cope with marriage is a good premise for the film.Thus the whole thing started badly. Lucky for us they were not afraid to repeat some of the stuff from the first plot regarding the ghosts themselves, although the whole idea of being able to give slime both a positive and a negative polarity only confused me and was never really explained.Anyway, the bad guy is pretty cool. Too bad he is not made more prominent and that so much time is wasted on Venkman's crumbling relationship with Dana. Also, there is a problem with the pacing. While Ghostbusters had a wonderful, natural flow, Ghostbusters II is disjointed and comes across as a series of episodes - some funny, some not so funny. The climax is no match for the climax of the first film and the whole thing ends too quickly and through some lazy writing - or perhaps the problem was a limited budget.In any event, I can't shake the feeling that this was more of an attempt to make some more money than to amaze and please the audience.

There are also some terrible aspects of this film - great shots of New York City in the 1980's ruined with cheesy effects, awful music, terrible jokes and inconsistent directing. However, when you consider the pressure of being the sequel to 'Ghostbusters' (1984), as well as how many hands were involved in the process, then I guess this is a pretty good movie. Too many writers, being too good of friends with the director, having too long to mull over a 90 minute script (nearly 5 years) will always lead to a film that tries to do too much and lacks a clear tone.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Of course, it's not long before evil spirits pop up again in Manhattan and they're back doing what they do best.  What makes this one work as well as the first is the relationship between the main characters.

103,DavidSim240183,Here we go again!,5,14 June 2007,"Ghostbusters is a comedy that has worked its way into the hearts and minds of people the world over. And its not hard to understand why. It had a fantastic idea. And matched it with the perfect cast to turn the No 1 box-office hit of 1984 into an enduring classic.Then five years later, the cast and production team returned for this sequel. But unfortunately, as is often the case of sequels, they seldom live up to their predecessors. Ghostbusters II is lacking in the energy and drive that propelled the original, something that reflected the box-office takings. Part 2 seriously underperformed compared to Part 1. They just couldn't repeat the same magic twice.All the cast are back, and Ivan Reitman is again directing, but there's nothing terribly original about this film. Its just a retread of the first, with only a few novelties thrown in for good measure.There is a bit of poignancy in the early scenes. Time has not been kind to the Ghostbusters. Because there is no Ghostbusters anymore. When they saved the world from the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man (the only one who doesn't return for Part 2), they also put themselves out of business.Venkman (Bill Murray) now hosts a psychic cable show for fraudsters. He knows he's a fraud, but at least he's honest about it! Ray and Winston (Dan Aykroyd & Ernie Hudson) are reduced to making appearances at kiddie birthday parties. And Egon (Harold Ramis) has gone back to standard scientific research.But trouble is brewing on the horizon. And again its Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) who brings the team into action. Dana now works at an art gallery, and one of the paintings she's restoring is possessed by the spirit of an evil dictator, Vigo. Vigo wants to return to the physical world, but he needs to possess a child to do it. And he's chosen Dana's baby boy, Oscar.Add to that a river of slime running beneath the streets of New York that feeds off the bad vibes of the people above, and we have another apocalypse on our hands.Its a bit hard to pinpoint why Ghostbusters II disappoints as much as it does. There's just no life to it. Its all perfectly watchable but it never raises anything more than chuckles while Part 1 induced aching sides. The cast are all present and correct, but even they go through the motions.You can tell Bill Murray is coasting his way through the part. Something that's not a pretty sight to see. When Murray is engaged and attuned to material, he can turn in a fantastic performance. But when the material doesn't interest him, his laid-back nonchalance turns sluggish. Something that seriously undermines the film as a whole. Films like the horrendous Scrooged and the utterly tedious The Life Aquatic.Ernie Hudson is once again moved to the sidelines, but at least Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are given a bit more to do this time. The one thing in the film's favour. The only complaint I had with Ghostbusters was that all the best lines were given to Murray. And Aykroyd and Ramis were a little upstaged. But they're given quite a few witty one-liners here. And Egon is especially funny, who gets some cracking wry observations:""Well Peter was borderline for a while...then he crossed the border.""Its nice to see Sigourney Weaver back, but she isn't given much of a chance to shine. She's just reduced to playing the cuddly working mum. And the film could have done without Rick Moranis. He overplays the Woody Allen shtick to the point I wanted to strangle him.And we get a really grating performance from Peter MacNicol as a foreign curator who works at the gallery and gets possessed by Vigo. Shame because MacNicol is usually capable of great things. Just watch any episode of Ally McBeal. But here he's wasted in a part that's beneath him. And that scene where he runs through the night-sky with a pram is just plain silly. The film's best scene is when the Ghostbusters end up in court for blacking out the whole city through illegal drilling (which is a bit preposterous). Its the one scene in the whole film where it manages to recapture the spirit of the original. Everyone is given plenty to do. Quips rebound back and forth like a tennis match. An hilarious turn from Harris Yulin as a fire and brimstone judge. And it all culminates in a dazzling showcase of special effects work when two ghosts from the judge's past return to seek revenge. Classic!But elsewhere the film is thoroughly routine. The effects work is just as good as you'd expect. But the big climax with the Statue of Liberty walking through the streets of Manhattan, an obvious attempt to rehash Mr Stay Puft is not nearly as thrilling as it should have been. And I never once believed it was a statue come to life. Just somebody dressed up to look like it.Ghostbusters II has its moments, but it moves in fits and starts. The two story lines of the painting and the slime never converge. Something it tries to achieve but never quite manages. And Oscar is a McGuffin purely designed to move the plot along. Nice gag at the end with the new and improved painting, but overall Ivan Reitman fails to deliver. Something that would become a depressing habit with him.",Ghostbusters II
104,joelwatchesmovies,A mostly enjoyable sequel,7,23 January 2020,"The fall from grace and quick rise back to it feels as contrived as it did in the first movie, but the pink slime plot following this is quite enjoyable in its investigation/teamwork angle (the 'busters are always better together) and ""positive emotion"" climax. Venkman still slips in some misogyny here and there but it's mostly overshadowed by the film's good smattering of quirky comedy elsewhere (Louis' opening statement was a riot: ""Because one time, I turned into a dog and they helped me"").

106,charchuk,Not as good as the first,6,7 May 2007,"Not nearly as good as the first; it's not as funny or as spectacular, and it becomes quite silly at times. The cast is still trying as hard, and there are no weak performances (save for maybe Peter MacNicol with a terrible accent) but the script falters a bit and the visuals aren't a marked improvement over the first. I did like the ending montage with the Titanic arriving and such, but much of the movie is just a copy of the first, right down to the monstrous figure walking through New York at the end. Though the image of the Statue of Liberty walking is pretty cool. It is pretty funny at time, too, and Bill Murray is as good as ever, but it really just suffers from being a lesser sequel.",Ghostbusters II
107,kdnor2011,Good movie,7,12 May 2010,"OK, obviously this sequel isn't as good as the original, but what could possobly live up to that hype. Ghostbusters 2 is still a good movie, even if the first is better. The comedy and horror are still really good. Some of the scariest scenes include the abduction of Oscar, and the scene in the tunnel. What really makes this film good is that it isn't trying to be the exact same film as the first, it expands the ghostbusters world. Plus, most of the actors came back to reprise their roles. Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Harold Ramis, Dan Akroyd, Sigorny Weaver, Rick Morannis, and Annie Potts. It isn't the best sequel of all time, but it certainly isn't the worst. If you haven't seen this because you heard it was inferior I still say it's worth a watch.",Ghostbusters II
108,jcbutthead86,"An Excellent,Underrated Sequel.",10,22 January 2013,"Ghostbusters II is an excellent,underrated sequel that once again that combines great laughs,supernatural thrills,wonderful special effects and well-written dialog. And while it is not as great as the original,Ghostbusters II is a great sequel that I think that has been overlooked and underrated for so long and if you're a fan of the first film you'll love this one.Set five years after the first film,Ghostbusters II tells the story about the Ghostbusters despite saving New York city in the first film have been put out of business. But now with Dana Barrett(Sigourney Weaver) in trouble with ghosts again,the Ghostbusters have to revive their business to not only deal with Ghosts,but a new villain named Vigo(Wilhelm Von Homburg,voiced by Max Von Sydow)and a pink mood slime that feeds on negative energy of the city and the Ghostbusters are the only ones to do something about it and when there's something strange in the neighborhood who you're gonna call? I honestly don't know or have any idea why GBII has a mixed reception with most Ghostbusters fans and film critics,although the film made money at the Box Office some fans and critics felt GBII didn't live up to the first film but I have always loved this movie and I think it's very underrated. The reasons why I love GBII and why it works is because it's a great sequel,the characters,the screenplay and the special effects. Doing a sequel can be a tricky thing especially when you do a sequel to a beloved classic like Ghostbusters,but director Ivan Reitman and co-writers/co-stars Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis and Bill Murray manage to pull off a great sequel that I don't think was trying to top the first film,but do a sequel with things that made the first film work. Like the first film,this film greatly balances Comedy and Supernatural terror with laughs that are funny either because of the characters or the situations the characters go through or the dialog. When the supernatural element of the film comes into play the tone and eerie atmosphere of GBII is scary and is up there with the first in terms of matching the spookiness and creepiness and will have images that will frighten you and also make you laugh your head off. I guess with moviegoers a sequel is going to be good or bad,the sequel is going to be like the first film or different from the first film,it's a damned if do,damned if you don't situation and some have said that GBII is a rehash of the first film I can say yes and no to that argument. Yes because GBII has the same characters and a few scenes similar to the first and no because of the story involving pink mood slime and people's negative emotions making the slime is very creative and the villain Vigo is a great antagonist for the Ghostbusters and compared with most sequels that have came out since GBII in which some are done for a quick cash grab at the Box Office,this sequel is pretty creative and done with heart and great imagination. The main characters in GBII Peter,Ray,Egon and Winston like the first film are likable and funny showing the Ghostbusters and how they've dealt with being out of work and of business and how they make a comeback and are accepted again by the city after five years almost like nothing had ever happened in the first film. The screenplay written once again by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis is well-written and funny with great scenes and dialog and creative moments and while the lines,quotes and dialog in this film isn't as memorable or classic like the first(the dialog lacks the grown up edge of the first and was toned down because of the kids and the popularity of the cartoon The Real Ghostbusters),GBII still has a solid screenplay. The Action scenes in the film are great and thrilling mixing suspense and great laughs that will have viewers smiling The special effects in the film are outstanding and wonderful and still hold up to this very day,whether it's the creepy ghosts,the proton packs or the pink mood slime. Every big budget blockbuster seems to always have that real big effects shot where the filmmakers put all of their money into the big effects shot and like the first GB,the big shot at the end of this film is big and not only is it big,it's awe-inspiring,jaw-dropping and unforgettable.The cast does a great job. Bill Murray(Peter),Dan Aykroyd(Ray),Harold Ramis(Egon)and Ernie Hudson(Winston)are excellent and hilarious once again as The Ghostbusters. Sigourney Weaver is wonderful as Dana,Peter's love interest and Weaver has a great chemistry with Murray. Rick Moranis is hilarious as Louis who is now the Ghostbusters lawyer and accountant. Annie Potts fantastic once again as Janine,the Ghostbusters secretary and has great scenes with Moranis. Wilhelm Von Homburg is creepy as Vigo,a guy who wants to rule the world. Peter MacNicol is delightfully fun and over the top as Janosz,a painter who helps Vigo. Harris Yulin(Judge ""The Hammer"" Wexler),David Margulies(Mayor Lenny),Kurt Fuller(Jack)and Janet Margolin(The Prosecutor) give fun performances as well.The direction by Ivan Reitman is excellent,brining a lot of energy and style to the film and does a wonderful job mixing Comedy and the Supernatural. Great direction,Ivan.The score by Randy Edelman is wonderful,light,effective and at times eerie and fits with the film's tone. Great score. The soundtrack also has great songs mostly Hip-Hop tracks by Run-Dmc(Ghostbusters)Bobby Brown(On Our Own and We're Back Bobby Brown also makes a cameo in the film),Doug E.Fresh and The Great Fresh Crew(Spirit),Glenn Frey(Flip City),a wonderful return of the original Ghostbusters theme by Ray Parker Jr and a great use of the classic Higher and Higher by Jackie Wilson. Great soundtrack.In final word,if you're a fan of the first Ghostbusters,you'll love Ghostbusters II,an excellent,underrated sequel that deserves a more fans and a second chance. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Ghostbusters II
109,x_manicure_x,Possibly worse than the original,4,14 August 2021,"Most of what happens here clearly doesn't make any sense, but it's almost as entertaining as the first film. It felt like they tried to make it more similar to the cartoon that came out in between, with the jokes being a bit more childish and Slimer popping out here and there. The biggest issue is that the plot is carbon copy: one dangerous entity from an exotic country gets to Sigourney Weaver by possessing a nerd who is obsessed with her, the Ghostbusters are the only ones who can save the day, but there is a mandatory guy from the government whose only goal in life is to stand in their way. Also, no-one seems to believe them despite all that happened five years earlier. It was hard to top the giant marshmallow man wandering the streets of New York, but the Statue of Liberty does a pretty impressive job as a Megazord.",Ghostbusters II

111,Stompgal_87,A slight improvement over the original,8,8 June 2014,"I rented out the first film a month ago and I found it above average but it had great music and special effects. I decided to give the sequel a chance and while I found it marginally better than the original, there were one or two weaknesses such as the rap song that sounded like a rehash of Ray Parker Jr's 'Ghostbusters' and the proton streams and Dana's television looking outdated for 1989.Despite these flaws, the special effects of the ghosts were very well done and the dialogue was somewhat funnier than that in the original. Standout moments include the Ghostbusters having moved on to different career paths at the beginning, the opening of pink slime oozing out of a crack in the road, a nanny ghost swiping Oscar from Dana and the climax of the Statue of Liberety stomping around New York City with the Ghostbusters sitting inside her crown. Other advantages are the original main cast returning, references to the first film, the music score sounding pleasant to begin with then becoming tense and powerful during scary moments, Rick Moranis's acting being more subtle than his over- acting in the original, the change in Dana becoming a mother and the use of Ray Parker Jr's signature song being better than the rap rehash of it. Overall this is the first sequel that is an improvement over the original since 'Toy Story 3' and it is funnier and more evenly-paced than the original as well. 8/10.",Ghostbusters II
112,stormhawk2021,Great second part,8,4 August 2017,"It's pretty tough for a sequel to best, let alone match it's predecessor, especially when the first one is an undisputed masterpiece. So yeah, Ghostbusters II isn't as good as the first, but it's not a bad film by any means. Unfortunately most people don't see it that way. Me, I really like this one, and think it's still a really decent film, even though it isn't what it could have been. The story begins five years after the first. Following the defeat of Gozer at the end of the first film, the Ghostbusters have actually fallen on hard times. Instead of being hailed as saviors, they have since been slapped with a restraining order and forced to cease their ghostbusting due to all the collateral damage their 'busting' causes. As a result, the four have hung up their proton packs and gone on to other activities. However, they are forced to get back to it when an evil ooze begins wreaking havoc, especially when it possesses a painting of an evil 16th Century Carpathian tyrant named Vigo, causing him to come to life to terrorize all who end up in his way. I think the main issue at hand here is sequelitis. It's just unable to capture the magic that made the first so special. It doesn't have the freshness, nor does it have the same level of laughs, wit, and energy. Ivan Reitman returned as director, and co-stars Aykroyd and Ramis once again wrote the script, and, while they don't do bad in these roles, their performances don't really stand out. I do however, like that they raised the stakes, and showed how actions have consequences. I just wish they could have come up with some more creative and stronger ideas. The music is still good though, and I still dig the effects, and yeah, the performances are fine, if slightly worn, but, even though this one has it's moments, it doesn't have near as much heart as it should. I'm still giving this one a really high rating though, as I'm a big fan, I like these guys and what they do, and it's still a fun and entertaining film. Yeah, some of it is a bit sillier, but I can't help but like it. Without a doubt, my main reason for really liking this is personal. Sentimentality is key here, as the earliest memory that I can recall is seeing this in the theater when I was a mere three years old. I can only recall one scene clearly, but still, it's a memory I want to cherish as long as possible. Bottom line: yeah, this is a step down, but it's still a pretty decent film, and offers a fair amount of entertainment, and, compared to a lot of sequels, it's quite strong, so give it a chance.",Ghostbusters II

The whole movie is wonderful. the acting is great again and the ghostbusters are back.  Sigourney Weaver is back too and now she has a baby Oscar, who is being an interest found by a painting.  Sure it sounds weird bu it makes sense when you watch it.  They do have a question I must ask.  How can the Statue of Liberty turn her head when shes made of stone?  I know it's supposed to happen but every time I watch this movie I wonder about that.  Rick Moranis and Annie Potts are back and in love.  They're love interests were amusing.  The strange green ghost that eats food is back, too.  I forgot it's name but I don't know why it's still here.  The plot is simple enough.

117,Gideon24,"As Sequels Go, I've seen a lot worse",6,9 December 2015,"Ghostbusters II is the surprisingly effective 1989 sequel to the 1984 box office smash which actually meets most of my criteria for a good sequel (see my review of The Dark Knight Rises) despite a few unexplained plot holes that gnawed at me throughout, but did not interfere with the entertainment the film undeniably provides.I love that the film addresses the fact that even though our boys were heroes at the end of the first film, the realities of the damage they did to Manhattan are dealt with. The damage they did to the city resulted in several lawsuits and the eventual disbanding of the ghostbusters. However, the boys are forced to rally when a 15th century demon named Vigo has targeted Dana Barrett's baby.Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis have constructed a viable screenplay which borrows a lot from the first film, but doesn't really rehash and, with the help of Bill Murray's loopy charm as Peter Venkman, make the film feel like a vacation to your hometown where you're catching up with old friends.Sigourney Weaver is again an intelligent damsel in distress and Rick Moranis and Annie Potts provide some giggles as they reprise their roles as Louis and Janine. Also enjoyed David Margulies' return as the mayor, Kurt Fuller as his slimy assistant, and Harris Yulin as a judge with a very short fuse.Though the film provides laughs and the same first rate special effects the first film did, I found it hard to get behind the film because the whole idea of a baby in danger was very unsettling for me and made it hard to fully commit to what happens here. And even though it might be considered nitpicking, I couldn't get past the fact that the Ghostbusters vehicle had the logo for the second film painted on the side and the film does have more endings than necessary, but it is a fairly entertaining ride and as far as sequels go, I've seen a lot worse. I've heard rumblings that plans are in the work to revive this franchise, but without the late Harold Ramis, that would just be wrong.",Ghostbusters II

Its not until the Ghostbusters are arrested yet again for disturbing the peace that the fun really begins.  There are parts of this film that are really good, and the special effects have improved from the first one but the story just isnt really there.  There are some impressive scenes involving the slime, and the comic timing of the main actors is spot on, but it seems that some cast members seem to hog the screen time, while others most notably Ernie Hudson dont actually get much screen time at all. I was a bit disappointed as with a five year gap between parts 1 and part2 they were not really rushed for time, but it looks like they came up with the script in around five minutes.  I guess I was expecting something more. Its still worth a look though- if you liked the first one.",Ghostbusters II

Bill Murray looks bored and asleep throughout the whole movie. The romantic scenes are obnoxious as well as Bill Murrays scenes with the baby. The effects are at least better in the original al though that sucks too.A sequel clearly made only for the money.And now Hollywood dishes out a remake. With an all female cast.

120,LuboLarsson,Way better than most sequels,7,7 January 2004,"Ghostbusters II is a worthy follow up to the 1984 original. Strangely it didn't exactly set the world alight when it was released in 1989. Why? I don't know, it certainly isn't because its a bad film because it's great. All of the top names from the original came back for this one even Sigourney Weaver. It's very nearly every bit as good as the first and much, much better than most sequels can claim to be. Bill Murray is again hilarious in this one and you might have to watch the film more than once to catch all his funny lines. Dan Ackroyd is great as is Harold Ramis who spends more time behind the camera these days. Also Ernie Hudson returns so why isn't he on the cover of the DVD with the rest of the guys? Shame on you Columbia Pictures. Rick Moranis is very funny in this, but to be honest the only time I've liked him in any films it has been in the two Ghostbusters films in anything else I've found him unfunny and annoying. The film has quite a good message too about the need for more love and friendship between people and less hatred, no really it does! I would loved to have seen a Ghostbusters III but I think that would have happened by now, I can't see there being another in 2004 with the original gang, and if it wasn't with Murray, Ackroyd, Ramis, Hudson etc I wouldn't want to see it.

122,caseynicholson,A Great (But Cheesy) 80's Sequel,8,2 August 2016,"I rated the original Ghostbusters a perfect 10/10 stars, as I find it to be a near perfect comedy. Today I watched ""Ghostbusters II"" for the first time since I was a kid, and I found it to have held up very well.This movie is not quite as good as the original, but it's still quite good. So much so that I've gone with 8 stars rather than 7, even though 8-10 tends to be my rating for superb movies. This sequel is cheesy in a way that the original is not, but it's still very good. Both are slapstick comedy, and both have a vibe that appeals to kids and adults. Still, the sequel is just a smidge bit off compared to the masterpiece that began the franchise.One thing that adds to the cheesy factor is the poor soundtrack used. Whereas the first movie played well off the strength of Ray Parker Jr.'s ""Ghostbusters"" single, this film has some lesser known tracks that just don't have the same appeal as that hit. As for the script and the plot, it's really not bad at all. Very good, in fact. But the climax of the movie is a bit anti-climactic, and there's a scene in the midst of the film that's supposed to be a fight scene between two protagonists that isn't much of a fight at all (they supposedly were trying to ""kill each other"").All in all, this is a very good film.

126,mbhgkmsgg,Ghostbusters II,6,3 December 2020,"I really wanted to like this.
Ghostbusters II tries incredibly hard to outdo its predecessor. Unfortunately, the resulting product is inferior in every way. If this film was standalone, then maybe, just maybe, it might be great. But when you compare it to the brilliance that is the first Ghostbusters, it pales in comparison.The biggest problem, by far, with Ghostbusters II is that it feels like a caricature of the first one. For some reason, everything just feels wrong. The character of Venkman is the best example of this. Especially early on, the character feels nothing like the Venkman we know and love in the first film. The comedy feels forced and quite often misses the mark. But it isn't just Venkman that feels off. The story is also quite ridiculous at times, and not the good ridiculous that the first one was. There are a lot of things in this that feel like they were forced in just for some fan service. And although I like fanservice as much as the next guy, if it serves no purpose, it's better left out.While this film has a lot of problems of its own, it also struggles because it will always be compared to a far superior prequel. If this was the only Ghostbusters film to exist, I'm certain that people would like it more, myself included. However, as it stands, Ghostbuster II will never be seen in the same light as the first one. And rightfully so. Everything it does, it does worse. It never manages to feel as fun and joyful as the first one, and those two things really carry that film.However, with all that being said, Ghostbusters II is by no means terrible. It's surprisingly good for an 80s sequel. While it doesn't quite reach the heights of the first one, it still does a lot of things right. It can be tremendously funny at times, and it is rather entertaining. Sure, the characters can feel a little funky sometimes, but most of the time they are the wonderful ghostbusting fellows that we've learned to know. Trying to fill the boots of an icon like its older brother, is practically an impossible task. This film courageously attempts it and does surprisingly well.I really wish that I had liked Ghostbusters II more than I did. It sets out to entertain, and it manages to do so. It's by no means a bad film. In reality, it's probably much better than I think. I just can't enjoy it as much as I should since I'm constantly comparing it to the first one. Here's to hoping that the upcoming film will be at least as good as this one.",Ghostbusters II

128,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 87,9,21 February 2016,"Before about 15 years ago, it was hard to accept any sequel as serious--give or take a select few. And I'm sure there were many who didn't take the Ghostbusters sequel too seriously either. But who could blame them back in 1989.Sure it has its issues. The villain's modus operandi has devastating effects, but his method of using a baby's body as a vessel to come back from the dead is played off as silly. Although it doesn't intend to be, it can't help it. The levity of the film is that strong. In this one, all the guys are back and they have to stop the evil Vigo the Carpathian--who is trapped in a painting--from coming back from the dead and ruling the earth. Weird things start happening all over town, as the ghostbusters discover that all of New York City's negative energy has been compiled into slime in the sewer system and is acting as a portal to bring back evil spirits.It isn't easy for them, as they are faced with adversity that doesn't make much sense. They go from being the popular saviors of the city, to all of a sudden no one believing in ghosts anymore.Ultimately, the film lacks any real depth. Character issues are heavily introduced but never resolved in the end. It gets a little lost in that department, sure.But there is a charm that carries over from the original. In fact, I find this one just as funny. The talents are far better utilized here, other than Bill Murray, who is just as good as he is in the last. Peter MacNicol is an especially great addition as the oft-confused foreigner, Dr. Janosz Poha, who curates the art museum where the evil painting is being kept.The first Ghostbusters movie is fantastic. It's legendary. But it shows its age quite a bit. Ghostbusters II may not be as iconic, but it holds up a little better. And although we don't feel as threatened by our villain, the threat is still very much there.Twizard Rating: 87",Ghostbusters II

Like the first Ghost-busters, Ghost-Busters 2 made very little impression on me. It was more just there. Although, I did think that the first film was better than this one. The first Ghost-Busters was definitely funnier. Although that's not saying much as neither film really had me in hysterics. I more just chuckled here and there. One thing I did like about Ghost-Busters 2 though was the villain. I liked how rather than a demonic God, the villain was the spirit of a malevolent human being. It seemed a lot more threatening in that sense. This was something that I thought was better about this film.Read my review for more: http://goo.gl/2tBPQt",Ghostbusters II
135,winopaul,"A kids film, and an art film",8,23 November 2016,"When the librarians put this out on the end-cap, I thought it was the 2016 remake. Now I know, this is the sequel, not the all-gyrlll-power remake. I wanted to see the remake to find out if it was pretty good and it was fan-boy misogyny that made it a flop. That is a task for another day, but watching this movie, and reading about it here will help me understand the remake and it flopping.Now that I understand there was an animated series, and that burned in certain expectations into not fan-boys, but kids, well that might explain the vehemence towards the all-girl cast. When something is burned into your brain as a kid, its like a religion, and I can see them being really upset with the remake, they consider it blasphemous. I guess the remake could be done with the original actors, but they are both long in the tooth and expensive. I would have had the original cast have kids, and turn the business over to them, for the good of humanity. If Melissa McCarthy is as profane in the remake as in most of her films, I can see that as another betrayal. The original was a cute movie made into a kid's franchise, and then they do the four-letter-word treatment. They deserved to flop if that is the case.The one thing I don't understand here is the slighting of the black character. He was not an any Act 1 scenes, and then, poof, he is dressed up and running around Manhattan. Talk about prestidigitation. Maybe he held out for too much money (called ""gettin' uppity"" by Hollywood producers) and finally made a deal and joined the cast halfway through principle photography.This is a simple good movie. I barely remember the original, but I like this one. It was playful and aimed to kids. It did not try to slip in all kinds of innuendo and double entendre to keep mommy and daddy amused. Instead it had some art film elements, like New York being a hell hole, The statue of liberty being a beacon of hope, and yeah, love cures all. Very childish, almost infantile. I loved it.Despite the movie Trainwreck, most movies that break even are pretty good. This one was $37 million in, $215 million out, worldwide. When you look at inflation-adjusted box office, the original was $586 million domestic, this one was $244 million domestic, and the 2016 gyrll-power remake was $130 million.

137,Blazehgehg,Falls short of the greatness the first movie achieved,7,22 January 2006,"Ghostbusters 2 ends up being another one of those movies that I enjoyed watching as a kid, but nowadays I'm smart enough to see what's wrong with it - just like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2.The main problem with Ghostbusters 2 simply is the fact there's not enough meat to it. The action is great - the special effects still hold up today, mostly. But where the movie really starts to stumble is the comedy. Now, I've mentioned in a previously that, as a kid, I never really envisioned Ghostbusters as strictly a comedy per-say, and it really bugged me watching the original on DVD because they treated it like it was another Caddyshack, you know? Nothing wrong with Caddyshack, but I don't picture Ghostbusters as a Caddyshack-esquire movie. Ghostbusters 2 really forces the comedy in this regard; it feels bland, rushed, and just lame. While as a kid I might've found Bill Murray screaming at a painting amusing, as a man of 22, I can only wince in pain. It's no wonder Murray was the biggest roadblock in getting Ghostbusters 3 off the ground; Ghostbusters 2 must've embarrassed the hell out of him. It embarrasses me just to watch him. And when the movie runs out of ghost-busting action and Luke-warm comedy, it does what every lame sequel does: It re-treads content from the first movie with a slight twist. Taking the role of our Hardened Skeptic in the first movie was Walter Peck, who eventually had the Ghostbusters arrested. Ghostbusters 2 replaces him with a new character who is pretty much the exact same person, except now he's the Mayor's Aide, and he has the Ghostbusters acquitted. These scenes play out pretty much exactly as they did in the first Ghostbusters, but with the aforementioned Luke-warm comedy replacing Murray's sharp wit.Although the edge on the knife has become dull, Ghostbusters 2 still did manage to be a pretty okay movie though. There are times when it hits that mixture that made the first movie a success. The movie is very watchable, but get ready for a few painful moments.",Ghostbusters II
138,kira02bit,"Pleasant, but disappointing sequel",5,22 July 2016,"After the mammoth success of the original Ghostbusters, it was a foregone conclusion that a sequel would be in the works. It apparently took five long years to reunite the original cast/crew. Unfortunately, the results are a real mixed bag.As the film opens, we discover that the Ghostbusters have apparently gone bankrupt and disbanded thanks to various lawsuits and derision from the events in the original. Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson have been reduced to making appearances at obnoxious children's parties; Harold Ramis is doing psychological research; and Bill Murray is the host of a bizarre TV show. When former client Sigourney Weaver becomes frantic that paranormal forces have targeted her toddler son and the guys discover a river of slime building below Manhattan, they reunite to once again avert disaster.Given that this crew had five years to come up with a script and funny material, one can be forgiven for being a bit bereft as to what appears on screen. The comedy is oddly mannered and toothless, and the visual effects are more ho-hum than dazzling. The entire tone of the film seems more like reuniting with a bunch of beloved old friends you have not seen for years and then having the entire reunion coast solely on nostalgia, sentiment and feelings from the past. There are no hilarious moments here and every time the film seems on the verge of letting loose...it doesn't. There is too much time devoted to people fretting over the toddler. I never thought I would see Murray playing unfunny mannered bits opposite an infant. The toddler is apparently being targeted as the vessel to be possessed by Vigo the Carpathian, currently inhabiting a painting at the museum at which Weaver works. All of this has something to do with a river of slime, but the script never really hooks up how or why.The film mistakenly thinks that based on Murray's classic line ""He slimed me!"" that the slime itself is some fascinating aspect in Ghostbusters lore that can hold its own plot. It doesn't. The whole ""mood slime"" nonsense culminating in a let-down touchy-feely climax feels really pointless.What does work is the congenial cast. They seem pleased to be back together again and it shows and, sometimes, it is infectious. Murray again gets the bulk of the screen time/material and once again Aykroyd, Ramis and Hudson have little to do. Nevertheless, it is still fun to see them back on screen. Weaver has a lot more to do this time around and once again reminds us of what a swanky comic foil she is paired opposite Murray. In a better film, they could really make some magic. Annie Potts returns as the receptionist, garbed in manic outfits and missing her acerbic attitude. The film also mothballs the flirtation she had with Ramis in the original in order to bolster a half-hearted romance with Rick Moranis, now the GBs tax consultant and in a role that feels shoe-horned in here simply because he was in the original cast. The one casting aspect that does not work is newcomer to the films Peter MacNicol as a Eurotrash art restorer with designs on Weaver, who becomes a sort of Renfield to the villainous Vigo. Between his overdone accent and manic gestures, he will really aggravate your nerves quickly.For a Ghostbusters film, there are surprisingly few ghosts (what little there are mostly show up briefly and to minimal fanfare near the end). The brief appearance of Slimer comes out of no where and like too much in this film feels disappointingly pointless. The conclusion is equally a let down. Reitman and company try to offer a half-hearted homage to the original with the ""mood slime"" and Jackie Wilson music somehow making the Statue of Liberty come to life and the GBs riding her to the rescue in Manhattan. Alas, the effects are so bad that sometimes Ms. Liberty looks huge and sometimes she appears 6-feet tall.The script still seems in the planning mode. The story never links up the slime and Vigo in any conceivable way. Nor does it explain why Vigo must have Weaver's toddler to possess when ostensibly any toddler in NYC would do the trick. Plus it is hard to believe that these guys who saved the world so publicly in the original would have not gotten any credit for it - actually it is a bit depressing. What we do have is an ace cast who seem happy to be back together on screen providing some pleasant, if underwhelming, diversion. We do not have a classic though and we do have the strange sensation that if the screenplay were substantially better, this cast would have hit it out of the ballpark.",Ghostbusters II
139,LagerLagerLagerShouting,Deja-Vu,6,1 May 2008,"Although not in the same league, story and originality wise as the original, Ghostbusters 2 is still an entertaining enough sequel. The problem is though all the characters remain firmly as they were in the first film and the narrative seems to be recycling the original, so the sense of conflict is pretty underwhelming and your left with the feeling of deja-vu. Despite this and beyond the predictable melodrama, the film is creative in both incident and dialogue and although it does scrape the barrel for humour sometimes and Bill Murrey, as before, is given all the best lines, the special effects come through in the end and with what better way to top a giant Marshmellow Man than with a walking Statue of Liberty! 6/10",Ghostbusters II

So she turns to Vankman (Bill Murray), Spengler (Harold Ramis), Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), and Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson) for help. When they discover that there is a river of pink slime under third avenue, they are arrested and are taken to court. In court, they find out that this slime is apparently mood related. If you are mad, the slime will get that way too. So they end up meeting the Scolarie brothers, who were given the chair when they were in prison, and so the Ghostbusters strap on the packs, and nuke the ghosts. This ends up getting them their jobs back as Ghostbusters and it puts them at the top. But all is good for a while, until the slime catches up to Dana and Oscar. The Ghostbusters then find out that the slime is related to the main ghost on their list, a 16th century magician known as Vigo the Carpatian (Wilhelm von Homburg), and that he needs an infant body so he can come back and rule earth.I wanna save the rest for a suprise because there is so much more to tell.Produced and directed by Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters, Stripes, Evolution), and co-produced by Joe Medjuck (Road Trip) and Bernie Brillstein (Ghostbusters), Ghostbusters II is a movie for all ages and I highly recommend it to any family who is looking for a good comedy to watch together.",Ghostbusters II

Also the thought that it wasn't as good as Ghostbusters but what movie could be better than Ghostbusters. I liked it. Some people passed it up to go see Batman; that huge movie during the huge summer of 1989.

It seems to be trying twice as hard, yet it succeeds only half as well. The first movie had a sort of easy rhythm to it, while the sequel feels forced. Part of the problem may be the fact that, like so many sequels, it ignores the ending of the first film and simply goes back to where it all began. None of the characters have grown or changed; nothing in the story has developed at all. Once again, just like in the first movie, the Ghost Busters are jokes to the rest of the city, and have to prove their worth both to themselves and the world at large, and of course they do, and everybody cheers them at the end. Once again, just like in the first movie, Bill Murray has to surmount the odds to win the love of Sigourney Weaver.

It's like watching a beloved set of characters from a terrific movie and watching the actors prostitute themselves with ridiculous plotlines, horrible special effects (even for 1989), and just plain lazy writing (and acting) thrown in to try to resemble a finished movie. This was only ""Ghostbusters"" in casting alone. The entire premise is a toned-down and incredibly unfunny remake of the original and repackaged as a sequel. The closest analogy I can come up with is like taking the most incredible, original, sharply-designed roll of toilet paper, then taking the end of it and flushing it down the toilet and watching all the energy, humor and genuine originality being sucked in and be destroyed down the sewer until it is a pile of garbage and completely unrecognizable at the end.

147,brownish33,BETTER then the original! Great feel-good movie!,10,23 August 2010,"i know i may be in the minority for most but i thought GB 2 was not only funnier then the original, but scarier as well. bill Murray made me laugh so hard in this that my sides hurt. his lines are priceless. Egon, ray and Winston are all back as the ghost busting team and are all so likable and you just want to be there busting with them. they are definitely a great team and have great chemistry as one. this time they go up against viggo the Carpathian. or perhaps ""HE IS Viggo!"". he is the scariest villain the GB's go up against in the 2 films. nothing really scared me in the first film, except maybe slimer charging peter but even that was pretty tame. viggo is a truly scary villain, and that painting......wow. its the stuff nightmares are made of. i know that as a kid i had horrible ones of this guy. like they say, a movie is only as ""good"" as its villain, well that is true here, viggo is terrifying. and the slime also creep ed me out. the yanoosh (sp?) character is hysterical and is played brilliantly. Egon is funnier this time around, and the ""slime"" is as much a villain as viggo the Carpathian. everybody came back for the sequel, even Louis Tully, Jeanine and Dana Barrett. the special effects are better this time around and the GB's got cool new tools like the slime blower. the movie is more family friendly which i LOVE because you can watch it with kids and it will scare them but also make them laugh a lot. the first movie had some scenes that i think are inappropriate for kids (ie. female ghost scene with ray) so this film was an improvement. proves you don't have to have bad language/sexual references in a film to be funny and entertaining! it was also scarier too, the subway scene comes to mind the most. scared me so much as a kid and still does if watched at night. viggo was a much cooler villain then gozer the gozarian or those terror dogs from the first one. both films are good but GB 2 was more my cup of tea. the one liners by Murray and co. are too much LOL. and ya gotta love Egon's tech-no-talk. i find myself chuckling when i think of the word ""psychomagnatheric"". most comedies (or in this case, ""action"" comedy) don't have message of any kind, they are just pointless. but i noticed in GB 2 that the film seemed to have a message about negativity and what it does. the slime grew powerful because of all the hate and ugliness of the city (""new york, what a town"") and it enabled viggo to gain power. the mayor saying it was every new yorkers right to be miserable is just the attitude that was empowering the evil slime/ghosts. but in the end the city, with the help of the ghost busters, realized that hate and anger was actually helping the evil viggo to rule the world and started to sing and be happy and start giving off lots of positive good natured energy which actually helped the ghost busters a lot in defeating the evil viggo. i thought this was such a good message for both kids and adults alike. because there is so much hate and anger in the world, and this showed what positive goodness can do to stop evil and wickedness.great sequel and i can actually say, better then the original despite what the creators/GB 1 fan boys think.",Ghostbusters II
148,asiduodiego,More a wasted opportunity than a bad movie by itself,7,13 March 2018,"Ghostbusters II is, all in all, a funny movie, with good jokes, good effects and decent acting. It's not bad by itself, but I think it pales by comparison with the original, and that's the main reason there's so much hatred for this movie.The good: The main cast returns, the effects are improved. The performances are all fine, with some exceptions (Murray looks bored), but the jokes work all the same, and it's pretty funny. I loved Peter MacNicol's interpretation, completely, one of the highlights of the movie. If you enjoyed the first movie, you'll find the same witty humor and jokes. It's a fine comedy. The bad: The plot is recycled, and nonsensical. The original movie worked so well, because it felt grounded in reality: a world similar to ours, but with ghosts. This movie exists in a strange universe in which everyone just forgot the first movie, which is a stupid plot contrivance just to recycle the first movie plot. The characters are basically in the same spot than at the beginning of the last movie, and finish the movie in exactly the same spot than at the end the last movie, with the Ghostbusters defeating a paranormal super-villain, and being hailed as heroes. All the previous complaints are not enough to make this a bad movie, or a bad comedy. It just feels like a wasted opportunity to expand the story and the characters. In these respects, the movie feels rushed and lazy. But, I recommend you to see it with an open mind, and you'll have a good time with some laughs here and there. 7/10",Ghostbusters II
149,xenazues,It was great sequel and worth watching.,7,16 January 2017,"Sequels are a tough thing to follow and this was no exception. We have to remember the first movie is an original. People talk about ghost all the time. But its an idea that was an original about 4 guys dressed up in outfits driving around a hearse. On top of that these guys where scientist (3 of them were the other was a random guy they picked up off the street who wanted a job. And he was black but it didn't give that stereotypical feeling directors try so hard to do in movies. Annoying as hell from a black person perspective. Like who the heck acts like that.) who were kicked out of a college and started a business against the wishes of the public. Most films that do this usually focus on one person. Not 3 individuals all together who have equal parts. The first film didn't even have a license to film in streets like you have to have now. You just can't go filming a movie anywhere you want. You are going to need a permit. In the first one they would go film and they would get told to leave. Kind of probably why they were so comfortable with telling the police in the second movie to go leave while they were drilling a whole in the middle of new york busy street. Doesn't that look natural to you?The second one brought back all the characters. No reason to fix what works. Those guys have been acting for years. Professionals before then and especially after the fact. So why mess with it. and sigourney weaver is a great female actress. Good looking and very witty. Believable and didn't over due her parts. She wasn't out classed by any of those actors. She held her own. The idea of the slime going through the sewer was great. It definitely kept you interested. And to this day I have that jackie Wilson ""higher and higher"" stuck in my head. I play the song at work all the time. Not very original to be honest sticking an old song in the movie. Movie directors of the late 80's and early 90's were all over that. And it worked. It also had a hip hop feel to it with the music. Bobby brown song was great. Another person lost in the late 80's and 90's with his music but was an icon during his time. (icon as you can get for music i guess.) The movie got 3 points off cause it missed on some things that they could have done. First the history of the characters and adding a dark side to it. Which you aren't going to get in a comedy movie. But successful movies that have a second movie use that movie to dig back into why instead of what. So sometimes you get a better reason that they didn't have time to explain it in the first movie. Kill Bill 2 is an example, The Godfather 2 is a perfect example. Even back to the future 2 which is in the future goes back and describes biff more. It just something really great scripts do to try to catch up to the book. And if your plot is good it works. But for what the plot was in this movie it did great. A group of scientist who got sued after the marshmallow man ripped through town and they got blamed for it, now they are doing other side jobs to stay afloat. Doesn't sound like a great plot, but you throw in great acting, great comedy, one liners, and simply just a smooth plot along with some creative ideas and you have a great sequel. So this is a must see movie to me. Especially if you have kids. I mean there are some nice cartoons to see and yes iron man is good (it will be a while before you see that on my review list, i have to go through the classics first) but this movie will be fun for your children if they like to be original. My son loves both ghostbusters and has seen all the star wars and hes only 7. And you can actually watch this movie and not have to turn it off realizing it wasn't for children. Who framed Roger Rabit was terrible about that. Good movie but still. I thought it was for kids, it wasn't. One more thing this movie I have came in a blu ray box with two of them in there, like a hard back book and two dvds inside with a personal letter from the director explaining why he made the blu ray set. Heart felt and i read ever bit of it. That reason alone is what makes writing reviews for movies and reading them so great.",Ghostbusters II
150,TJMBuddlake,Loads of Fun but falls a little short,7,8 July 2012,"Ghostbusters, was great. It was something. Witty, funny and everything in between. Ghostbusters 2, just about loads of fun but it feel short in a few things I can sum up. 1) The Villain. Vigo I felt needed to have more of a better back-story. It was cool in the fact that he was supposed to be like Vlad the Impaler but a little more info on how it links him to the slime-related threat.2) The jokes. The jokes and punchlines could have been made a little better that way the movie would be just as good as the first.3) Bill Murray. I knew he wasn't too into making this movie and yet he made Peter Venkman famous and he's saying he's not too proud of that. WHAT THE HELL IS HIS PROBLEM?! Overall, there were some kinks in this movie but I still say give it a chance, its just about good as the first. My final score 7 out of 10.",Ghostbusters II
151,astro_92,The courtroom scene truly rocks!,10,21 March 2006,"Ghostbusters 2 is highly entertaining motion for anyone that digs films that are great fun from start to finish. This movie has a vast amount of memorable moments, sequences, and lines. Although the storyline here is very similar to that of the first one, the entire motion picture delivers so much amusement that it is often hard for viewers to keep up on the movie's central plot. Regardless of all these factors, Ghostbusters 2 is easily one of the best sequels ever produced in motion picture history.This movie takes place fives years after the events of the first Ghostbusters flick. Peter, Ray, Egon, and Winston have been given a judicial restraining order by the entire New York community. The order strictly forbids them performing services as ghost busters. You see, even though they saved the world from utter destruction at the end of GB1, they caused a lot of damage to a high-rise apartment building located near Cenral Park. However, the boys reunite after Dana has a scary and mind-boggling experience when her infant son, Oscar, is mysteriously taken away while in his carriage out on First Avenue. After some investigation and deliberation, they decide to jackhammer a hole in the middle of the busy intersection. When Ray goes below like a worm on a hook he discovers a river of pink slime flowing heavily under the city. Later in the movie, the find out that the slime is the living embodiment of the bad vibes and negative feelings that have been generated over time by the citizens of New York City.Right now I would like to elaborate on what is perhaps the most memorable sequence in the entire movie: the courtroom scene. Following their late-night excavation on First Avenue, Peter, Ray, and Egon are arrested for willful destruction of public property and causing a blackout over the entirety of New York City. The three of them are put on trial in a court of law presided by Judge Stephen Wexler. Wexler's nickname is ""The Hammer"". This is so because he is a constant gavel banger and screams at other people just for the fun of it. Therefore, Judge Wexler is very sadistic, arrogant, and closed-minded. He also has a very lousy temper. As a result of his hot anger towards the guys, the pink slime in the jar present in the room bubbles like crazy and eventually unleashes two gigantic apparitions: the Scoleri brothers. The judge recognizes them because he himself gave the brothers the death penalty for murder a long time ago. The two ghosts now want to kill him. All this chaos forces the judge to eliminate their restraining order so that the two ghosts can be removed from the courthouse. They succeed and the Ghostbusters are back in business.Ghostbusters 2 is truly a magnificent motion picture! The courtroom scene and many other moments will have you laughing like a maniac. This movie, like the first one, will forever remain to be a favorite with me.",Ghostbusters II
152,TheXeroXone,"A lazy plot, but still enjoyable.",6,16 May 2012,"Five Years Earlier...When Ghost Busters arrived on the scene in 1984, it was a phenomenal success. It was a roller coaster of charm, thrills and wit for all ages. Following the film there were plans to make it a TV series, but the funding simply wasn't there. Instead it was made into a series of animated series aimed for the kiddie audience that about half of the movie was intended for. Mind you the animated series was respectively dark for its time and in order to bring more humor into the series, the producers brought in a comical sidekick in the form of one of the Ghost Buster's first spectral nemeses. A ghost referred to behind the scenes as Onionhead, but would come to be known as the gluttonous Slimer.In many ways Slimer represents the nature of favoring marketing over substance. he was R2D2 without the subtlety and about half as useful. Fortunately the writers of the sequel foresaw this issue and he only makes two useless cameos in the film and never completely embarrasses the film by making it interact with the main characters.Unfortunately the taint of marketing over substance didn't end with Slimer. The majority of the film is seasoned with similar laziness. The main characters are reduced in the very beginning to underdogs again instead of the heroes they were at the end of the first film. This eventually leads to a redemption scene in which the antagonist is a despotic judge who for some bizarre reason chooses not believe in ghosts, despite the fact that a 50 ft giant ghost was captured on live television during the climactic battle of the first film only five years ago.Also returning is Dana Barret who plays the mother of the impending victim, Oscar. In the original film, Dana was a victim because she simply lived in the wrong apartment complex. Now her baby is the impending victim because... he's cute? I have my own personal issues with the use of babies or young children as plot devices because it eliminates any real drama. Nothing ever happens to these kids (Hollywood wouldn't dare risk it) and so no legitimate dramatic tension can be established by placing them ""in harm's way"". I'll get into the laziness of Oscar's character a little later. Dana portrays Peter's love interest again, because it would have made too much sense for them to simply still be together after the events of the first film and her character is just a little too well-adjusted for someone whose baby daddy just left her with a newborn for a job in Europe.Slightly less lazy is the return of Louis Tully and his new love interest, Janine Melnitz, whose character is disappointingly reduced to a sexually aggressive caricature. While the chemistry between the two isn't entirely absent, Annie Potts' character was better in the first film as a snarkier assistant at odds with her employers and a thing for intellectuals. Louis Tully is Louis Tully, but unfortunately for Rick Moranis, his character role this time around is downgraded by the two aforementioned cameos with Slimer.The meat and potatoes of the plot is established with the introduction of Vigo the Carpathian. A despotic sorcerer and tyrant whose spirit exists in a painting bearing his likeness. His main weapons of choice are a Renfield-like servant who is given vague supernatural abilities and is only slightly less annoying than Andy Dick and a powerful, spiritually charged sludge that manifests and feeds on negative emotions. The latter would have had a better execution if they had come up with a better solution to dealing with it other than happy, cheerful slime and serving the oldest possible cliché of objectified good versus objectified evil. Vigo's plan is to take over the world (Of Course!) and in order to do so he needs to possess a human body and that someone is baby Oscar.This leads us to the true laziness of using a baby for a plot device. Oscar's character is entirely unnecessary except to serve as a springboard to bring Dana and Peter back together because we need to revisit this relationship from the first film. Also, it is obvious that Vigo intends to begin his reign from very beginning and yet he favors a host that would be relatively defenseless and lacking in basic communication abilities. It is also seen through his actions that he could possess practically any other human so the question begs why not choose any older child in New York City from ages 8-13 instead of learning how to walk, talk, feed yourself and use a toilet all over again.Plot and general character laziness aside, the effects are decent but the music lacks the pop of the 'original' score from Ray Parker Jr (with my own respects to Huey Lewis and the News). Perhaps hip hop was not the way to go with this film.Despite its flaws, its still a very watchable and moderately enjoyable film. It still manages to produce some genuinely creepy and funny moments which is what a Ghostbusters movie should have and it was nice to see Ernie Hudson's Winston Zeddemore do more in the film than be a stand-in fourth and the main four characters are still true to form. Its definitely worth a watch or two.",Ghostbusters II
153,flurbinflarbin,A great sequel,8,30 December 2019,"I wish they'd stop trying to remake Ghostbusters though. But this sequel is great. The first two Ghostbusters are wonderful, don't bother seeing any of the others.",Ghostbusters II
154,t-hf,"Twice the fun, Twice the heart.",10,16 June 2014,"I think this film is unfairly criticised. The only reason that it was and still is, is because it faced living in the shadow of one of the most successful comedies of all time. What film wouldn't have trouble emerging from the wake of the original Ghostbusters. I was watching an episode of The Big Bang Theory the other day, more specifically the episode where they find an original draft screenplay of Ghostbusters 2 and toss it away when they find out that it is Ghostbusters 2 instead of the original. This struck an angry nerve in me because I adore both films equally. This film is just as hilarious and just as well written, but it has one thing the original didn't have...a heartfelt and important message.The story (for anyone that hasn't already seen it) concerns our heroes getting back into business after a 5 year hiatus following the lawsuits that were brought on by the incidents of the first film. They quickly don their gear again for another round of hilarity, fantasy and adventure. The cast are again on superb form and the fantastic chemistry between the main heroes is still there. The main enemy that the ghostbusters face is an historical and mystical figure trapped inside a painting at a New York art museum. This villain's wrongdoings coincide with the existence of a river of ""mood-slime"" flowing in the sewers beneath the city, which is where the important message comes in.Unlike the previous film, this film provides an important message that acts of human decency and generally being a good person can indeed save the world, which is true to some extent and this is elevated to fantastic proportions when the ghostbusters use the mood slime to literally transport Lady Liberty to the museum and destroy the mood slime surrounding it by inspiring countless New Yorkers. This might seem a bit convoluted but watch the film for yourself and you'll see how everything comes together. I would even say that the statue of liberty scene even rivals that of the marshmallow man scene from the first film and is elevated excellently by the song that is used.Ignore the reviews surrounding this sequel because rest-assured, it is just as funny, just as exciting and inspires you in a way that the original never did.",Ghostbusters II
155,TomTomH,The worst sequel I've seen so far,5,8 July 2012,"In 1984, 'Ghostbusters' came out to be ranked 28th in The American Film Institute's top 100 comedies of all time. In 1989, the second film arrived and I thought it's the worst sequel ever made. They got lost. A sequel is about making it bigger and better than the original, not this. How do you make a sequel ten times better then the first? You've got to go bigger. Sometimes you lose the relationships with sequels that are from the original that are unexplained. You lost a bit of the relationship between Peter and Dana. Without those relationships the film and script would make more sense. Ivan Reitman, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis resprised their roles as directing, writing and acting and made it worse. Fingers crossed that the third installment is better if it's made.",Ghostbusters II

157,Hoots,A Great Film.,7,27 August 2000,"Ghostbusters II is a great film, with a cast and crew of comic geniuses that are at the top of their form. 	 	The story is neat and interesting. The concept that the Ghostbusters kind of have these two nemisis in the Slime and Vigo is very cool. It's obvious that Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd know these characters so well that they know what the Ghostbusters would do in almost any situation. I wish that the story wouldn't have fallen back on the same formula as the first film, but, oh well, I guess that is what it's like with all sequels, isn't it? 	 	The cast is perfect. Bill Murray's great as Venkman, and proves that he's a comic genius. He's also got support from  Aykroyd as Ray, and the hilariously always scientific Ramis as Egon. Rick Moranis is fantastic as Louis Tully, and I loved the ending.	I also thought that the special effects were better than they were in the first film. I especially liked the Scoleri Brothers. They're the kind of goofily hilarious ghosts that the Ghostbusters films excel in. 	 	Ghostbusters II is a wonderful film that puts the emphasis on comedy and action, and the special effects are only there to further support it.",Ghostbusters II

It really is, as people have claimed brilliant and better than the original (that is not to discount the greatness of Zuel who still occasionally thrusts his dagger of wickedness into my side). As people have also commented the soundtrack is great. I recommend purchasing it on cassette, although other forms of media are acceptable. The Oingo Boingo song is so good that I almost forgot that they sucked and went out and bought one of their albums.  I still think the original scene is brilliant. Also the villian Vigo may be the greatest villian of all time. Why is this movie only rated at like 5.5/10?

The biggest flaw was putting Janine and that short guy together and that was really stupid. Story, special effects and action wise, I think that this movie was slightly better than the original.

I think it is funnier, scarier (Viggo scares the bejeezus out of me), and much more clever. Also, I think in general if sequels are well done then it is possible to beat the first film as, in this case, you already know and love the characters so watching the sequel is like revisiting old friends. It also allows you to get straight into the plot of the movie without having to go through the getting-to-know each character parts, as we already know them from the first film. Venkman is hilarious in this film, although it is hard to beat his ""Yes it's true, this man has no dick"" line from the first film. The villain is actually slightly scary while in the first film the dog/marshmallow man are just humorous. Great plot, fantastic cast who deliver a stellar performance.

I would say the comments I made about them for Ghostbusters reflects my opinion of their roles in Ghostbusters II.My major complaint about Ghostbusters II, as I've mentioned before, was the lack of desperation the first film had.  The villain didn't induce the same sense of terror Gozer did, and the final battle between the Ghostbusters and Vigo wasn't as spectacular.Still, despite its failures, it was still a much better film than most others in the Comedy/Special Effects genre.

168,DoobieKeebler,an incredible movie and a worthy sequel,10,19 February 2000,"I simply don't understand why so many people have bashed this film lately. ""Ghostbusters II"" is an incredible movie; funny, entertaining, and a perfect sequel to the original 1984 classic.  In fact, I think it's entirely possible that this movie might be better than its predecessor.  Anyone who liked ""Ghostbusters"" should definitely like ""Ghostbusters II"", why they wouldn't is beyond me.  The script is strong and the movie's message is a great one.  Plus, the movie can be enjoyed be the entire family, even more so than the original.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. After many viewings, it remains fresh and always enjoyable.  This is, in my opinion, the best sequel ever.  There is no way that people can say that this taints the name of the first film, as it is just as good and enjoyable. The music in ""Ghostbusters II"" is great, the comedy non-stop, the adventure enough to keep you on the edge of your seat.  There are just not enough good things I can say about this movie, and yet it bothers me that people say this film is garbage.  This film doesn't fall into the typical sequel trap by not living up to the original, because it is just as great as ""Ghostbusters"".  It achieves the rare feat, which only a handful of sequels have. (""Back to the Future Part II"" and ""Toy Story 2"" come to mind.) ""Ghostbusters II"" does not disappoint in any way, even with the high expectations the first film set.  If you are not a big fan of the first one, I can see why you wouldn't like this movie (I couldn't understand why, but at least what your reasons are).

170,rebschucks,decent,5,25 June 2007,"There was a couple things that kinda made the movie not so good: For starters, there was really no need for a sequel. There really wasn't anything that they really needed to add to make the Ghostbusters II fresh and original. So there was no bothering with new material, they just kinda stuck with what worked in the first movie.The other thing is that the first movie was geared towards adults, but in the time between the first and second movie there was the Saturday morning cartoon series ""The Real Ghostbusters."" So in light of that success, there had to be a taming down of the naughtiness that fueled bits of the first movie. Basically they had to make a PG sequel out of a PG13 movie. They also had to, at least to a degree, put the characters of the movie version in line with the characters from the cartoon. I think that if it weren't for the animated series, this movie might never had been made and certainly would not have had much success at all.But if you can deal with both those setbacks, the movie isn't completely terrible by any means. Just mediocre. Bill Murray looks bored throughout, but in an odd sort of way that actually kinda works for Peter Venkmann. Everyone else has fun with the movie, and the foursome are a much more balanced ensemble than the last time (I like that they give Ernie Hudson a little more to work with than the first movie). The whole evil painting scenario is a little ridiculous and as a villain isn't too bothersome, but Peter MacNichol makes a fun and memorable not-quite-so-evil lackey sidekick. For the most part the gags work and baby Oscar is adorable. I loved this movie as a kid and it has those late 80s nuances - like the Bobby Brown theme song - that make it kitsch-y enough to take me back.",Ghostbusters II

However the writer/director chose to make a well-paced sequel without trying to do to much.    The writing focuses on wise one-liners that work pretty well keeping in line with the wittiness of the first film. The love angle between Lewis and Janine was a little silly and overwrought and took away from some of the adventurous feel of the first film. The sequel also lacks that ""us against them"" vibe that made the first so enjoyable. However I applaud the writer/director form very playfully staying within the same story and not trying to do too much. The special effects were virtually unimproved on from the first film but this gave an air of normality to usually bloated sequels. The romance between Murray and Weaver was amusing and the performances of all the cast were on par with the first. Also Vigo made a much more scary and funny villian than the pathetic Zule creature from the first.

I think it gives Ramis a little more to play with also.However, the story is just... well done before... better, around 5 years earlier. Yes, this is almost Ghostbusters by numbers.Take almost any scene in Ghostbusters, and it's counterpart is in Ghostbusters II. Slimer in the Hotel? The Ghosts in the Courtroom. Mr Stay Puft? The Statue Of Liberty. Getting arrested? Erm, getting arrested and put away. Appealing to the Mayor? Appealing to the Mayor.Some of this is intentional movie deja vu, but it comes across as lazy.

177,rockchester,The sequel that should never have been made,1,23 March 2013,"Sometimes I wonder if Bill Murray and Dan Akyroyd are lucky or good. If they were good, they probably would have refused to make this steaming pile of slime. If they were lucky, well, their luck ran out this time. Ghostbusters 2 is thoroughly uninspired, pointless, full of plot holes and is a mere semblance of the original's fine craftsmanship.The movie makes no sense. For starters, as with a lot of sequels, it starts out with people who were living happily ever after at the end of the first movie. If they were still living happily ever after, there'd be no point to this crappy follow-up, so of course somewhere since the end of the first movie, stuff happened and no one's happy any longer, including the audience. And, as with many sequels, they decided to take some elements of the first movie and have the audience choke down a ton more of it. Somehow, they got the idea that slime was really funny in Ghostbusters so let's make the slime a star and parade it endlessly across the screen. The premise seems to be that there's a river of negative emotion, in the form of slime, under NYC that runs towards, for no particular reason, and terminates at a museum with a really big painting of a sixteenth century whack job. So, we have the slime and we have the bad guy and they seem to be related. There's slime, and there's a bad guy... and there's slime and a bad guy. I give up. Now, the bad guy, rather than come back to life as a full grown evil overlord who will rule the world, decides that he should grab some baby from someone (conveniently, Dana just happens to have one) and manifest his evil presence inside it and in seventeen or eighteen years, he'll be ready to rule the world when he gets out of high school. I smell an Oscar. Heh Heh.The movie starts out with bold letters telling us: Five Years Later. Uh huh. Five years after, I guess, the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man victory that, apparently, turned out to be a flurry of lawsuits and career ending bad vibes when the city woke up the morning after and realized it hadn't gone to bed with Mr. Right. Oh well, I guess when we saw all of the cheering New Yorkers admiring the ghostbusters in the first movie, we were MISTAKEN! Dana and Bill's character (that's right, I don't even CARE what his character's name is anymore) didn't get married because Bill has problems with the whole commitment thing. Then, Dana married some other guy who we never see and know nothing about who impregnated her about a year before this sorry excuse for a movie begins and then he moved to London. I guess he had commitment problems too. At least the baby didn't pop out of her chest but I digress. The rest of the movie is more like a series of SNL skits that have little to do with each other. A lot of the actors who graced the first movie showed up for this one. The mayor, the accountant, the secretary who just magically shows up and becomes one again once the slime patrol regains its credibility, the slime guy who slimed Bill Murray in the first movie.The movie is absolutely full of plot holes and stuff that happens for no particular reason. Rick Moranis was an accountant but now he's an attorney who has no courtroom experience. Later, he somehow hooks up with Annie Potts (the secretary) who is interested in him for no apparent reason and they get down in Dana's apartment. It gets worse. At what passes for the movie's finale, he has his own ghostbuster uniform and his own proton pack. Annie packs him off to wander the streets looking for a ride to the museum and finds the slimer is driving the bus. OK, where's the exit? The original ghostbusters, in the meantime, have commandeered the Statue of Liberty and animated her so that she trudges off to the museum too, with the busters riding in her head. OK, so the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man couldn't do this movie because he had a previous engagement, right? I mean, if they're going to create one ridiculous, nonsensical plot hole after another, surely they could have glued Stay Puft back together, yeah? What other giant thing can we have walking down a busy NYC street smashing police cars inadvertently? Never mind that she's metal and could only manage to waddle incoherently towards the target. We animated her so now she's not metal. Fine, whatever. These two train wrecks converge on the museum. Liberty smashes the sky light. Oh goody, another lawsuit for Ghostbusters 3 if they can talk the studio in to financing it. The overlord shows up, makes some faces. The slime shows up and, well, slimes some faces. In a final bit of stupidity, Rick Moranis's character stands outside with a crowd that has appeared out of nowhere to sing Auld Lang Syne. In an amazing bit of timing, since he's in no way in communication with the actual ghostbusters, Rick shoots off his proton gun at the same time the other ghostbusters do and saves the day, er, night, er whatever. Happy New Year, New York, New York.At this point, I'm having an out of body experience as this horrifyingly bad movie has sucked the will to live out of me. Oh my god, Bill. I've got news for you, dude, Garfield wasn't your biggest mistake after all! Perhaps drinking heavily before and during the movie would have helped. Anyway, the baby is safe, Dana is in love with Bill Murray's character again and the whole motley crew oozes it's way in to the sunset, er, moonset, whatever, to continue their happily-ever-after-or-not lives. Who ya gonna call? Not Ghostbusters 3.",Ghostbusters II

181,tom-2979,I don't understand the hate..,9,1 December 2018,"I saw too young to be reading reviews about this when it came out. My parents took me to the cinema to see this when I was just 7 years old! It was one of the greatest experiences of my life. Watching it now, I still love it.. its original, inventive, funny and the Ghostbusters universe is consistent and solid - despite being a comedy, the actual rules of the film aren't ever broken.Anyway, I understand its not the original, but its still fantastic and I'm so sad that the backlash against it meant that a 3rd film was never made. We had to wait 30 years for a disgusting pile of trash that spat in the face of these two originals.I will never not love this film.. to me, they both stack up as excellent.. I can always tell a great film because if its on TV and I flick past it whilst changing channel, I will end up watching the whole thing! This is definitely one of those, along with things like the Back to the Future trilogy.This was such a huge hit with the kids too, so inbetween the first and second film, the cartoon took off massively and was excellent as well, this film catered towards some of the kids needs as well and it worked well.Basically, I don't have much to say except that they don't make films like this any more, we were spoilt and this doesn't deserve any of the unnecessary dislike it got. It's a wonderful fantasy, comedy, adventure... pure 80s perfection!",Ghostbusters II
182,Century_hades,It just didn't deliver,5,16 March 2014,"I re watched Ghostbusters 2, I remember being pretty disappointed when I saw this sequel as a kid. The first film was such a blast for me when I saw it during the summer of 1984. So expectations where high for this one.It just didn't deliver, and seeing it again as the years have passed. Its faults stand out more and more to me. The lines are no where near as funny, and the story is pretty dull. Combined with the hip hop rap soundtrack is the final nail in the coffin. I remember a lot of movies coming out around this time using rap in their soundtracks. (including rocky 5 which I disliked.) It's watchable but now where near as memorable as the first film. I think the first movie is just one of those things where everything clicked. So it never needed to be visited again.",Ghostbusters II

The first movie had me so entranced I almost cried from nostalgia. Oh, to be a kid again and go to the summer screening of the original. The sequel I'm now have the intention to comment has ripped-off the original plot only doing the following: A) Exchange the Marshmallow Man with Miss Liberty B) Exchange Gozer for Vigo C) Exchange the Marshmallow gook with pink slime D) Exchange the wonderful Elmer Bernstein's movie score for an awful and forgettable music. E) Tried to make a Rap-like version of the original stuff. Just say no to this one!",Ghostbusters II

GB2 in my opinion is a worthy sequel to the original film. Okay, so it was never going to be a patch on the original, but in the Hollywood-world-o-sequels, even a ""good"" film is a triumph! Waynes World Two is a perfect example. (Thank God they didn't do a second Titanic movie!)In this film the Ghost Busters are back, but the regular stream of work has dried-up and they are reduced to their own various 'normal' jobs - Egon is back in the Lab, Ray now runs an Occult Bookshop and Peter is where he should've always been ... hosting a cheesy talk show. But the strange goings-on soon return in the form of Vigo the Carpathian - and evil and nasty spirit-entity who plans to return to life through the body of Dana Barrets child, Oscar - thus bringing about the END OF THE WORLD! ... and so on.A fairly simple plot, but still as funny and, most importantly, entertaining as ever.

The story was original, but gripping, and there was plenty more comedy thrown in by Bill Murray than in the original. The problem with sequels is that people compare them to the magic and novelty of the original. Usually they are just as good, if not better.

I made it to the toaster on the pool table scene and then I turned it off and literally threw the disc away and recycled the case for a cd without a home. This movie was painful to watch. It was just rich actors going through the motions for a paycheck. The introduction of the baby into the mix was cheesy and the scenes of Bill Murray's character and the baby were unfunny and kind of cruel from a 2007 perspective. I like the original, but this was just a desperate attempt to re-kindle something without the original spark or inspiration. Bad, bad flick.",Ghostbusters II

The original Ghostbusters is quite possibly my favorite comedy of all time. This sequel that was released in 1989 is downright terrible. I remember watching this sequel when I was about seven or eight years old and not liking it. However, yesterday I tried watching this film again since I love the original and I (shockingly) loved the 2016 one, and I could not even finish Ghostbusters 2 because it was so awful! I made it an hour into it and I could not even finish it. The movie is painfully unfunny. It felt like a parody of the Ghostbusters! I don't know what went wrong with this movie. I can watch the original and the new one multiple times and laugh out loud, whereas with the sequel to the original I only chuckled once! Overall, this movie is an absolute disaster. It is horrible and I will never EVER watch it again. This movie absolutely gets a 1/10! I'm telling you avoid it and just stick to the original 1984 one and the new 2016 one!",Ghostbusters II

I try to be more like the cartoon and hey I like the cartoon. Transferring that to the big screen does not work well. The actors take a huge toll because they're forced to be more kid friendly and when these actors are kid friendly it does not work well most of the time. Check it out if you like the cartoon if not stay away. 5/10,Ghostbusters II

192,mattslyfox,Slime Anyone?,6,16 April 2004,"**SPOILER WARNING!**Ghostbusters II was the long-awaited sequel to the smash comedy of 1984. GB2 opened on June 16, 1989. When I was 3-years-old, I remember seeing promotional ads for this movie on TV. I wanted to go see this movie with my brother, but my mom thought it would be too scary for me at age 3. I never got to watch this film until it premiered on SHOWTIME in March 1990.The plot begins on the holiday season before the final decade of the 20th century. The Ghostbusters have become bankrupt over a long period of time. Only Ray and Winston are only available to entertain children at birthday parties. They are even being just as under-appreciated by little kids. One of them comes up and says, ""My dad says you guys are full of crap"". They are mostly doing their best work as plain, ordinary scientists. Dana, whom we all remember from GB1 now has a baby son named Oscar, who was pushed down the streets of Manhattan by an unseen force. The four ex-ghostbusters investigate this problem by illegally drilling a hole in the middle of first avenue. They discover that a large river of PINK SLIME is flowing underneath. This slime causes people to act upon evil impulses, making them evil and mean-spirited. As one of the men get lowered up from the hole, he accidentally smashes something that blows out the power in ALL of New York.The four men are now go face-to-face in court. As the argument gets heated, a group of pesky poltergeists break out and cause terror. The four men eventually take care of the problem and later reclaim their fame and fortune.*THE GHOSTBUSTERS ARE BACK!* As if the problems aren't bad enough, the underground slime flow summons the spirit of a 17th Century warlock named Vigo, who is first taken form as a mysterious painting in the NYC museum of art. A local restorer (Peter MacNicol) for the Vigo painting becomes possessed by the evil spirit and tries to kidnap Dana's child Oscar, so he can be the sacrifice child of the spirit of Vigo. Meanwhile the slime begins to continue causing horrific things to happen all over New York City on New Year's Eve, and the Ghostbusters eventually have to challenge Vigo in order to stop all the madness.My favorite scene in the movie is when a mass of the pink slime oozes out of Dana's bathtub and tries to eat Oscar. I also thought it was cool when the ghostbusters made the Statue of Liberty come to life, making walk down the streets of Manhattan in order to restore all the love and freedom it needed.
ILM did a great job with visual effects in 1989's GB2. The effects in GB1 from '84 were supervised by Boss Films, which I thought did a pretty lame job with the stop-motion effects and all, but did a really great job on the marshmallow man effects.The plotline for Ghostbusters II is quite a stretch, but by the end of the film, it all adds up. I still give credit for this movie, because I saw this one, before I saw the original Ghostbusters. Although the film seems to be somewhat of a repeat of GB1 and doesn't appear to have any hardcore adult humor, because GB2 needed to appeal to younger audiences, due to the popularity of the Saturday Morning cartoon series, it appears to be a well-made and enjoyable sequel. I really enjoyed the Bobby Brown songs that were included on the soundtrack as well.The Ghostbusters have once again proven that they where indeed one of the BIGGEST and BEST of 80's icons. To this day both movies are close to becoming classics.7/10 stars -- A GOOD MOVIE!",Ghostbusters II
193,adamvdm-882-474391,Why Ghostbusters III never got off the ground,3,28 February 2014,"After hearing about the unfortunate passing of Mr. Harold Ramis, I decided to take a look back at one of the movies that he was best known for... and then a couple days later, I saw the sequel. No disrespect to the man's writing, but by God was it not on par with the original.It has its moments, though. Rick Moranis did a decent job reprising his role, the scene with the Statue of Liberty was both visually impressive and a bit of a heart warmer, and as ""puppety"" as he looked in this film, it was good to see Slimer again. But when this film was bad, it was PHENOMINALY bad. The soundtrack is kind of to blame, in my opinion. The Sinicized tones sound like a 1980's horror film if anything. Scenes like the slime in the bathtub and the baby being kidnapped work with it since they're trying to give off a scary vibe, but when it tries to attempt something more lighthearted, it doesn't even BEGIN to level it out. The first movie managed to take the climax with the final confrontation of Gozer and still manage to deliver some good laughs. There was nothing in the climax of this film that I could bring myself to chuckle to, mostly because it involved a small infant dangling on the wall between life and death with a satanic looking Shakespeare trying to possess his body. I'm sorry, but WHERE in a scene involving THIS would I be inclined to be humored?If this was how unfunny a sequel in this franchise was back then, I CRINGE to think what would have happened if 3 lived to see the light of day in THIS generation. Oh, and the remix of Ray Parker Jr. song was terrible and forced. Just thought I'd make that clear. R.I.P. Harold Ramis November 12th, 1944 - February 24, 2014",Ghostbusters II

The point of it is that Ghostbusters 2 is almost every bit as good as the first one, I will admit that the first one is better but Ghostbusters 2 is NOT boring and is a VERY entertaining movie.  With an all-star cast which includes such greats as Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd. The movie really works in following the Ghostbusters after they split up and it has a good solid story to it, not to mention that the soundtrack is very good.  All in all if i had to use a point system with rating movies, this movie would be exaclty one point behind the first in all aspects as far as entertainment value, music , and story go.  But this movie is definitley a classic.",Ghostbusters II

I feel that they could not have made a better second installment, in creating the ""family"" feeling after the audience has been very familiar with the characters. I felt that the sets were warm and inviting, the lighting friendly. This is of course in stark contrast to the river of slime scenes, and the underground railway. The second was a bit over the top, even I found myself peeling off the wall. It has some of the most memorable lines from a villain, Viggo (not Mortensen) ""The scourge of Carpathia, the terror of Moldavia"".

Dealing with the flaws first, it is certainly inferior to to the original outing, and at times aspects of the plot are left unexplained (how can the public singing outside really dissemble the ectoplasmic shell that engulfed the art museum??? why did no one else find the river of slime since it flowed underneath the ENTIRE city, and the fact that the Ghostbusters only decided to investigate the Vegos painting as a source of the cities supernatural activity just because Dana didn't like the look of the picture! What a great lead!). On the plus side the original cast are back (there is great on screen chemistry with the 4 ghostbuster actors), Rick Moranis plays the geeky Louis role to perfection and Bill Murray is on form again with his classic deadpan one liners, the scenes at the courtroom are excellent and several aspects of the film are in fact, very entertaining! Ghostbusters 2 is no classic but above average in my opinion.",Ghostbusters II
198,sloth_ian,Tremendous film,10,6 May 2003,"One of my favourite films ever, it surpasses the original (though not by much) in terms of effects and humour. It's hard to know where to start giving out praise. Bill Murray is once again excellent as the sleazy Peter Venkman who has excellent one-liners. Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramis excel again as writers and their roles, though reduced, are still important - their career paths at the beginning are a joy to watch. Ernie Hudson, as Winston who completes the quartet, is more funnier here than he was in the original. Sigourney Weaver has been given a better presence, despite having a fairly naff plotline (the story is the one cause of concern - Dana's baby being used as the reawakening of a painting?) whilst Rick Moranis is once again hilarious: the courtroom scene is priceless.The humour here makes up for a slightly weak plot, the effects are better (the dogs in the 1st film were pretty dire) and the contributions of the cast and Ivan Reitman are spot on. Plus the theme music (which is lacking slightly in here) rocks! So ends my worthless internet opinion.",Ghostbusters II

This time, the culprit is a River of Slime flowing through the subway tunnels below the streets---and it is caused by negative human emotions!! (like crime, bad feelings, people being rude to each other on the streets, meanness, bad services, etc) and the mayor does not want to take any action until it erupts into full blown pandemonium and chaos in the streets, not to mention Vigo, the ancient tyrant that wants to inhabit Dana Barret's baby, Oscar, so he can live again and turn New York City into the scariest place on Earth to be in! I liked the part when the slime erupted into chaos on the streets of New York, with ghosts and dinosaurs chasing everyone around, though that part could have been much better. It would have been great to see more, like park benches chasing people, trees in Central Park turning alive and mad, cars driving away from the monsters and crashing into trees that hit back (like the Whomping Willow in ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets). Also would have been cool to see clawed hands popping up out of every sewer hole in the streets and whipping at people in the streets and on the sidewalks. And the more people misbehave, the worse the chaos becomes. Bet that'll change New York City people's attitudes!

204,ilovesleepers345,Fun first sequel to entertaining movie series,7,14 April 2008,"I know some of you here don't like this sequel because it plays too closely to the plot of the first movie,but I don't see that as a problem like other reviewers here.I mean,most people don't like sequels anyway because they add nothing new to the story,in most instances.After-all, isn't that what a sequel's for anyway,to add to the original story? Anyway,there are some funny lines in the movie that I like as well including how Dan Aykroyd calls those bratty kids at the birthday-party at the beginning of the movie ""Ungrateful little yuppie larva!"" LOL. I too am a bit puzzled why the writers/producers didn't explain why Janine (Annie Potts),no longer loves Egon (Harold Ramis),and instead is in love with Louis (Rick Moranis) in this one.What happened there,did they (Egon and Janine) break-up or have a falling-out,or something? I do love the addition of some of the other characters,from Janosz Poha and Jack Hardemeyer to Dana's baby,little Oscar (who was simply adorable, especially in those yellow Winnie-the-Pooh footsie blanket sleeper pajamas he wore at the end of the movie.I had a pair when I was 4 years old myself).Of course,you have your usual ghostly encounters, the main evil,out-for-world-domination ghost,this time Vigo replaces Gozer,which wants to possess little Oscar so he can live again to conquer the world,and the ghost-busters must help Dana to get little Oscar back from Vigo's evil clutches,with the help of Lady Liberty.Of course,we also have the mayor's assistant that wants the Ghost-busters put out of business,permanently,even going as far as having them hauled off in strait-jackets to the loony-bin.Of course,the mayor has the boys released from the nut-house and the boys come to Dana and Oscar's rescue,as you might expect.I like also when the ghost-busters try to convince the mayor about what's going on with the pink 'mood' slime,the mayor says another funny,memorable line, ""Being miserable and treating other people like garbage is every New Yorker's God-given right........"",before Hardemeyer fools the ghost-busters into being hauled off to the funny-farm.Overall,I think this was a fun movie to watch,especially if you loved the first movie and I really liked the funny one-liners some of the characters said and the premise of the evil,tyrannical tyrant from 500 years ago coming back to try to take over the world and how the ghost-busters must band-together to help their friend,and Peter's (Bill Murray's) old flame,Dana Barrett and her baby get away from the evil Vigo's clutches before he possesses Oscar's body and eventually takes over the world (once he gets out of his diapers and goes through puberty LOL),so overall I give this film a rating of 7 out of 10 stars,and I also agree with some of you,it'd be a shame if they never come out with a second sequel to this entertaining movie series.",Ghostbusters II

i now see that the GB films were supposed to be comedies.. somehting i didnt realise until many years later. Obviously this was aimed more at kids cos of the cartoon, which i was a huge fan of. The attempts at humour in this are pretty bad, but some passable. The effects are still good, and the music. The characters still likeable. Janosz ? Great acting by peter, but what a horrible character!Some stupid stuff also- why is the mayor hating on them when they saved the world? Then he suddenly decides he wants them again?

206,mrnewland,A flawed but still worthwhile sequel,7,7 June 2020,"If somebody tells you that if you liked the first movie but WON'T like Ghostbusters II, just disregard them. This movie, by name has grown to be somewhat of a ""red-headed stepchild"" of the Ghostbusters canon but when you actually watch the movie, you learn to appreciate the fact that it's still the same cast, same writers, producers, directer, etc so therefore this movie atleast FEELS like and has the same energy as the beloved original. you might or might not like like this as much as the original, but you absolutely cannot deny that this movie is legit, so if you're expecting post T2 Terminator sequels, post-Aliens sequels, post Predator(1987) sequels, do NOT worry, it's NOT like that, not even close.I believe that other than having a hard movie to follow, it's flawed in the storyline since there's alot that happens between this movie and the first movie that don't make a lot of sense and seems far-fetched.Some of the positive aspects of this movie other than just being a legitimate Ghostbusters movie and all the chemistry between the cast, this movie is unique from the first because it's moreso horror than the original. What I mean by that is that while it's still an obvious comedy, the ghost parts in this movie, especially the main antagonist are much creepier than anything from the first movie.Definitely give this movie a chance, it's worthy and who knows, you might even like it better than the original.",Ghostbusters II

The chemistry amongst the talented cast hadn't waned in the least five years on. Screenwriters Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd conceived a believable low point at which to start the Ghostbusters in their second installment (a direct consequence of the climactic events of the first film), effectively recapturing the joy of watching our hero underdogs launch their unlikely business essentially from scratch again. New obstacles in the romance between Venkman (Bill Murray) and Dana (Sigourney Weaver) are credibly established, fertilising a more emotionally complex and – for my money – more fulfilling love story this time around; most sequels struggle with incorporating new character arcs for returning protagonists (a pitfall called ""sequelitis""), but ""Ghostbusters II"" handled the matter expertly. And whereas the first film had its share of one-liners, it was, overall, more situationally funny; the sequel, on the other hand, is full of hilarious, character-specific dialogue exchanges. ""Ghostbusters II"" doesn't betray or shame the spirit of its forerunner in any way. It didn't necessarily build upon the mythology of the first film; it's no ""Aliens (1986)"" – few sequels are! It's hard for me to imagine why there isn't more love for the Ghostbusters' encore outing.It may not be quite live up to it's predecessor, but the movie still delivers some laughs.Read More (my full written review) - reelchat.com.au/blu-ray-disc- review-ghostbusters-ii-1989/Reel Chat ""Ghostbusters II"" episode (my audio review) - reelchat.com.au/reel-chat-2-0-ghostbusters-ii-1989/",Ghostbusters II
208,tockaloo,One of the best movies ever made!,10,5 December 1999,"I've seen both movies and I love them both! I would have to say that Peter is the best character in the movie because of his sarcastic sense of humor. The rest of the characters are great also. Both Ghostbuster's movies are so different from others, but that's what so great about them. They're one of my favorite movies. To whom created the movies, great job to you! By the way, that's the best role that I've seen Lady Liberty play. It's too bad that she had to fall over!",Ghostbusters II
209,ccagle-4,Ghostbusters II: Why Bother?,1,3 July 2006,"Probably the worst sequel since Caddyshack II, Ghostbusters II makes the viewer wonder why they sullied the reputation of the first movie to make this dog. The thin plot centers on some goo that is underneath New York and is somehow causing evil to emanate from it. Dana has a son and he is a necessary part of a long dead prince's plan to come back to life on earth. The Ghostbusters go from being out of business to back in business to stop this evil prince.The movie is full of filler (the court scene and the obligatory ghosts are absurd to say the least; they don't look like humans yet the judge quickly identifies them?) and is so bad that I would have turned it off halfway through if I had been watching it by myself. Simply dreadful.Avoid this movie like the plague and enjoy the original for everything that this movie is not.",Ghostbusters II
210,akorolowicz,One of the Best Sequels Ever!,9,2 August 2007,"Ghostbusters II is a great movie that is ridiculously underrated and in some cases is BETTER than the original. Many people have commented on this movie and always say that it's underrated and that couldn't be any more true. What other movie has the Statue of Liberty coming to life and a painting of a sixteenth century king as the villain. I have done extensive study and i have finally figured out why this movie isn't treated the way it should be. Ghostbusters II was released on June 16, 1989, one week before a little movie called BATMAN came out and became a world wide phenomenon. A little known fact is that Ghostbusters II set the record for the highest grossing opening weekend in cinema history, only for it to be crushed a week later by Batman. The impact and success of Batman left Ghostbusters II forgotten and unloved, grossing 112 million dollars next to Batman's 251 million. Now that iv'e explained the reason why it's underrated, now it's time to talk about the movie.Ghostbusters II is about the group five years later since defeating Gozer and were sued into going out of business. Ray and Winston now run a occult book store and appear at children's birthday parties, Egon is now a researcher at The Institue for Advanced Theoretical Reaserch, and Peter is now the host of a TV show. Dana now works at a art museum and had a child after breaking up with Peter. A coworker of hers named Janosz is restoring the painting of a 16th century ruler named Vigo one night when it comes to life and tells him to bring him a child so he can be resurrected. Meanwhile, Peter, Egon, and Ray discover a river of slime under the city streets and are arrested and trailed for illegal drilling in public. But two ghost appear and attack the courtroom but the ghostbusters save them and are back in business.I once saw a interview Director Renny Harlin did for Die Hard 2 and said that to make a good sequel you have to be more original and inventive then the predecessor. He is 100% correct, Ghostbusters II is more inventive and original the the first, a river of slime that can be used for good or bad depending on if it absorbs positive or negative energy, a painting of a 16th century king coming to life and trying to resurrect himself through a infant, making the Statue of Liberty come to life with positively charged slime and a NES Advantage controller. All of the actors are at the top of their game and the special effects are top notch. One thing that has always bothered me is that Winston seems to disappear and reappear through the film, in the beginning we see him with Ray at the birthday in full uniform then when the rest join in to drill under the street and are on trail he's nowhere to be found but when their back in business he's suddenly back again. Another thing that bothered me is that when the Ghostbusters are in the museum fighting Vigo, Louis just grabs a suit out of a closet (like they had it their in case they wanted his help) and takes a bus to the museum that Slimer is driving. A ghost is driving the bus and his dumbass just gets on like it's ordinary for a ghost to drive a bus.The best part of the movie is when the Ghostbusters make the Statue of Liberty come to life to get New York's positive energy flowing. Has their ever been a scene in film history like that before or after Ghostbusters II, NO! The Ghostbusters also don't just use proton packs here, they take the slime they've collected and make slime packs to use against Vigo along with their Proton Packs. After seeing this movie i wanted to see Ghostbusters III, there was room left open for a third movie. At the end Louis becomes a member of the Ghostbusters so why not do a third showing him with the team. As time went along i eventually wised up and decided that there shouldn't be another sequel, the movies are fine the way they are and the series should be left alone.Ghostbusters II is a great movie and is very underrated, you should go buy this movie as soon as possible and watch it. Goodbye and GHOSTBUSTERS FOREVER!!!",Ghostbusters II
211,jak_ras,Quite possibly the worst movie ever made.,1,9 July 2004,"It's not funny, it's not scary and it's not the least bit entertaining. This movie has everything I hate in a movie...and nothing else. Even ""bad"" movies tend to have some highlights or at least they're so bad that you just can't help smiling to yourself. Well I didn't smile while watching this.I remember not even liking this movie when I saw it back in '89 (I was 12) but after seeing it again I'm appalled. The effects are horrible, even for it's age. The theme music is generic 80's pop that you couldn't remember if you listened to it a thousand times. It feels completely out of place. The story in itself is slightly more interesting than the one of the original movie but is ruined by pretty much everything else. The cast is as you'll expect them in a movie like this but the gags and one-liners are just terrible. The ending has to be one of the lowest points in film making history. Disgusting.And I liked the original ghostbusters... If you haven't seen this yet, don't. 1 out of 10 (my lowest score yet).",Ghostbusters II

213,revahakurtul,Exact same things happened in the original,7,9 August 2018,"So what happens in the first one was marvelous. However this movie is a new kind of lazy writing. On the other hand, there is an advantage. This is not the worst ghostbusters movie.",Ghostbusters II
