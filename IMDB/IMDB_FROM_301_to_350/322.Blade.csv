0,MartinHafer,100% insane....and that's not necessarily a bad thing!,7,5 March 2011,"Up front I must admit that this is not the sort of film I usually watch. No, I usually am very content to watch foreign films, classic Hollywood or silent movies. So me watching an action film like ""Blade"" is highly unusual--and I am obviously not in the target demographic audience. Yet, despite this, I still enjoyed this movie because although I usually don't like films like this, sometimes you just have to turn off your brain and enjoy an insane action pic.""Blade"" originally was a comic book and although he's not one of the biggies at Marvel (like Spiderman or Captain America), he has gained a lot of popularity due to the Blade films. That's because at least the first one (I've not see the others) was exciting and had non-stop insane action. And, unlike the Twilight series, the changes in the vampire canon are exciting and make for an excellent and non-whiny film! No, these vampires do NOT brood about their lot in life--they totally enjoy the killing and revel in it! Apparently the only thing that might stop them is Blade (Wesley Snipes) and people like his assistant (Kris Kristofferson). However, how they stop them is new--using a kitana, bombs, fire and guns that shoot silver bullets to dispatch vampires even faster than you see folks die in a samurai film! As a result, the film is INTENSELY violent and bloody---INTENSELY. So, this is definitely not a film for kids or for those put off by gallons and gallons and gallons of blood and entrails. For example, in the first scene (at a vampire rave), you must see at least 200-300 hundred gallons of blood--and it's very realistic looking! And, when it comes to the language, it's equally explicit.So, despite being much of the sort of thing I usually hate, I really liked ""Blade"". Call it a guilty pleasure...it was one intensely wild ride. The only problem is that after a while there are SO many deaths and so much fighting that the plot really loses momentum. Still, it is extremely well done for what it is.",Blade
1,Leofwine_draca,Full-blooded vampire action,7,24 November 2015,"One of those films which is best to see at the cinema, due to the visual impact of the film in the many special effects and choreographed fight scenes within it. Forget watching LITTLE VOICE or some other film like that at the cinema, you don't lose anything when you see it on TV. When watching these kind of special effect epics, you simply have to be at the cinema. And I was. Myself and a friend had a choice between this, the PSYCHO remake, LITTLE VOICE or MEET JOE BLACK. And I'm glad we picked this one, as none of the others are as entertaining as this one was.For a start it's an adult tale, so expect gritty realism (bones breaking, frequent swearing, etc.) and Snipes gave us some actual insight into his role as the vampire hunter, instead of being another po-faced action hero. Here he is, torn between his human and vampire instincts. So I was impressed with his skills here. The other nod goes to Kris Kristofferson (FIRE DOWN BELOW), who plays an old, limping mercenary with great skill. Aside from a Udo Kier cameo, the rest of the cast is full of fresh, unfamiliar but unblemished faces we are used to seeing in DAWSON'S CREEK and the rest of those boring American TV shows. Stephen Dorff is Frost, the big baddie vampire of them all. He's not much of an actor, but he remains suitably evil.The film has many artistic scenes of blood dripping, guns dropping, all in slow motion as if they mean something. It certainly looks impressive, even if deep down it all means nothing apart from holding the audience's interest. Indeed this film is shallow, but it's so enjoyable that doesn't matter. The special effects are, predictably, the main star of the show, and they're in abundance. My record for ""most deaths in a film seen in the cinema"" was previously STARSHIP TROOPERS but this one overtakes it by miles. We've got impalings, decapitations, shootings, cuttings, burnings, meltings and even explodings (probably the most disgusting effect here). The audience was wincing and going ""oh my God"" at some of these effects so they obviously did work. Some of the effects look a bit computerised for my liking (especially the gargoyle-skeleton things which look like they were a cheap effect from an episode of XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS). As the film is an action-horror flick, there are also a lot of fight scenes, and these are handled with such ferocity, skill and speed that they cannot fail to impress. Blade fights loads of vampires off at a time, getting punched and beaten but always fighting back.The film also has a lot of interesting ideas about vampirism, and we learn about their society. Along with that is scientific analysis of the vampire virus, familiars who are the vampire's slaves and many other concepts. When the long-awaited SFX climax arrives it is slightly disappointing, but entertaining nonetheless. Blood literally burst on to our screens. There were a lot of references to other films (RETURN OF THE JEDI and THE SATANIC RITES OF Dracula to name but two) and a lot of the film was clichéd, but it was fun cliché. However the violence is numbing and excessive so it's not for the weak of heart. If you're an action fan, then it's probably worth your seeing.",Blade
2,SnoopyStyle,fun action,6,31 October 2013,"Blade (Wesley Snipes) is born to a mother who was bit by a vampire. This gave him superpowers which he uses to battle evil vampires with the help of Whistler (Kris Kristofferson). The robotic acting from Wesley Snipes and the constant cool pose fighting are what makes this a fun watch.The story seems like just filler for the next action scene. Stephen Dorff and Udo Kier make for good creepy villains. The dialog is fairly lackluster. The production value is good for this B-movie. It does have a dull look to it all, and needs more flash. If you love blood splattering gore, this is a good watch.N'Bushe Wright plays the doctor that Blade rescues from a vampire. She's not up to scratch. She doesn't have the screen presence or the joyful innocence to provide a good foil to Snipes. She's almost as robotic as Blade.",Blade
3,kosmasp,Brother Darkness walks at daylight,7,11 May 2007,"Hope the summary line won't irritate you that much (it's a little homage to the Chappelle Show/Charlie Murphy, but also to the character Daywalker). But I'll try to put all the things I liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything I didn't like in another paragraph, so it will be easier to read! Let's start with the good things! The quote ""strong bloody violence"" (which is used by rating boards, to describe the content of a movie, does fit here very well. This is not a movie for kids! Or for the faint of hearted! It has Blade as a central character (Wesley Snipes is phenomenal) and a crazy enough story thread to hold/justify the action scenes! The original idea is also very engaging and intelligent. The action scenes are great here too.OK over to the things I didn't like. The overall story is too thin. It's enough as I've written above to hold the action scenes together, but there could be more. And a character like Blade deserves more (imo). The drama therefor isn't the best ... also it's use of clichés doesn't help. Some characters are underwritten ... That's that! :o)",Blade
4,classicsoncall,"""Sooner or later, the thirst always wins.""",7,30 May 2019,"Lots of new vampire lore for followers to consider - vampires brand their half human surrogates with a tattoo on the back of the neck called a glyph, the scientific name for a vampire is 'hominus nocturna', and the Book of Erebus is the Vampire Bible. I didn't know any of these things going in, and it's the kind of stuff I look for whenever I take in another vampire flick. This one's two decades old now as I write this, so I'm a little late to the party, but I like to take in a vampire flick every now and then, as this one also checks off a box on a list of comic book inspired movie characters. This one's quite a bit on the gory side, probably more so than most, and it gets off to a bloody start with a vampire disco rave in which the fire sprinklers shower blood on the dance crowd in a maze of brilliant red. If this is what gets your juices flowing, the picture is probably made for you. The story itself features Wesley Snipes as a 'turned' vampire, i.e., not a pure blood, on a mission to rid the world of vampire evil. Aided and abetted by grizzled blood chemist Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), Blade (Snipes) is accompanied by once bitten, twice shy Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright) in a quest to put a fellow turned vampire Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) out of the world domination business. It pretty much boils down to blood-soaked spectacle cloaked in martial arts mayhem on Blade's part, with a curious cameo by a Jabba the Hutt inspired sack of flesh called Pearl (Eric Edwards). Definitely not for the faint hearted.",Blade
5,gavin6942,Good Comic to Movie Adaptation and Good Vampire Story,7,15 November 2007,"Eric Brooks (Wesley Snipes), better known as Blade, is a half-human, half-vampire ""daywalker"" with all the advantages of being a vampire without most of the side effects (though he still craves blood). As such, he has made it his mission to stop the evil vampires (led by Stephen Dorff and Udo Kier) with the help of his sidekick, Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson). As an age-old prophecy comes to fruition, time is of the essence to stop the vampires now... Traci Lords also appears.This film works, and I'll tell you why it works... because it is a vampire-inspired retelling of the Patrick Swayze classic ""Road House"". Both films feature tough but sensitive leading men who travel from city to city to bust up groups of hooligans intent to make life miserable for those around them. Both has sidekicks who looks like urban cowboys. Both of them have that sidekick killed by the hooligans, leading to greater revenge. Both have the romantic interest be a doctor, specializing in a field that helps the hero (surgery for Swayze, blood for Blade). There are some obvious differences, but the general theme is more or less the same... this is Swayze's Dalton character if he were a vampire hunter.And that's really the selling point of this film. Sure, the vampires are cool and the story is cool. And Stephen Dorff is incredibly cool. But if you don't look at this film through the lens of ""Road House"" you'll be forced to look at through the lens of ""The Matrix"" with all the stunt fighting and bullet-dodging, not to mention the ubiquitous late 1990s techno music which seems like it was stolen directly from ""The Matrix""'s soundtrack. And any film that falls into this trap has no chance to survive in the long term.Did I like this film? Heck yeah, I really enjoyed it. Vampires, Udo Kier, Stephen Dorff and Wesley Snipes' best role since ""Demolition Man"" (though still not quite as good). Traci Lords was here (but unfortunately over eighteen). If you like vampires and you like action films, this is probably the best you're going to get... I can't really think of another film. And as far as comic adaptations go, this was one of the better ones, opening the gateway for the hugely successful Spider-Man and X-Men franchises.",Blade
6,jboothmillard,Blade,6,8 July 2005,"I like horror films, and this is pretty much Dracula meets Kill Bill. Wesley Snipes plays Eric Brooks, also known as Blade, he is a defender of the human race who kills vampires with his huge blade and excellent martial arts skills. The only twist is that he used to be a vampire himself before Abraham Whistler (Kris Sristofferson) transformed him to the good side. Dr. Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright) was the victim of a vampire, her mother was even bitten by one, this explains her birth mark. Blade looks after her as she hides from other vampires. Meanwhile, villain leader of the vampire gang Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), plans to suck the blood out of all humans with his huge army of blood suckers. The violence is really good, the digital effects are intriguing, the martial arts are cool, and Wesley Snipes is the perfect actor for the role. Wesley Snipes was number 96 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Good!",Blade
7,ccthemovieman-1,Stupid People Will Like This; Try The Sequel Instead,2,9 December 2006,"This is too long, too dark, too sordid, too profane and too Rambo-like. The video box advertised it at 91 minutes but it really ran two hours. I hope they made the correction on the DVD. Actually, it would have been better had it been that shorter number. Two hours is way too much for a film that starts great but goes downhill fast and keeps going downhill with some of the most stupid dialog and action scenes I've ever seen. It seemed to go on forever. If you have no brains, you'll like this, however.For some reason, I did get a free look at the sequel and I have to admit - that's pretty good. It's a far better movie than this one, so if you're curious about the ""Blade"" stories, stick with ""Blade 2"" and forget this one.",Blade
8,Tweekums,Wesley Snipes the Vampire Slayer,8,27 January 2017,"Vampires are living amongst us with the collaboration of those in power; they manage to keep a low profile though that is until upstart vampire, Deacon Frost, decides that the old order needs to be overthrown. Standing against the vampires is Blade, the 'Day Walker', a half vampire who has none of the usual vampire weaknesses and, with the help of a serum, can control his lust for blood. Other senior vampires look down on Frost because he was turned rather than born a vampire but unlike them he is interested in the past and has deciphered ancient text with tell how to summon the Blood God to do it he will require Blade's blood.Early on Blade rescues a doctor. Karen, who has been bitten and takes her back to his base where, with the help of his friend Whistler, they attempt to cure her. Once treated she tries to help him find a cure as well as working to make more effective weapons to battle the vampires. After many fights with Frost's underlings the final confrontation and the ceremony take place inevitably it will be fairly bloody.I haven't read any of the comics that inspired the film so can't say how close this is I can however say that this is an exciting take on vampire films. Gone are the usual crosses and holy water; instead we get swords and silver stakes and bullets. While there are plenty of horror elements it is effectively an action film with lots of shooting and martial arts action. Wesley Snipes is great in the title role as he makes the action look real rather than excessively choreographed. Stephen Dorff is menacing enough as bad guy Frost; it helps that the character is an intelligent villain rather than an obviously matched evil version of Blade. N'Bushe Wright is likable as Karen, Kris Kristofferson is solid enough as Whistler and Donal Logue provides some needed levity as a vampire who keeps getting an arm hacked off. The action scenes are pretty intense and at times quite bloody. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of Snipes, vampire films or exciting action.",Blade

10,BA_Harrison,A Marvel-lously enjoyable vampire flick.,8,27 April 2020,"Long before the Marvel Cinematic Universe was a thing, director Stephen Norrington gave us Blade. Based on Marvel's comic-book series about a vampire hunter who is part bloodsucker himself, the film starred Wesley Snipes in the title role, with Stephen Dorff as his nemesis, nasty vampire Deacon Frost, who is attempting to take over the world by resurrecting an ancient 'blood god'.Norrington does a great job in translating the comic to screen, delivering wonderfully choreographed fight scenes, plenty of stylish visuals, a smattering of gore, and a pounding techno soundtrack, with only a smidge of unconvincing CGI to occasionally ruin the effect. Snipes, a solid actor and skilled martial artist, fits the character to a 'T'; able support comes from Kris Kristofferson as Blade's mentor Whistler and N'Bushe Wright as helpful hematologist Karen, who is unwittingly caught up in the battle between good and evil.Also joining in for the fun are cult favourite Udo Kier as 'pure-blood' vampire Dragonetti (who has the best death scene of the film), Donal Logue as Frost's rowdy right hand man Quinn, and Traci Lords as sexy vamp Racquel (whose screen-time is all too brief, her character destroyed in the film's blood-soaked opening nightclub scene).8/10. Still holds up as a very worthy Marvel movie.",Blade
11,Quinoa1984,"One of the most exhilirating, intense and original movies of the 90's",8,28 April 2001,"Blade is a movie that should become a classic.  It stars Wesley Snipes as a half vampire/half human who has they're strength, but also there thirst. So, he becomes a vampire hunter, trying to clense the earth of the horror known as vampires who lurk the earth among us.  Unfortunately, there is a vampire who will try to conquer the earth, but up against Blade, who knows. A film that gets better with each viewing and has so much action it should appeal to horror freaks, and should also appeal to the comic book people that are also in touch with Spawn.  The first bloodbath action sequence is a marvel.  A",Blade
12,BandSAboutMovies,Marvel starts here,8,9 September 2020,"Say what you will about its CGI today, but if we didn't have 1998's Blade, we may have no Marvel Cinematic Universe. Let me tell you, there was probably no cooler hero than Wesley Snipes at this point in time. Ah, it's still pretty rad today.New Line almost made this movie as a comedy, but after Snipes couldn't get Black Panther made, he was able to get the main role in this one. To me, the best part of the film is the relationship between Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) and Blade, but I'd still be interested to see what it would have been like if Patrick McGoohan or Marc Singer had taken the role.As for the main bad guy, Deacon Frost, Jet Li, Mark Wahlberg and Skeet Ulrich were all up for the role, but it belongs to Stephen Dorff. You kind of have to respect a bad guy so evil that he keeps the hero's mother a vampire for decades.Actually, all of the vampires are great here, even in the minor roles for Donal Logue, Udo Kier (who has been in the vampire films Blood for Dracula, Spermula, Die Einsteiger, Modern Vampires, Shadow of the Vampire, Dracula 3000 and Bloodrayne) and Traci Lords. Director Stephen Norrington (The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) was supposed to play Morbius the Living Vampire, but the part was cut.N'Bushe Wright also makes a great partner for our hero as Dr. Karen Jenson, as she works to determine a cure for Blade's vampirism. But hey - he's the Daywalker. He pretty much will always be a vampire determined to kill all the others.How cool is it that Marvel's first big movie success came from a side character from the 1970's Marv Wolfman and Gene Colan The Tomb of Dracula series? Sadly, while those creators got a ""based on characters created by"" credit, they didn't make any extra money. Such is how comics has always screwed creators.",Blade

14,hitchcockthelegend,The Daywalker.,8,19 July 2008,"Half human and half vampire, Blade's function in life is to rid the world of vampires, he is driven forward by the notion that his mother was killed by his half brethren.This is no ordinary vampire film, this is nothing to do with bearing crosses and creatures making music of the night, this is armoured weaponry, dazzling swordplay and a protagonist that is as cool as anything that has leaped off of the comic book page. Wesley Snipes (perfect piece of casting) is Blade, a much troubled superhero (aren't they all?), he has to take a formula suppressant to keep away his inner vampire cravings. Aided by trusty pal, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), they wage war against all blood suckers and here they must stop the sinister Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) from executing his monstrous plan.There are no cranial pondering's here in this piece, this is a joyously high velocity action horror movie, containing great choreography and retaining its comic book heart. Blade is pure popcorn fodder for the MTV generation, in fact director Stephen Norrington utilises his music video background to great effect as the combat scenes are scored with delightful sledgehammer precision. Blood brains and gore flow freely as the film hurtles towards the head splitting conclusion, loud, dark and tinged with brooding menace, Blade is hugely recommended for a ripper of a night in. 7.5/10",Blade

16,CinemaSerf,Good vampire hunt that has just too many pirouettes.,6,4 August 2020,"Wesley Snipes is ""Blade"" - an immortal half-breed charged with protecting mankind from the menace of the ever-peckish vampires with only his quirky sidekick ""Whistler"" (Kris Kristofferson) as an ally. Finally, the vampire council decide it is time to rid themselves of their nemesis and so ""Deacon Frost"" (Stephen Dorff) is tasked with bringing him down. I was always a fan of Dorff - never the best actor, but he had a bit of presence on screen - a good looking bit of rough, I suppose - and here is is a good counterpoint to the fastidious man-in-black whom he is out to destroy. The fight scenes are too choreographed for me, way too much acrobatics that detract from the menace of the story - it's supposed by about vampires, not rhythmic gymnastics - but it still moves along well as ""Frost"" tries to summon the blood god ""La Magra"" to give him the ultimate power to defeat our hero. This doesn't hang about, the action is fast-paced and the effects and characterisations gel quite well together for an enjoyable, if predictable story that is by far the best of the sequels it spawned.",Blade

18,zardoz-13,"The Best Thing to Happen to Vampire Movies Since ""Dracula""",9,26 June 2008,"Actor & producer Wesley Snipes may have finally found himself an action movie franchise that he can sink his teeth into with British director Stephen Norrington's ""Blade,"" a well-made, imaginative, adrenaline-laced vampire chiller based on the Marvel Comics' super hero. Snipes heads a first-rate cast that includes Kris Kristofferson, Stephen Dorff, N' Bushe Wright, Udo Kier, and Traci Lords. ""Blade"" synthesizes the exotic swordplay of the ""Highlander"" epics, the double-digit body count of a John Woo thriller, and the martial arts pandemonium of a Jackie Chan opus to spawn a horror movie several cuts above your ordinary vampire fare. If the sight of blood, especially torrents of bogus blood, turns your stomach, avoid ""Blade."" ""Blade"" takes its cues from renegade vampire sags like Robert Rodriguez's ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" (1996) and Kathryn Bigelow's ""Near Dark"" (1987) rather than those venerable classics such as either Tod Browning's ""Dracula"" (1931) with Bela Lugosi or Neil Jordan's ""Interview with a Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles"" with Tom Cruise (1994). The Snipes hero must have chose the same guy who tailored ""Mad Max"" and ""The Terminator"" in what essentially constitutes an apocalyptic version of Fran Rubel Kuzui's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" (1992). ""Blade"" qualifies as a tour-de-fang chiller with darker humor than ""Buffy,"" top drawer special effects, and an infectious techno-pop soundtrack. Lowbrow escapism that it ranks as, ""Blade"" benefits chiefly from scenarist David S. Goyer's solid, seasoned writing skills and atmospheric, innovative helming by sophomore director Stephen Norrington.Scenarist David S. Goyer provides an invigorating screenplay. ""Blade"" bristles not only with lively action and adventure, but also an intelligible plot that the characters go to extreme lengths of describe and discuss. When you consider that Goyer has penned scripts for ""Dark City,"" ""The Crow 2: City of Angels,"" ""Robert Heinlein's The Puppet Masters,"" ""Demonic Toys,"" and ""Kickboxer 2,"" then you know he qualified as the ideal choice to pen the script. Goyer's revenge fantasy script never leaves you in the dark about a bloody new world where its embattled but immortal hero Blade wages a perennial war against vampires. Goyer shows impressive flexibility in co-opting vampire mythology. At one point, a half-blooded vampire smears on sun screen lotion to shield himself from the sun. Jealous vampires put one of their vampire enemies to death by gradually exposing him to sunlight at dawn. Meanwhile, our hero uses an ultra-violet light to singe unruly fangsters. About the only vampire trait neglected by Goyer is the ability to shape-shift into a bat.A vampire infected our protagonist's pregnant mom, Vanessa Brooke (Sanaa Lathan of ""Love & Basketball"") with its venomous blood while she was carrying Blade in her womb. Delivered by Caesarean section from his dying mother, Blade emerges as neither totally human nor truly vampire. He can walk in sunlight without risk, and neither silver nor garlic can faze him. One villainous vampire admires Blade when he observes that Blade has ""all of our strengths and none of our weaknesses."" The filmmakers milk dramatic tension from Blade's growing tolerance to Whistler's (Kris Kristofferson of ""Convoy"") anti-venom serum. The chance that Blade may not revert to his vampire origins not only lurks in the background but also enhances the suspense. This element of uncertainty generates anxiety and endows the protagonist with an Achilles' heel that makes him seem more believable and charismatic. Blade cruises around in a black 1968 Dodge Charger.Legendary vampire hunter Abraham Whistler found Blade as a juvenile roaming the streets and living off the blood of derelicts. Transforming Blade into a super hero with injections of a blood substitute, he serves as Blade's stepfather and ordnance maker. Surprisingly, Whistler lasts longer than most sacrificial characters. Loosely modeled on the Roman god Vulcan who forged weapons for the deities, Whistler trains Blade to slay vampires with extreme prejudice. Blade approaches his crusade with the enthusiasm that Charles Bronson mustered for killing muggers in the quintet of ""Death Wish"" movies. Not surprisingly, more than enough vampires survive from other parts of the world for Blade to combat in the sequels. Wow, does ""Blade"" ever leave itself wide open in its wrap-up in Russia for a sequel! Anyhow, the vampires in ""Blade"" are not tooth fairies. Organized into a powerful, global underground syndicate, Dragonetti (Udo Kier) presides over them as a Corleonesque godfather. The scene in the shadowy conference room with vampires dressed in suits is effectively creepy. Kier's Dragonetti is a pure-blooded fangster in a world of full and half-blooded vampires. In ""Blade,"" the cities of the world have been practically undermined by vampires. Vampires have gained leverage in the business and politician arenas. These vampires own the police so they control the law. As the snotty, upstart Deacon Frost, actor Stephen Dorff plays the half-breed vampire who Dragonetti turned. Frost harbors greater ambitions than Dragonetti. The elder vampire prefers to co-exist with mortals and abide by their treaties. Frost demands that the vampires dominate humanity. Secretly, Frost has been translating the ancient vampire text, The Book of Erebus, which will enable him to resurrect vampire blood god La Magra. Frost wants to revive this demon, but he needs the missing link: Blade's blood. Frost calls Blade ""day-walker,"" because the vampire bible has prophesied Blade's unique genetic make-up. If he can revive this blood god, Frost can control the House of Erebus that rules the undead, and vampires can emerge as the dominant force in the world. The splashy finale in a phantasmagoric vampire temple with skeletons bursting out of the mouths of vampires in a storm of jagged lightning bolts owes a little to ""The Fifth Element"" as well as ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad"" (1958), but this scene is fully and logically integrated in Goyer's script.Sure, ""Blade"" amounts to nothing more than bloody pulp fiction. Nevertheless, Goyer and Norrington have reinvented vampire thrillers. ""Blade"" is entertaining, somewhat cheesy, but technically proficient hokum done with considerable technical prowess. Congratulations Stan Lee!",Blade
19,Boba_Fett1138,The coolest action hero in years!,8,25 July 2003,"A cool outfit, trendy sunglasses and awesome weapons. Blade has got it all.Blade is the coolest action hero in years and the movie is certainly one of the most original vampire movies. The atmosphere is dark and cool and the strange but nice cinematography by Theo van de Sande adds to that.The cast is good and the characters are pretty cool especially the main villain Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is awesome but also Wesley Snipes seems to be born to wear the dark cool Blade outfit. Unfortunately the female actresses (N'Bushe Wright and Arly Jover) aren't the world's greatest, to put it gently.The best thing about the movie are the fights. I even recognize some of the style in ""The Matrix"" and even the atmosphere is almost identical. The success of this movie also inspired to make other super hero movies (Spider-man, Daredevil, Hulk, X-Men etc.). Some were successful, others were not.The special effects are also nice and sometimes even gross. (Exploding vampires!)Just a cool nonsense movie that's very entertaining. Recommendable!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Blade
20,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Sharp,8,27 August 2009,"I have not had very much experience with the comics, so I cannot make many comparisons to them. When you unleash Snipes, it's pretty hard to mess it up. This manages to lift it beyond that, and while the action(which is never excessive, and always forwards the plot), cool and well-done shoot-outs and awesome, well-choreographed martial arts alike, is all intense, fun and exciting, it does marvelous on almost everything else, as well. From my understanding of the title character, this really nails it(and the gallery, including and beyond that, is magnificent, very colorful and imaginative). The psychology is accurate, and it's also communicated nicely to the audience, not talking down to us and not being too obvious. Design is excellent, the utilitarian approach to the weapons is spot-on. The casting is great, Dorff, Lords and Jover make such good vampires. So does Udo Kier, but A, this isn't the first time he portrays one, and B, everybody who's seen the man in anything could have told you that. For such a subject, this is somewhat different than the traditional movie about the creatures. It is rather bloody, violent and gory, and not everyone will have the stomach for it. The tone is brutal and gritty. There is convincing atmosphere and suspense in this. The acting is a tad mixed, though there are no downright poor performances. CGI isn't bad, it was done on not that huge of a budget considering the amount, and it certainly works. The music is kick-ass. This is nicely stylized, and it doesn't go overboard. The humor is genuinely funny, very natural, and doesn't try too hard. Script is well-written, dialog and story alike. This is paced well, very fast and smooth. The cinematography and editing are flawless and just a little bit creative, without this becoming an experimental film. There is plenty of strong language in this. The DVD comes with an informative commentary track of several people(cutting back and forth between them), two featurettes I will review on their respective entries here on the site, half a dozen minutes or so of random behind-the-scenes footage, and a few short, and spoiler-free, interviews. I recommend this to fans of those who made it, and anyone who enjoys Wesley fighting on-screen. 8/10",Blade
21,view_and_review,Blade is Boss,9,23 November 2020,"""Blade"" was awesome. Even more than ""X-Men,"" I think ""Blade"" helped set up all the brilliant Marvel movies to come. It was textbook. Our first introduction to Blade was a badass pose followed by cool butt-kicking. He was a sword-wielding, gun toting, kung-fu fighting, vampire killer. He was the whole package. And truly, I think this was Snipes first good movie since ""Demolition Man"" in 1993 or better still, ""White Men Can't Jump"" in 1992.Blade was hunting down vampires one underground club at a time trying to find Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), a leader in the vampire world. Frost was himself at odds with the ""pure bloods"" as he called them: vampires who were born vampires. Frost had grand plans to finally bring vampires into the public eye and make them the clear cut dominant species.Blade, who was helped by his partner and weapons maker Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) was determined to find Foster and find out what his plan was. He was slowed down a tad after he rescued a woman who was bitten (Karen played by N'Bushe Wright). I say slowed down a tad because there was no stopping him from carrying out his prime objective, even if that meant using Karen as bait.Yesterday was my second time watching ""Blade"" and I think I enjoyed it even more the second time around. Although, my enjoyment of it was aided by the different ending I saw. The first time I watched ""Blade"" I saw the Blood God ending in which Foster became this large amorphous blood creature. That was weak. This time I saw the ending in which Foster remained in human form; he just was able to quickly regenerate after being cut by Blade's sword. A lot better.",Blade
22,Uriah43,An Average Movie,5,9 October 2012,"Originally, I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype. The plot was too predictable, the script was elementary and the special effects were downright laughable. But that was the only thing ""laughable"" as there was absolutely no humor in this film either. Likewise, the acting was slightly below average as well. Wesley Snipes (playing the vampire hunter ""Blade"") appeared to be ""overacting"" while the rest of the cast's performance seemed routine and colorless. So, basically what I saw was a film consisting primarily of gunfire, action and martial arts. Nothing more than that really. Obviously, some people really like an action movie that has these elements. In this case, quite a few people must have liked it because it won the ASCAP Award for ""Top Box Office Film"" in 1999. But that doesn't necessarily ""prove"" it was a ""great"" movie. All that really means is that a lot of people went to see it. And that's fine. Similarly, Wesley Snipes won the 1999 Blockbuster Entertainment Award for ""Best Actor--Horror"" for this film as well. In all honesty though, I didn't see much ""horror"" in this vampire picture to really get excited about. Again, just gunfire, action and martial arts. To be fair though, there is a growing number of vampire movies made these days that place a greater emphasis on action instead of horror. But, the difference between a ""great"" movie and one that is just ""average"" in this regard is the quality of the acting. And like I said previously, the acting wasn't that good. Now, that is not to say that this was a ""bad"" film by any means. People who like action movies will probably love this one. However, if you're looking for a good horror movie then it might be best to look elsewhere. In short, this was an average movie all the way. Nothing more and nothing less.",Blade
23,anaconda-40658,A Dull Blade.,2,9 September 2015,"Blade (1998): Dir: Stephen Norrington / Cast: Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson, Stephen Dorff, N'Bushe Wright, Udo Kier: Stupid title names its anti-hero played by Wesley Snipes as a vampire hunter who is himself part vampire. His mother was bit by a vampire while pregnant so he was born with their abilities yet human understanding. He saves a doctor and spirits her off to his lab where Kris Kristofferson provides him with weapons. We are left with blood, guts and ridiculous storytelling. Production values are excellent and director Stephen Norrington does a stylish job but Snipes appears out of nowhere and kicks the crap out of dozens of vampires while going through poorly written dialogue. Stephen Dorff plays the villain as usual, and Snipes will obviously have the most difficulty kicking his ass. Kristofferson is laughable providing Blade with a super size of everything from weapons, antidotes, cable television, a dental plan, life insurance, and a vibrator. N'Bushe Wright plays the rescue victim because these films seem to require a female in pearl and she is due up. Udo Kier plays the head of the vampires who should voice a complaint that head of the vampires is in a low rent film such as this. The special effects are the key factor here and they slash through the screen like a lightning flash but they never render the film watchable. Pointless mess bent on being the year's biggest dog show. Score: 2 / 10",Blade

I got two new hands, and I don't know which one to kill you with.",7,18 June 2019,"Blade is a better film than I remember it being throughout, with till this day one of the greatest opening sequences of all-time.Quality performances and cast, though it's debatable whether it's better without the title character on screen or not. He's stoic and rather robotic and like Clint Eastwood in a Western, he just can't die. It's a good show at the end, but Frost has transformed and essentially unkillable, yet still taken down. The story here's extremely similar to that of ""Angel."" A soul forced upon him and he fights for good, just Blade's personality and past aren't explored. It's missing the little down to earth in-between moments of characterization. Angel also goes on to have a son, that's a daywalker like Blade. The film's seedy, but in a good way, with shady characters and setting, with a dark tone. Though fun at the same time, with excellent villains. It does drag a bit mid to late.",Blade
25,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Highly enjoyable if slightly flawed,9,19 July 2011,"While engaged in a destructive battle with vampires, half-human/half-vampire Blade teams up with a doctor to stop a renegade from unleashing a powerful creature from vampire lore.This one could quite possibly be one of the better additions to the vampire saga to come around in a long time, and definitely has a lot going for it due to that. Much of the positives here is on the continuing focus on action gives this one a rather fun feel with a lot of great confrontations, starting out with the spectacular assault on the nightclub as he wipes out dozens of vampires by gunshot, slashing and other weaponry as it starts the film off with such a bang that the mixture of action into the proceedings makes for some entertaining moments right off the bat. As this leads into the shoot-outs in the hospital attempting to take out the charred vampire left in that initial attack, the pace is set-up here for some really thrilling moments here from the shoot-out in their book-room following his capture and eventual escape into the train-station which has some brutal action with his dealings with them, as well as their hideout in the garage which gets some fine brutality mixed amongst the action. Still, the best parts here is the lead-up to the final showcase battle at the ceremonial chamber, from the collection of the council and their set-up along the statues and undertaking his draining for the start of the actual ceremony where the appearance of demon skeletons from their mouths is where this really picks up considerably. Even the action is fun here with fine brawls amongst the guards and the kung-fu battle in the pit before getting to a stylish sword-fight that finishes with a great final death for the group, all of which means this one has a ton of great action scenes that make for a really fun time. What grants this one so much action-packed fun is the main story here, which is a rather novel idea and is carried across wonderfully here, from the concept of the vampires as a society, complete with a hierarchy, rules and guidelines for living undetected. This makes for a stellar universe here as it gives it a big sense of history that's richly deserved here, while other little things that come up here, like the relationship of their helpers or the underground feeding nightclub, one of the film's action highlights, has a novel ring that provides for a clever way to continue on with their heritage but mixed up with a contemporary feel that is frighteningly sensible as well as logical. These here are the film's most enjoyable aspects, though it does have one main problem. The film's only real misstep is tied to the explanation of how he survived the initial attack and how he's the way he is, handled in a very back-handed way that's just thrown into the proceedings without any real attempt or effort, making his back-story all the more confusing and off-putting. Though some of the kills here end up providing a lot of rather fake-looking CGI gore in the process, this is a minor flaw in an otherwise entertaining effort.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, a mild sexual act and drug use",Blade
26,Aaron1375,A very stylish movie.,10,19 September 2001,"This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again and not get tired of it.  It is by far one of the best comic book adaptations ever.  I liked this one even more than X-men.  In fact, this movie is sort of a cross between X-men and the matrix and it came out before either.  Wesley Snipes does a great job with the character of Blade.  He is just not an emotionless super hero.  Also, this movie isn't sugercoated to get a pg-13 rating.  Sure comic books are for kids mainly, but I like a little more in my movies. Let's face it, if we were in these situations we would cuss up a storm to so it is more realistic.  This comic book adaptation also has something that many don't.  A good fight in the end between the bad guy and good guy. Let's face it, none of the Batman movies had a very good ending fight.",Blade
27,trashgang,another comic relief,6,15 October 2008,"It has taken me ten years to actually see this movie. Why? Because I have seen a lot of trailers and was still thinking, what is the fuzz about this one, is it action is it horror? Well, I can tell there is a lot of action in it, a lot of martial art but the horror is far away, even as it is a story about vampires. It all starts of very well with the scene in the discotheque but afterwards it becomes very clear that this is a comic remake. The story is very well but the effects makes it laughable. When the mastervampires have a ritual at the end, won't tell it all, they change into flying skeletons...looks stupid, looks like Disney is horror. The only effects that are nice are the bites and the ending of Udo Kier, that's really nicely done, sometimes the flying skeletons made me remember of the disappointment of Evil Dead 3. But then it was the eighties. Due the fact that there are sequels people must really liked this one, perhaps the second one is better, will see....",Blade
28,Mr-Fusion,Nails the dark and creepy tone,7,27 January 2015,"As a property, Blade easily lends itself to the big screen. He's got the vigilantism of Batman, Punisher's hatred and brutality, killer fighting moves, and the best parts of vampires without their weaknesses. He's just such a great character. And Wesley Snipes owns this rile, bringing distinct badass cachet to the party. He makes a vicious beatdown so bloody fun.It seems like this is where Marvel got its shít together after a string of misfires (""Captain America"", ""The Punisher"", Corman's ""Fantastic Four""). Finally, a movie that takes its source material seriously with a capable action director and an effects budget (for '98). The vampires are refreshingly non-emo and they even throw in some realism without going overboard (vampirism as a blood disorder was novel). To top that off, there's a literal bloodbath. It's very '90s, but still leaves its mark. The pieces just come together here so well.7/10",Blade

Wesley Snipes,(Blade), did a great job of chopping and cutting up any blood sucker that came across his path. Kris Kristofferson,(Abraham Whistler), gave an outstanding supporting role and assisted Blade through the many problems he had to face to avoid from being over powered by the VAMPS. There is also some very hot looking females to add lots of sex and action to this story, which is not your usual run of the mill vampire flick.

31,disdressed12,a very well executed vampire film,8,13 January 2007,"Blade is the first in the Blade trilogy(Blade,Blade2, Blade:Trinity)It stars Wesley Snipes in the title role as a human vampire hybrid,who has (almost)none of the vampires' weaknesses and all their strengths.Blade has made it his mission to hunt down and destroy the evil vampires.His one weakness is his thirst for human blood.Blade is aided in his quest by Abraham Whistler,Played by Kris Kristofferson,who has developed a serum to curb Blade's blood lust and to keep his vampire side in check.Stephen Dorrf,plays Deacon Frost,the main baddie and Blade's adversary.Snipes is very convincing as an action hero,he is athletic,charismatic,and the camera loves him.Kristofferson is cast well in the supporting role of Whistler.Dorrf is also very convincing as the villain.he too,is very charismatic.Stephen Norrington directed the film.his previous directing experience was 1995's ""Death Machine"".he also directed""The League of Extrordinary Gentleman""(2003).his other credit include special effects work on films such as ""Hardware,Aliens, and the Exorcist:the Beginning,as well as makeup effects for ""Hellraiser:Bloodline"".David S Goyer wrote the script for ""Blade"".he previously wrote the script for The crow:City of angels,as well ""Blade 2"" and ""Blade:Trinity""He also wrote the screenplay and story for Batman Begins,as well as the story for its sequel,2008's Dark Knight"".anyway,back to ""Blade"".the film moves along at a brisk pace,is well directed and well written,with good dialogue.the film is also well photographed,is visually very appealing.the tone of the film is dark,without being oppressive and the music is appropriate.there is a lot of graphic vampire violence(the film is quite blood soaked at times)and some language.and obviously there are many action sequences,sometimes over the top,but this is no criticism.it works well with this movie.finally, the special effects are plentiful and generally well done.overall,a very well execute movie in the vampire genre. a strong 8/10",Blade
32,thesar-2,Slice Blade,7,2 November 2009,"'Blade' would be an extremely above-average comic-book, vampire-hunter action/horror if it weren't for two minor flaws. #1 I loved seeing the all-but invincible Blade/Snipes do his slicing and dicing, but the whole ""Yes!"" fist/punch was literally a letdown. #2 Bad, no make that horrible, CGI – even for 1998 standards. This is mainly in the last third, but some sprinkled throughout. Okay, despite those minor infractions, I really enjoyed this movie. All actors did a suburb job and the fact that this now looks like yet another 'Matrix' rip-off is hilarious considering this came out one year prior. So maybe 'The Matrix' copied 'Blade.' At any rate, it's a very movie for multiple genre-loving audiences: Comic Book geeks, action fanatics and horror/vampire lovers. So, we have Blade, half-man/half-vampire, or ""day-walker"" and his accomplish, Whisler (a la ""Batman and Alfred"") battling the undead who, apparently almost out number humans. Who knew? In a rare act of humanity (Blade's more of an antihero) our sword ninja/vamp rescues a newly infected (coincidentally) blood specialist/doctor. Meanwhile, trouble brews amongst the vampires as one wants (you guessed it) supreme power and needs Blade somehow to obtain it. It's not the most original concept, if you read what I just wrote, but still highly enjoyable. You will want to see Blade succeed, you will root for him despite his imperfections and mannerisms. And you will know what's coming as this is the typical act 1-2-3 of a comic book introduction movie. Still, watch this without trying to go too deep. Such as Vampire SPF-1000 ""suntan lotion""? Really? What about the scalp? Wouldn't that still burn? Just like the money they burn for weapons? Uh, okay, I am going too deep. Once again, sit back and enjoy the techno-charged fun ride.",Blade
33,FeastMode,my notes,5,26 July 2019,"There was a lot of good in there. the fight scenes were pretty awesome, and blade is a badass. but certain parts make it feel really outdated. and there are some really fake moments that take out of the movie. one example is a scene where someone is getting tased over and over, and they add the sound effect, but the visual effect is a blank white frame, smh. and the punch and kick sound effects were noticeable. one of the characters was so bad (the bad guy's right hand man). this could have been amazing. stylish and cool, lots of blood and violence. so much of it is what i would want from this movie.

Its nineties stylings only occasionally come close to cheesy and its relatively generic plot isn't quite so much 'seen it before' as 'I can tell where it's going to go', but the hyper-energetic action set-pieces and confidently laid-back spirit are infectious in a surprising way. 7/10",Blade
36,bowmanblue,The Marvel movie that set the ball rolling,8,11 June 2014,"Back in the nineties, DC (comic book) movies seemed to rule the big screen (i.e. Batman and Superman being the main two) whereas Marvel (comic book) movies seemed to be destined to fill up TV stations with men in skin-tight lycra running around throwing weak punches here and there.Then came Blade. Blade is not your typical superhero and this isn't your typical superhero movie. He's half human and half vampire and he spends his time ridding the world of the undead. And he does this in more of a brutal way that your average superhero.Since Blade, Marvel seemed to realise how to make a superhero movie and since then, it's overtaken the DC universe. Maybe it's because Blade is such a broad movie - it's action, horror and superhero movie all rolled into one. Of course it's definitely not a comedy. There are few moments of light relief as it's pretty serious through and through.If you like 'classic vampire movies' (i.e. before Twilight) then you should give this a try. It's quite an epic from start to finish. It spawned two sequels, the first of which was actually almost as good as the first (some say better), whereas the second one left audiences split.However, the original is definitely a stand out movie. Anyone who likes horror, action, martial arts or superhero movies should love it.Now all we need is a 'Blade vs Twilight' movie.

I have to admit I didn't like the blood and gore but I loved the action involved in it. It was really enjoyable!However, I didn't like in the ending where he was about to kill a Vampire, I would actually would love to have seen him kill the vampire!

39,The-Sarkologist,Playing Call of Duty is probably a much better use of one's time than watching this film,3,23 December 2011,"I saw this film quite a while ago and hated it and wondered whether it was because I had been bitten by the bug that creates such a high expectation in a movie that when I see it I am bitterly disappointed because it did not meet my expectations. So, I decided to give it another shot, and once again was bitterly disappointed. No, it was not that I had high expectations, but rather it was because this film was actually rubbish.Blade is based on the marvel comic book of the same name as is about a 'daywalker' a half-vampire that has all of their strengths, but none of their weaknesses, with the exception of their thirst for blood. Blade (Wesley Snipes) was born after his mother had been bitten by a vampire but before she had turned, so she was still, partly at least, human. It is unclear what had happened to him between his birth and when he was found by Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) at the age of 13 and together they became a team of vampire hunters. The movie begins when a young man is being lured into a vampire nest to feed, and the man is rescued by Blade in his hunt for a renegade named Frost.Now, in this universe, the vampires are divided between the pure-bloods (those born vampires) and the turned (those who become vampires after they are bitten), and the hierarchy is set in that order. Then there are the familiars, those who sell themselves to the vampires in a hope that one day they will become vampires. As Blade explains to Karen, a haematologist that he rescues after she is attacked by the vampires that he is tracking, that they are a race that live apart from humanity and have a treaty with humans not to abuse their powers.However, there are those within the vampire ranks who desire to rule over the humans, Deacon Frost being one of them, and he is researching the ancient texts so that he might become the Blood God and thus turn the tide of the war between the humans and the vampires. However as it turns out the vampires are actually manipulating humanity from behind the scenes and ruling them from the shadows. As Blade explains, they control the police, but move from city to city keeping in the shadows.Now the question is why I did not like this film. Personally, it was really clichéd. Now, unfortunately, vampires in and of themselves are clichéd, and have been this way ever since Bram Stoker first wrote his story about vampires (Dracula). Now, don't get me wrong, Dracula is actually quite a good book, but in a sense it has been quite overdone, from the old silent classic Nosferatu, to the many copies that have appeared on the cinema screens ever since. However, Vampires are still quite popular (as can be seen with the Twilight novels and films which, to me, are rubbish). The problem is that once one sees something a vampire story that is really good, it sets a benchmark which makes it very difficult to exceed, and to me that turned out to be the role-playing game Vampire (of which I will not go into details here).Obviously in a film one does have a very limited space to be able to set the scene, but still, I feel that this film does fail on in a lot of areas, and if I were to label one scene, and that is where Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorf) appears in daylight and survives, namely because he is wearing sunblock. Seriously, that, to me, is rubbish. He simply should have burnt up like all of the other vampires that are exposed to sunlight.As this film came to the end it reminded me of a video game, namely it was a series of fight scenes interspersed by some cut scenes that help move the story along, and then, at the end, the hero fights the big bad guy, and wins. Video games have changed a lot since the days of space invaders, and are multi-million dollar productions in and of themselves. It seems that a lot of the action films follow the format of your average video games these days, though games tend to be a lot longer than your average movies, though I also know (and I have done it myself) that people will sit and watch others play these games. As for me, I tend to like a bit more depth and less cliché in my films.",Blade

This film is rated R and uses its rating appropriately as we see a lot of gore violence and much blood.As watching Blade for the first time, did enjoy some of the film's moments and its origin story but do not feel too impressed. The plot was rather generic, the acting was average and there has this ""corny or cheese"" type feel.Besides the character of Blade and Whistler we don't care for anyone else. Did not care for the character of Karen as she felt forced and was in the film for a larger portion than needed. The villain of Frost was nothing special either but he wasn't terrible. The rest were standard.Just as in these superhero films they are rather predictable in the end and this Blade film is no different. The final showdown is as one would expect.

45,filipemanuelneto,"Blood, testosterone, swords and blows.",4,9 August 2020,"We are facing a film that was planned and thought for the teen audience, thirsty for pure hard action with fights more choreographed than ballet and litres of blood everywhere. I could be exaggerating, but this film is just that. It's good, if what we're looking for is something to entertain without thinking too much.Its based on a coherent script, although its fantasized, superficial and sometimes illogical. Everything revolves around Blade, a vampire who walks during the day, hunting and killing other vampires, usually the naughtiest. Blade's real motivations are never fully explained, but we understand that they are related to his past and his late family. Here, however, he has to face a powerful vampire, who carries out a palace coup and takes power in vampire society, and who is determined to invoke an ancient blood divinity that will exterminate the entire human race (it seems unproductive to liquidate their food source, but things are what they are). The film has dialogues full of insults and heavy slang, scenes of bloody deaths and violence, but it was made for a young adult audience. The film also explains many things about the rules and the vampire society, as well as the way humans sometimes want to be turned into vampires, but that is all in the background when it comes to action.Wesley Snipes is convincing in his role, which is basically a highly trained and apparently unstoppable tough assassin, ""Terminator"" style. He never laughs, never shows emotions, he imply hit, fight and kill. He is not a friendly guy. Kris Kristofferson gives life to his mentor and greatest ally, an elderly human who, in the past, was a vampire hunter. Basically, he sounds and behaves like a smug cowboy from those old western movies. Stephen Dorff gave life to the main villain and was very effective in his task, giving his character an air of sadistic cruelty that made him threatening and convincing. N'Bushe Wright appears simply for being pretty and as a draw for the male audience.Technically, its a film that bets everything on action and on highly planned and choreographed fight scenes. Of course, some of them are shown in slow motion, a feature that ""Matrix"" helped to popularize the following year but which, for me, becomes tiring and even expendable. There are dozens of deaths, we can't even count them, and there are kills for all tastes. It looks impressive... and it is! You can see how much money was invested in these scenes. The sets and costumes are good, but I would particularly highlight Blade's costume, black with some quilts that seem to work as bulletproof armour, and a raincoat that looks like a black cape. Showy and stylish.",Blade
46,damianphelps,PROOF!!!,8,9 January 2021,"Snipes can make a great movie!!For my money, Blade is one of the best comic adaptations that has been made to date (2021).
Snipes plays the brooding hunter perfectly, the story is good, the support cast are great (especially Donal).Blades biggest draw cards are the audio and visual components. This movie is a virtual feast for the eyes and ears and the newly released 4k HDR lifts that to an even better standard.As the trilogy goes it drops a little with each entry but the original is a dead set classic :)",Blade

49,Movie_Muse_Reviews,The all inclusive vampire-action-sci-fi package,7,10 January 2009,"Vampires have been hands down the most popular subject of ""monster"" related films and books for centuries, their popularity going as far back as the early 1700s though their origin much, much earlier. ""Blade"" is what happens when classic vampire lore meets 90s action movies, a fusion of stylized action and vampire myths. Yes, Blade--the vampire hunter-- carries a shotgun that fires off silver stakes. While stylized action and certainly vampires are nothing new, together they pack an highly entertaining punch.The Blade universe is a modern one where vampires live among men, turning them to vampires only at a rate that is enough to ensure their survival. But one of these turned vampires, Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), wants more for the vampire race and studying an ancient vampire bible, learns of a way he can awaken a blood god that would turn the world population into vampires. Standing in his way is Blade, (Wesley Snipes) a vampire-hunter who is born a sort of half-vampire (his mother was bitten during pregnancy) and possesses all their skills with none of their weaknesses. Hating the creature buried inside him, Blade is motivated to kill them, straight up.Blade is one of those mysterious, dark, cold and emotionless protagonists. That makes Wesley Snipes perfect for the role. It helps to have not so good actors in these stoic roles because they play them better than anyone else (take Keanu Reeves in ""The Matrix"" for example). While Blade of course is forced to get in touch with his emotions in the film, this of course is not of our concern. What is of our concern is that Snipes kick a lot of ass and look cool doing it, which he certainly does. Sometimes quite humorously, which is always a plus of stylized action. The only other performance worthy of mention is Kris Kristofferson who is typecast as the grumpy old human vampire hunter who makes all the gadgets and would rather shoot himself than become a vampire.Stephen Norrington (whose biggest credits include creature effects work for James Cameron's ""Alien"") brings Blade's world to life. Norrington brings you everything you could want in a vampire action movie, even if you don't know what that is yet. It's sleek, cool, very bloody and moves at a strong pace. For one thing, ""Blade"" doesn't get dull. David S. Goyer, who wrote the script based on the relatively unknown Marvel Comics character, gives you exactly what you expect from an action script without going overboard on the one-liners. The intrigue of the vampire lore he's created is enough to help you get by the few annoying parts that come up in addition to the unnecessary swearing that was likely included solely because the action would guarantee an R rating anyway.""Blade"" is not a consummate action hero movie, certainly not by 21st century standards the way the market for these films has exploded and produced some incredible films, but it's fast-paced, entertaining and full of goodies for people who like action and vampire mythology. The special effects are strong for 1998 capabilities too, which doesn't hurt. Basically, it's enough to emerge a winner despite some bad acting and its predictable action hero plot and script. Not even just a winner, but some of that predictability still scores big points even if it's familiar because the movie is very cool.",Blade
50,Anonymous_Maxine,"Wesley Snipes returns to let the world know that Demolition Man was not the last ridiculously awful movie that he planned to make in his career, which seems to be headed precipitously downhill.",3,15 October 2000,"There's nothing worse that a well-known film actor or actress can do than star in a film where they deliberately and obviously alter their voice. Wesley Snipes not only does this (terribly) in Blade, but he also wears false teeth and BROWN colored contact lenses. Are his eyes just not the right shade of brown? They had to be changed? And what was the deal with the teeth? There was never a single shot in the film in which he had fangs. Besides that, listening to Wesley Snipes talk like he's trying to scare a six-year-old kid gets real old real fast, and some of his lines were so pseudo-tough guy that they ruined the movie nearly single-handed, for the same reason that the idiotic Pitch Black was ruined (`There are worse things out tonight than vampires.' `Like what?' `Like me.'). Way to go, Wesley. That was so impressive that for a second I was almost fully awake. The kind of awful acting that this movie is full of belongs in cheesy action B-movies. I have barely even begun, and it's bad enough with just what I have mentioned so far, without having to watch the laughable efforts of Blade and his goofy female sidekick to periodically pop each other's shoulders back into their sockets (`It's dislocated!' POP!!! `Ahh, better.' Are you kidding me?). I won't mention the fact that when Blade popped hers back into her socket after having casually tossed her from rooftop to rooftop, he actually YANKED on her arm. Excuse me, Dr. Blade, but don't you think you ought to apply pressure in the other direction? This may seem trivial, and I'll admit that it is, but keep in mind that it is a pure example of sheer stupidity, and I have an extremely low tolerance for stupidity in movies. These kinds of things about Blade make it clear that it is pulled along entirely by the special effects and the star power of Wesley Snipes as an action film hero. Besides, he looked cool, didn't he? I sure as hell wouldn't mess with a man that big dressed like that, but don't you think that if a huge, tattooed black man wearing a trenchcoat, a bullet-proof vest and carrying a sword were to smack a police officer's head against the trunk of his own car on a crowded street in broad daylight, at least one or two passers-by would notice? That would qualify as suspicious behavior, in my opinion.
There were so many things thrown into this movie for no apparent reason other than to hold the audience's attention that it really took away from the movie as a whole. For example, what was this globular, vampire version of Jabba the Hutt? Where did he come from? How did he get like that? All other vampires were in human form, and this guy hardly even resembled a human at all. Was there some reason that he was so tremendously fat? It's amazing he was alive at all. Granted, I don't expect his life story. Frankly, I'd rather not hear it. But there was obviously no other reason for him to be in the movie other than to stimulate the gag response from unsuspecting audiences. But that's not all, remember what Blade said to Karen (his goofy female sidekick) as he went to check the nearby vault door? He said, referring to the use of the UV ray gun with which she had been roasting his vampire skin, `If he moves, fry him.' Where the hell is he going to go, Blade?! He can hardly move!! What's he gonna do, run away? If he stood up he'd probably crush himself with his own weight.
Am I being too hard on this movie? Good, because this is what it deserves. I'll admit that it had a few redeeming qualities (by `a few,' by the way, I mean more than one but less than four). For example, it was cool how Blade exploded the two martial artists by the elevators by the hallway, and the BLOODBATH sign at the rave in the beginning was also pretty good. Aside from these minute moments of forced entertainment, everything about the film was terrible. The `climactic' fight scene between Blade and Frost was like watching a little white kid in a fight against a huge black bodybuilder, resulting in the utter absence of any excitement whatsoever. How about that Blood God? Was he to convert the whole planet into vampires (`Anyone caught in his path will be instantly turned')? You'd think that if this vampire community had thought ahead at least a little bit, they'd realize that maybe it would be better if they tried to MINIMIZE the number of humans turned into vampires, because the more vampires, the less humans. And the less humans, the less FOOD. Thus, in taking over the world, they would inadvertently and idiotically bring about their own starvation and extinction. That's just another example of the stupidity with which Blade is filled.And of course, they couldn't have left out Blade in some other country (the bitter cold of Russia) speaking in Russian to a vampire in Moscow. How nice. What a tough guy. He killed all the vampires in the U.S. so now he's going global. What a piece of garbage this movie was. Granted, you probably won't be extremely bored throughout the entire movie (even though I was), but keep in mind that this is the type of film that you really have to try hard to enjoy, particularly if you are no longer in junior high school. This is a brainless, pointless movie, with little to no forethought put into it, and the end result is pathetic.",Blade

53,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,25 November 2016,"Is this the movie that started it all? I'll go in and say ""no, not Blade,"" though it does certainly need it's share of credit.For starters, it was rated R, and even though it was rater R back in 1998 where R was far from the kiss of death and Hollywood could feel free to make movies that weren't kid friendly and expect a solid return, it was still rated R. R is harder to turn into a franchise.And then there is the character himself, Blade. For those of us that wandered the comic book racks, Blade was awesome...but awesome in the way that us Catholics and probably most Jews view Angels...as in you love and respect them, but never want to meet them in person.You see an angel you know there is about to be blood, a lot of blood, you probably won't live through it sort of blood and the same goes with Blade.And mind, that applies across the board, Tomb of Dracula, The Nightstalkers, and the insanely short lived solo series.So of course the movie is rated R. I mean, the opening with the with the blood sprinkelers told us two things straight up, the first was that the movie was going to be way too much fun. And the second was that it would be far from kid friendly.Seriously though, what a way to open a film. Gets you hooked from the start. In fact, it was so good that we even overlooked the fact that vampires were dusted ala Buffy.Buffy/Blade show down, you'd pay to watch that wouldn't you? I know I would.So, yeah, this does not at all start the Comic Franchise movie trend, but it was important. It really proved that there could be a movie based on a comic that didn't involve Superman or Batman and still be a success, still be good.Sure, The Punisher 1990 proved that, at least in the B-Movie world, but Blade was summer blockbuster sort of good.Sure we wanted to see Frank Drake and Hannibal King, Rachel Harker and Doctor Strange, but for the first installment, Blade was enough...even if Deacon Frost was too young it was still miles and miles of awesome.And now that Snipe is out of jail, Strange is out in theaters, and the MCU has Marvel Edge...we can only hope to see another.",Blade
54,freemantle_uk,Vampires and Materials Art together at last,8,4 December 2009,"If any writer or director wants to make a film about a lesser known comic book hero, then they really need to see Blade and Blade II to see how it should be done. After the disaster that was Batman and Robin, this shows comic books films could be done seriously and was a surprise hit of 1998.Blade is a half-human, half-vampire. His mother was bitten by a vampire whilst pregnant and he ends up infected. He has all the strengths of a vampire, but he has a sense of humanity and is able to walk in the day (he is nick named 'The Daywalker'). But he has to fight his internal thirst for blood and make sure he is more human then vampire. He works with his mentor and tech guy Whisper (Kris Kristofferson) who hunt vampires. Blade is the muscle, he is a skilled fight and uses weapons like a silver sword to kill vampires. They are also investigating the activities of Declan Frost (Stephen Dorff), a vampire who was turned and wants to bring about a prophecy involving the re-birth of the blood god. A sub-plot also involves Blade saving Dr. Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright), a hematologist i.e. a blood specialist. She had been bitten by a vampire and on the edge of turning. She offers to find a cure for vampirism, and help creates a new scrum for Blade.This is a film that proved that David S. Goyer is a talented writer, and that Stephen Norrington have ability as a direct. They made a dark, serious, very violence film with a few little jokes to lighten things up. Stephen Norrington gave the film a dark, yet cool tone, showing a good eye for the setting and there are brilliant action sequences. He has a cool effect for when vampires are killed. The material arts are well done; maybe a little too much MTV style editing, but still very good. Some of the CGI was a little ropy, but the film was made in 1998, and it's budget wasn't as big as other major films of the time; but still pretty fun. Goyer adds a political and social dimension to Blade, involving vampire politics and racism (between true blood vampires and turned vampires). They are themes of corruption, but the biggest theme is Blade fighting his urge. The best vampire stories often have some sort of theme in them. Wesley Snipes is utter cool in this film, showing his fighting skill and delivers good one-liners. He is Blade. He has the look, the skill and the ability to play the role. Blade and Blade II are the best films he has done.There is also good dance music by Mark Isham. I am personally not a fan of dance music (except for Paul Oakenfold), but in the context of this film, it works really effectively.A fine action movie.",Blade

Stephen Dorff is totally cool as Blade's young and psychotic arch-nemesis, Deacon Frost.  Blade's tight looking weapons too.

It also helped to introduce the kind of stylized action that would almost become cliché after the release of 'The Matrix' a few years later.Though there is a decidedly 90s zeitgeist to it all, 'Blade' is a stylish, well-made take on the whole vampire mythos that holds up surprisingly well sixteen years later.",Blade
58,jimbo-53-186511,Bloody good!!!,7,17 August 2016,"Blade (Wesley Snipes) is a half-human, half-vampire who makes it his personal mission to rid society of vampires (who live in the underworld, but move freely with 'human society'). Blade is assisted in his mission by Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) who has raised Blade since he was a teenager and Karen (N'Bushe Wright) whom Blade rescued shortly after she has been attacked by a vampire. Blade learns that the vampires are plotting something that could prove catastrophic to the human race and with the help of his small team he sets about trying to stop the vampires.Blade is just one of those films that is just pure fun from start to finish; it's chocked full of impressively choreographed fight sequences, incredible special effects, quick editing (which admittedly looks a bit choppy at times). Whilst it is a fun film, the plot and tone mostly remain dark (meaning that it's a film that's fun, but in a way where it can still be taken seriously rather than being fun in a dumb way). The special effects are impressive and whilst, arguably, they may still be the star of the show director Stephen Norrington does still allow room for the story to breathe - the character of Blade is given some depth and never remains one dimensional. The story is a little bit silly and many of the antagonists are more cartoon-like than menacing but in a film that's this much fun it never really matters and the film still remains enjoyable (as long as you know what to expect from it).As well as the Matrix-style fight choreography and impressive special effects the film also benefits from a good performance from Snipes; here he's able to effortlessly switch between delivering dialogue in bad-ass serious fashion to kicking a load of ass and delivering one liners in a typical 'tongue-in-cheek' manner. The supporting cast are all fairly good, but it's only really Stephen Dorff & Kris Kristofferson who are any sort of match for Snipes.I can't deny that Blade is not likely to appeal to all audiences - it is pretty violent and gory and the Matrix-style fight sequences and OTT special effects won't meet with approval from everyone. However, I happen to like these things and coupling these things with a reasonable story (it isn't a brilliant one however) and a rather 'knowing' performance from Snipes it all equates to 2 hours of unpretentious fun.",Blade

Wesley Snipes plays Blade, a cranky half human, half vampire hybrid with all of their strengths and none of their weaknesses. He spends his time brooding through decaying nocturnal hell pits looking for vampires to slaughter. He's joined by even crankier Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) a human companion and Q to Blade's Bond. When a rogue faction of the slick vampire nation rebels with a nasty plan to resurrect a 'blood god', Blade races against time to find their leader, a hotheaded punk named Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff in a career highlight). Frost is a nasty genocidal fiend and makes quite the adversary for Blade, setting up one hell of a final smackdown in the third act. Donal Logue plays scruffy first lieutenant to Frost, N'Bushe Wright is a female scientist on Blade's side, and Udo Kier slink nicely through his scenes as vamp overlord Dragonetti. The action scenes have a throat ripping viciousness, the vamps are uniquely grungy and sleazeball, and it all coagulates into a nice piece of pure 90's comic book escapism.

I would compare this movie to the first ""Matrix"" movie, this one being also a wanna-be cool action movie with a pseudo science-fiction background instead of a horror background like in this one.I give the four points for the acceptable first thirty minutes, the action effects, the style of the actors and the special acting of Wesley Snipes.

What we have here is an avalanche of action with a 90's techno soundtrack. The action is quite stylized, with a whole lot of it, borrowing a lot from Hong Kong action movies mainly with some early CGI f/x. The tone of this film is very dark and is grounded by an excellent performance by Wesley Snipes as the title character. He does not need to say much to convey the hatred and coldness of his character and as such is singularly focused at taking out the vampire populace for the pain and struggles he had in his life as a vampire/human hybrid. Kris Kristofferson is great as Whisler, a Van Helsing type and father figure for Blade. Steven Dorff is lousy as a villain opposite Blade, it seems he tried too hard to play a cool villain, but comes off as a annoying dufus. The support cast is pretty strong with Udo Keir(who would have been a better choice as the title villain), Donal Logue and N'Bushe Wright who appears as Blade's love interest, sort of, is really good as well as gorgeous.

The action industry actually did something right by making a film with some intrigue and intelligence. Wesley Snipes fit the role of Blade perfectly, never indulging us too much with sly dialogue, instead proceeding with the standard butt-whooping.

First off, I love the world this film develops. Its ideas are not only interesting, but also well thought out and fantastically executed. Wesley Snipes absolutely rocks it in the lead role as the titular character Blade, and truly I can't imagine anyone taking on the role but him. As for supporting performances, Kris Kristofferson provides a great performance as Whistler, even for his shorter time on screen. The rest of the cast can vary from decent to average, although truly no one is bad, but Donal Logue's take on his character Quinn seems a bit unfitting. The CGI certainly doesn't age well, but that's usually to be suspected with these kinds of films. The pacing can take a dive once we get about an hour in, but luckily the film pulls together just enough awesome action scenes and phenomenal acting from Snipes to pack one hell of a punch. The style of the film is unmeasurable, truly something missing from many hollywood blockbusters today. In the end, Blade may not be perfect, but it is truly an awesome and underrated delight- and perhaps just might be the best vampire flick ever made.

Almost 20 years before audiences flipped out over the hard-R superhero movie ""Deadpool,"" the lesser Marvel Universe superhero Blade smashed onto the scene with with this ultra bloody tale of modern day vampire hunting. Wesley Snipes plays Blade, a half human/half vampire who can walk in sunlight and uses that to his advantage as he hunts his vampire quarry. In this vampire universe, vampires have an underground secret society, who use their wealth and power to hide their existence and keep themselves well fed. That is until upstart vampire Stephen Dorff decides vampires should come out from the shadows and should claim their rightful place at the top of the food chain. It's a cool story set up, but what makes this film great is Snipes as Blade, the ultra slick direction by Stephen Norrington, and the unapologetic gore that made this movie standout at the time (though it still manages to stand out to this day among superhero films). Sure, ""Deadpool"" and ""Kick-Ass"" were super violent, but they were done with a a fair amount of humor. ""Blade"" is a humorless and completely serious of film, mixing action and horror. In many ways, it's more of a hybrid of ""The Matrix"" and ""The Hunger"" and is less similar to any other superhero film of the past 20 years. ""The Crow"" is probably is probably the most similar of comic book movie to this one, although I don't know if I'd really consider ""The Crow"" a superhero movie either. Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" may be the only other superhero movie since Blade to take what I'd consider a serious tone that wasn't afraid to embrace downbeat themes and not worry about being a wide audience crowdpleaser. I think Ang Lee intended his film to be a crowdpleaser, but it ended up not, although I think ""Hulk"" is highly underrated and I would argue is the best of the recent big budget Marvel films (even if they rebooted the series and do not consider Lee's film part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe). But back to this film in particular, Wesley Snipes commands the screen as Blade, in what' is likely his most memorable onscreen role. His stoic low-voiced man-of-few-words demeanor does border on parody and will admittedly come off as silly if you're not into the spirit of the film, but it worked for me. Also, Snipes, a trained martial artist, has some of the best fight sequences of his career. In terms of story, writer David S. Goyer took the unique approach of not making the movie about Blade's origin story and instead the audience finds themselves thrust into the middle of a long simmering war waged by Blade agains the hidden vampire world. The audience's is introduced to Blade and his secret war by way of N'Bushe Wright, an innocent human who finds herself suddenly caught up in fight when she's attacked by a vampire. Director Norrington, as well as director of photography Theo Van De Sande, get a lot of credit for the film's slick look, with tightly edited action sequences and a cold austere vampire world bathed in cool blues and blacks (until it explodes in blood red). The film also greatly benefits from its' supporting cast, which includes not just Dorff, but also Kris Kristofferson as Blade's human helper, making all his weapons and gear, Donal Logue as Dorff's primary henchmen, Udo Kier as an establishment vampire opposed to Dorff, and even Traci Lords shows up as a vamp. There's also a fine atmospheric score by the always great Mark Isham. Also worth noting are some excellent practical special effects, particularly a memorable sequence with a Jabba the Hutt-like vampire is tortured by Blade's ultraviolet flashlight. However, there are some significant downsides to this film. The main one is that the film's best scene, the vampire rave blood bath, is the first scene of the movie and nothing that follows lives up to it. It really is a dynamite scene, with New Order music blasting, sexy vampires cavorting, and blood spraying down from the ceiling where the vamps have rigged blood to rain down from the ceiling fire sprinklers. That is until Blade shows up and mows them down in his trench coat with guns, stakes, high kicks, and samurai sword. Also to the film's detriment are that the characters are all rather underdeveloped. Sure they all have a backstories, but they are more archetypes than relatable or empathetic characters. The story also meanders a bit and loses momentum at times. There's also a rather lackluster and disappointing climax that didn't seem consistent with the rest of the film's slick modern setting. Writer Goyer has a pretty hit or miss track record and his best films included either co-writing credits by others or were made by strong directors like Christopher Nolan, Alex Proyas, or Guillermo del Toro, the director of the far superior Blade sequel. Left to his own devices, I'm not sure Goyer is that good of a write outside of developing solid story set-ups. Another complaint is that while the films did feature some excellent practical special effects, the CGI is consistently awful throughout the film. The CGI blood looks like Magic Marker, the vampire disintegrations from stakings and whatnot look like a bad TV show superimposed images, and when the vampires swell and explode the CGI just looks completely off. The CGI was distracting and takes you out of the film. Still, despite these fairly major deficits, ""Blade"" manages to be a memorable horror/action film hybrid that is well worth watching flaws in all, although Guillermo del Toro's terrific sequel should have been the first film to launch this franchise and is the high point of the series.",Blade

The martial arts (stunts) are amazing and so are the groundbreaking visual effects. The musical score is magnificent and really drives the whole experience through a roller-coaster ride, of over-the-top blood-letting. Excellent supporting performance from Kris Kristofferson, in the part of his side-kick whistler. 'Blade' is not just any movie that is made and then goes away. Subsequently the whole look and feel of this picture, has been highly influential in the Horror/Sci-fi genre.",Blade
72,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,The first successful Marvel adaptation,8,13 June 2013,"Before this film, it was clear that any Marvel comic adaptation to the big screen was not favored by many. Howard the Duck (1986) impressed very few and The Punisher (1989) did not even get a chance to be released in U.S. theaters. It was difficult to say how Marvel would perform after such mishaps. Thankfully, they came back with one heck of an action-horror film starring one of the most popular actors at the time - Wesley Snipes. And was it a great casting choice; thank you David S. Goyer.To be brief because it was already explained, Wesley Snipes plays a half human, half vampire named Blade who takes it upon himself to slay every vampire that he comes into contact with. Just because, he doesn't like being part vampire himself. Accompanying Blade is his weapons maker called the ""Whistler"" played by Kris Kristofferson. Both Snipes and Kristofferson show great chemistry on screen will give a real sense that these two guys have been at it for years. Snipes plays his role with a controlled anger and moves with style, while Kristofferson lightens up the air with lines that any old man would say.Witnessing these two handle their work is a medical examiner Karen (N'Bushe Wright) who also shows off some feminine power when she's given the chance. But just like any other female character in an antihero movie like this, Wright's character will not be a love interest and I am totally fine with that. Same goes for what should be for Marvel's The Punisher, Daredevil and Ghost Rider. Playing the villain, Deacon Frost is Stephen Dorff and he too gives the cold shoulder (pun intended) to many of his enemies, including his own. He doesn't even seem to really care about his partner Quinn (Donal Logue), a fellow vampire. That's selfish man.Along with a set of great characters, comes some fierce stylized action, cool special effects and dark music. The writing is where it gets a little cliché. Because Wesley Snipes holds several degrees in martial arts, it should be no surprise that the action will be stylized to a level that will entertain and not be over top. And because this movie is rated R and is about vampires, there will be blood. In fact, I think it's appropriate to say that this movie was under the ""Marvel Knights"" logo before it was even introduced with Punisher: War Zone (2008) and Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2012). The atmosphere is dark and gritty. Which is exactly what fans enjoy and want with comic book characters. Also, the special effects were evenly distributed as well, nothing seemed fake.As for the music composed by Mark Isham, I found it to be effective because it contained a lot of downbeat tones that helped emulate how dark this movie was. But I also found it lacking because there was no reoccurring theme for the main character and it also wasn't present as often as it should have been. Again, when it was present though, it was effective. As for the writing, what didn't work for me was the whole prophecy concept. That and the ""chosen one"" line. Even if that phrase were left out, it would not have sounded so cliché. But overall, this is one early Marvel film, no one should miss.Wesley Snipes does a great job portraying Marvel's first antihero. The action is tight and the score is dark and brooding. The writing even allows for good dialog but its back-story is too cliché.",Blade
73,PredragReviews,"Half-Human, Half-Vampire, All Hunter...",7,12 May 2016,"""Blade"" could have been yet another overblown blockbuster, but it differs in that its relentless nature builds excitement rather than smacking of desperate CGI-laced attempts to keep the audience interested. Wesley Snipes plays the ultra cool hero and you definitely root for him. Although it seems that sometimes he tries too hard at being a hero but most of the time he succeeds. What makes Stephen Dorff's character scary is his intelligence, which is expressed beautifully in the actor's eyes. He is probably one of the most convincing comic villains since Jack Nicholson in Batman. The acting is pretty run of the mill for the most part, with the standout acting being done by Stephen Dorff as Deacon Frost, spoiled brat and complete maniac (and vampire of course) and Udo Kier (even though he isn't in the movie for more than 5 minutes total) as Dragonetti, the head of the pure blood vampires. While Frost isn't your typical buff, brawny villain, he makes up for his conscipicous scrawniness with his intelligence and ruthlesness As I first saw it, the images blew me away. The fight scenes are beautifully choreographed and shot and there's a really stylish atmosphere to it. The industrial soundtrack adds to the rhythmic editing and accelerates the fights. The special effects are somewhat weak, but this is a glossy B-Movie and that is part of the fun it provides. As I saw the brilliant ""Matrix"" one year later I realized that some shots seemed very familiar to Blade. The sardonic nature of the movie is further enhanced by the ability of the characters to poke fun at the ludicrous nature of the hyper-intense fights that propel Blade in his quest to rid the world of vampires. It's a journey that's enjoyably involving, despite the frenetic pace, and that's a rarity with any action blockbuster.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",Blade
74,vengeance20,Very Good!,8,4 June 2019,"Not a fan of vampire horror flicks but gave this one a watch from seeing the trailer.The film is about a man named Blade, who was born a vampire after his mum got bitten while conceiving him.I found the film to be pretty epic & entertaining! Wesley Snipes does the role of Blade well as with the other actors themselves of the roles given! The gore effects were ace, however the CGI effects were fake looking & unrealistic looking, but I guess for a film of 1998, it was good...!Overall, worth a watch! 8/10",Blade
75,brando647,First Great Marvel Movie,8,2 April 2010,"Before Bryan Singer came along and blew our minds with X-MEN or Sam Raimi wow'd us with SPIDER-MAN, director Stephen Norrington created one of the first good Marvel comic adaptations with BLADE. The series follows the half-human/half-vampire Blade in his on-going battle against the undead with the aid of his mentor Whistler. In the film, Blade confronts Deacon Frost, a vampire who's become fed up with his people's desire to remain in the shadows of humanity. He plans to summon the vampire blood god La Magra and allow vampires to rise to their rightful place over the humans. BLADE is Norrington's first major directing gig and he brings us a killer action/horror film to debut one of Marvel's coolest characters.With few exceptions, the casting in this film was terrific. Wesley Snipes truly is Blade; I can't think of any other actor that would've personified the character anywhere as well as Snipes did. He's got the cool demeanor, hint of humor, and wicked martial arts skills to bring to the role. Kris Kristofferson's gruff attitude was an inspired choice for Whistler and Stephen Dorff was fun as Frost. The character of Frost reminded me a lot of Kiefer Sutherland in 1987's THE LOST BOYS which probably made me a bit biased because of how fun a movie it was. Dorff was equal parts crazy, arrogant, and evil: all the best qualities in a comic villain (especially a vampire comic villain).The action in this movie is awesome, with plenty of martial arts (all vampires know martial arts?) and slicing/dicing. Blade's got a nifty arsenal of toys at his disposal, including his glaive, his sword, and a compound called EDTA that had been cooked up by his hematologist associate Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright). The EDTA makes for some gory endings for a couple of vampires that cross Blade's warpath. The film's weakness comes in the form of the CG, which has not aged well. Nearly all the CG in the film stands out and pulls you right out of the movie, especially the wraiths in the La Magra summoning scene. I don't know if it was a lack of funds or time but the visual effects still needed a great deal of work.",Blade
76,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Blade"" is a strong, mature comic-book film, with outstanding performances and a unique visual style...",8,17 February 2012,"Stephen Norrington's 1998 release ""Blade"" (based on the Marvel comic character) is the film that arguably lead to the recent trend of comic-book movies. It's success (along with that of ""X-Men"") caused people to do something they always should have- take comics seriously as an art form and a medium for storytelling. The film is an incredible, Gothic ride with great performances and unique visuals, and should be seen by any fan of action, horror or film in general.Blade (Wesley Snipes) is a half-human, half-vampire. His mother was bitten while pregnant, and his blood was infected by the vampire virus, granting him some vampire-like powers (such as inhuman strength), although he also suffers from ""The Thirst""- the vampire's natural need to feast on human blood, which he combats using treatments and serums, almost like a drug addict. Blade and his mentor Whistler (Krist Kristopherson) spend their nights hunting and killing vampires who feed on the humans.At the same time, a vampire named Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorf) is plotting to overthrow the noble heads of the various vampire clans, and using them as sacrifices to bring about ""La Magra"" a vampyric blood-god, to destroy humanity and grant himself untold power. Blade and Whistler (along with help from a pathologist played by N'Bushe Wright) must figure out a way to stop Frost's deadly plans before he wipes out all of humanity.The film is truly dark and Gothic. Norrington's direction sets an ominous and deadly mood, and the visuals are all well-crafted. The score by Mark Isham is tragic and melancholy, with some nice techno-y action music thrown in for good measure.Acting is generally good (though Dorf does get a little hammy at times) and everything meshes quite well. The action is nice, though it feels a little staged and over-choreographed, and the visual effects, for the time, were outstanding. I should also mention that this is a violent, violent film. It is the bloodiest of the three movies, and has a lot of gore, which actually almost took me ""out"" of the movie a few times- some scenes felt campy with the sheer amount of carnage and goo being flung at the screen.In addition, there are a couple of scenes and jokes that stick out like a sore thumb, and the tone is a bit too oppressive, making this a hard movie to sit through if you are not in the right mood.I'm giving this a good 8 out of 10. I'd highly recommend it to fans of action and horror. It is a strong vampire film. (Also, a cool note, this movie is one of the several pre-""Matrix"" films to utilize ""bullet-time"", that cool trick where action slows down dramatically to the point where you can see individual bullets whooshing through the air. Just a fun little piece of trivia- ""The Matrix"" did not invent this trick.)",Blade
77,Terryfan,Half Human/Half Vampire Blade shows how a comic book movie is suppose to be done,8,24 September 2015,"Blade Marvel's Half Human Half Vampire character when he made his film debut in 1998 the film became a hit. While the 1990s were good for cinema and movies there were some comic book films that more or less left a sour taste in movie goers mouths. There were some that were awesome some that were just a disgrace.However Marvel's Blade really show that you can make a good comic book movie, this film just did some very smart moves first they made this a R rated film which for the story and plot in this film, they pick the right cast for the characters and the action is just well done.The plot of the film centers around Blade (Wesley Snipes) and his mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) are on a quest to hunt and destroy vampires along with putting a stop to Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) and his minions Quinn (Donal Logue), Mercury (Arly Jover)However things take a change when Karen (N'Bushe Wright) gets bitten by Quinn leaving Blade to be her protector and they form a partnership to put a end to the vampires. The story gives us a look into the origin of Blade and how he became to be which we learn as the plot advances.Also the action and fight scenes were very well balance and had you on the edge of your seat and the way the film starts with the fight in the night club gave us what we would expect during the film it goes to show that they knew what they were doing.Each fight scene is worth watching. Also the film has a good collection of classic lines. Blade just goes to show that it's cool to make comic book movies and in some help restore credit into films based on Comic Books to restore the trust into making hit movies I give Blade an 8 out of 10",Blade

When I found out that this movie is a superhero marvel movie, I was shocked because the dark tone, yes that's how marvel movies were back in the 90s early 2000s but the character of blade is not a superhero, he's more like a vigilante but they're the same thing but still, I was shocked when I found out. I really enjoyed and love this movie. Marvel movies back then weren't that good, they were really really bad. I loved the action, the connection between blade and the old man. The girl at the beginning that got bit, I wasn't a huge fan and she wss only there because every stereotypical Hollywood movie or I should say every movie needs to have a woman in the movie in a supporting role or leading role.

80,pyrocitor,"True to form, Blade doesn't suck",7,15 September 2016,"He kicks enough slow-mo ass in a long black coat to make Neo go ""Whoa."" He rocks a vampire franchise slick and edgy enough to make RPatz whimper. And he brings enough spurting blood to the superhero blockbuster to make Kevin Feige faint. He's Blade - breakout star of the era when the term 'superhero film' was largely tantamount to 'campy garbage'. And he's a welcome shot of adrenaline to the current day multiplexes bursting at the seams with his more bloodless (ha) brethren. Respect.Director Stephen Norrington knows exactly how to stay on the fun side of campy, and goes right for the jugular in doing so, offering a slick, taut, and hugely entertaining bloodbath. Eschewing both a redundant origin story and some of the decade's more frantic action editing, Blade is marvellously paced, ticking along, shark-like, from exposition to action interlude and back with the hypnotic steadiness of blood pulsing through veins. It's hardly an ambitious plot (stop the pending vampocalypse, natch), but lent welcome life from Norrington and writer David S. Goyer's more inventively gruesome touches. Check out the sprinklers at the underground vampire nightclub dousing the raving crowd in blood in a gleefully macabre Carrie homage, amidst the film's inspired opening sequence, and it's impossible to deny you're in for a garishly amusing treat. Granted, some of the film's stylistic choices (Mark Isham's industrial-influenced soundtrack) age better than others (DP Theo van de Sande shooting the film like a streaky, jump-cutting '90s hip hop video is fairly jarring). But Norrington's flair for the grotesque helps punch up the monster horror fun. His prosthetic deformities and bubbling corpses playfully pilfer the best of Total Recall and Raiders of the Lost Ark, just as the classist in-fighting in the vampire ranks (born vampires sneering condescension at 'turned' bloodsuckers) lends odd nuance to the villainous MacGuffin, while a sterling climactic setpiece amidst a (practical set!) marble vampire temple is as sleekly Gothic as you could ask for. Blade may not reinvent the action wheel, but it certainly gives it a good, vigorous spin in the right direction. As the titular vampire hunter (no, not Abraham Lincoln), Wesley Snipes firmly establishes himself as one of the more reliable '90s badasses. His icy charisma is easily enough to carry the film, even if his attempts at infusing Blade's monolithic masculinity with humour through bursts of twitchy sassiness may take some adjusting to. Still, anyone who can sell a punchline as corny as ""Some motherf*ckers are always trying to ice-skate uphill"" with dignity intact is worth of accolades in my books. Supporting Snipes, N'Bushe Wright astutely refuses any damsel in distress clichés with a welcome, hardened charisma, at the cost of occasionally neglected to react appropriately to some of the film's more fearsome scenarios. Similarly, as the film's central antagonist, Stephen Dorff is perfectly oily, but his refusal to chew scenery in favour of a more subtle creepiness backfires somewhat, making him a suitable, but fairly forgettable foe. Finally, Kris Kristofferson lends his 'gruff mentor' archetype an appealingly indignant crustiness, bagging many of the film's better lines in the process. As the bodies hit the floor amidst the flurries of impressively executed, cathartically bloody action choreography, a realization sinks in: Blade, for all its leather-clad macho posturing, is a remarkably unpretentious film. It's fun, no- nonsense, and down and dirty, in the ways that only a moderately-budgeted franchise film with low expectations but high potential can be. You can practically see the seeds for 2016's Deadpool's rampant success being lain, albeit with only the tiniest winks of its fourth-wall-toppling zaniness. Still, nearly 20 years on, Blade remains an adeptly unapologetic slice of entertainment. If you're thinking of giving it a pass, as Blade himself succinctly says, ""Motherf*cker, are you out of your damn mind?!""-7.5/10",Blade

I'd never heard of Blade, didn't know about Marvel/DC, etc,, all I knew was Wesley Snipes had been in several movies that I liked (Major League/Demolition Man/Passenger 57) and he was gonna be fighting vampires. I was sold!Eric's mother was attacked and bitten by a vampire while she was still pregnant. By the time drs were able to get him out of his dying mother Eric had already undergone exposure to the vampire virus. As he grew up, he developed incredible strength, endurance, and reflexes. Along with the ability to heal from injuries much faster than a normal human. Unfortunately for Eric though, he also acquired the vampires need to feed on blood.Along with Abraham Whistler (both friend and mentor), Eric adopts the name Blade and begins exterminating vampires wherever they can be found.I'd give a score of 7.5 for the whole Blade trilogy. The reason I'd say that score instead of an 8+ is bc of the 3rd movie. Blade is an awesome ride with a great cast,, and Blade II is even better (of course I think that can be attributed to the genius of Del Toro as director). Blade Trinity is a fun ride as well, but not as good as it could've been. Apparently there was a LOT of trouble on the set of the movie, and it sounds like most of the trouble was coming from Snipes himself. Thankfully,, due to Reynolds and Biel, as well as a very good supporting cast, it's still enjoyable enough to watch.So go watch them already!!",Blade

85,one9eighty,"Vampires, Actions, thrills, spills, horror and fun. Before there was an Iron Man, there was a Blade.",8,8 April 2016,"This is a Marvel comics inspirited film from before the Marvel Universe films got big like they are today, it follows Blade, the ""day walker"". Played by Wesley Snipes, Blade, was born a half breed human-vampire cross, all the strengths of a vampire and none of their weaknesses. Before entering the world his pregnant mother was bitten by a vampire and as she's dyeing in hospital from the Vampire bit Blade is born, this origin is explained right at the start of the film so that the audience is in no doubt how he came to be. Now an adult Blade is fighting Vampires with the help of Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) who saved Blade from himself and from becoming a Vampire himself when he was a child living on the streets. Together they fight the cause with Blade doing the dirty work and Whistler providing the tech and back up. Blade's only weakness is 'the hunger', the vampiric need to consume blood which he keeps under control by periodically injecting himself with a serum. The film follows Blade dealing with a rebellious uprising within the Vampire community. After saving Dr Karen Jensen (N'Bushe Wright) from a Vampire attack Blade becomes aware that a plan is unfolding in the Vampire community who up until then have generally remained quiet and discreet as a community who lives side by side with humans without them knowing. Deacon Frost (played by Stephen Dorff) is trying to become all powerful despite the Vampire orders express wishes. He is part of a new order, not born a Vampire but turned into one, keeping his human characteristics which include greed and the need to be all powerful. He has stumbled onto some old literature which talks about the Blood God/Demon. Believing he can invoke the demon Frost sets his plans in motion but he is one ingredients short of success, the day-walkers (Blade's) blood.This is a thoroughly enjoyable film and in my opinion is probably the best I have seen Snipes on screen, I even like Dorff, thinking about it I can't recall many other stand out films that Dorff has done before or after this. The plot and script are straight out of the comic world and such are punchy, dramatic and humorous at times. The effects in this film are great, from the way the fight scenes unfold to the way that the vampires meet their demise. The film is dark more often than not but that's because of the nature of the subject and vampires not particularly liking daylight - this is one of Blade's strengths so there are daytime shots too, don't worry. The soundtrack to the film is fantastic, a lot of thought went into making both the film and the musical score fast paced and exciting and it really worked. Other actors in the film hold their roles well from Kristofferson playing grumpy Whistler, to others like ex-porn star turned actress Traci Lords and Donal Logue as the cock-sure vampire Quinn. If you haven't seen the film and you like action, adventure, a bit of horror, comics, heroes, or vampires then you should enjoy the movie. Although it was a moderate success at launch it become a cult favourite and has since spawned two more sequels bot of which maintain the look and feel of this film.I'm awarding this 8 out of 10.",Blade

Snipes is perfectly cast as the morally ambiguous vampire hunter. His nemesis is Stephen Dorff, who is trying to spark a vampire takeover. Dorff is only satisfactory as the lead vampire, is physically unimposing, and doesn't seem to be on screen that much. Kris Kristofferson is interesting as Whistler, Blade's weapons and knowledge expert. N'Bushe Wright is OK as the hematologist, who ends up rescued by Blade and then helps him in his battle against the vampires. Donal Logue from ""Grounded For Life"" seems like he's doing a Sam Kinison impression throughout the movie in his role as one of Dorff's main baddies. The film is just under two hours long, but it moves swiftly enough to make it seem shorter. The action is fast and loose, peppered with computer generated effects, martial arts violence, blood, and gore. Many reviewers commented on comparisons between the effects and violence from Blade and The Matrix, but it should be noted that Blade was released before The Matrix, not after it. From the opening sequence at a vampire rave to the final obligatory face off between Snipes and Dorff, the film consistently provides satisfying action and plot turns, although it's hard to overlook the fact that it's somewhat formulaic in structure. **1/2 of 4 stars.",Blade

The way it works it is dated with very little and uninteristing plot, with terrible villains and little character development for our hero (closer to the 80's in that sense).But it is visually really cool (taking in consideration that the special effects are dated) and the cinematography just works overall.
Maybe it was the need for more humor (or better humor) and definitely the need for better exposition scenes, a better plot and better villains and worldbuilding. Well, actually all of those things forced me into a low rating, even if I did enjoy the movie alot, right until the last third.
Still, not awful, just maybe dated and too 80's and 90's, when ridiculous unrealistic human behaviour was totally fine, taking away any sense of realism or plausibility and lessening the enjoyment, at least for me.",Blade
88,SanteeFats,Good stuff,8,19 March 2013,"I now own all four of the Blade movies. The three with Snipes are extremely entertaining. He seems to actually know some katana moves (his sword type from the samurai of Japan) or at least someone in the movie did. The leather clothes and the cape are a little over the top but what the heck. Of course the bad guys are really bad and the good guys are almost as bad but only to the those that deserve it, the vampires and the familiars. Kris Kristopherson is great as Whistler. Daniel Logue is way to nuts to be taken seriously which is a shame because I like him. IMDb requires way too many lines as far as I am concerned. A pithy to the point review can be left with fewer that 10 lines of comment.",Blade
89,tim-764-291856,THE original vampire action flick...,8,8 July 2012,"You might think, from my IMDb reviews, that this mid 40's film-lover just doesn't ""do"" comic book action films. I don't 'do' bad ones but Blade I've always really liked.Apart from the odd, obvious computer graphic, this near 15 year old film still looks fresh, with witty exuberance and big, impressive sci-fi sets. The range of characters is suitably colourful and impressive, with a great turn from a gruff and scruffy Kris Kristofferson, as The Whistler (who's a vampire hunter) and sexy, sultry black girl Dr Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright).However, it's Wesley Snipes, always looking lean, mean and imposing and great in his black leathers that transports the film from a hum-drum half-hearted affair to knock-out action movie. He's mean with his fists, shoots 'em up like a mean mother and snarls impressively quite a lot. Stephen Dorff, as the evil rival who's intent on entrapping clubbers at his nightspot and using them for him and his pals to feast on.As a vampire story, it's an interesting and entertaining twist on the familiar theme. Yes, the film does rely a huge amount on CGI, but for once the SFX add to rather than swamp and they still look really good.Above all, Blade is brisk, smart, flashy and violent but with enough of the other bits to stick it all together, really rather nicely. Superb.",Blade
90,CharltonBoy,Superb action movie,8,2 November 1999,"Well what a film! Blade is one hell of a good action/horror movie. Weslie Snipes is great as Blade the vampire slayer. This movie has some amazing special affects and i bet you have never seen so much blood in two hours. Your in for a treat here ,sit back and enjoy.  8 out of 10",Blade
91,stamper,"Move over Buffy, here comes Blade!",7,23 September 2003,"Before watching this film, I had relatively little knowledge of the comic book character Blade. I'd only seen him as a special guest' once or twice on the animated series of Spider-Man I was watching when I was in my early teens and the only things I remembered, were that he was a vampire hunter and that he seemed to be a native American. In the film version dedicated to Blade, he still hunts vampires, but instead of being a native American he is black. I, for one, do not care, but if there would be a film with a black Spidey, an Asian Wolverine, a blue Hulk or a black Kingpin in a Spider-Man film, I don't think I could bare it. Now I'm not judgmental or something, so I would not dismiss different colored characters immediately, but I guess for some characters it would be harder for me to stomach, because I like them more than others.
Getting back to this film, I must say that it starts off great, with an original insight into the lifestyle of modern vampires and some good old action. The film just immediately finds it's pace and luckily it stays on it for the bigger part of the picture. The contributors to the films capability to do that the actors. Wesley Snipes is good as vampire hunting Blade as is Kris Kristofferson as his elderly sidekick Whistler. The best performance though, in my opinion, comes from Stephen Dorff, who not only seems to enjoy playing Deacon Frost but seems to actually become Deacon Frost just for the take of each scene he is in. He doesn't just act Frost, he breathes Frost, he IS Frost!
The direction of the film, is OK. Nothing great, nothing bad. The choreography of the action sequences is mostly good and there are just some minor things (which are present in almost every film) that could have been improved in those important departments (important for an action film that is!). The things I do not like about this film, I would like to blame on the script. First of all I feel that Blade's personal drama could have gotten a bit more attention, so that he could have more depth as a character and second of all I didn't quite like the ending of the film. Why? Well, first of all, the ending is somewhat predictable. Secondly, I felt that it could have been more original and spectacular. I mean, throughout the film Frost makes such a big fuss about La Morga, that  in the end I couldn't believe what kind of wuss the prophecy foretold. Last and maybe least, the lines in the end aren't too good. Well maybe that is putting it a bit too harsh, but Blade screaming Frost' over and over again seemed a little lame and unoriginal to me.

92,tbills2,Blade Is The Daywalker,7,17 December 2013,"Blade is a slice 'em and dice 'em and leave 'em for dust, super action fantasy adventure, that's rated R and pretty bloody. It's a Marvel adaptation of one of the lesser known comic book heroes, Blade, that has thus went on to become a successful movie franchise. One of the original and one of the greater comic book films made, you'd have to go all the way back to 1998 to remember this comic classic, Blade, have we all forgotten about this movie? Blade is fairly awesome! I don't hear about too much worthy praise for Blade but in time Blade will surely be remembered and appreciated for the generally awesome movie that it is.Played bestially by Wesley Snipes, Blade is a legendary vampire hunter who is a half-breed, half-man half-vampire, only one of his kind, making him The Daywalker, giving him all the strengths of the vampire but with none of their weaknesses. In his fight against evil, Blade's equipped with an extensive arsenal of blades and guns and special gadgets to stay alive with, and he's a master of the martial arts with superhuman strength and capabilities. Blade's one man army weapon specialist, Whistler, makes all kinds of useful toys for Blade. Deacon Frost is the street smart, book smart, driven bloodthirsty lead villain vampire obsessed with unleashing the Blood God, La Magra. Blade ends up taking a liking to a human who is about to turn, Karen, unless they can find a cure. N'Bushe Wright appears in one of her best roles. She's incredible as Karen. N'Bushe Wright is physically impressive alongside Wesley Snipes. Kris Kristofferson is really awesome in Blade. Kristofferson gives a really moving performance. It's one of his better roles. Stephen Dorff can be found in one of his top roles. Dorff is believable as Deacon Frost and very good.Blade's razor-sharp from end to end, nicely pieced together with spectacular fight scenes, bass-pounding techno, excellent storyboard, intense action and star-powered acting from Wesley Snipes, Wright, Kristofferson, and Dorff. If you're a fan of this type of a movie and you haven't seen it yet, GO WATCH IT, and HURRY! Blades's a really cool flick!",Blade
93,ivo-cobra8,The best vampire slaying movie ever my number one favorite Blade film,10,30 October 2015,"Blade (1998) is the best action/horror vampire slaying movie ever made! I always have enjoyed watching Blade. My number one favorite Blade film I love this film to death. It is one of the best action sci-fi films of all time. Wesley Snipes best role till it's days ever! No one can play Blade like Wesley Snipes did! Blade is not an origin story, but it is a real world of darkness. Blade is just so bad and anti-hero which is perfect for the world he drives in. It is my favorite comic book Vampire movie. I love this film, I love the action and I love everything in it! I love Wesley Snipes and Kris Kris Kristofferson so much they have such a chemistry between each other. Wesley Snipes Kicks ass!!!!! This is the most super hero Vampire slayer film ever made!  It is been so long since I last watch this film. I kept watching it 11.year ago in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was been released I kept watching Blade 1 and 2 on my CD on my computer and on VHS tape that I had this film. Blade of trilogy was the only film I owned on VHS I did not owned Blade II or Blade: Trinity at that time, but I have now the whole trilogy on Blu-ray. The best dang vampire slaying movie ever (say that fast five times)! Its funny too, it shows him killing a bunch of vampires but then regular people are thinking that he is killing humans! I watch this film as a child and all the blood in it and the violence made me crunch. I grew up with this film, 11.years ago kept constantly watching this film over and over, till it's days it is my favorite best Vampire flick. Blood and the crunch in this movie is AWESOME!! Just awesome! So In this movie Blade is a half human, half vampire, hybrid he protects the human race from other vampires and in this movie he has to stop Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff). Deacon Frost wants to resurrect the blood god ""La Magra"", And he needs Blade's blood and he needs 12 volunteers. So that he can walk in the sunlight and declares extinction to human race. Blade is humanity's last hope!Wesley Snipes plays a half-mortal, half-immortal charged with ridding the earth of a race of vampires led by Stephen Dorff in this action-packed blockbuster.This movie right here oh my god! is this movie AWESOME! Watching this as kid you really don't know much, other that Wesley Snipes is a Bad Ass!!!! But now when you are older you can really know how much of a bad ass Blade really was and he does making a point! Wesley Snipes is AWESOME! Yes awesome!So yea... Wesley Snipes does a good job in this movie, everyone does a great job in this movie, so far, even Donal Logue as Quinn with a long hair and beard hi did a wonderful job. Stephen Dorff is actually pretty good, I haven't really seen much of Stephen Dorff's work yet, I'm pretty sure he is not even around today, I am not sure what happened today, I'm not sure if he just drop off the map or if he just quit acting all together, but yea. You would never guess this was MARVEL movie because MARVEL's name was nowhere near this property so far. So that was kind a odd to see this choice but yea, we all knew who he is anyways, so that become kind a cool, and yea violence, blood, the gore amazingly AWESOME!!!!! Yea, I brought the word amazingly back. It is crazy, over the top, sword fights, knives throwing's, all this wrapped in the one and you get that final fight between him and Deacon, dang that is good time! That is good awesome times you know. And it is just nothing like that right now and I am hoping that we get another sequel to Blade: Trinity. The actress Arly Jover who played Mercury, Deacon Frost's girlfriend was so sexy and hot and she is so awesome with her hair and changing her hair styles for 11.years I was confused with a thought that Deacon's girlfriend was played by Traci Lords because she is blonde. It took me so long to figure it that out, that it was Arly Jover played Deacon's girlfriend and not Tracy Lords. What I like about the character Blade are his gadjets, the sharp ones in particular and his outfit and style! Bottom of line It is my favorite best film still I think Blade II is a little better than Blade, but I still love the trilogy. Movies like this don't exist today. The rating I give to Blade is 10/10",Blade
94,mitsubishizero,An underrated anti-hero movie,8,27 September 2020,"Wesley Snipes was born to play this role. It may not even been that well received upon its release which's a shame but regardless, this was a sold film. Wesley Snipes plays the title character dedicated to keeping vampires from taking over humanity as we know it. Aiding him is whistler and a nurse(N'bushe).As if exterminating vampires isn't enough, he has to deal with an ambitious young vampire named Deacon Frost(Stephen Dorff) who's determined to make vampires the dominant species and will stop at nothing to accomplish that goal.What I like about this movie are the action scenes. They're well choreographed and edited. The sword fight at the end is crazy(and I mean that in a good way). The dialogue is good though sometimes it can come off as flat. The exposition's mostly straight to the point.Blade's an underrated film that I recommend you watch whether you're a comic books fan or not. This's a movie you definitely want to sink your teeth in to.",Blade
95,FilmOtaku,"Amazing  a ""comic book film"" done reasonably right!",7,10 December 2004,"I have no idea why I had never seen the ""Blade"" films before, especially since it is based on a comic book, (Marvel at that) and a relatively obscure one from the 1970's/80's at that. However, it was decided by my boyfriend and one of his friends that since ""Blade: Trinity"" was coming out this week that it was about time to get up to speed. Generally, it was a pretty good experience.Directed by Stephen Norrington (""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"") and starring Wesley Snipes, Stephen Dorff and Kris Kristofferson (did I ever think I would be saying those words?), ""Blade"" involves a vampire hunter (the title character, played by Wesley Snipes) who has a little of the vampire blood running in his own veins. His mother was bitten by a vampire while she was pregnant with Blade, who was subsequently born a ""half-breed""; half vampire  half human. He has the strength and thirst of a vampire, but he is able to walk around in daylight and ages like a human. Together with Abraham Whistler (Kristofferson), a fellow vampire hunter who took Blade in when he was 13 and raised him/trained him, they a pitted against Deacon Frost, (Dorff) a ""young"" vampire who is not only super cool, but super ambitious as well. He needs Blade's blood to summon La Magra, the blood monster, which would enable him to reign over humans, rather than exist among them, as vampires have been doing for centuries.I was pleasantly surprised by how stylish and fun this film was to watch. It was slick and Blade is a cool character. The techno score was very appropriate and added to the great action scenes. I particularly thought the early scene at the rave/bloodbath was great. It really kick-started the fast pace of the film and gave us enough background without spelling everything out for us. The only real criticisms I had were in the CGI area  the whole blood monster/antidote thing was pretty over-the-top and should have either been scaled down a bit to work within the production's ability, or handled in a different way completely, because the result was very cartoonish, but not in a positive way.See this film if you like action films. I'm pretty sensitive when it comes to horror films (read: wuss) and I wasn't scared or startled once. This is a fun, sleek film that was definitely worthy of a franchise. 7/10 --Shelly",Blade

97,AngelHonesty,Over Rated,5,7 January 2020,"I love Vampire Movies, Underworld Is one of my favorite Movies, but I find this show is very lacking. It's mostly about Wesley killing/beating up vampires the entire time. The plot of the show isn't very good; extremely lacking, the lines are terrible, and the CGI is really bad. The filming is okay, but the gore is way over done making the show distasteful. It would have been nice if Blade himself would have had more of a character. He literally is just a ""Tough Guy"" who broods all the time. I do enjoy the action in the movie and the different views of how a vampire can be hurt or their abilities they wield. Since every show has a different opinion on the vampire, it's always entertaining to see the differences.",Blade

Snipes was born for this role and he adds depth to a role that might've been one dimensional with someone else. This is a cult film that I would love to see it again on the bigscreen, or 4k for a secondary choice. Both Blade I and II are impressive visually and allow the series to shine, where others have failed. Vampire films tend to be very generic and seeing a stylish comic book film adapted this way was impressive. Supporting cast only add to the style of the film.

101,gigan-92,A Decent Hero/ Vampire Flick,8,18 July 2009,"Overall, I give this film a decent 7.6. To start I'll say I love how the character was portrayed and adapted on to the screen. If you read comics occasionally or simply watch DVD extras you'll see the Blade character is drastically different from the one we see in the film. Among the changes, Blade is now most importantly half vampire, therefore acquiring ""all of their strengths, but none of their weaknesses."" The credit for this goes obviously to David Goyer, a fellow fan of the darker genre of comic books. Thanks to him Blade has become a much more interesting character and I find him one of my favorite anti-heroes really. Wesley Snipes is born to play this role, although some would've probably preferred Dezenel Washington or Will Smith. His acting here doesn't need to be exactly Oscar winning per say considering the character but I'm glad he decides to play the DayWalker in the two sequels. Also starring is Stephen Dorff as our main villain and Kris Kristofferson as Blade's Alfred so to speak. The acting is good actually and the action keeps the plot going for sure. The opening scene in the club is one of my favorite parts I've got to say. I have to pick apart a sense of extra non-realism: a black man in a leather coat with a sword beating the #$%^ out of a cop in broad day light some how going unnoticed by the crowds walking by seemed kinda..well...dumb. Moving away from a few of its flaws, the music by Mark Isham was great and fitted the film nicely. Luckily stunning sequel, ""Blade 2"" improves itself.",Blade

103,Bogmeister,Fighting Modern Vampires in the Big City,7,4 February 2006,"It's a glimpse into how Hollywood works and thinks that, with all the primo Marvel super-heroes to choose from, even including 2nd-tier heroes like Luke Cage & the Panther, the first successful big budget Marvel film is based on an obscure supporting character from the little-known 'Tomb of Dracula' comic book. The key to the success was upgrading the Blade (Snipes) character to be a cool bad-ass in the big city, with neat weapons and wardrobe, not to mention super powers lacking in the original comic book version. On initial glance, the movie could be a standard action thriller from the nineties, but director Norrington imbued this with enough style and mythology to make this a cut above most of those. Rather than an old Gothic atmosphere, everything points towards the modern, the sleek. The actual 'Dracula' character isn't present; instead there's an entire secret cabal of vampires, ruling in secret - for one reason or another it seems all of the police force is employed by them. There are different 'grades' of vampire in this story - those born as vamps and those turned. The so-called pure bloods form a ruling council. They exist in an unspecified truce with human bigwigs i.e. politicians - which comes as no surprise, I suppose - all bloodsuckers would support one another, right? Also borrowed from the comic books is the villain vampire Frost (Dorff), portrayed as an elder man in the books, but here a turned arrogant punk aiming to change the status quo. The more interesting aspects of the story have to do with the internal conflict among the new age and the older generation of vampires, not the usual battles between humans and vampire monsters. Blade himself in not really human, being a kind of hybrid, having the strengths of a typical vampire and none of their weaknesses (sunlight, garlic). His fights are martial arts-influenced, with the added FX shots of his opponents disintegrating as a fatal blow is struck. Some dark amusement is provided by Donal Logue as Frost's no.2 vamp, never quite getting that killing blow from Blade, just losing a limb every other scene. Logue and Dorff, tho, never seem quite in sync in their scenes together, with Logue stressing the humor and Dorff playing it very straight. But they manage, in conjunction, to provide the necessary menace for Blade and his allies to stand against.The film veers a bit into inane territory for the climax, when Frost is planning to unleash something called 'La Magra' on the world, which I believe was meant to turn everyone into vampires. Instead of the planned 'blood god' FX, we get a souped-up version of vampirism in Frost and some extra martial arts effort from Blade to wrap things up. Snipes is stolid as the hero, letting loose a grin every now and then when the prospect of graphic violence rises up. He and fellow vampire-killer Whistler (Kristofferson) are supposedly close friends but you get the impression they're together only because they both hate vampires. It's a rather somber unemotional world they both exist in, with nothing more than resolute soldiering a guiding force. Blade would continue to soldier on in two sequels.",Blade

The special effects are in a world of their own. This is one of th most thought out comic book based films you will ever see and it has a great cast. It's good to see Kris Kristofferson and Udo Kier.

I'm usually not one for vampire movies, but this movie did a pretty good job of keeping me interested.  There are only a few things in the movie that really drove me up the wall.  SPOILERS AHEADI couldn't stand the ""Pearl"" character.  What the heck was that?  That was a useless character to put in the movie and EXTREMELY out of place.  Why does everyone look human-like except for this disgusting thing?  Dumb Dumb Dumb!!!I also hated the way the vampires exploded at the end of the film.  The computer animation looked HORRIBLE and like a cartoon!  I don't know why the director insisted on having the vampires blow up like a balloon and then explode all over the place.One other thing that kind of bothered me, but wasn't anything terribly infuriating was right at the end of the movie when Blade throws the vile in the air and spins around and kicks the vile-dart-thing into Frost.  Sure it kind of looks cool, but c'mon, NO ONE could do that!Other than those three things in the film, I thought it was great, and truly enjoyed the film.

So it was only natural that i was skeptical when viewing this for the first time. But i was actually surprised at how entertaining this movie turned out to be! Blade (Wesley Snipes) is a half man, half Vampire who hunts evil Vampires and try to protect humans from the bloodthirsty creatures of the night. Now however he has become the hunted one. His special half-breed blood is interesting to the Vampires since they think it can be used to summon the mighty blood-god.There is mainly one reason why this movie works so well. And that is the action-scenes. There is a frenzied pace here that just keeps going throughout the whole movie. The acting is of course over the top, but still suitable to the movie. Stephen Dorff is entertaining as a Vampire leader, Wesley Snipes is suitably hard and composed as the hard-case Blade. There is some gore in this movie, but i think it's balanced quite nicely. It never becomes excessive.So watch this movie for the heart-pumping action and high pace. It's not movie of the year, and it's not Oscars material. But entertaining it is. I rate it 7/10.",Blade

He has got the strenght of a vampire, but he has also got the thirst for blood from the vampires.  To supress his thirst for blood, Blade uses a special serum.

Soon there is a party in a vampire-nightclub, Blade enters it and begins killing the vampires.  The action- and fight-scenes in this movie are incredibly well directed and cool to watch, the soundtrack is very suitable for this movie, and Wesley Snipes is perfect in the role as Blade.  Blade is a modern adventure, and takes place in an urban environment, instead of the rural environment that most vampire-movies takes place in.

The difference for this film is that it's created for an older audience. There is a lot of bad language and is very violent. This doesn't make the film bad. The film is actually very good. All the actors playing vampires, are made up to look like a vampire but not too much like one. The Blade characters is perfectly played by Wesley Snipes, and really brings an interesting character to the film. There is a lot of fun action sequences to watch too, but i found a few problems with the CGI. The CGI did look fantastic, especially for it's year, but i found some sequences a little bit odd looking, especially the look of the blood bubbles. Still, Blade is a wonderful film which i definitely recommend is your old enough to watch it and enjoy horror or comic book movies.""Quinn...""

114,buiger,Good visuals are not enough...,5,10 April 2015,"Now, first I must say that I am not a fan of vampires, vampire movies, etc., which probably places me in a strict minority. Having said that, 'Blade' just goes to prove my point: A rather boring, totally predictable movie full of far too many choreographed ballet scenes (read: fights), which does absolutely nothing to make us develop any feeling whatsoever for the characters. Consequently, we couldn't care less who lives, who dies, or how. The acting is sub-par in my opinion, but this may also be due to the non- existent screenplay. On a positive note, the cinematography, special f/x, costumes and soundtrack where all very good. Unfortunately, that is all this film really is: an over-sized, extremely expensive video clip.",Blade
115,markovd111,No blood on that blade...,6,24 November 2019,"Blade has one of the most cool openings of any super hero movies. It is with pain that I watched the rest of the movie, seeing how all of that could be so much better than it is. My biggest issue with this movie actually has nothing to do with story or acting. No... It's about blood. When Blade enters that club at the beginning of the movie, you expect to see a monstrous bloodshed. I mean, it's not like it's problem to show blood, they already drenched the whole club in blood. But no, when Blade kills vampires, they just disintegrate. Why?! It feels so out of place and wrong, it literally pains me to see action scene potential not being used to it's fullest. So, what you have left is vampire killing machine who kills vampires, but that killing doesn't look as nearly as spectacular and fun as it could look. And when you add to it the odd pacing of the movie and the way characters are developed, it doesn't really make us care all that much and in the end, you are left with really mediocre movie that could have been so much better if it's makers knew what they wanted to do. 6/10, try to watch it for fun...",Blade

Blade is a half-man, half-vampire good guy trying to help the mortal humans from Stephen Dorff and his group of vampires taking over the earth. In my opinion, this movie has the best martial art moves that I have seen since Rumble in the Bronx! I must give Theo Van De Sande (Director of Photography) mad props on proving his skills with this movie. I can't wait until part 2!P.S.  If you own a DVD player, buy the Blade DVD; if you don't own a DVD player, BUY ONE!  Geez, it IS the 21st century!",Blade
117,chrisbrown6453,This was a really cool movie.,9,15 May 2002,"Wesley Snipes is Blade, a half mortal, half vampire. His mother was bitten when she was pregnant with him, and when he was born, he inherited all the vampire powers (strength, agility, and regeneration) and none of their weaknesses (sunlight, silver, garlic). But he is human in that his life goes at the same rate as all of us. Vampires tend to live a lot longer. His life is spent killing vampires, and searching for the one that infected his mother. The movie starts with a nasty birth scene, and quickly turns into a bloodbath. Literally. There's a very cool fight scene, and then the rest of the movie is spent following Blade. The major plot (killing vampires) is good, but the inner plot wasn't well developed. Stephen Dorff plays a vampire leader. He isn't a pureblood (meaning he wasn't born a vampire, he became one), and he wants vampires to take over the world. So he translates the ancient vampire Bible, and learns of a way to summon the blood god. Great, but what does that mean? The whole blood god thing isn't explained. Why is that such a good thing? And when the blood god arrives, he isn't all that much better than any other vampire when it comes right down to it. So that was disappointing. Otherwise, I liked the movie. I enjoy these gothic/action-adventure/vampire/thriller type films. They always have an awesome soundtrack, and pretty good fight scenes. And these days, the special effects are a compliment. Blade is no different. Some of the special effects are cool and revolting at the same time. But they get the point across. And Wesley Snipes does a great job playing Blade. Now I haven't read the comic books the movie is based on, so I don't know how faithful the movie is, but he was very cool, and very menacing. And what I really liked was that he didn't display a lot of emotion. Sometimes in these movies, the bad-ass good guy has a heart that comes out way too often. Here, Blade has a heart, but it comes out very, very rarely, and then only for a few seconds. The rest of the cast was adequate, nothing really special about them. The scenery was good looking, and the direction wasn't bad for someone I've never heard of.  Many quick editing and shaky camera movements, that worked well during the fight scenes. What I did like about the story, was how they made vampires seem more human than creature. They discussed how to kill vampires in a way that made it seem like you could actually kill them, and not just like they were invincible. And who would have thought that something that became famous during the O.J. trial, would have played such a big part of the climax? (You'll have to see it to understand what I'm talking about, and if you still don't get it, write me and I'll tell you about it.)
Overall, Blade isn't for everyone. The blood effects can get brutal sometimes, and if you don't like the whole vampire thing, you may not like this. But I enjoyed it, and I think it's worth seeing on a big screen.",Blade
118,domino1003,The Best of The Trilogy,8,30 June 2005,"""Blade"" is the best of the series and loaded with action and martial arts. Blade (Wesley Snipes)came from an unusual birth: his mother was attacked by a vampire and dies giving birth to him, resulting in Blade being half vampire/half human. With his mentor/weapons master Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), Blade is on a mission to hunt and destroy vampires that run the city. Seems that these are not your typical vampires: They're like the Mafia. Lead by the Elder vampire Dragonetti (Udo Kier, who seems to make a career out of playing bloodsuckers), the vampire organization has their fangs into many different pies, and also own the cops. Of course, Dragonetti's pain in the neck is Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff, playing it cool), who believes that humans are their meal ticket and shouldn't be coddled. Frost is also digging into the legend of La Magra, the blood god that will pretty much wipe out humanity, and Blade's blood is the trigger to releasing La Magra. Blade, with the help of Karen (N'Bushe Wright), a scientist that helps Blade by creating a neat weapon to fight the bloodsuckers off, goes into battle, but not before he discovers a secret connection between him and Frost.Action packed and loaded, and interesting twists to vampire mythology (When disposing a vampire to the sun, Frost and Co. watch by wearing heavy sunblock and motorcycle outfits. Clever!). Snipes does the action thing pretty well.",Blade

Simple story. Some logical flaws in the scenario. Fight scenes look good, but have some slight continuity and timing problems, noticeable when viewed multiple times.The ugly. Nothing.The result. Solid entertainment for action or vampire lovers. Don't expect complexity.",Blade
120,SkullScreamerReturns,Wesley Snipes' action star moment,6,21 August 2021,"Wesley Snipes was a rising action star in the 90s but he seemed a little bit like a second-tier guy compared to Stallone and others he worked with. I think Blade was his shining moment where he got the spotlight to be the lead star. Another highlight actor is the charismatic Kris Kristofersson as Blade's ""Q"" type weapons supply sidekick.I saw this film in the late 90s and my memory was that it was pretty good. Now I watched it again after a long time. It was good but not quite as good as I remembered...but it has enough entertaining value to not be boring.Pros: Snipes is a very cool Blade. This is casting done right. He looks great in his leather coat and he also does some great looking fighting moves. I don't know if that's any particular real martial arts style but the only thing I'm considered is that it looks good. I mean...it looks even more cool than masters like Bruce Lee...Minor cons: The plot is ok but it's a bit cliche and not as great as I wished for. Special effects...not aged very well but the good thing is that the movie relies more on physical actors than shiny effects so this is not a big deal. Music: some techno/industrial that tries to make the movie feel very ""hip"" for the 90s' kids but feels a bit dated now. But it's only occasional so, once again, I can live with it.Overall: a little bit better than average Marvel movies. See, Blade doesn't feel like a comic book superhero movie in the first place. Even though it is based on a comic book character, the movie's style is more like ""90s' action film"". It might not be a super classic but I recommend to watch it once if you like action films.",Blade
121,supertom-3,"Style, Class and gallons of blood!!",10,21 September 2001,"This film is superb! Wesley Snipes Plays Blade the vampire hunter with pure class, he kicks butt in such a fluid and violent way that would make Bruce Lee proud. The movie is a fast paced, thrill ride of action and superb stunts. The first action scene and last are outstanding and Wesley looks like a Terminator as he runs around wiping out all suck heads. The script is pretty good and there is sharp dialogue too. Wesley should have done more action films than he has, i know he is a very good actor and in this he is not streched as much as in his more comic or drama roles but as far as action stars go he is the best actor of them all, only Bruce Willis, Stallone and perhaps Tom Cruise (if he counts as an action star) come close. Also aswell as Wesley being quality, Steven Dorff is also very good as the bad guy. It was an unexpected surprise that someone of small stature compared to Snipes should come across as menacing, but he does. Overall the film is sharp, stylish and i hope the sequal is done with the same sort of pace.",Blade
122,skybrick736,Blade,8,26 July 2015,"The film Blade, is one of the very first all-out action vampire movies that are often seen today in modern horror films. What's great about Blade is the likability of the two main heroes, performed by Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson. Stephen Dorff also was tremendous as the ruthless Deacon Frost, that was the leader of a group of young club-going vampires. The filmmakers didn't shy away from their use of gore and take advantage of the R rating being an extremely violent movie. The gore could have even been better though, if the filmmakers didn't use the cheap trick of dissipating vampire ash when struck with silver. There are many horror films out there that are pretty brainless, but Blade is brainless in its own way by having top-notch fighting sequences and a story that's fun and easy to follow. It's slightly outdated, but nostalgic in the fact it's one of the very first, fast-paced superhero movies, which are all too common place nowadays.",Blade

He hunts vampires at night, particularly Deacon Frost, a dangerously power hungry vampire.Wesley Snipes is awesome as Blade. He is able to turn a kind of cool comic book character into an amazingly cool movie character. Everybody plays their roles well. The action in this movie is non-stop. It doesn't let up. The fight scenes are awesome. Blade features one of the greatest sword fighting scenes in cinematic history. The special effects are pretty realistic, save for a few sequences, and they're cool to watch. The movie is really well paced. It doesn't slow down or get boring at all. Everything is really good all around. This is probably one of the better comic book films, and definitely one of the greatest vampire films.8/10",Blade
124,Rammstein-2,The very definition of bad adaptations,4,24 January 2000,"I have always found movies that are made from graphic novels interesting. Some of them are very successful in the attempt to copy the stylized world of comics. The very best example yet is Matrix - I've never seen anything like that film.But Blade is much like the Batman movies: nice tries that won't work. Both Batman and Blade are quiet, angry people who never smile (except for Clooney, who seems unable to wipe that stupid grin of his face). They walk around, do their thing dressed in the most indiscreet clothes you can possibly wear and then get out again.Yeah, Batman is just kind of a parody - but Blade tries to be more serious. Which doesn't work, or course. It's about as serious and profound as a puddle of water on the street. The action is nice, yes, but it is obvious that the budget for Blade wasn't half as big as for Matrix, because it is too rapid and shaky. Some gestures, such as the REALLY corny Maculay Culkin ""yes-I-just-nailed-the-bad-guy""-gesture in the vampire disco or the completely unnecessary pauses he makes with his sword, are probably a token of the original comics.As for the acting qualities of Snipes, well... I'd like to see him in a normal movie, one where he doesn't act like someone completely improbable. Like Howard's End or The Bridges of Madison County. Or then again...maybe not.",Blade
125,bh_tafe3,Well made 90s actioner,8,30 November 2014,"Wesley Snipes has been in his share of instantly forgettable garbage in his career, but in the 90s he was a formidable talent in the action genre. And Blade is one of his signature roles.This sleek, glossy entry into the action genre is credited by some as leading to the reigniting of comic book properties as workable franchises, but to be honest, I was not aware of the Blade comic series going in, and I'm not too sure how many other people were in 1998.In the film's opening scenes, we start in a normal looking nightclub, that turns out to be a vampire rave joint where they have blood in the emergency water sprinklers and feast on humans. In comes our hero of few words, identified by some frightened and overawed vampires as Blade, and he wipes out pretty much every creature in the club with a funky looking sword and some cool martial arts move while muttering tough guy one liners. It's a nice, bloody, clichéd opening to the film, and gives you a real pointer to whether you are going to enjoy the next two hours or not.Blade is the story of a half vampire (Snipes), retaining his humanity through blood transfusions administered by his grizzly mentor Whistler, (Kris Kristofferson in an excellent career reinvigorating performance) who is able to walk around in the day and kick some serious vampire ass. He becomes something of a legendary adversary in vampire circles, and the nutty vampire antagonist Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff in a rare worthwhile role) decides to invoke an ancient ritual to give him super evil powers to rid the world of the day walker. This is a potentially ludicrous plot that is played straight by Dorff's enjoyably malevolent villain, who is a hard enough man to be a genuine threat without coming across as unstoppable. This is where Blade succeeds where a a lot of films get it wrong. When the villain is too unstoppable, the writers can't work out a way to actually defeat the villain in a satisfactory way and we end up with either a nonsensical rushed resolution or a deus ex machine solution. Not here though. The final showdown is suitably over the top and dramatic, and as an audience we can buy into it.Coming on the back of The Vampire Chronicles and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Blade was more than a simple cash in. It was an entertaining, lustily violent, well made action film in its own right. This is a high point for Snipes and Dorff, a new type of comic book movie and one of the better actioners of the late 90s.",Blade
126,ozthegreatat42330,An OK Flick But...,6,22 March 2007,"This was an OK film, however I found the gore to be overdone, got tired of watching the exploding vampires, and found the scene with the character ""Pearl"" totally disgusting and unnecessary. Too much gore tends to desensitize you after a bit and the shock value tends to be lost. And thank God someone finally killed off the Traci Lords character, a major irritation from the beginning. Other than that, I thought the production was well done, and Wesley Snipes was at his very best. Kris Kristofferson also performed well, as did Steven Dorff. I would like to have seen more film time time for Udo Keir, who is a true horror icon. The concept of branded human ""cattle"" as familiars was also an interesting twist. One mistake that I noticed. In the scene where the twelve are gathered in the temple Raquel destroys one of the twelve with a sword. But when the ceremony begins to change Deacon Frost into La Magra there are still twelve vampire clan leaders. Where did the extra leader come from? And don't say she didn't kill him, the disintegration is very clear on the video. I actually found the sequel to be a better film.",Blade

But this is something like Batman meets Zorro with a nocturnal protagonist who also wields a sword and various other sharp implements. I hadn't seen this much blood since Duke Nukem 3D. The villain is really good too and we get to see Donal Logue from the TV sitcom Grounded For Life as a voracious minion of the vampire Deacon Frost.

In order to satisfy his thirst for blood he takes a plasma serum that his mentor and fellow vampire hunter Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) developed, but its effectiveness is waning. Also along for the ride is a doctor (N'Bushe Wright) who was unlucky enough to also get bitten by a vampire but who is conveniently a hematologist who just might be able to develop a cure for our heroes problem. Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is our hero's nemesis, a leader among the vampires who were infected as opposed to the more reserved purebred vampires, and just to make things a little more interesting Frost has a sinister plot in motion that must be stopped.Snipes is well cast in a role he could sink his teeth into (sorry), it may not be the role of a lifetime but was certainly an improvement over some of the parts he had inexplicably taken. In the character of Blade we get an intriguing tortured hero, and while this isn't a character piece its still interesting to watch. As for the rest of the cast, Kristofferson is fine in a fairly stock role, but both Dorff and Wright are fairly forgettable.A movie with lots of noise, lots of gore and lots of visual effects, it's certainly enjoyable on a live action comic book level.

129,deepfrieddodo,Snipes Is Brilliant As Blade,9,22 December 2020,"Wesley Snipes is the perfect casting for Blade, and a lot of its brilliance comes from having him as the titular character. Aesthetic plays a big part in it, but his martial art abilities provide such excitement in the fight scenes. As far as vampire films go, particularly in a modern day setting, it's hard to beat this. The plot is swift and provides a good story arc without dwelling too much on the semantics, keeping the film punchy with action.For 90% of the film the special effects/CGI hold up pretty well, everything happens so quickly in the fights (it is Snipes after all) that you've already moved onto the next oncoming villain without dwelling on the last. However, towards the climax the 90s effects become visible and take you out of the moment a little bit. The biggest shame is that Snipes won't be part of the MCU, and we weren't able to see his character in the wider universe, it would have been brilliant to see.",Blade

There a few reasons why: the story by David S. Goyer is wonderful and very creative based on the comic book.  Mark Isham's musical score is great to listen to and helps the film in some of the battle scenes.

He runs the streets hunting down vampires, along with his mentor Abraham Whistler(Kris Kristofferson). They're tracking a vampire cult. Meanwhile a vampire by the name of deacon frost(Steven Dorff) is secretly plotting a master plan to overthrow humankind and make himself a god. Blade was one of those films at the time that made waves primarily because of it's tone. It was one the first rated R comic book it had swearing and it had blood. It was a movie targeted more toward serious readers. Wesley Snipes was the perfect casting for blade he stoic and serious badass but snipes still adds some wit to to the character. Alot of his action scene are nicely choreograph many the hand to hand combat is really entertaining. I know Disney working on a film with Mahershala Ali but,Wesley is blade and that gonna be some difficults shoes to fill. That's primarily because Snipes himself really wanted to do this movie, he had the passion for this similar to Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool. When you actually have an actor who really cares for their role they're going to always give it their all. Kristofferson As Whistler is good a great as blades mentor You feel a strong bond between these two even though it more that macho non expressive relationship. The character of Karen is honestly pointless. Outside of her being hematologist There's no reason for her to accompany blade around. Stephen Dorff you can take him for what he is, he's not imposing he's not scary or a badass. He's a modern teen drama vampire. A rebellious guy who looks like a whiny douche, that looks more concern with his hair and throwing a fit. He not a character you would expect For a blade movie you look right at him and Immediately think of course blades gonna kick this guy's ass.

The film does however offer just enough cool mart arts action, impressive special effects, and solid performances by the cast. Wesley Snipes is admirable in the title role of Blade a half-human half-vampire who becomes humanity's protector from the sinister forces that threaten their world. Snipes is believable in the role especially in the action/fight sequences. Stephen Dorff is effective as the villain Deacon Frost but he isn't given much to except for a few action sequences and his showdown with Blade at the end is sort of a let down. Kris Kristofferson, N'Bushe Wright, and Donal Logue are good as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. Udo Kier and Traci Lords show up for brief appearances but neither of them ever get the chance to leave an impression. The action/fight sequences are well executed featuring fierce bone crushing moves but the final fight between Blade and Frost was a bit disappointing compared to the ones that came before it. The dialogue wasn't the greatest at times either and the lack of suspense weighed down a bit but everything else made up for it's flaws.

Blade is kind of the same as Blade 2 in many aspects. I just enjoyed the guys in Blade 2 more...they looked incredibly ferocious.  This movie is a modern vampire story, with some nice elements but not really captivating action. Blade is the interesting one, as he is half/half. And then you can look at him out of two points of view: by a vampire, he is considered perfect; by his human part, he does not consider himself so.   The story of the movie is unspectacular, with some nice fight scenes, but that's kind of all. Not really much impresses, beside the good special effects. Not the actors, not the plot, nothing. This movie just doesn't seem fresh.   The only smarter part is the one about the conflict within the vampires. Pure blood, or not, does it really matter? Same question as in Harry Potter...just had to think of it. Here we see in a brutal way that it does not. But by this we neglect the fact that all pure blood vampires have more experience than the new ones, but still they are too few.
   This movie showed the vampires in a dark view. The only light is Blade. The vampires are everywhere...I would say that if it really is so, then why doesn't the world know anything about it...the vampires aren't perfect, and some of their victims might have escaped. Like the guy at the beginning...and I believe that there still is a vampire-free TV station...   Anyway, the movie is just shallow. Worth a 6.5 maybe...out of 10.",Blade

The previous released Marvel adaptation had been a film version of Captain America that was produced for a extremely low budget and ended up going straight to video, which was appropriate considering how terrible it was. There had also been an abortive attempt to produce a Fantastic Four film, but after the completion of the film, it was shelved when producer Bern Eichenger made a deal with director/producer Chris Columbus to produce a big-budget version (which would take more than a decade to actually make it to screen). It was into this environment of calamity that emerged a film centered around a little-known Marvel character named Blade. Blade, a half-human, half-vampire who has devoted his life to destroying other vampires, didn't seem like a likely choice to bring some light to the Marvel universe, but it did and managed, in many ways to breathe life back into Marvel film adaptations.Written by comics aficionado David Goyer (whose personal collection of comics reportedly stretched into the thousands), Blade was a vehicle for Wesley Snipes, directed by a former make-up effects artist turned director named Stephen Norrington. The results, while not perfect, are rather entertaining for a action-driven comic adaptation. Blade starts off with guns blazing, featuring a high-energy action sequence in an impromptu vampire nightclub where vampires gather to feast on unlucky victims. The sequence is full of energy, some rather tense suspense at the appropriate moments and well-staged fight sequences.It is from here that the film's plot begins to unfold: the world is secretly ruled by an ancient race of vampires who control much of the financial empire throughout the globe, manipulating humans and using some as their pawns. Blade, assisted by his mentor, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), a man whose family was killed by a vampire, hunts down vampires from city to city, desperately attempting to rid the world of this scourge. It is after a vampire bites a doctor involved in blood research, Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright), whom Blade attempts to save from becoming a vampire, that he finds himself drawn closer to his arch-nemesis, Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), who is attempting to translate ancient vampire text to discover the secrets of a all-powerful deity who will transform the world into vampires.Blade is not high-art, that is for sure. The film is not designed to change your life or make you think deeply about important issues. It is, however, designed to provide some entertainment for it's running time, and pulls it off fairly well. As with other films of it's type, when a complicated culture has to be introduced to the audience, an outsider is the perfect opportunity, and Karen Jenson provides that entrance into the world of the vampires, allowing for exposition that is not unrealistically placed. We learn a fair amount about the film's vampire world, and it proves interesting at times. However, this is first and foremost an action film, and Blade services that aspect well. Beyond the opening scene, there are several major fight sequences in Blade, all well choreographed and destined to get the adrenaline pumping. Director Norrington uses some stylization during the course of the film, including time-lapse photography, but doesn't overdo it like other films heavy on action in recent years.Wesley Snipes is strong in the role of Blade, making an indelible impression, even with limited dialogue. He looks the part of hardened vampire killer and wears the role well. Kris Kristofferson is good as his mentor Whistler, providing some necessary levity at moments and giving us a more human hero to latch onto when Blade proves a bit less than talkative. N'Bushe Wright is serviceable in her role, but proves to be a somewhat bland companion for Blade. Stephen Dorff gives a good performance as the villain, without going over the top.Blade is not quite as good as other Marvel adaptations that followed it in short order, such as X-Men and Spider-Man, but it is a decent piece of action film-making that does it's job well.",Blade
140,aramo1,The Matrix owes a lot to Blade,7,6 October 2001,"Interesting twist on the Vampire yarn - fast, loud and moody. Despite my initial fears Kris K carries his part reasonably well and Snipes aka Blade provides a formidable physical presence. Lots of blood, steel, silver, burning and exploding bodies provide an enjoyable :) 110 minute distraction. IF you like the black look of The Matrix then Blade will appeal to you, Blade even has a 'dodge the bullets' sequence.",Blade
141,XhoXhuXhamen,"Hahaha, The Vampires Are Gonna Kill Us All",7,17 October 2021,"So much of me wanted to give this film a 10. Unfortunately, I'm a PURIST when it comes to Dark Films. And if Trite Humor and Cheesy Dialogue is included, my rating drops. That said, Blade is one of the Best Comic Book Character Films ever made. Wesley Snipes does an excellent job in the role, especially with the choreographed action scenes. Unfortunately, the casting department didn't look for a more believable actor than Stephen Dorff, but that's life in a Vampire Coven like Hollywood.As far as the directing went, I thought it could have been better. A better director would have nixed the Pointless Humor and requested a change of cast members. By contrast, the Underworld Series remained Dark from the 1st film all the way to the last. Why? Because it had a better director and a far better cast.That's my review. If you want details, watch the film yourself.",Blade
142,Meredith-7,"Far too graphic, but it has a nice look",5,23 July 1999,"I dont think much of Blade as a film, it was not particularly entertaining, and it certainly did not add anything new to the cinema world, or the tale of vampires for that matter.  It has a very modern, cool look to it.  Blade has a nice costume and some extra special weapons which he puts to good use. But some of the violence was a bit too graphic, and unnecessary.  The story itself is quite stupid and Dorff is really annoying as the evil vampire, although not quite as annoying as his bimbo blonde side kick who really should take some acting lessons.  I was just really bored by the whole experience.  A total waste of money and time, but it could have been so much better.",Blade
143,CrassActionHero,The Sharpest Blade,7,16 December 2006,"Blade (1998) Review: Blade gives a rather new twist to vampires. With Wesley Snipes as Blade, expect some action. I looked forward to this. Here we go.Our hero Blade stalks the night. He hunts vampires. Unlike Vampire Hunter D, he's not a bounty hunter, he has an agenda. The villain is Deacon Frost done well by Stephen Dorff. His agenda, to rule the world.The action is tight and quick. Blade seems rather unstoppable. His sleek and destructive way of dispatching the vampires is damn cool to watch. Wesley Snipes is pretty good as Blade. his performance is quite good and gritty. Good choice as Blade.The atmosphere of the movie is perfect. In the dark and decadent city, vampires lurk for prey, so does Blade. The scenery is very stylish, dark and corrupting. Another plus is Blade is not just another faceless hero, we get character development. Blade is not in the mood to talk about his past. You will find out why.Blade also has a decent plot. The villain here has a rather sinister plan at hand. Blade is also not a goody two shoes. He pretty much lets his actions speak louder than his words and is brutally honest. I like the gritty hero, not the milk drinking, say your prayers, and eat your vitamins hero. Blade is the better anti-hero. Blade does have a few drawbacks, the bad vampire henchmen are not that menacing. Most are just a group of faceless mobs that are dispatched with ease. The only henchmen worth looking out for is Quinn played well by Donal Logue.The Last Word: Blade delivers. I enjoyed this one the most. This is a stylish take on vampires. One more thing, Blade is violent, so sent the kids to bed and enjoy.",Blade
144,MichaelMRamey,One Of The Beat Comic Book Adaptations,8,16 April 2018,"I had heard of Blade for years. He was a character I knew about and also some of the things that made him.

Although it may be a bit too flashy, every scene, and even every shot in a scene, is filled with tension and suspense.  The editing is great;  The music adds to the film's tension. The use of a luminescent red in various scenes, even those not involving attacks (I don't think I am imagining this) conveys the blood seeking of vampires. Great stuff.",Blade
146,sam_smithreview,this is how super hero movies should be made,10,25 April 2016,"1990's Wesley Snipes was the Action star with movies like Passenger 57, Demolition man and Murder at 1600. So When Blade was announced and Wesley Snipe was the main lead, a lot of people were excited. Wesley has a black belt and is a known martial artist too, so with pressure on making a successful comic book movie in a dark tone following after the failure of the Batman franchise, one of the biggest comic book franchises of all time, The film had a lot to prove...And did it, boy! Blade was Amazing, it had great scenes awesome Soundtrack! pretty bad ass fight scenes and a cool villain played by Stephen Dorff. The Origin story of Blade was quick and useful with exposition, which meant that there was more time to actually focus on the story. Wesley Snipes performances, is arguably one of the best comic to live action movie adaptations. Forget Bale, Downey Jr or Keaton as your number one comic to movie faces. Snipes was Blade! His acting was great, his presence was felt. Dorff did an amazing job at being the self centered leader, who wants his people to rise.There isn't much negative to say about the film, one could point out the blood effects, but when you watch in the cinema it looked real as hell. Another thing should be said about the film, was it was actually first who used the whole slow motion footage, and not the matrix which came out 6 month later.",Blade
147,chvylvr80,One of the best vampire movies,9,20 October 2003,"The Blade series is a shot in the arm to vampires movies, action movies, and sci-fi movies put together. Blade remains one of the best comic book adaptations and the best black superhero. Wesley Snipes is perfect to play Blade since he has the look and physical ability to pull off the roll and since brotha Snipes isn't really given the credit he's due, this is a great vehicle for him.The fights in Blade are the best things about the movie. Plenty of swordplay balances out the gunbattles so there is something for everybody. The soundtrack fits each scene perfectly and like the sequel's, it's a great techno soundtrack. The tone and look of the movie is dark but that enhances the look and the feel of this kick ass movie. There is not much slow time and the slow time that there is is dedicated to explaining some of Blade's story. The supporting cast also does a fabulous job. Kris Kristoffersen, Donal Logue, and Stephen Dorff fill out their characters completely and all are accomplished actors.Bottom Line: Although bested by Blade 2, this is still a great movie and the DVD is filled with great extras. A must have if you like action films.",Blade
148,metalrage666,Repeated views certainly make for average appeal.,5,20 September 2016,"Unfortunately the years have not been kind to Blade, and for me at least, the less said about the sequels, the better. When this first hit the screens I loved it simply due to the constant action, however watching this now just leaves me with a very real feeling of ""meh"".To be fair, as a comic book adaptation, Blade works a real treat. I was never a fan of the comics, but from what little I do know, this stays faithful to the comic legend, his origins, his skills and abilities, but leaving the comic book lore behind for a moment, as a movie and in retrospect, it just no longer works for me for a number of reasons. The action in of itself is relentless and bloody. There's enough gore to suit most horror fans and enough action to satiate most needs on first viewing, and that can often be enough to initially love this for what it is. The fighting is choreographed as well as any ballet but it's when you delve a little deeper into what's really going on that the love eventually fades.I can accept that as a person who was endowed with vampire strength, giving him heightened senses and coupled with his skills with swords, knives and all manner of weapons would make him a formidable opponent, but to be completely unbeatable is little far fetched and honestly, quite boring. What's the point of watching a hero go about his business if there's no Achilles heel for his enemies to exploit? Watching Wesley Snipes effortlessly smack people and vampires around like they were rag dolls, reminds me of any Jet Li or Steven Seagal movie where no matter the odds, they win every fight, they never get a scratch or even manage to break into a sweat. It becomes a little monotonous to watch after a while to see that the only time Blade takes a hit is when his hands are tied, and with his regenerative ability, merely getting punched in the face a few times is the same as ripping off a band-aid; it might sting for a second but who cares? All the vampires know about Blade and refer to him as the ""Daywalker"", so they know what he's capable of yet they all insist in taking him on one at a time. The opening sequence in the abattoir/underground night club has the whole crowd all pent up with blood lust yet Blade dispatches many with ease like it's a day at the beach while the others all run screaming for the exits. I could never get why these blood-thirsty vampires never attacked him en masse. Persistently going one on one seems redundant and suicidal. I also take issue with every group of vampires acting like bumbling fools when confronting Blade. None of them seem to be able to shoot straight and even when there's ten or more with machine guns, no one manages to get a shot off before Blade shoots them all. Whether they're vampires or human familiars, watching them stumble around trying to kill or capture one man gets frustrating. I'm not watching a comedy so why the Keystone Cops routine? Vampires are supposed to have super speed and reflexes, something that's witnessed in one scene where Deacon Frost dodges bullets, yet everyone else manages to get shot, stabbed, punched and kicked with minimal effort. We are also told that while crosses don't actually work, sunlight does, however that's rendered moot by some good ol' fashioned sunblock. So apparently vampires can be Daywalkers too if they wear an SPF 50+. Although the jury is still out on whether you need to wear a motorcycle helmet with the visor down, or just the sun-block and no sunglasses. It's the same sun, but do you need to protect your eyes or not? Make up your minds.I felt that Kris Kristofferson was totally miscast in this as the shuffling perpetual angry and irritated senior citizen and partner to Blade. Despite his tech prowess, Whistler is completely useless in this, even more so in the sequel and seems to only serve as some kind of joke to old age.I was going to give this only 4 stars but had to increase it by one simply due to N'Bushe Wright. She's so hot in this and whenever this is on late night TV, she at least makes this watchable. Sanaa Lathan is also not too bad to look at as Blades' mother, (despite her being 10 years younger than Snipes), so having them both in a film that's getting worse with age is at least one redeeming factor. My growing distaste for Blade may be in part due to the excessive and saturated feel that vampire movies have had on audiences. Along with the Underworld movies, the Twilight Saga and various other random vampire flicks that have done the rounds in the last 10-15 years, overload and boredom was inevitable. Blade isn't a bad movie by any means, and is worth a look if you catch it on TV when there's nothing else on.",Blade

153,bannonanthony,A brilliant start to a brilliant trilogy.,8,22 June 2005,"I have now seen all three BLADE movies so I thought I'd review them all now. This, the first film of the series, did not disappoint me when I saw it for the first time. My parents had seen it ages before I did and gave me their opinion. I agree with them on some things and disagree on some others. For instance, they complained that Stephen Dorff was pretty unconvincing as head vamp Deacon Frost. I personally thought that Dorff was very good in the role and could be very menacing at times. But this is Wesley Snipes' show and he is excellent as our hero, the half human-half vampire Blade. Known as the Daywalker, he is the bane of the existence of the vampires who have their fingers in many pies of human society. Adding excellent support is Kris Kristofferson as Abraham Whistler, Blade's mentor and weapons creator.The cast overall is very good and the action scenes, such as a battle in a vamp nightclub at the start and Blade's final assault on Frost's stronghold are staged brilliantly. Stephen Norrington is, in my opinion, an excellent director and he delivers the goods with this movie. As a fan of muscle cars, I'm also glad that Blade has some cool wheels here (a black Dodge Charger). My only gripes would be that Frost's minions, with the exception of the luckless Quinn, can be pretty faceless at times and that I think Frost should have turned into a giant monster for the final fight as was originally planned. That aside, this film kicks off the BLADE trilogy excellently and I'm glad that David S. Goyer was the writer for each one as the world he creates is truly stunning.",Blade

155,Jexxon,Anaemic,5,11 January 2005,"Half man, half vampire Blade (aka Wesley Snipes) is out to kill off vampires in general, and Stephen Dorff's brat-pack-vampire bad guy in particular. The latter having a nasty scheme where he's intends to take over the world (or something).The film starts off, and continues, in quite a violent fashion. It's definitely not PG-13 stuff either, but surprisingly hardcore action. In a sense, it's more gory and violent than the more ""unreal"" (but in my opinion, better) sequel Blade 2. For the first half or so, things happen at a steady pace with both nice action scenes and cool characters - but then things start to fall apart.Gradually, the plot gets increasingly stupid, and the proceedings come to a screeching halt. Not that there has to be constant fighting and blood flying around, but the way too long and talky conclusion of the film was pretty uninteresting. I just couldn't give a damn about what happened anymore. The bleak gritty look that worked so well in the first half suddenly just feels gray and boring.Some editing to tighten the film and keep up the pace from the opening would have made it so much better. As would a decision to forget about dodgy CG-characters for the end battle in favour of some man to man (or as the case may be - vampire to vampire) battle that doesn't leave one character fighting a blue screen.

156,psycho_153,GOOD ACTION/HORROR MOVIE!!,5,29 December 1999,"This was one of those slick action movies that was made to look good on screen, and it did, the vampire fighting sequences were excellent, there was plenty of blood and gore the whole movie looked good to the eye. It was a fun watch and very entertaining. Good movie but I didn't like how Blade could slice vampires in half and they would just die, it looked good but vampires don't die by getting sliced in half. Other than the vampires and how many rules were not kept to in this movie, Wesley Snipes gives a good performance as Blade and Stephen Dorff is great as the evil vampire. The story is when Blade's mother was bitten by a vampire during pregnancy, she did not know that she gave her son a special gift while dying: All the good vampire attributes in combination with the best human skills. Blade grew up to be a vampire hunter for revenge on his mother's death. The vampires, who managed to infiltrate nearly every major organization, need Blade's very special blood to summon La Miagra, the blood god, in order to gain reign about the human cattle, as they call us. If you beleive that vampires can only be killed by a stab to the heart and the weapon must stay in the heart and chopping the head off are the only ways to kill a vampire you won't find that in Blade. But Blade has it's moments and I would recommend it as a good horror/action movie.",Blade
157,maxmages,"So everyone who loves Twilight, will hate Blade.",7,13 January 2018,"In itself a super cool movieBlade is definitely super cool money for the movie as well as for the main character. However, the film has little '90s troops that are quite outdated and take something out of the sails of the wind, the same goes for the' 90s CGI effects, but instead kicked 3 annoying action movie cliches as it should be.I love to watch movies that stand out from the others. I love it when I do not know who in that time a surprisingly big part and I love R rated comic book adaptations (Blabe came first).But there are many things about this movie that bother me, such as the constant shaky cam, is a tripod really that expensive? The back and forth intersect between the normal dialogues, not everything has to be presented excitingly high 10, because that makes the really exciting something bland. The main villain is just as old as muscular and looks as cool as the hero, so it would be better if he stings out more, especially as he is in a wheel full of old men who look like they are having children's souls to fight to the top as he represents the new kind and the new danger. Then do it too dangerously enough: if your rogue is not cool, then make him ... huge and scary, scary, super strong, diabolical, or at least entertaining enough that it does not interest you like boring.Seriously Deacon Frost just does not say it out and behaved like that until the climax, I wonder why we and the ever wasting our time with him, at least if he was super pretty and always well-dressed, you could at least to conclude that he served only as their figurehead and that would explain his motivation but unfortunately no! Nothing like that!Or we just change a few character traits and attributes in this movie because Frost's right hand, his asshole, was so nasty and so annoying that she always wanted to clap her hands when Blade missed one, her jokes were damned funny and his whole character so exhausting that you're just waiting to satisfy the feeling of salvation when he finally dies. (Unfortunately, a fight as well as his death like sex with a tuna can is painful, disappointing and totally anti-climactic.But those are the mistakes in the script that was probably stretched to double length (with over 10 minutes of filler), an amateur music video editing and post credit scene which for some reason was inserted after a blackout but before the credits, there are only a few plot Holes in the bad plan but otherwise there is not much to find worthy in this movie.The fights are exciting, so the characters are super interesting the whole movie has a cool look, only half of the movie is night city and even the scenes that take place at night are neatly photographed and lit up so you can see enough and that Film has enough stuntwork for about 50 trailers.",Blade
158,BB-15,"Old Blood, New Bottles",6,8 August 1999,"Is there anything more ridiculous yet still fascinating than vampire movies? I cannot explain their almost 100 year old appeal but Blade is another in a long list which I enjoyed and here is why.First there is a style twist in Blade combining 40's film noir with vampire conventions. (In a much stranger way Dark City also tries for this kind of look.) Second, our vampire is the opposite of the usual sophisticated blood sucking aristocrat. Blade's central character is a Schwazenegger Terminator macho antihero except that Wesley Snipes can act. Add some martial arts, lots of shooting, vampire mumbo jumbo, gross zombies and you have an above average action film. There is a Ghostbusters apocalyptic subplot that I was able to ignore almost through the entire movie until it overwhelms the story. But soon that was finished and Snipes went on with being cool. Speaking of Snipes, he just oozes a menacing intensity. Coupled with Kris Kristofferson as the grizzled side kick and N'Bushe Wright as the damsel in distress and you have the foundation for Snipes to be his big, bad self.
Blade is basically an action film that has the right mix of movie styles to make it worth watching.",Blade
159,no-skyline,Great Character - Patchy Movie,7,27 January 2006,"Blade is a quality comic book adaptation with some real visceral action and possibly the best opening sequence to any movie of this kind. I wont spoil it to much for those who haven't seen it but Blade wiping out vampires in the opening club scene is absolutely awesome. Even with the 100's of millions of dollars thrown at the likes of Spiderman, X-Men etc the effects in Blade for the most part still hold up today.Of course the problem with a great opening sequence is can you build on that and top it come the end of the movie and unfortunately this is what holds Blade back from being a great movie. Wesley Snipes was made for the part of Blade both physically with his fight stunt work and in his brooding performance and thats what makes this film. Anyone else in the role is unthinkable. The problem comes when Blade isn't kicking a** the movie really slows down, also none of the action sequences really match that first adrenaline rush. The plot is mostly irrelevant there's something going on about a blood god but really who cares it's all about Blade looking cool and kicking vampire a**.A quality movie for action and comic book fans that just falls short of being great 7/10",Blade

I am also a comic book fan so I know plenty about the comics. With both in mind, I don't see much room for hate.If you are a fan of the comics, you'll see that they got the Blade character just right. Wesley Snipes pulls off the role as if his life depended on playing the part. Stephen Dorff isn't exactly the ""old man"" Deacon Frost but to call his performance crap either way is harsh. The other performers do a good job with the other standout being Kris Kristofferson as Abraham Whistler.In terms of action this is probably one of the bloodiest films I've ever seen with the bloodiest being Punisher War Zone. The gore spills out realistically and the burns also look realistic, Udo Kier combusting in sunlight is an image that sticks with you.In terms of overall plot this is relatively simple - Blade tries to take down Deacon Frost, the vampire that killed his mother.The execution is purely for those who like action-oriented vampire films such as Underworld or people who know the comics and want to see their favourite vampire-hunting comic book hero to be brought to life.Overall if you are into these types of films, this is a must see.

Despite its sub par critics reviews the movie still managed to make 70 million domestically and 131 million worldwide. It became a film that was beloved for its action set pieces and the interesting character of Blade, but when I watched the film today while I can see a lot of great action here this film lacks on giving a compelling and interesting enough story and it also ails in making the characters really that interesting either. While Blade is great to see on screen being portrayed by Wesley Snipes all the other characters along with the main villain do nothing for this story to make it interesting. N' Brush Wright's character could have been really something interesting, but she is not and instead feels very pale compared to Wesley and she and Blade have no chemistry together on screen. Stephen Dorff is a character that could have been great but is instead merely just a sideline Marvel villain before there was a MCU. Which is quite sad to say cause I saw some potential at the beginning of the fill for this character, but sadly he is nothing of notable interest. Overall Blade does have good fight scenes and is defiantly different from most vampire films.

167,Rumples,One of the better comic adaptations,6,23 May 1999,"Blade is violent, unpleasant, cliched and even a bit corny. But it is still a fairly entertaining movie and a classy action/horror film. Yes the script is flimsy and the storyline a tad unlikely but that doesn't stop this film from being interesting. I felt that it started out quite strongly, not being familiar with the comic I was intrigued at the possibilities, but faded badly at the end. Anyways, don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed. But if you're prone to queasiness and don't like the latent sexuality behind all that biting, sucking and blood, give Blade a miss. My vote 6/10",Blade
168,poem,"Good effects and much fighting, but no horror",2,1 February 1999,"When I saw the first announcement for this film, I thought it must be great (I'm a big Wesley Snipes fan). Seeing the preview lowered my expectations, and the movie itself was a disappointment.It is most of the time nothing but an average action movie, and even if the effects and fighting scenes are good to excellent, the story itself was quite flat and boring, and there was nothing about horror. The vampires were just evil humans with some special abilities, not a symbol of forces or fears in our subconciousness, our animal inside, or of natural forces (such as the pest), or such. The start of the film is the best part of the whole picture; Traci Lords plays Racquel (even if nobody ever calls her with a name in the movie), a vampire woman, which takes a human victim (a man which believes she loves/likes him) to a vampire disco. That whole scene culminates more and more and really makes you shiver - it was a very good start --- until Blade appears and starts the first of the well known boring good hero fights: the good hero kills everybody (i.e. every vampire) and is soooo cool and soooo invinceable and sooooo boring... one of the vampires he kills is Racquel, and later I thought that this was quite symbolical, for she has been the one which had ruled the only really good scene of the movie. The later film never comes back to the level of the start. There are some nice jokes in it (exploding vampire blood etc), and many effects are excellent (but not that strange scene where the blood god is created. that looks just absurd), but the fighting is nothing but the well-known typical unrealistic stuff. In all his films, Wesley Snipes is a natural cool one; but here he _tries_ to be cool all the time, and becomes, of course, very uncool this way.This film has been compared to Spawn, but Spawn is a totally different kind of film; a good family movie where good fights against evil, and good wins. At least that movie was not promising what it cannot keep. Of course, the film about Spawn was very different than the comic; while Blade was really close. But I expect more of a vampire movie, especially if they have such excellent actors, than only an action movie with expensive effects.",Blade
169,WilsonLau,Good give,10,30 October 1999,"This movie was excellent and shows that Wesley Snipes is amongst the best actors of this decade. The film is non stop action, very detailed. The only beefs I had with it was that the vampires disintegrated after Blade killed them and that the martial arts scenes were hard to see. I would much rather see the corpses of the vampires, its more realistic. This guy is none stop action! I'd like to see him in a movie with another action king, Dolph Lundgren. These two guys would make the perfect duo in a martial arts movie!!",Blade
170,McFrogg,Van Helsing wins.,1,17 April 2018,"What a stupid movie Blade is. It's a perfect blend of most of the things that were wrong with the 90s. Style over substance, violent anti-heroes, extreme blood and gore, bad music, bad CGI, unnecessary use of sunglasses and fat, flatulent people...the only reason people rate this disgusting movie higher than ""Spawn"" is because of the gore. It's a very strange movie. The movie tries very hard to make us think Blade is a tough guy, but it's so forced and unnatural. The tacky opening, where blade shows up at a rave party and kills a bunch of vampires is embarrassing to watch, especially when he does that weird ""ooooh yeeeaaah"" gesture with his arm. There's a disturbing Oedipal theme in this movie too. It's so blatant that I even noticed it as a kid. The absurd quote about ""motherlovers"" suddenly makes more sense now. Maybe there's a deleted scene of Blade trying to ice skate uphill on YouTube?If that's not bad enough, wait till you see the flatulent, naked, Jabba the Huttish vampire who sounds like a smurf. And people took this movie seriously in 1998? They probably wanted a piece of The Nutty Professor's success. Fortunately, Blade and his mothe...I mean, girlfriend tortures the vampire to death with UV light because he's fat and ugly. The movie isn't really about ""good vs evil"" either, since according to this movie, the Crucifix is powerless against vampires (they took away the most interesting thing about vampire movies). Still, there are supernatural elements in the movie. The vampires worship a pagan deity called ""the blood god"", and we are shown pages from a ""vampire bible"". Overanalyzation time!Does this mean that the blood god created the universe? If so, why does Blade rebel against his creator? And why does he hunt down and kill vampires, they're just a poor minority trying to worship their god. The vampire religion is shown to be the true one, right? So in a sick and twisted way (this is a sick and twisted movie, after all), Blade is Lucifer. Now, I highly doubt that is what the filmmakers were trying to say, but when you remove the Catholic element from vampire movies, they become meaningless. I bet the filmmakers like all decent Hollywood types didn't want to offend anyone by including Christianity in a wholesome movie about mindless violence, incest and half-naked women. But what are vampires anyway? If they're just freaks of nature, why all the supernatural stuff? Skip this garbage and watch a good vampire movie instead. Like Terrence Fisher's Dracula movies or the excellent BBC version from the 70s. Or better yet, read the original novel by Bram Stoker.",Blade
171,Exiled_Universe,"An Amazing Movie, Better Than Expected!",9,25 August 2019,"The reason i even saw this movie in the first place was because of the first few minutes of the movie with the whole vampire club fight which is still the best part of the movie even after seeing the whole movie for the first time and im pretty sure most people can agree with that whether you like this movie or not. I was supposed to see this a long time from now because it was still a long way away on my schedule but sometimes i just have to squeeze movie in there because they look really good and it would be cool to see them and i am also very desperate to see them. So i have seen it and it was way better than i expected. There was way more fighting and action than i thought as well as more blood and better story line and characters. Im glad its rated r because sometimes movies, especially vampire movies or if its from marvel is not so im glad. The cinematics are really cool and different and altogether its very impressive for before the 2000's. The CGI was horrendous and thats obvious but sometimes its barely visible plus it also looks kinda cool and to be honest i dont really care about that i mean this is from the late 90's and its the first movie in the trilogy so they probably didn't have enough money until the other ones to make the effects better. My parents probably think its iffy and i dont like werewolf and vampire movies but this obviously gets a pass because its a superhero.

The first and easily the best in the trilogy, BLADE is wall to wall action from the opening scene (at a vampire dance party) to the closing credits.

Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast as Blade, and is backed up by solid performances by Kris Kristofferson as his mentor Whistler.

This film produces a lot of blood and violence, the usual predictable ending and a very thin plot. Some have compared this film to Spawn which is much worse and could even make this film look good.Wesley Snipes plays this role with little emotion, a cold killer with the advantages of being half-vampire, half-human and none of the disadvantages that go with either. I never really cared for Blade or his mentour and couldn't really get behind any of the vampires either. Without anyone to endorse, this film is nothing more than a 120 minute special-effects-filled trailer.I must note that a sequel is being made to tie up the loose ends left by this film. However, after watching this film, I can't see why anyone would even care about a sequal. Even fans of the comic book must be disappointed by this effort.I would recommend this film as a rental for an evening when there is really nothing to do.

176,Batkid1,Comic Book Movie with Stylish Martial Arts.,8,12 August 2007,"Face it, I've never liked vampire and/or horror movies, but then I rented this film and, man, was I in for a treat! This film isn't so much a Horror film, but merely a action movie w/ Vampire lore and anti-hero looking for revenge. Wesley Snipes has had a couple of good and bad roles either as a supporting or leading character, but he is merely a ""like-hm-or-hate-him"" sort of person here. He is truly skilled in a type of kung-fu and he was obviously having a lot of fun kicking everyone's butt. The supporting actors ( Kris Kristofferson, N'Bushe Wright, Udo Kier, Stephen Dorff, Sanaa Lathan ) help explain our hero's characteristics/abilities and the world that they all live in. There are a couple of cons: plot holes, gratuitous profanity, and a techno/electronic music score that only rival the above pros. And if, you, the viewer, are not satisfied, then at least acknowledge that this film helped inspire Action/SciFi movies (THE MATRIX) and satisfy Marvel Comic Productions enough to bring more of their creations to the screen (X-MEN, SPIDER-MAN).Recommende for those interested in these type of movies.",Blade
177,bullions27,Great action flick,7,23 October 2000,"Blade was simply fun. Ignore the critique a while and just sit back to watch the movie. I wasn't expecting Wesley Snipes to go Braveheart with the humans over the terror being brought down by evil vampires. I expected good action, martial arts, and lots of it. Blade delivers as an action flick. Some of the characters maybe like cardboard, particularly Blade himself, but it's not so to hurt the movie. It doesn't become too melodramatic to a degree unlike many action movies try to do with their heroes. What you get from Snipes is a good I-can-own-your-ass-anyday performance. What more do you need? About the only negative side of the movie I can tell you right off would probably have to be its reference to vampire history. ""Pure Bloods""? Vampire eccentrics will cry infamy over this novelty but that's about the worse of it.I was disappointed at the ending though, and so the DVD version is a MUST see with the alternate ending.",Blade

179,flickjunkie-3,Get Those Fangs Into It...,7,24 November 2000,"Blade looked like an intriguing idea from the adverts, so I decided I would follow my instincts and go and see it. Although Blade is not a great film, I certainly enjoyed myselfMeet Blade (Wesley Snipes). From the outset it's clear this is a troubled hero - a pre-credit sequence has him enter the world shortly after his mother's fatal encounter with a pointy-toothed demon of the night. Hardly your model birth. But every superhero has their dark side to wrestle with and being half-vampire just leaves you with an aggravating desire for meat cooked very, very rare. With a nifty serum suppressing such cravings and equipped with weaponry by grizzled armourer Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), Blade launches a one-man crusade to rid the world of vampires, forsaking the classic cross and holy water combo for a more forthright reliance on weighty darts, bullets capped with garlic essence and a sword edged in silver.With an opening sequence to die for, it is certain Blade is going to be lots of fun. Wesley Snipes is perfect for his role, and Stephen Dorff is a superb villain. Kristofferson is also very watchable. The direction is enthralling, I look forward to see some more good stuff from Stephen Norrington in the future. The script is flawed but enjoyable, and the art direction is fascinating.Blade is a film you can really get your teeth (or should I say fangs?!) into, I recommend it for action fans who want a scare!I rate Blade 7 out of 10.",Blade

182,DJ_Shilo,Hunting Season Begins,8,21 September 2018,"It's not often we get a great origin story to a well-written and severely determined vampire hunter with a deadly purpose. ""Blade"" is a gory and violent, non-stop action picture that jumps from the DC comic books and shines brightly. Wesley Snipes may have found his best role and the best performance of his career.
It's about a vampire hunter named, Blade (Wesley Snipes), whose mother was bitten by a vampire while she was pregnant with him. As a result, she dies, and he lives only to inherit some differences like being able to walk in the sunlight. While living on the streets, Blade is taken in and adopted by his mentor and weaponsmith, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) where he sharpens his lethal skills under Whistler's tutelage. After destroying a vampire nightclub, Blade rescues a hematologist, Dr. Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright) after she is bitten, in an attempt to save her. Meanwhile, a young vampire, Decon Forst (Stephen Dorff) has declared war on the human race when he tries to awaken a blood god - La Magra, that puts Blade at the top of the hunting game. The only problem is, Decon needs Blade's blood, the blood of the daywalker.Blade's origin story is well written and fascinating that I must give it up to David S. Goyer for writing the movie and doing a good job. After seeing the character in action, it makes you wonder who Blade is and what his real purpose is. Is he looking for his mother's killer or is he merely attempting to kill all the vampires, the thing he hates most? We learn a little from the opening of the picture and Whistler fills in the blanks later on as to who he is and how he came to be. Blade is a composite of a characters study because there are so much detail and background for him that the movie is not long enough to tell it all but Wesley Snipes takes the role and dives head first into the character.Mostly this is an action movie with some brilliant special effects. The source material comes from a comic book with a superhero feel, but since Wesley is an accomplished martial artist, it looks even better. He punches, kicks and slices threw vampires, and it's quite entertaining to see. There are several fight scenes in the film, but one fight scene is virtually a bloodbath as body parts burn while others are shot off, come undone and ripped apart. The opening sequence in the vampire nightclub is not only a bloody battleground, but it's got an old-school Hong Kong action style feel to it. One Vampire has his head kicked into a wall light while another is shoved into the ceiling by his chin with Blade's stakes.Throughout the picture, we don't know what's Blade's real intentions are. Something inside him is eating away, and it seems like he is searching for his mother's killer, but we don't know, but we feel there is something more. He is left mysterious. Deacon Frost is the nasty vampire pest that thinks he is above everyone and proceeds to awaken the blood god to become invincible. Deacon looks to be eternal not just the whole ""walk in the sunlight"" routine.Snipes hit an emotional range with the character. He is a commanding presence and makes those afraid of him go running into the night, well most of them. You can believe that Wesley is physically good at the action. The Climax sets Blade inside a temple where the monsters all gather together to figure out his weakness and trap him in a casket-like machine to acquire his blood. This action does not go according to plan and Blade takes the final stage with Deacon. Before we see the outcome, we see a character who is vulnerable as well. We know Blade is not the superhero he is supposed to be but a man dying to escape from what he is and possibly become human.",Blade

Stephen Dorff does a fantastic job as the villain Decon Frost. The action is top notch and by the time the film reaches its conclusion you will find yourself deeply immersed and on the edge of your seat.

185,MinorityReporter,Very stylish and entertaining!,7,15 October 2005,"It seems to me that a lot of people don't know that Blade is actually a superhero movie on par with X-Men, Daredevil, Punisher and the likes. What all these heroes (and in the case of X-Men hero group) have in common is that they were all conceived in the magical world of Marvel. Blade was originally a normal person (in a blue outfit) who chased vampires because of a personal grudge and eventually facing of with Dracula himself and he was for lack of a better word boring. So boring in fact that the character was shelved and in fact never used in the Marvel universe. At least until he was reinvented.David Goyer did a stroke of genius when he took the character of Blade and turned him into a leather clad dark knight. He can't take all the credit though and much of this must go to Stephen Norrington as well who with his distinct visual style brings out the best of the character. The Blade character (Wesley Snipes) is pretty amazing in this film and mixes martial arts with Batman like darkness. Snipes is pretty good as the title character and is successful in bringing out the duality and inner demons of the character. He is, however, a pretty rigid actor both in voice and in posture and is only interesting enough for one film (which is clearly seen from the inferior sequels). Kris Kristofferson is good as well and really brings the tormented character of Whistler to life with energy and sense of timing. N'Bushe Wright, however, is fairly weak as a leading lady making her character relatively flat and lifeless. Donal Logue is pretty funny and manages to do a lot with a minor character. German, Udo Kier, should also be mentioned as he brings a lot of finesse and style to the vampire race, probably born of his experiences from playing Dracula. Stephen Dorf provides the best acting in the film and his chilling performance as Deacon Frost stands as one of the best screen villains I have perhaps ever seen.The story is good and, I feel, renews the vampire genre (something that hasn't been done since Robert Rodrigues' From Dusk Till Dawn) by adding a lot of contemporary elements and maintaining the comic book feel. By saying that the film has a comic book feel does not mean that the film is unrealistic. Far from it. A lot of effort has been put in trying to make the film seem as real as possible. Including the effects which are pretty good for their time. I found the vampire ""dustings"" to be a very nice touch. In stead of adding a lot of blood when a vampire dies Norrington chose to let the vampires spontaneously com-bust which looks great. The fact that the overall effects were well done adds to the credibility of the film which would otherwise have fallen flat on its face.As previously stated Norrington has a very distinct visual style that sets him apart from the directors of the following Blade movies. Del Toro is nearly as skilled but I prefer Norrington's style. His style gives the film a very special look and feel but most importantly it gives the film atmosphere. A very tense dark atmosphere which works great in tune with the main character and story. Along with the visual style the music which also works fine and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the movie.All in all Blade is a very entertaining movie that should probably have had an 8 from me but a few annoying flaws (which cannot be revealed without spoiling the movie, suffice to say, many of them are located near the ending of the film) does that the film must settle with a high 7.7/10",Blade

Snipes does a perfect job as the vampire hunter, and the story gives a very interesting take on the half-human, half-vampire vigilante. Stephen Dorff portrays the villain, Deacon Frost very well, and portrays an antagonist that haunts the audience with excitement, and mesmerising chills and thrills.The opening takes a fantastic direction on the birth of Marvel's nightmarish vigilante-to then ultimately introducing himself as the Vampire hunter we all know today.Blade still captures some enjoyable moments, giving one of the ""coolest and visceral"" Marvel opening scenes still worth a watch. It certainly brings the Marvel Halloween-themed vigilante to the big screen a fantastic show of a ""superhero"" that is a little bit ""scarier"" than any other Marvel heroes out in other universe/s.Overall, the movie is not the ""best"" Marvel movie, but it's still enjoyable in other areas.

193,puttputtk,coolest vampire film?,8,15 September 2010,"Blade (1998)5 word summary Half Vampire battles evil vampires10 years before the vampire craze took over teens and young adults across the country Vampire films were actually cool. Blade is packed full of action. It has some of the coolest fight scenes and is one of the coolest vampire films made. It's not full of drawn out dialog or lame love stories like most vampire films. It does have a bit of a love story in it but it's barely noticeable. As I said the fight scenes are great. The sword fights are well choreographed and when you add in disintegrating vampires with every sword swing and every silver bullet shot it looks even cooler. The effects are usually really good. When the vampires disintegrate and things like that look good but toward the end when a hand is formed from blood and some one explodes it looks terrible, which is a shame. As for the acting Wesley Snipes did great and Stephen Dorff did even better. The supporting cast did fairly well too. Blade does have some problems, besides the occasional bade graphic. Some really cheesy dialog and painful attempts at catch phrases, but it worked out decent in the long run so I guess that's really what matters.I don't think the plot is the most original vampire story, but it is a pretty original way of telling it. Anyone looking for a good action film should check this one out. Anyone who doesn't like the 2008 style of vampire films might also enjoy it just to see some vampires get killed.

This movie has some great fight scenes in it and the special effects are very well done. I definitely recommend this movie ad if you like the matrix movies this one has the same sort of a feel to it with colors and effects and such. It is worth it to check this one out. The acting and everything are all right on I hope the other two movies are just as good. Because of how surprised i am with this movie i will give it 8 out of 10 starts.,Blade
195,shovon-1,Has it''s Flaws but a Neat Stylish movie,8,30 July 2019,"I saw it when it got released back in 1998.
I saw it again today July-2019, that's a 20 year aprrox. evolution on my overall psyche ...and I found it stylishly made even today, too. Judging with todays standards where we are bombarded with cgi in plethora ..name it.. avengers, spiderman, aquaman...etc etc. These are graphics made from software that was available in 1998, so they are not groundbreaking , but it passed off even today to label it ''stylishly made then''.
Wesley looks good, at times very good, Leather jacket and all and cool crew cut.
Bad Guy portrayed comes off with flying colours as the 'bad guy' .....chuckle.
where I recently gave Jhon wick-3 a 5 , I give this one a 8 ....in my eyes more stylish and carries more sensibility than Wick 3 -parabellum.",Blade
196,DesertDogMedia,Blade,8,2 July 2014,"Title: BladeDirected by: Stephen Norrington Storyline: We start off in a hospital with a pregnant woman being rushed in while covered in blood. She goes into labour while the doctors and nurses are trying to treat her, they perform a C section to take the child out. We are then introduced to a CONI (Character of no importance) as him and a vampire are driving through the city to get to a vampire nightclub/rave. But just as Blade shows up the music and sprinklers stop as everyone realizes that Blade has crashed their party, one guy tries to take him on but is shot with a silver spike before making it past the crowd. Blade opens fire on the ravers and starts killing them all one by one, until he runs out of ammo. This is where the other toys come into play. We see Quinn get set on fire regardless. He is then taken to the morgue where his kills another CONI and injures a main character, who Blade then saves. In the next scene we are introduced to what looks like the hierarchy of vampires along with the movies antagonist, Deacon Frost. We also get to hear Blades backstory as told by Whistler when Karen finds out that he is a hybrid. The next scene shows us Frost and his men taking out the head vampire by binding his limbs together and leaving him to be killed by the sun rise while they stay protected by their motorcycling suits and helmets. Frost than finds Blade's base and beats down and bites Whistler while kidnapping Karen, Blade then comes back to this and Whistler begs him to kill him, but Blade cannot do it, so he hands Whistler the gun to do it himself. Blade is then captured after being beaten down, so him and Karen are then taken to ritual site where the vampire hierarchy are place in their positions and Blade's blood is drawn for the ritual and it begins as Karen is able to escape. This comes to the fight scene that really shows off Blade's fighting skill, along with the fact that all of these moves were performed by Wesley Snipes without the use of doubles or anything as he is training in various forms of marshal arts. Blade kills Frost in the final show down fight and this ends the movie, but in these scenes you can tell that it is a stunt double, especially in the slow motion scenes. Acting: Wesley Snipes was perfect as Blade because he was able to pull off the stern, distant and emotionless expressions when he needed to, but was also able to give the character emotion when he needed to. His knowledge of marshal art also helped him out in this sense. Stephen Dorff as Deacon Frost, he played the suave calculating vampire role to a T, not much else that can be said. Noticeable Camera work: The fight scenes for the rave scene are well choreographed and do not contain any BS shaky cam, so you can actually see what is happening and what moves are being used. A good example of camera work is one of the shots where Blade kills one guy and spins around to punch another straight in the face, but all we see is him punching the camera at first, but the next shot shows that we were looking for the POV of a vampire, or a vampire henchmen to be exact as he doesn't turn to ash straight away and has his head kicked into the lights and then turns to ash. We also get a good 360 shot when he uses his silver boomerang blade which the camera follows all the way around. We are given another camera punch shot in the hospital scene when Blade comes back to finish Quinn off. The movie does like its establishing shots of buildings, and it is able to pull them off with style in a way so they do not feel over used. The driving scenes are also very fond of using vignette tracking shots for when they're inside the industrial area and voyeuristic shots for when Karen is sneaking around Blade's base. But in the end fight scene with Frost that is made up to use by them giving us a wide range of shots we haven't seen used in the fighting context such as shot reverse shot, birds eye shots, perfectly executed 180º panning shots and worms eye shots. Costume: In Blade's first appearance in the movie we are treated to a tilting shot of his costume going from his boots, past his chest plate and to his neck. The all black leather works quite well in contrast to the silver buckles on his chest plate, his whole theme revolves around black and silver. Overall Feel: The move is a 2 hour epic, there may be slower scenes in the movie, but they do not feel like slower scenes, they do not break the pacing in the movie. Blade is a movie which you wouldn't expect to be a superhero movie, but it is. Because Blade is owned by Marvel, but feels nothing like a superhero movie. This movie was Marvel's foothold in the cinematic universe as all other popular superhero movies were primarily DC, and the two movies that contained Marvel character didn't have movie releases and were just so the relevant studios could keep the rights to them in one case. This movie perfectly blended action with a good narrative and it was made even better thanks to the cinematographer and stunt organizer who made fight scenes visually stunning to the Nth degree. Like any good movie, it has its problems like some vampires turning to ash when they were killed without silver and such, but apart from that the movie is a great movie to watch and has great re-watch value added to it.",Blade
197,timothydao,Vampire movie,8,19 September 2021,Great action and stunt. It's a stunning horror movie that ever made. And it was from Marvel. I would recommend everyone to see it.,Blade
198,ARTaylor,The First in the Superhero Renaissance,8,23 May 2011,"Blade was the first of the modern wave of truly serious superhero movies, and it establishes much of what would follow. Gone are the outrageous vehicles, overly silly enemies, and alternate universe where time seems stuck in one decade. This movie was one of the very first to show what it would be like for an extraordinary person to appear in an ordinary, modern day world.For a character so obscure, Blade is handled very well in the film. Let's face it, before the movie he was more known for being a recurring character on the 90s Spider-Man cartoon. But afterward he skyrocketed almost to the top. Not quite X-Men or Captain America popular, but he became recognizable to non-comic book geeks.The story is good, it isn't just another standard superhero origin movie. It's handled like Tim Burton's Batman, he's already out there and fighting. The origin is just a brief explanation for the newcomer. I really would like more superhero movies to follow that model since it does work and gets the hero into the action sooner. There's the right blend of action, horror, suspense, and humor to keep audiences entertained throughout.Wesley Snipes does a terrific job. He seems to fit the role perfectly. Snipes handles both the fights and exposition well. He also has that Arnold Schwarzenegger/Harrison Ford style ""serious comedy"" delivery where he says funny lines but doesn't come off as a comedian. Now I find myself reading Blade and only thinking of his voice.Stephen Dorff is also amazing as Deacon Frost. He's the only one able to move the spotlight away from Snipes. His delivery makes for one terrific villain, though his character doesn't have the pathos many other villains have. I remember him more for his sadistic acts, but not particularly as to why. Still, sometimes a villain without a specific reason is more frightening.The other actors are also good, though most are overshadowed by Snipes and Dorff. Kristofferson's Whistler has a great relationship with Blade. Their final scene is really great, though makes me wish the series had a stronger sense of continuity with Whistler. N'Bushe Wright is good, though not particularly memorable. Donal Logue is great as the comic foil and I wish he would do more than just be the comedic relief in the occasional superhero movie.The action is the real stand-out. No stuntman in the Batsuit fighting in the shadows ten feet away. Snipes is in there doing the work. It moves fast but is never confusing. There's a real sense that they are going somewhere with it, not just trying to show random cool scenes. The only real problem with the movie is the ending. It's still exciting like the rest of the movie, but a little sloppy. That's because the producers made one ending that no one liked. So they quickly made another using many of the same ideas. The one they have works fine. But if they had known from the beginning, it would have flowed together better.The CGI is also noticeably dated and takes you out of the movie. Luckily they don't use much of it and rely more on superior practical effects.The best part is that the movie revitalized the superhero genre. Before this, there was Superman and Batman. Superman hadn't seen the screen in ten years (longer if you look at an actually good movie) and Batman & Robin had nearly killed the genre off just the year before. But notice how afterwards there has been at least one superhero a year, and now several a year. Marvel used their minor character to open the floodgates for everyone. Sure, subsequent movies have had their ups and downs. But generally speaking the quality of superhero movies has been quit good. No more nipple suits or Richard Pryor built computers.The movie's exciting action sequences and exploration of vampire lore keep this an entertaining flick. Though Blade still may not be the comic book character to read, the movie is still entertaining enough on its own merits to keep it around. And at the very least it will stand as a marker for the following renaissance of comic book movies.",Blade

200,m0rg16,Norrington is a genius,8,22 April 2006,"You'll not find a better pop corn flick, no matter how hard you try. Blade is an excellent film from the Kung Fu inspired fight scenes to the acting of Wesley Snipes.Blade is a Daywalker, a human with some vampire powers. He has their strength and their regeneration power, but also their thirst. He hunts vampires for a living and that's pretty much the plot. In this film, he goes up against the villainous Deacon Frost who wants to put an end to mankind once and for all and rule over them. Even though Stephen Dorff won't strike you as the coolest villain ever, he is still way more memorable than anything the other Blade films will offer.Kris Kristofferson plays Blade's mentor Whistler who is an aging vampire hunter himself. Even though Kristofferson is just an old country singer, he's definitely ideal for his role. Some of his lines are just golden.Stephen Norrington definitely cooked together one of the best action films I've ever seen. Now it's not something that will etch itself onto your mind and stay there forever but as far as dumb action films go this is great. The action scenes are obviously inspired by kung fu films where western slug fights are matched with eastern camera controls. Not an abuse of quick cuts that Hollywood films usually prefer and instead we get a full view of the fight which is very effective.Other than that, Blade is in this film much different than in the lackluster sequels. Here he is an animal, his hatred for vampires is obvious and he'll do anything and kick anyones ass to get them. Again, this was not present in the sequels where Blade is instead a show off. He spins his sword in nine different cool ways before finally cutting and nobody knows why. That's why you should see this film, and avoid the sequels at all costs. Norrington is one of the best action directors out there, and it's to bad he hasn't done more films.Rent or buy this film. But at least see it. It's an excellent pop corn action flick. As good as you'll find, actually.8/10",Blade
201,k844140,First decent Marvel screen adaptation,8,27 June 2021,"Though some Marvel adaptations released before Blade, they were completely unwatchable. Blade in its turn is a great lively vampire action film, which was the first one of Marvel adaptations which is pleasant to watch. It's definitely not perfect, but is good for its time and genre. Right at the beginning of the movie we can see great fighting scenes which are decently directed in this film. The directing is actually good all throughout the movie. Wesley Snipes did a great performance, as well as other actors, though Frost is quite a weird character. The story isn't entirely unique, but for a 90's vampire action film it looks fine. R rating was a good choice which some other Marvel movies lack. The film really partially looks as horror and it is a great thing. Nevertheless, the story has some flaws, such as Frost's plan. He wants to turn all people into vampires, although they need human blood to live. They would just extinct because of his stupidity, not rise like he planned. Some CGI looks funny in 2021, but of course we should remember that it is 1998 film of medium budget, and I personally don't mind it. But on the whole film is good and it surely worth watching.",Blade

The vampires are on the verge of completing the puzzle that will give them the ability to become day stalkers.  Humans are just food for the undead.  Blade (Wesley Snipes) is the key to the puzzle.  Much B&G later the good guys win the battle but not the war.  There has to be room for a sequel.  I hope there is no sequel to `Blade' or `John Carpenter's `Vampires.'

205,yasenkiranov,A very dark and stylish comic book adaptation,7,23 November 2012,"When I watched this movie I knew,that Blade was a Marvel superhero.I haven't read any of his comic books,but I am familiar with the character himself.The only other marvel movies I have watched so far were the ""Spider-man"" films and ""Captain America-The First Avenger"".I was surprised to see that""Blade"" was much darker and unlike many Marvel films,it makes you take it seriously.The Story was interesting and the characters,surprisingly,did not feel underdeveloped.The thing I liked the most however was the dark and haunting atmosphere the movie manages to create.In a couple of scenes ,where characters are introduced to the us,you can get a basic impression of what personality they have,without them even saying a word.Now that is impressive.The acting was alright,Wesley Snipes turned in the best performance,in my opinion.I did not like the fight scenes that much,however.I mean,they were alright,not that over the top,but the blood effects kinda sucked.Other then that,there were the typical cheesy one liners,but,thankfully,not a lot.Overall,""Blade"" is a dark,stylish and very entertaining action/thriller.",Blade

208,gurghi-2,Dull,3,11 May 1999,"The seriousness with which this movie took itself kept me from enjoying it; I wanted to laugh, but the wall-to-wall gore n' lore didn't allow it.  The incessantly unpleasant tone makes for a terribly boring moviegoing experience, unless you're the sort that pores over Fangoria magazine.Most offensive are the movie's calculated images- every single moment, practically every shot, is designed around the premise ""what would look cool?""  This renders characters, exposition, dialogue and action completely unbelievable.  It also has the unfortunate- and perhaps intentional -effect of glorifying some truly repulsive, blood-drenched violence.  We can expect as much from a vampire movie, but there's no subtext or allusions here (other than to other movies) and director Norrington shows no understanding of implication or restraint.Not to mention, Mr. Snipes is so pompous, I would rather have seen Blade bite it.",Blade
209,Aphex97,Blade delivers solid comic action fun!,6,18 June 2001,"All this movie needed to impress me (and all I expected from it for that matter) was excellent action and intriguing special effects. This movie delivers these aspects in spades. I was very impressed. Amazing choreography of fight scenes, and the CGI effects blend nicely with the action...The story line is your basic comic book routine: super evil bad guy has plot to take over the world. Mysterious, troubled hero must stop him. Final showdown occurs, and...well, I'll let you guess what happens. Its not the story line that is impressive, it is the presentation that makes this movie worthwhile. Slick directing, cool weapons, excellent action sequences, nice special effects with a sharp attention to detail in the use of CGI. The sets are spectacular, and the acting passable. What more can you ask from an comic action thriller? Not oscar material by any stretch of imagination, but certainly a interesting way to kill 2 hours if action and special effects are your bag.

210,stemelia21,Classic vampire action,7,24 August 2020,"This original Blade film was awesome. The first 15mins of this film were just fantastic. It had the right music, action, set, just awesome. This film gained at least one star for the sound track which was playing during the blood bath scene, which went on to be copied and named ""operation blade"". The orginal was far better.The story line was fairly simply no twists and turns. It was just a good old fashioned vampire hunter film with lots of action and vampirey goings on. Stephen Dorff played the cocky bad vampire wanting grandeur really well and Snipes was awesome as Blade. Even the lesser characters were played well. The feel of the film was good too. It was dark but not too much, there wasn't really many special effects, apart from the odd jump scene and the vampires disintegrating when killed, it all added up to the right feeling for the film.This is how vampire films are surposed to be made, nowadays their mostly about vampires falling in love with the human girl rather than eating her.I feel for this genre of films this will always be one of the better ones and holds a well deserved 7/10.

If I were to compose a list of the worst movies of the 1990's, this would surely go straight to the top. (Or is it bottom?) I tend to enjoy vampire stories, but this is the worst one I've ever seen. The bad guys are overdone and the plot is lame. The movie bored me so much that it felt a lot longer than it was, and it was overlong at 2 hours as it is! One particularly stupid moment in this movie is when the female lead is placed into a dungeon-like room and she faces some sort of horrible monster thing that used to be a friend of hers, who ""sort of"" hinted at having a crush on her before he was killed. Why he was a horrible monster thing is left unexplained (or if it wasn't, I missed something), and his presence is pointless anyway.

There was a lot of blood and gore and some of that was portrayed with CGI and it was pretty laughable late 90s CGI. The action was ok in some parts but kinda got boring after it seemed like the same moves just kept repeating. The story was ok but I didn't really feel for the characters. The performances were kinda dull. It is intriguing at times but it's not much else. One of the main characters dies but I didn't really care that much since all of the characters are not that interesting or relatable really.,Blade

The first hour was great but then some really silly CGI and darkness ruined the movie. Wesley Snipes isn't the best actor as we all know but I feel he could have done a lot more in this film. Its a Stereotypical vampire flick which like most vampire movies is set in....wait for it...Russia. The cinematography was OK but I felt the movie overall was a little dark. There was plenty of action but the film doesn't end at all leaving room for Blade 2 to formulate and the special effects were weak. Pearl was also a character that didn't need to be in the movie. I never felt anything for any character as no one was fleshed out at all...not even Blade. However I did like the first hour and Blades character was alright. The car he drives in the movie is cool though. All in all don't expect too much when viewing this one....save it for a rainy day or a time when you have a couple of hours to kill.,Blade

219,Dante Hicks,Surprisingly Good Comic Book Adaptation,7,20 May 2000,"Having seen this only after watching 'The Matrix' I can tell where the latter film got all of it's ideas. Subway and Lobby scenes, graphic martial arts, thumping music. All present and correct, and though 'The Matrix' does all of these things better and is in general a far superior film you have to give it up to 'Blade' for thinking of them first. I admit though that like many people I watched 'Blade' without the faintest idea about the comic book it was based upon and I still don't know anything about it. Like many big screen versions of such comics it fails in that it tries to deliver to both fans and newbies alike. Frankly I got the idea but I got the definite feeling that there was a lot more back story and a whole new universe which wasn't particularly well expressed throughout the film. Also, the similarities to the TV series 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' were quite obvious, though who came up with it first is debatable. Basically I liked it though Snipes brooding, invincible character made the film a little too clearcut. The man seemed to have no weaknesses, either emotional or physical, and so it was clear to me who would 'out'. Still, it's unlikely that 'The Matrix' would have turned out to be such a brilliant film had it not been for this merely average actioner so hats off to it for that.",Blade

I don't expect him to forgive me, nor let me choose another movie to watch ever again after this.After watching ""The Wolverine"" I wanted to see what an R-Rated Marvel movie would be like (apart from ""The Punisher"", which is a guilty pleasure of mine) and I thought this would be a great idea, I was wrong and if you haven't seen it I can only ask you to please stay away from it.I'd probably give it a 1/10 if it wasn't for a scene where a little Asian girl the bad guy, played by Stephen Dorff, is holding as a hostage gets thrown away into what seems to be a hot dog stand and from there to the steet, it was one of those Robert Rodriguez ridiculously funny moments and just because of it I'm giving the movie a star.I recommend you stay away from this...please don't watch it.",Blade

Wesley Snipes plays (and growls his way through) the lead – a vampire hunter called Blade – and does it rather well. A lot of action set to the heavily tecno/hiphop -based soundtrack is what the film is all about, with some humour and drama thrown in time to time. Kris Kristofferson (Whistler), N'Bushe Wright (Karen) and Stephen Dorff (Deacon Frost) support in the cast. The film's opening scene is a great one and it's rather sad that the rest of the movie doesn't quite manage to stay on the same level – we've seen the best the film has to offer after the first ten minutes or so.Blade is kinda cheesy fun, a guilty pleasure of some sort. It's over the top in in a lot of ways (starting from Wesley's growling, continuing with the often ridiculous use of music and ending with the endless sunglass-related jokes) and does it shamelessly too.

However, that doesn't detract from a movie which, although it doesn't do anything new with the traditional vampire story, does offer a fast and furious couple of hours of well choreographed action.Wesley Snipes is Blade, a half breed human/vampire mix and the only one of his kind. Taken from his mother by Cesearean section, after she was bitten by a vampire, Blade has all the strengths of a vampire with almost none of their weaknesses... garlic, silver, sunlight... all are nothing to the Daywalker. Unfortunately, he still ages like a human and he still has the vampiric thirst for blood.Discovered as a child by vampire hunter Abraham Whistler (a wonderfully gnarly Kris Kristofferson) Blade is subsequently trained into a highly skilled martial artist and fighter who hunts vampires across the US. Naturally the vampires take a dim view of this but are consistently unable to take down their nemesis due to his regenerative abilities and impressive skills, particularly with the sword. Using this and other weapons, created by the partially incapacitated Whistler, Blade is a powerful enemy, albeit one fighting against a seemingly insurmountable adversary which has its claws, figuratively and literally, in much of the modern world.However, all is not well in the vampire society. A schism has developed between true, pure blooded vampires and those who were merely bitten to develop into vampires. As the 'turned' (bitten) individuals grow in power behind their leader Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff in a selection of very cool shirts), they begin to examine ancient vampire relics which suggest that there may be a way of bringing a vampire god, La Magra, to Earth where he will initiate a vampire apocalypse. Blade must stop them.The plot of this film is well paced and interesting, although sometimes has to stretch a bit too far for comfort's sake. Still, despite the occasional lapse or ridiculous moment, sun block protects turned vampires from sunlight apparently, the tension is built up fairly continuously and the various fights and climaxes work effectively.Unlike the CGI heavy sequel and truly diabolical third film with its horrendous products placement (could you really fight someone if you were listening to an iPod!?!), the original Blade comes with few strings attached and no obvious debts to be paid (although devotees of Hong Kong cinema might take umbrage at that). Using wire work before the Matrix made it the done thing, Snipes and, perhaps more importantly, Norrington give us a genuinely super hero whose gravity defying moves seldom appear too excessive. A general (if not total) lack of slow motion and characters who are prepared to be fairly unambiguous means little distracts us from the standard good versus evil fights throughout, while N'Bushe Wright is scorching but useful (not your average screaming damsel in distress) as the doctor caught up in the middle of Blades' fight with Frost and the vampires (and who creates a recombinant viral gene therapy in about five minutes!).Gerenally Blade works very well, the reveals are unexpected and the acting fairly downplayed. However, the secondary bad guys and the Big Bad Fight at the end are less effective, the latter of which seems particularly lame. A look at the DVD deleted scenes suggests that an alternative, perhaps more apt finish was unworkable within the limited budget available. Instead the film leaves a slightly sour taste in the mouth due to its unpalatable finish but that shouldn't take away from the overall achievement of making an excellent, fun if overly serious movie that goes down well after a few jars in the pub.Comparisons with the sequels are, in my opinion, favourable. The less said about Blade Trinity the better but there is a definite suggestion that the second movie was superior. I don't agree with this, thanks mainly to the ham fisted attempts to arouse emotion, the rather ridiculous plot, too much CGI and too much gore for gore's sake. It also gains a character and loses one with almost no explanation as to the how's or why's and has the most unrealistic bunch of kick asses ever committed to film (the blood pack really should've seen an image and accent consultant before filming and what is the point in having Donnie Yen in a martial arts film if he doesn't even get to fight anyone!?!).So stick with the original and best: Wesley Snipe's Blade slicing and dicing the evil vampires with some hardcore moves, kick ass tools and a thumping soundtrack.",Blade
224,TriNitroToluene,snipes explodes bloodsucker hands with his blade,9,21 January 2001,"Action, Action, Action.  That is what you're going to get by watching this movie, not very much horror.  But when I say action, I mean the very best of action, the caviar of action!  I don't know about you guys but that is definitely good enough for me.  Snipes is an @$$-kicking brotha/vamp who has a mean streak when it comes to other vampires, especially Deacon Frost (portrayed well by Stephen Dorff).  This movie has everything going for it. Good plot, great acting, EXCELLENT CAMERA WORK, EXCELLENT SOUNDTRACK, EXCELLENT FIGHT CHOREOGRAPHY, and EXCELLENT LIGHTING!!!  Did I specify that enough?  The fight scenes are just plane and simple astonishing.  The way they introduce us to blade is very slick, you can tell you're in for a lot of action just by the first 10 minutes of this film.  The beginning was magnificent, and what most movies do is that they start out great and slowly plow downhills, Blade does not fit into that category.  The movie stays on par with the trend that it's beginning sets to the most extent, which counts for a whole lot.  Acting is done great by Kris Kristofferson as Blade's mentor, and newcomer N'Bushe Wright has an appealing prescense in the movie also.  You will enjoy this no matter who you are.  It really adds alot of technology into the whole vampire idea.  Bram Stoker would be proud to be a forefather of this movie ; )",Blade
225,MovieManiacX,"Kinetic, Bloody, & Extremely Cool",10,11 August 2005,"Blade is the movie that made me start collecting movies. I had seen a little bit of it when I was 12 and it gave me nightmares. But four years later, I rediscovered it when I bought the DVD and it quickly became one of my favorite films. What I saw blew my mind: This movie was absolutely awesome! It had everything a kick-ass action movie should have and then some! Blade is a dark, bloody, testosterone-filled action film from start to finish with a character that epitomizes badass.The opening scene in the nightclub sets the tone for not only this film, but for the entire Blade series. The action and fight scenes in this movie are intense, kinetic and well-executed with crazy stunts, impressive martial arts, and blood and ash flying everywhere. Blade has a wild arsenal with some truly amazing weapons, particularly the stake launching shotgun and the glaive (S-shaped boomerang thing) that he uses to their full potential. Blade moves so fast that sometimes it seems like a blur of leather and silver. Throughout the entire film Blade stylishly deals out insane amounts of punishment and death in some very inventive ways, especially with the E.D.T.A., a chemical that causes vampires to explode (use your imagination). You'll be cheering for Blade as he destroys any and all vampires that get in his way.This movie is very bloody. Vampires nastily disintegrate into ash after being blown away or impaled. Limbs are chopped of many times. Vampires literally rip out your throat when the feed on you. And did I mention that vampires explode into chunky heaps of blood and guts? If you like blood and gore, this movie will satisfy any gore-hound.Wesley Snipes IS Blade. No other actor could be Blade. He has the look, the voice, the demeanor, and the badass personality to make Blade entirely believable and extremely cool. When he puts on the leather trench coat and the sunglasses, he becomes Blade. In this movie, Snipes evolves the character of Blade and shows some of his human side, but not before killing as many 'suck heads' as possible. Stephen Dorff as Deacon Frost does a great job, even though he doesn't pose too much of a threat to Blade because he is so small and pale. Dorff has the menacing and brutal Deacon Frost down perfectly. N'Bushe Wright does a good job as Karen, as does Donal Logue, who provides plenty of comic relief after his repeated run-ins with Blade. Kris Kristofferson is excellent as Blade's hardened mentor Abraham Whistler. The guy is at least 70 years old, but he could definitely beat the crap out of someone half his age.Stephen Norrington shot the movie very stylishly. Everything has a blue-gray industrial feel to it, which suits the dark, tortured character of Blade perfectly. We only see daytime once or twice the entire film, which I thought was great, since it's how Blade and the vampires live. Norrington also stages some truly spectacular scenes, like in the subway and in the temple of La Magra. I really enjoyed his use of fast forward shots that show the city turning from day to night. Very nice, Mr. Norrington.Followed by two sequels: Blade II in 2002, which is just as awesome and also extremely stylish, and Blade: Trinity in 2004, which is also pretty good.The Bottom Line: Blade is an outstanding action movie, with kinetic action, great special effects, a top-notch performance by Wesley Snipes, and a dark and gritty visual style. One of my top ten movies.",Blade
226,lanycera,Maybe it's my 90s nostalgia,9,6 November 2020,"But this movie is great. I love the cinematography (I mean the opening blood rave scene is just epic), the soundtrack and Wesley Snipes as Blade.I'm not sure how it ended up on such a low rating, because this movie is better than most modern 'superhero' flicks and miles better than Underworld.
It's an excellent dark comic translation, packed with great fighting scenes and style. It's not bloated with special effects; it's dark, minimal and gritty.I recently re-watched Blade II, which was directed by Guillermo del Toro, and was equally surprised by the rating. It stayed true to the vibe of the first movie. I would rate II overall a bit less, but not by too much.Conclusion: It's going to be hard to make a remake worthy of Wesley Snipes and his Blade legacy.",Blade
227,Dorkboss,Decent Comic Book Movie,7,10 October 2018,"Other than Batman Returns and The Crow, comic book films in 90's was playing either dumb or lazy or sometimes both, but Blade was one of those comic book films that showed not only can comic book movies can be cool, but it can also be an interesting way entertain the audience, rather than being a kids film. While the did succeed at being both awesome and help getting the popularity comic book films again, it still has the 90's tropes. But aside from the writing not being perfect, there still a style and creativity that makes the film enjoyable, the characters are entertaining, the visuals are good and the action sequences is impressive.",Blade

229,MikeSmash,Blade: One Bad Mothersucker!!,7,27 January 2006,"Blade, Wesley Snipes' better hero performance, continues the story of Dracula in a twisted but cool, ass-kicking way. This is not your father's typical vampyre film. ""Blade"" is the newer & fresher version with vampires living in luxury, blending into every facet of society without much notice. Wall Street, off-shore accounts, condos, fancy cars, & club-hopping is the flavor that is favored in this film, neighbor. There has never been a vampire hunter more skilled, more prepared, and more ruthless than Blade. Blade has a score to settle with the Vampyre Clan, and that is the bloodsucker who killed his mother & made him who he became. In ""Blade"", Blade is the tortured soul, half-human & half vampire hunter from the comics who takes on a renegade vampire Deacon Frost & his posse of blood sucking idiots bent on human & the vampire kingdom domination. The Vampyre leader, Dragonetti, thinks that Frost is a major risk to his plans & orders him to take care in his behaviors. Blade has trained most of his life to effectively destroy any & all vampires in his path. He has become the one man all bloodsuckers fear, and with good reason. The heavily tattoed Blade hates a part of himself & is on a mission for a cure to end his thirst. Along with fellow hunter & father figure Abraham Whistler, Blade goes out on nightly suck-head fests kicking all the vampire ass he can to a sweet soundtrack & fabulous martial arts choreography, not to mention using the most technological weaponry. Blade, taking rare pity, saves the life of newly bitten hematologist Karen Jensen & takes her back to his hideout. Karen proves her worth by creating a vampire blood weapon which explodes them once injected. Blade & Karen find out that Frost is making big plans for the Vampyre underworld from Frost's wannabe & the archives beneath the city. Frost captures Dragonetti, takes him to the beach, & watches him burst into flames during a morning sunrise. Now that Dragonetti is dethroned, Frost takes over the vampire hierarchy & captures Blade and Karen, he beckons to use Blade's blood to release La Magra, the Vampyre God & envelope his power. Frost also assembles the entire Vampyre Council to use in summoning the Vampyre God. Blade, severely drained of blood, meets his birth mother, who was turned by Frost when she was pregnant. Blade releases his mother from her curse & gets a blood power-up from Karen. Once his strength is regained, Blade takes on vampire soldiers & finally meets Deacon Frost, freshly upgraded to Vampyre God (incredible fight choreography). After a spectacular final battle, Blade destroys his nemesis Deacon Frost & saves the world.Blade will not disappoint the hard-core vamp fans & does his karate best to impress. Good ensemble cast with Kris Kristofferson, N'Bushe Wright, Stephen Dorff, & Traci Lords. Great costume design, ultra-cool tattoos, & kick-ass weapons (beautiful sword) designed for Snipes, who plays his role with a superb tough-guy flair & quiet inner storm. Blade will delight, unless you just don't like terrific action, dark humor, & Wesley Snipes at his athletic & physical best!! Check it out!!!",Blade
230,RueMorgue,"Hokey, but so what? A pretty entertaining ride nevertheless.",8,9 May 2001,"Okay, sure, this movie is a bit on the hokey side.  It's difficult to take characters from comic books and put them into movies with any credibility (Dolph Lundgren as The Punisher, anyone?), but this tries very hard.  I've never read the actual comic book, but that doesn't really matter, I suppose. I judge a film mainly on its merits, not on whether it is a faithful retelling of someone else's idea.  (Unless its a film based on a true story, that demands at least some attempt at truth and accuracy.)  So why will I give this movie a fairly high rating?  Because it tries.  It tries very hard.  In my book, that makes it a fair attempt at an entertaining film.Many films have been made with vampire subject matter being the main focus. It seems everybody has their take on vampire lore, be it the cross, the silver, the garlic, the aversion to sunlight, whatever.  Some of those ideas are included here.  The storyline is familiar... a group of vampires conspire to take over the world, with one person (mainly) standing in their way.  Blade (Wesley Snipes) lives for the sole purpose of the destruction of the vampiric masses, who have slowly but surely moved into the world, and share it with humankind.  For the most part, the human race is blind to the fact that vampires exist all around them.  The vampires have even taken familiars, people who aspire to be vampires and do the vampires' dirty work for them to show how worthy they are of eventually being ""turned.""Now that I think of it, there are many elements of this movie similar to the storyline of the Roddy Piper film, They Live.  A hidden enemy, hidden group of people plotting against them, the fight to save human-kind... all that is present in Blade as well.The acting isn't the best here.  Snipes is, at best, only slightly better than some of his other roles; N'Bushe Wright, a relative newcomer, isn't too bad; Kris Kristofferson is forgettable as Blade's sidekick (he's to Blade what Chip is to The Punisher).  Stephen Dorff does the best job of the whole cast here, as the ""head"" vampire you just love to hate.I don't know, but I just loved the special effects in this film.  From the blood-soaked vampire-style rave, all the way to the inevitable fight at the finale of the film, the special effects aren't half bad.  There's certainly enough blood and gore to go around, but after all, this is a vampire movie, right?  The various shapes and sorts of weaponry Blade uses are fairly unique, and not generally used in contemporary action films.  Snipes has more flair with a decked-out sword than he does with, say, a machine gun. Plus, there's so much more thought that goes into fighting with a blade than just blowing someone away.  (Unless, of course, you are Indiana Jones.)Overall, this isn't the best action film ever made, but it's not half bad, either.  As a bonus, the musical score & soundtrack are pretty cool, too. Tell me, in what other movies can you hear super drum'n'bass like Source Direct or Photek?!My Rating:  8/10",Blade
231,niteman,Stop thinking and eat your popcorn!,8,10 September 1998,"The first, oh, 70 minutes of Blade are what an action movie (and a comic book movie) should be.  The action sequences are well-choreographed, without the now-popular editing that makes it impossible to tell what's going on.  The special effects don't diminish from the fighting.  And little touches like blood raining from a sprinkler system let you know you 're in a very strange world. The last ten minutes of Blade are perhaps the strangest reversal in the history of film.  I don't want to give it away, but the villain goes through what will happen in great detail, and then it happens in a fashion completely different, which is unexplained.  It's like they decided to change the movie without telling us why.  Still, the final scenes do offer the most enervating sword-fight I've ever seen.  All in all, this is a cool movie.  Not a smart movie, not a movie that, ultimately, makes much sense, but a cool movie.  With some damn good techno, if I might add.  Go see it, but put your brain in neutral.",Blade

235,firstruleofmethclub,A super hero faire with a touch of the horror genre,7,17 April 2015,"First released in 1998, Blade brought commercial success back to Super Hero films, after the woeful distribution of films like Batman & Robin and Steel stopped the genre in its tracks.Starring Wesley Snipes (New Jack City, Chaos) as the eponymous Half-Vampire/Half-Human hybrid come Super Hero/Vampire Hunter, Blade works with Dr. Karen Jensen and Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson: Planet of the Apes, Provinces of Night) in order to defeat vampires Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff; Public Enemies, Felon) and Quinn (Donal Logue; Zodiac, Ghost Rider) and their host of undead soldiers before they can kill Gitano Dragonetti (Udo Kier; Rob Zombie's Halloween, Johnny Mnemonic) and the other vampire Elders in a ritual that will transform Deacon Frost into La Magra, the vampire Blood God.With me so far? No? That figures. The script's interesting, but it's not terribly sense-making. What I mean to say, is, the script's rubbish, but the *story* is great. The whole film is really rather story and effects driven, but the characters are pretty lacking. Quinn is sort of fun, and Deacon's well he's attractive, but not a lot else. Still, there's more to him than most of the characters, including the titular Blade.Straight up, just putting out there, I think goth-culture is attractive, so, my aesthetics may go quite a way to influencing my decision in the final score, if you disagree with me, you might want to keep that in mind, seeing as most vampires have at least a little bit of that going on. All that aside though, the opening of Blade is one of the strongest ways a film can start off that I've ever seen. It has basically everything you could want for a modern vampire tale. Including the Blood Rave song, Confusion (Pump Panel Remix) by New Order.The cinematography was another cool point, lots of ins and outs in a non-nauseating way.

Maybe not all at once, I know that could get a tad pointless, but it really didn't transfer well in this film.To end with, there's on plot-hole I'd like to bring up, I don't think I'll be spoiling anything too badly, but if you want to go in completely fresh, stop reading. There's one point when Frost says he needs to kill the 12 Elder vamps in a big underground ritual in order to complete his ascendancy into the Blood God (Khorne?), but he kills the leader earlier, on a beach. Okay, so maybe he wasn't counted, and he was actually number 13. But, Frost's lady-friend Mercury kills another with Blade's sword, before the ritual gets started, and nobody seems to care...

237,Bob_647,Dark & edgy serial comic book propaganda; & it is cooked off its edge!,8,31 May 2020,"Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast as Blade, a half human, half vampire known the day walker. He has all their strengths and his only weakness is the thirst for blood. Since he teamed up with Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) he has hunted down vampires who have lived amongst us unnoticed for centuries, but omnipotent overlord Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is tired of living in harmony with the humans, as food, and he plans to waken the Blood God and take control of the worldDavid Goyer did a stroke of genius when he took the character of Blade and turned him into a leather clad dark knight. He can't take all the credit though and much of this must go to Stephen Norrington as well who with his distinct visual style brings out the best of the character. The Blade character is pretty amazing in this film and mixes martial arts with Batman like darkness. Snipes is pretty good as the title character and is successful in bringing out the duality and inner demons of the character. Stephen Dorff provides the best acting in the film and his chilling performance as Deacon Frost stands as one of the best screen villains. While overall bad comic book movies were so bad that they were entertaining, Blade is entertaining because the action is good. There are some typical action cliches but nothing too annoying for the viewer. The overall story is thin but again, nothing too bad.The story is good and renews the vampire genre by adding a lot of contemporary elements and maintaining the comic book feel. By saying that the film has a comic book feel does not mean that the film is unrealistic. Far from it. A lot of effort has been put in trying to make the film seem as real as possible. Including the effects which are pretty good for their time. The vampire ""dustings"" are a very nice touch. In stead of adding a lot of blood when a vampire dies Norrington chose to let the vampires spontaneously combust which looks great. Vampire movies are usually considered to be low quality. For the most part, that is the case these days. But every now and then a good vampire movie comes up and in the 90's there were 3 vampire films that are considered to be the best.The film maintains it's dark edge with retrospective Gothic production, snappy one liners, & sudden violence. This may sound like cliches, but Stephen Norrington is able to direct the film through a Gothic style of its own. The screening time of 2 hours is not cumbersome. There are fresh surprises in every scene. The production design is tremendously visual & candy, with an intuitive & simplistic comic aspect to the production layering & screening.This movie pops right out of the pages onto the screen with sheer violence, blood, martial arts, weapons, fire, & the good against evil. Yes sure a lot of action flicks contain all these goodies, and most of them have bombed. But not Blade, the movie was filmed just right, not going overboard, delivering a good length and never a dull moment. Blade is a fantastic action thriller that keeps you captured for the whole duration and Wesley Snipes delivers what I would say to be his best performance yet.",Blade
238,Oorag,Could have been more interesting,7,23 January 2000,"Although Blade was far superior to Vampires, which came out around the same time, it was lacking in some areas. Blade is clearly a comic-book super-hero movie, fixating almost totally on Blade's inner struggle and total supremacy over his enemies. You can only watch so many Faceless Guys in Black Jackets and Knit-Caps get pummeled before it gets tedious. The action is clearly in the ""Boss Man stands on a table and bad guys throw themselves at him to be killed one at a time"" which I've always found inferior to more realistic, down-and-dirty action. I kinda wanted the camera to move over a few feet to reveal the Nameless Baddie Geneterator that spews out the cannon fodder. I would have liked to see the Vampires get a little more personality. Instead we have the Wise-Cracking Vampire, the Sexy Vampire, and a whole bunch of Stoic Vampires.However, Blade has some pretty good choreography, and Wesley Snipes knows his stuff, though I thought it was more than a little homo-erotic the way the camera focuses so lovingly on his massive pecs.

242,mules82,Haim and feldman are wonderful.,8,13 May 2002,"Blade is another vampire movie starring such great American actors as Corey, in both the Haim and Feldman variety, Keefer Sutherland and Alex Winters. Haim plays the brother of this guy who likes to hang out with Keefer Sutherland.  Sutherland is in a gang of outlaws with Lou Diamond Phillips and Christian Slater.  They are also vampires.  Anyway, the brother of Haim never knows what is going on, but Haim does.  Haim teams up with Feldman and Joe Pesci as they try to take down the vampire army led by Sutherland and Stephen Dorff.  There is one great scene where they are all playing volleyball in a pool and Ben Stiller spikes the ball and it hits this girl in the nose and she starts bleeding.  Robert DeNiro gets mad, then he says that he doesn't like ice cream or cookies.  In Blade, Chris Rock, who plays the lead vampire, can go out during the day unlike most vampires who die upon exposure to sunlight.  Rock holds a big umbrella that blocks out the sun, he also wears spf 35 which is a very strong sunblock.  He is also black so he doesn't burn easily.  I really liked this movie.  There is this one scene where Haim's brother thinks he is eating Chinease food, then he looks down and it's worms, but the whole time it's really just lo mein.  Also, there is this scene with Tony Danza and he yells up the stairs for Samantha and jonathan to come down, then he beats up jonathan and vampires come and they eat everyone.  That scene was cool.  Overall, I'd say this movie was a 8/10.  A lot of scenes made no sense at all and seemed like they were just cutups of different movies spliced into one non-sensical one.  But I still liked it a lot.",Blade
243,CC_The_Martian,Let's have a talk...,5,4 April 2016,"I know this movie is considered a great superhero movie, a great vampire movie, a great action movie, a great Wesley Snipes movie and a great R-rated movie butI think it needs to be re-examined. On the one hand Wesley Snipes embodies the character of Blade, the action is great, the acting is great, and the film has numerous twists and turns, the thing that real hurts the films is the Vampire angle. For some reason we as a culture are obsessed with Vampires, they were beginning to wear thin when Twilight came out, and that with that mystifying international sensation and the supernova of Vampire fiction that came in its wake I can safely say I am sick to death of Vampires, no pun intended. Again and again and again and again, it's gotten to the point where they're not even intimidating any more, just boring. And here is no exception, if a vampire movie wants to survive it needs to be able to put it's head above the proverbial water and stand out but Blade just doesn't, no surprises, nothing new, nothing interesting, just generic Vampire stuff that manages to kill an otherwise great movie. I know a lot of people like this film a lot but I cannot see why, give it a watch but I am not a fan.",Blade
244,joelsmith190,"Not a great comic book adaptation (this is coming from a comic fan), but it's a great movie",8,22 July 2015,"A few months ago, I watched Blade 2 and I've been told it's the best in the trilogy. I also watched the end of Blade: Trinity (it was on TV so there was no reason not to). A few days ago, I finally watched the first movie of the trilogy.Blade is a Marvel character, half human, half vampire; all of their strengths and none of their weaknesses. The films aren't very accurate; one of the main characters in the films (Whistler) originated in the 90's Spider-Man series and not the comics. There were three major films, and also a TV series.Anyways, this film is good, but not stunning. The action sequences are great. Especially when Blade's kicking some vampire butt, slashing them as they turn to dust. Wesley Snipes does a great job as Blade. He definitely acts like the badass Blade is. The story is okay. Nothing special.Special effects actually aren't that bad for the most part. They don't seem dated or anything. The musical score is good but the soundtrack isn't. The costumes are all well done.Acting is okay besides Wesley. There's some star power in the cast. The dialogue is well written. The tone is dark but it avoids the kinky vampire blood stuff of say, Vampire Diaries, for the most part. It does only as much world building as it needs to, and nothing extra. You could argue that the later installments into the franchise do it better, but I disagree.Blade is a great film but not as good as Blade 2, which is just an improved version of this one. Blade gets an 8/10. It's not phenomenal but it's still pretty awesome. Check it out if you haven't already.﻿",Blade

247,wolfie-8,"Too violent, way too violent",1,8 May 1999,"I don't care whether this is a ""comic book movie"" or not; it's far too violent. At one point, the villain actually throws a little girl across the street into a kiosk. She goes through it and lands on the street in front of a bus, glass flying everywhere (and gets nary a scratch, of course, in true ""comic book"" style.)Perhaps the filmmakers thought this was acceptable because the ""bad guy"" did it and Wesley Snipes saves the girl, but I was horrified. I actually cried out in shock and anger in the theater. I'm surprised Stephen Dorff agreed to do it; he should be ashamed of himself.Of all the money obviously spent on effects, could they not spare a few more dimes for the script? I'm sick of hearing that I ""want too much"" from action movies, that I should just sit back and enjoy the ride. No, thanks very much, I want a decent story. I want some character development (a 10-year-old could come up with better than what ""Blade"" provided). Most of all, I want some decent dialogue (""A cold heart is a dead heart""? ""Maybe you should just let it go""? Somebody stayed up all night writing those lines, didn't they?And for heaven's sake, what's with all the evil Asians? Nearly every single vampire henchman was Asian, and an silent, chop suey type Asian to boot.

I also liked the idea behind the main character: Blade, played by Wesley Snipes, is a renegade vigilante half-vampire who fights against the underworld while having to keep his own vamp urges in check.Sadly, I didn't like much else in this movie: the huge potential for creepiness was discarded in favor of non-stop video game-like action, any hint of atmosphere was destroyed by that annoying camera work (first jerky, then slow-motion) that's characteristic of today's action movies and music videos, and the overall look of the movie is dominated by a pretty obnoxious Cigar-and-Martini/GQ-style fashion sense.I enjoyed the opening action sequences, and a bit of what followed, but Blade became increasingly stupid, and by the half-way point I was pretty much through with it.",Blade

Yes, that is the basis of the plot.  But the method of execution of that plot is something else!  Start with Deacon Frost.  This is not your normal egocentric vampire. I've seen Dracula 2000 (not too bad a movie--then again, I give it credit for having a new premise!), and am into White Wolf and the Camarilla so I know the two origins that are presented in each.  I have the feeling that part might answer a few questions that have arose, but the whole feel is right. Frost makes a wonderful Anarch-Brujah kindred.  The council of pure-bloods are like the Old-School Warrior Scholars, the True Brujah who resent this upstart who came in and tried to change their habits and ways.  Do things properly seems to be what they are saying.  Excellent resource for a gamer.Then you've got Blade.  A day-walker, as he's called in the movie.  Dhamphir is another name I've heard applied in the VtM game to apply to him.  I see not only the strength and stamina of a vampire, but the celerity of one as well.  As for the Matrix-esque moves, you decide.  How close are the two movies to release date, and remember to allow for cgi-production times as the actors are wrapped, but the ""extras"" added in.  I don't think anyone stole anything here!The good doctor Karen is an interesting twist.  A cure for vampirism.

Hardcore vampire fans might not like it but so what. Wesley Snipes was perfect in his role as Blade, and he pulled off being a bad ass really well.

Unless, of course, it has a name director and a vast majority of the people know who the superhero is. However, BLADE is an exception.

264,moonlightreflections,An above-average comic book movie.,7,9 June 2001,"Not being the least bit familiar with the characters from the comic book series, I expected this film to merely accomplish the basic: introduce me to the characters and their inherent characteristics, present a plot, and end with the destruction of the main adversary and perhaps hint at the possibility of a sequel.  And that's exactly what this movie happens to deliver.However, unlike with most other comic book movies, I felt that this one did it with a bit of class.  Risking a more limited audience with strong language and graphic fight scenes, ""Blade"" presents a very modern, believable and dismal world whose little nuances effectively managed to elicit a sense of dread--as minor as it may have been--from a viewer who rarely ever becomes involved in a story unless an emotional (i.e., sappy) aspect is concerned.Yes, the movie has innumerable plotholes, and preposterously unrealistic situations such as a standard female doctor being astute enough to contrive what no one else has been able to for several thousand years.  But when you have an enemy as cool as the one in this movie, and fight scenes with involving and exciting camera cuts and special effects such as this, what else matters?  It may run a little long, but for what it sets out to do, ""Blade"" stands out in sharp relief among most other movies in this genre.",Blade

BLADE is by far no masterpiece - it's simply a comic strip come to life. But hey, does it come to life! The ""bloodbath"" scene at the beginning is a real eye fest. Alright, Snipes impersonates rather than acts the semi-human vampire killer. But he's cool as an icicle. Sidekick Kris Kristofferson is the perfect choice. And Stephen Dorff makes a decent villain. Still, logic doesn't apply to the plot (e.g. if the old, pure vampires like Udo Kier are that powerful, why can Dorff kidnap him this easily?). In fact, the whole mythology behind the film is half-cooked, if that. The showdown is loud, but its solution a bit feeble, providing a one-liner that could compete with the worst: ""Some motherf**k**s always try to ice-skate uphill."" Snipes states. Huh?!?

It really strays from the usual vampire formula, and it really mixes up things, making Blade a truly unique movie, which still holds up even to this day, and is still above all other vampire movies.Wesley Snipes is the perfect choice for Blade. He is charismatic, fits perfectly in the shoes of the Daywalker, while his co-star Kris Kristofferson is born to play Whistler. He is a badass SOB, and he is always there to even the odds, which are almost always against his half-vampire friend.

Blade is perfect popcorn pleasure,9,27 April 2006,"When a young man is taken by his mysterious girlfriend to an underground rave, little does he know that she is secretly a vampire and that all of the other 'ravers' are blood sucking beasts. But don't worry- there's Blade to save the day.And spectacularly so.Blade. armed with a sword, shotgun, handgun and shuriken type weapon, rips through half of the occupants, taking them out in a flash of brilliant effects and expertly staged hand to hand combat. The vampires disintegrate into dust and Blade moves on.This opening action scene is one of the best ever, and sets a dark but constantly entertaining tone for the rest of the movie. Directed by Stepthen Norrington, who went onto make Sean Connery flop LXG, Blade came out before The Matrix and in terms of coolness, beats Keanu's film hands down.When vampire Deacon Frost (Stepthen Dorff) plans to resurrect a long dead vampire god, Blade and his mentor/sidekick Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) use their heavy arsenal to stop him. With doctor Karen Jenson onboard (N Bushe Wright) Blade also searches a cure for his thirst. No, not that kind of thirst...Blade, played to understated perfection by Wesley Snipes, is a half blood, or 'daywalker'. His pregnant mother was bitten before giving birth to him (it turns out later it was Frost who bit her) and he has been given all of the strength of a vampire, and none of their weaknesses (daylight, garlic, silver). Unfortunately he also has their thirst, and he uses a garlic compound to quell his thirst. Snipes is physically able to perform in the film, and with Blade a man of few words he has no problem conveying the human emotions.Kristofferson is effective as Whistler, and his death scene late in the movie is accompanied by superb melancholic music. Dorff, while not the beefiest of bad guys, is able to give Frost a youthful exuberance and cocky persona that sits as a perfect opposite to Snipes and his brooding.Wright is decent support as the token female, working away on a cure while also letting Blade bite her when he can't find any serum. Donal Logue is annoying as Frosts sidekick, but thats the point. However, when he finally gets his comeuppance its a great comedic moment as he charges at Blade and gets decapitated by an acid edged piece of rope.The fights and effects are superbly staged, with the nightclub massacre one of the highlights of action film history. The gleaming white tiles end up blood splattered as Blade takes no prisoners. Later Blade jumps off as building, grabs onto a speeding train and gets put in some kind of ancient tomb style device. The action never lets up, and Norrington delivers well with his limited budget.Blade, unlike some other action heroes, decides to take a life when he could easily spare it. When launching his one man assault on Frosts headquarters, he annihilates the human bodyguards of Frost and discovers one on the floor lying injured. Blade points his shotgun in the guards face, and the guard shouts 'no! i just work for them!' before Blade blasts his head off. Its an incredibly powerful moment, coming after Whistlers death and filling Blade with anger and a lust for revenge. He is a great hero, but not infallible.This is a great action movie, and there is no chance of someone watching it and being left bored. Its perfect Friday night entertainment, and deserves to be loved.A splendid action epic.",Blade
269,Kurt-15,"BAM! Nonstop energy, impressive photography, brilliant film!",10,23 March 2002,"To be fair, I am posting this review AFTER my review of the sequel.  Why? The sequel sucks for very specific reasons, plot elements and devices present in this film are sorely missed in the sequel.This film exists solidly on the ""serious"" side of vampire flicks - ""Dracula"", ""Shadow of the Vampire"" and ""Interview with a Vampire"" - not the campy cheesy schlock of ""John Carpenter's Vampires"".  Why?  It makes vampires seem very real, as opposed to the pure shlock of evil undead coming ""to get you"" - ala ""Evil Dead 2"" (without the satire).
The film starts with a dramatic introduction to the world of the vampires, from a very personal angle.  The energy is built in the intro, and carried to the hilt by superb physical acting by Snipes, with outstanding action sequences that are unequalled in Western cinema.  The main characters are very strong, very distinct, and very realistic.  Even though all of them could of been torn from a comic book, this film's photography and sound editing put you right there in the middle of it all.  Unique set design and shooting locations also give this film an eerie ""every city"" feel - beating ""The Matrix"" to the punch by as much as a year.Stephen Dorff shines as a villian, and is so good at being bad you'd think he was the protaganist (there are many other reasons to see that as well). While some critics can't get past the gratitious violence and well, gallons of blood, open minded viewers may see the bigger message in this film. Tucked neatly into the subplots are a good protrayal of a gen-x class struggle, led by Dorff's character.This film's greatest strength is the plot.  Make no mistake: this is not average 80 IQ plot here.  This is pure neoclassicalism.  If you don't see it, you're missing the point of this film.  The sequel has no plot - the lead character is just moving through a series of action sequences to get ""the bad guy"".  In this film, Blade struggles with personal identity, family, love and love lost - and a plot development that is a real double whammy.I really can't say enough good things about this film.  The costumes and set design set the scene; the indulgences of wealth and power. The photography immerses the viewer combined with a perfect soundtrack and choreography. Fantastic casting and unbelievable direction make this film a winner.If you like pure slasher fare, this film will entertain - but if you want some serious backstory, plot & character development added to your violence (like ""The Matrix"") look no further - and skip the pedestrian sequel.",Blade
270,1001,A palatable offering of Snipes and dice,6,17 January 1999,"Blade is everything Spawn wanted to be and wasn't. While Spawn was a loud, obnoxious, incoherent mess that should have stayed in Hell with its erstwhile hero, Blade is a relatively subdued (it's nice to actually hear the soundtrack), stylish, well-directed movie that actually tries to build empathy and pathos into the characters. While both are adaptations from comic-books, only one is a page-turner.Blade, or Eric as his mom calls him, but which superhero would command respect with the name Eric, is half-man, half-vampire, made so by his mother, who survived a vampire attack long enough to give birth to him. This gives Blade a certain edge in his understandable grudge against vampires, ""all of our strengths and none of our weaknesses"" as his main vampire nemesis attests. The aforementioned nemesis is Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) who wants to unleash a vampire apocalypse on the world, decrying the Mafia-type approach that has served vampires so well up to this point - ""humans are our food, not our allies,"" he explains. Blade is aided by his mentor/weapons specialist Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) and a female hematologist he rescued, Karen. Her expertise lends her to both create anti-vampire blood, and a possible cure for Blade that would make him fully human again. Although one gets the sense that Blade's fate isn't entirely tragic. He relishes kicking vampire butt.The movie Blade succeeds for two reasons. It's technically polished, with good acting, excellent directing and production design, and awesome special effects - the way the vampires turn to skeletons and blow away like dried parchment when they die is way cool. There are three accomplished action sequences, the opening party scene which Blade inconveniently crashes, a brush with death on a subway, and the final conflict, with some special effects I can say, as a movie seasoned veteran, I've never seen before. The second reason is that Blade understands the inherent pull of the vampire myth. Vampirism represents a life given to sin, essentially. They are sensual creatures, dependent on flesh and blood for survival, shirking the light, and yet eternal, like evil fleshly lusts the Bible warns about. Vampires are not tragic, like Interview with a Vampire would have you believe, but fun, cool, and sexy. That's their power. Is not sin sexy? why would it be tempting otherwise? Vampires are cool because they live in sin without paying its consequences - death. But for that reason, they are the enemy and must die. For sin is, in the final analysis, bad. This essential good/evil conflict must be there for this type of story to work. Spawn had neither this nor the technical excellence Blade has, which is why it sucks so bad. Blade reminded me of another good vampire movie, Bram Stoker's Dracula, by Francis Ford Coppola. They would make good companion pieces on video.",Blade

While there are great action sequences and overall good acting, there remains a questionable plot and a questionable amount of CGI use given the quality they were able to provide. Overall it's a decent action movie with some memorable moments.",Blade
273,bwilson124,Not what I was expecting,6,17 July 2019,"I really don't know what I was expecting, but this was a bit underwhelming. I had never seen any blade movie, and know the favorite if many is the second, but started at the beginning. I just had a hard time getting into this, partly because the cgi really hasn't aged well, partly because the acting was just way over the top....almost cheesy. Not awful, action was pretty good.",Blade
274,dpsmith-61153,Action Packed Vampire Movie,7,10 February 2021,"This is a very enjoyable film indeed. The action sequences are very entertaining and thrilling, and compliment the story nicely. I just wish they had fleshed out the characters/vampire backgrounds a bit more. It was a bit confusing at first understanding the past mythology so-to-speak. Wesley Snipes plays a very badass Blade, well. As does Stephen Dorff as the antagonist. Their clashes are great.",Blade
275,mikerichards,A very dull Blade,3,8 October 2001,"That snarl...That scowl...The acts of random violence...The gutteral voice...The fetish wear...That shaven head...It can mean only one thing...GRACE JONES IS BACK!Actually my sources tell me that the title role in Blade wasn't played by the 1980s diva, but by Wesley Snipes.All in all this is not an improvement.Blade is an adaptation of a comic character; somehow in the transfer from the simplistic, two-dimensional world of the printed page it has become even more simplistic and lost a couple of dimensions.The plot is hackneyed almost beyond belief and adds nothing to the vampire genre, in fact, much like Nosferatu, it seems to suck the life out of the audience. In brief, upwardly mobile vampire wants to become more powerful but is opposed by Blade, half-human, half-vampire, all annoying. It all climaxes with Blade being put in a vampire juice press, some bad martial arts and the most pitiful CGI since 1968.Blade has to be the least empathic character since Dolph Lundgren's Punisher (also a comic adaptation, perhaps there is a trend here?). Surely the audience is meant to be on the same side as the 'hero'? And whilst a vampire can be a tragic character, this is not true of Blade, he is relentlessly cruel, scornful and not a whole lot better than the bad guys.I assume that Wesley Snipes has an 'acting' career purely so that everyone else can be compared favourably. As he snarls his way through his movie you find yourself looking for a stake - even a ballpoint pen - anything to put Blade in the grave. As a piece of narcissism, Blade is pretty much unbeatable - we are treated to endless lingering shots of a gym-fresh Snipes for no reason whatsoever. Likewise no other actor is allowed any chance to give a reasonable performance; the likes of Steven Dorff *CAN* act, but they have to play second fiddle to Snipes' tedious performance.Kris Kristofferson used to appear in good movies, here he is reduced to a sidekick that you just know isn't going to make it through to the final reel. And what happens when Blade finds out? Yes, you guessed it, he rushes to the scene to wreak his revenge in the villain's giant underground lair.
Why can't world-domination take place in a quiet country house? They always go ahead in underground cathedrals that would have had Albert Speer wondering if they were a little grandiose. A lot of these plans could be stopped right now if local councils paid more attention to plans for extending sub-basements. The rest of the movie is just as dull and unimaginative with nothing new to add to the genre. Vampires have been done to undeath and perhaps they should be laid to rest for a while - at least until someone can think of some way to make them interesting again.To finish, there *IS* a Grace Jones vampire movie, it's called Vamp and it's about ten times better than this.",Blade
276,tilmonhocutt,Very very good.,9,13 March 2019,I usually dont like it when a movie deviates from the source material. In this case I make an exception. I think Blade the movie is MUCH better than the comicbook Blade. They played fast and loose with laws of physics a few times but then again its not like vampires are exactly true to science. It has all the action and violence and gore you could ask for. And the good guys even win.,Blade
277,hdcole,Very Slick Movie,9,4 September 1998,"Finally got to see this movie.  It is a great movie.  Wesley Snipes played blade the way this type of character should have been played.

That being the case, this film was an awful lot of fun to watch, despite predictability and 2-dimensional acting.  The action scenes were better than most of this genre' and the plotline made more sense than most other comic-movies.  Snipes proved himself to be a consummate action-figure star once more in this film. The only disappointment I had with this film was it's en-masse treatment of most of the vampiric characters... but that's more a problem with my enthusiasm with real horror films than with this production in particular. This is not a real horror film, and horror film fans will be disappointed - but if you want a hell of an action ride, see this film!",Blade

Ever since the ""Batman"" series, ""Spawn,"" ""Judge Dredd,"" and many other pitiful p.g.-13 bombs, I dodged everything at all cost. I would question in my mind, ""why can't someone make a movie that is rated R and stays true to the story, how difficult is that?"" And finally my prayers have been answered with Blade. This movie pops right out of the pages onto the screen with sheer violence, blood, martial arts, weapons, fire, the good against evil, etc. Yeah sure a lot of action flicks contain all these goodies, and most of them have bombed. But not Blade, the movie was filmed just right, not going overboard, delivering a good length and never a dull moment. Blade II is cool, but not as cool as the first.

285,blonde_ambition,One of the better modern-day vampire movies,7,9 May 2005,"We've kind of been overdosed on vampire movies in recent years, most of which being total The Lost Boys rip offs, but Blade is probably the best of the new spate of vampire films. It's about a man named Blade (Wesley Snipes) who is a vampire slayer. Ironically, Blade's mother was attacked by a vampire while pregnant with him. Seeing as he was not directly attacked, he is now a half vampire; basically he is a vampire but has blood substitute to eat, and is referred to by vampires as ""the daywalker."" On the baddie side is Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) who isn't happy with all the pure-blood vampires (lead by Udo Kier)ruling the vampire kind, so takes over with his own little gang and tries to resurrect something evil known as La Magra.Fast paced and intense, it's clear to see why it has become so popular and Wesley Snipes is fantastic in the lead, plus the leather-clad look suits him. And Dorff, as his nemeses, surprised me. Despite playing a baddie that seems like yet another David-from-The-Lost-Boys rip off, he is very good at portraying that somewhat evil yet not pantomime-esquire baddie. And he clearly loves playing the role. Of the supporting cast, Udo Kier and Donal Logue are the most entertaining; Kier (once again playing a vampire) delivering the sort of subtle evil performance he has been famed for and, in some lights, does look incredibly creepy, even though he's not really portrayed as a baddie at all, and Logue is wonderfully upbeat and frantic as one of Frost's little cronies.If the movie does have any drawbacks, at two hours, for some people it can get tedious, and the obese vampire is absolutely hideous, but the movie is so fast paced you probably won't have time to get bored, and that hideous vampire is only in it for about two minutes, plus you can't help but sympathise with it when Karen (Blade's love interest, played by N'Bushe Wright) is pretty mean to it.Overall, it's a very watchable movie that you will most probably enjoy.",Blade

The opening nightclub scene was one of the top action scenes of recent memory, a multitude of weapons and ample blood and guts combined brilliantly. Wesley Snipes was fantastic as the half human half vampire hero, and although the put on guttural voice got a little annoying some times, his performance was flawless. Full marks to Kris Kristofferson for his  great cameo performance as handy man Whistler, and Stephen Dorf was also good as Deacon Frost. The fight choreography was great, very well done, although a slightly longer climax with Frost would have been better. The gore bordered on overly gratuitous for most of the film, but stayed on the good side of gratuitous thankfully. All in all, an action spectacular to be watched and enjoyed over and over again, here's hoping the sequel is as stylish and action packed. 7 out of 10.",Blade

289,Fifth_of_November,How comics should be brought to the big screen,7,17 August 2015,"Blade. Saw this gem of a movie at the theatre and will never forget how it worked on me. Almost everything was done right with this comic adaptation.The movie generates a sense of reality the whole way, and this is one of the best things a superhero movie can deliver in my honest opinion. Sure, some elements here and there like vampires going to ashes remind you that this is a fantasy, but the story itself remains real most of the time except at the climax which evolves into surreal. Filming was also very well done, avoiding flashy colours, accentuating the feeling of seriousness and reality throughout the city scenes.Fight choreographies were perfect, delivered fantastically by Snipes. Speed was fast enough to show that unnatural characters are at work here, but still slow and natural enough for our human eye to know what's going on. Wesley Snipes also did not just get fighting right, he also got acting right, delivering a nicely balanced performance. Managed to show that Blade is a tormented guy without going overboard and keeping the movie's focus elsewhere, where we want it to be. And Stephen Dorff did even better with a timeless performance in the role of Deacon Frost­. His character instills fear and doubt in every scene where he shows up despite his smaller stature and business clothing. It all fit together perfectly. Finally, one also needs to mention the successfully designed settings in many scenes, from the Temple of Eternal Light to the skyscraper rooftops to the vampire archives, it's all eye-popping and does not get old even today.Now, to what was not done right. First, some special effects. The blood ones, especially by the end where Blade explodes a few vampires with blood boiling, look absolutely horrible. The ashes from vampire dying by silver didn't work with me either, although they were not as bad as the blood effects. I also thought N'Bushe Wright wasn't a great cast for Karen, although maybe the role itself wasn't the best part of the movie. All in all, very minor sins compared to the whole achievement.Before closing, let it be said that Blade showcases some unrestrained violence but where there is no violence or danger, superheroes aren't needed much. This movie understood that most hero stories must be set against a credible evil in order to work, and Blade was a movie made for a mature audience rather than for kids.",Blade

Some reviewers  has taken it seriously now that the first example of it arrived here (Vinterberg's ""Festen""). I haven't changed my mind, although seeing Blade made me, at least, understand it.Here, in Brazil, we didn't see Woody Allen's ""Deconstructing Harry"", Ang Lee's ""Ice Storm"" and some important others yet; mostly because our theatres have been busy during all this year with films like this. Films where the leading role is played by special effects.The modern techniques aren't guilty at all. What would it be of great masterpieces like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" or ""Star Wars"" if they didn't exist? But, what's sad, and this is the worse thing about ""Blade"", is when you clearly see that some scenes were created just to justify astonishing effects. Sometimes you start to wonder if you're watching a movie or a cartoon. Do you remember ""Spawn""?This movie has no characters and, therefore, no performances to be remembered; but I was expecting this. The plot could be resumed to 20 minutes and the action scenes are weak. So you can wait until it's released in video.Marvel's Blade is not published here, but I really love other comics characters and, still, I have to say that no superhero has conquered a respectful place in movies yet, not even Batman. Well, I'm waiting anxiously for the X-men and, for now, I'm going to see ""Festen"" to see if these danishes are better filming than they are when making statements.",Blade

Having enjoyed Stephen Dorff in ""City of Industry"", it was fun seeing him portray another bad boy.  The casting in this movie is wonderful (has Traci Lords ever been more suited for anything than her walk on here?)  Wesley Snipes simply won't settle for any one genre, and it's great to see.I really must agree with some of the others who've commented here about the New Line Platinum Series DVD--it is exceptional. I haven't seen or heard a better film for a home system.  DVD owners everywhere should be supporting New Line's incredible series which includes ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Dark City"" special editions.

What I will say is this: The first 10 minutes of this film are incredible. It's as close to a textbook audience grabber as I've ever seen.

I love vampires, and as a result, i love this movie, however even if i hated vampires with all my guts i'm sure i would still enjoy this movie. In all likeliness i probably would, considering it is about killing vampires. Blade is a great movie because it never makes you bored; not for a second. You're always watching enthusiastically, wishing it will never end, enthralled by the epic dialogue and storyline. And violence. And if you think the faint-hearted would hate this movie because it has violence and heads flying in every direction, think again, for when people die in this movie they turn into ash, not blood.

296,russellt-766-50076,"Provides exciting action,but little else",6,7 July 2010,"Blade is a decently entertaining action flick thanks to its stylish film making and cinematography . It has some pretty cool thrills and good action scenes. Sadly that is the films strongest point. Most of the main characters a thinly developed and are only a bit interesting. Blade himself is cool and tough and has a interesting back story but really isn't that compelling. Karen,a girl he saves who then becomes a main character is as dull as dishwater and her acting isn't very good. To be quite honest Wesley Snipes doesn't turn in a great performance either. His blade is very one note,cool tough guy. This is sometimes very entertaining but other times it doesn't serve the movie very well. Whistler however is a different story. Whistler is Blades mentor and serves as a father figure for him. He is very well played by Kris Kristofferson and injects some much needed humanity in this film. The other great characters in this movie are the villains Deacon Frost(Stephen Dorf) and his right hand man Quinn(Donald Logue) they add some menace and humor to the film. My only other complaint about this movie is the CGI. CGI was very hit or miss in the 90s and this film is no exception. What I hated the most about it was that whenever somebody was killed by silver they would dissolve into dust. I have two problems with this.ONE: I like seeing lots of bodies after a huge action scene,its just really cool.TWO: the CGI looks especially cheep during these shots and it is very distracting. But despite it's many flaws Blade is a very entertaining film thanks to its style,energy and great action scenes. And Kris Kristofferson is really cool in this movie,always a plus",Blade
297,DeadpoolX,Lifeless,4,13 July 2003,"The problem with Blade is that its star and director take the film far too seriously for its own good.  What should have been a fun action movie ends up unpleasant, meanspirited, humorless and unexciting.  Norrington's most recent effort, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, suffers the same lack of spirit.

The plot is quite weak but the movie is fast, the dark atmosphere pretty well rendered, the fight scenes well done. In a nutshell, you don't get bored (even if the movie is slightly too long). On the other hand, Blade is not a film that I could watch over and over again: even if it is entertaining, there is nothing exceptional or unforgettable about it.

300,suburbannightmare,"amazing film, superb cast, fantastic action...nuff said?",10,3 November 2006,"Awesome. Awesome. AWESOME. This film should make Marvel proud that people still want to turn their comic books into movies. It's dark, atmospheric, fast-paced, well scripted and visually brilliant. Blade is based on and adapted from the popular comic books by Marvel. Blade, a half-human, half-vampire hybrid spends his nights hunting down and killing off vampires. Using an array of big guns, big swords and sometimes just plain cool martial arts moves, he dispatches said creatures of the night in huge style, creating CGI orgies of vampire-death-by-disintegration and beating senseless anyone else that gets in his way (look out for Officer Krieger). Helped along by Whistler, his faithful yet badass human partner, Blade's quest is to rid the world of these pesky bloodsuckers altogether. However, a certain power-hungry vampire has other ideas, and he sets about clawing his way to the top of the food chainThis is one of the few movies that are actually better than their accompanying trailer. Rare, I know, but it's true. Everything about this film is astounding. The casting for one, is fantastic. Wesley Snipes was director Stephen Norrington's first and only choice for Blade, and he does a fantastic job. Really the only film I truly like him in. Seeing him as any other character, he just looks strange without his black leather coat, sword, impossibly cool shades and tribal tattoos. This role was made for him. Stephen Dorff is brilliant as Deacon Frost, the maniacal and murderous un-pureblood vampire who wants to take over the world. (Ah, the old take-over-the-world ploy. Never fails.) He even manages to scare Udo Kier's master vampire Dragonetti into submission. Kris Kristofferson's Whistler is great  a decrepit and world-weary creature, almost like a father figure who keeps Blade in good supply of guns, swords and easily wieldable Ultra-Violet light sources. As Blade details their relationship quite astutely ""he makes the weapons. I use them."" Just happens to help that Whistler wants to wipe out the vampires as much as Blade does. N'Bushe Wright is fantastic as Blade's hematologist sidekick, Karen Jensen. She's attacked by Frost's second-in-command, Quinn, (brilliantly played by Donal Logue) and subsequently rescued by Blade. Most female action sidekicks tend to grate on the nerves after about five minutes of screen time, but Wright has a good mixture of sass, brains and she looks good carrying a shotgun. I don't understand why she didn't pop up in the sequels though. Traci Lords is aptly sexy and sinister as Frost's vampire minion Mercury (because of course, you have to have at least one slinky female vampire).The look of this movie is amazing too  everything is dark, moody and ominous. Even the few daytime scenes are overcast and gloomy. The dialogue, cinematography and acting are all first-rate, but the action scenes are probably why this movie is so popular. They're brilliantly choreographed, snappy and just brutal enough to make you giggle. Thankfully, they're also filmed in such a way that allows you to actually see what's going on. Most fight scenes these days are filmed way too close to the actors, and everything just becomes a blurry mess. I want to see that fist connect with that guy's chin, damn it. The soundtrack to this film is outstanding too - a hardcore techno slice of musical menace that fits the film brilliantly. Listening to the soundtrack is almost as good as watching the film. But nothing beats the club scene at the beginning with blood spraying from a demonic version of a sprinkler system, and New Order's 'Confusion' thumping away at your eardrums. Sensory assault.Even though this film is nearly ten years old, it hasn't dated. The dialogue is still wry as hell, ""-There are worse things out tonight than vampires -Like what? -Like Me"" the gore is still gory and the characters are still impossibly cool. This is another movie that'll age well, along with other films like The Lost Boys and Near Dark. And I still feel compelled to watch this quite frequently. Usually late at night when blood and guts and darkness show up so well in a room with no lights on",Blade
301,veiwer,The first marvel comic book movie that worked.,10,14 October 2007,"2 sequels , a TV series and a few video games later, the first Blade movie is still daywalkers best outing .Its a super stylish, exciting and down right cool thriller filled with great action. It also holds the little mentioned distinction of being the first marvel movie to actually work on the big screen (come on, seriously ,do you realise what marvel movies were like before this ? )and predating the matrix by a year with its black leather clad martial arts hero theme.From the kick ass opening rave sequence to the (wisely re-shot) sword fight climax, there's never a dull moment and it keeps a dark, slick, visual style throughout.The best thing about blade though, is that its one of those few comic book movies that has a hero who's every bit as interesting as the villain. As blade, Wesley snipes makes a stoic, powerful , mysterious protagonist and on the other end of the scale, Stephen dorff makes deacon frost one of the coolest vampires ever and it keeps their rivalry highly watchable. Also worth mentioning is blades grisly mentor whistler (""catch you ******* at a bad time?"")played brilliantly by kris kristofferson .Blade is easily one of the best movies to be based on a comic book. Go see.",Blade
302,se7endaze,"'Blade' is perhaps not great art, but certainly great fun...",5,19 June 2005,"Wesley Snipes stars as Blade, an immortal 'day-walker' who considers it his mission to hunt vampires. Blade's mother was bitten by a vampire during her pregnancy, which passed a variety of powers on to her son. Blade benefited from the best attributes of both vampires and humans, and grew up to be a vampire hunter in order to avenge the death of his mother, and to find the means of becoming ""human"" once more. Snipes does his best ""Terminator"" impression by hiding almost all of Blade's emotions beneath a macho facade. This approach works on a certain level  it makes Blade a more dangerous and ambiguous figure, but it also prevents the audience from connecting with him. But, before he can dream of becoming completely human, he must deal with the new leader of the vampire nation, Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), whose stated goal is nothing less than the complete domination of the world. Despite being over-the-top, Stephen Dorff fails to imbue Frost with the ferocity necessary to make him a memorable villain. Blade is aided by Adam Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), who provides him with a range of high-tech solutions. The grizzled sidekick lays down a nice character role performance for the future installments.N'bushe Wright is simply boring. The supporting cast includes the internationally known Udo Kier as the vampire whose position Frost inherits, and ex-porn star Traci Lords as Frost's long-toothed mistress.A fine combination of action, science fiction and horror, 'Blade' is one of the best comic book adaptations to date. The performances in Blade are serviceable. While hardly deep or cerebral, they manage to capture much of the spirit of the original comic book and succeed in not turning it into a children's cartoon. The film provides plenty of action and effects, fights and blood. The violence is successfully broken up with a variety of one-liners and humor.The atmosphere is so well-developed that it's easy to forget how derivative and monotonous the plot is, and to get lost in the darkness of Blade's paranoid, vampire-filled world. Blade is fueled by a kinetic energy, and there are scenes, such as the opening dance club sequence, the ""Blood Bath"", that functions as exotic, erotic assaults on the senses. Ultimately, that all turns out to be a rich icing on a half-baked cake. Blade has the capacity to dazzle, but it also will leave many viewers dissatisfied. Stylish and entertaining, 'Blade' is perhaps not great art, but certainly great fun.",Blade
303,hepodcast,"Not Subtle, Just Fun",9,19 November 2015,"Blade is not a subtle movie. It practically runs on the rule of cool. Everyone is in black leather, swords are the best way to kill, and immortal beings somehow still act like twenty-something douche- bags.There's a lightness in the plot that's hard to overlook. Vampires apparently just become evil when they turn, making it easier to cope with the efficiency that Blade kills them with. As a character, Blade himself doesn't have much depth, although Wesley Snipes brings a certain gravitas to the role that makes this easy to overlook. Less easy to overlook is the pretty-boy villain, who might as well be the trope-maker for the Marvel Villain Who Could Have Been Really Cool, But Fell Short of His Potential.But as easy as it is to pick holes in the logic of what's happening on screen, in retrospect, Blade was arguably one of the most influential movies of its day. It came out the year after Batman and Robin had bombed its way onto the screen. Batman and Robin represented the worst way Hollywood could look at comic book movies. It was silly, childish, without weight or import. ""See how silly this Batman fellow is!"" it said to the viewing public. ""That's because comic books are really for kids, not for serious grownups like us!""And with that movie fresh in people's minds, Blade stormed into theaters and set the whole thing on fire.In some senses Blade shares a bit of its basic DNA with Batman and Robin. The story is relatively simple, the lines between good and evil are starkly drawn, there is very little nuance to any of the characters. This is still ""comic book"" story telling.But on the other hand it broke ground for what a comic book movie could be. For one thing it definitely isn't for kids. The hard R, ultra-violent action is clearly aimed at a more mature audience, and it soared at the box office despite ignoring the younger demographic. the same audience that would flock back to the theaters in the next year to see more heroes in black leather fighting the forces of evil in The Matrix. This wasn't a comic book movie; this was an action movie.And maybe more significant is the presence of predominantly black protagonists. This isn't a ""thing"" in Blade. They don't have some point to make about racism. And the fact that it's so casual about it, makes the lack of black-led superhero movies even today, seem even more glaring by comparison.It's also worth mentioning that despite coming on the heels of a comic book movie that nearly everyone hated, and despite being an R- rated superhero movie, Blade did crazy business at the box office, topping 70 million dollars domestically and 130 million worldwide proving there was still life in the genre.And so, despite not being a great movie on its own merits, when placed in the history of comic book films Blade is a Colossus, standing astride two eras of film-making. It has one foot planted in the silliness of the past, and another planted in another era, an era we arguably still haven't reached even today, an era where the whitewashed and watered down superhero movie is a thing of the past, an era in which comic books are most decidedly not for kids.Blade is an echo from the past, an influence on the present, and a vision of the future.(Editor's note: I love this freaking movie with zero guilt and no regard for what it did for comic book moviesWesley Snipes killing vampires with a samurai sword is awesome)To hear more of our thoughts on Blade check out Episode 165 of the Human Echoes Podcast. www.humanechoes.com",Blade

This item ranks in the bottom half of all the vampire movies I've ever seen (and believe me, I've seen a lot of them).  Bad acting, zero characterization, little to no thought, almost non-existent plot (and that that's there you can drive semi-trucks through the holes in). Sure, it has action and is loud, and has more action, and more noise, and blood, and action...  These things alone do not make a good (or even halfway decent) movie.  Beats me how some people can say this is the best vampire movie ever made--all I can assume is they haven't seen many.  I suggest seeing Near Dark instead.",Blade

And not only didn't it stink to high heaven, it was actually GOOD!  The perfect vehicle for Snipes; Blade has no personality anyway.Yeah, there were some plot holes, but every vampire movie has THOSE.  But there were good FX, some great action scenes, and a story.  Not a great story... but a story nonetheless.  Not many vampire films actually have one.",Blade

The comic book action style was retained to its full potential with special effects galore adding to the atmosphere.Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff were both excellent in their respective roles, with Snipes acting convincingly.As this is a topic which has been flogged - or bitten - to death, it was refreshing to see the Vampire tale taken from a different perspective. Certainly not ""Interview with a Vampire"", but I somehow suspect Norrington had no intention of it being so.",Blade

Since most are familiar with the background and story of Blade, I will tell you about the film. Wesley Snipes as Blade is perfect for the film. I can't even picture anyone else playing him. Kris Kristofferson plays an awesome ass kickin' old man in the movie as well. Frost, played by Stephen Dorff is the main villain in the film who at first appears to be a weak adversary but actually is quite good as far as acting goes. There is plenty of action and killing in the movie. Never is there a dull moment. It isn't so much scary as it is action packed. You'll get your guns your knives, your hand to hand combat, and a nice body count to end the movie. A decent amount of gore as well, so if that is what you are looking for then you won't be let down. The performances are good, the action is great, and the story is great, which leads to a pretty good movie. If you end up liking this one, see the second one as it is ten times better.",Blade

It's special effects are out of this world. The acting in this film is flawless. Wesley Snipes is the coolest guy in the world. Stephan Dorff is the coolest bad guy ever. The plot in this film is original. This movie is unlike any other horror flick. This movie has a story behind it. I haven't met anyone who did not enjoy this movie. If you haven't seen this movie watch it now. If you have watch it again.,Blade
311,Sofalofa,"Great soundtrack, good fun",10,11 March 2004,"Superhero films usually end up a tad disappointing. Lets be completely honest here, the only REALLY good epic superhero film so far is Superman (Chris Reeve). Batman looked great but was dull, Spider-Man (always the coolest superhero) was pretty good, but imagine how good Spider-Man would have been if his film had been directed by David Lynch or David Cronenberg!Never heard of Blade, apparently a minor character in the Spider-Man comics. Still, this is great fun. Good for Wesley Snipes for making a success of this after playing second fiddle in SO many films.The opening scene is just great - by the way - for those wondering what that ace techno tune is in the opening rave sequence, it's New Order - Confusion (Pump Panel Reconstruction Mix) - ahhh that rave brings back memories... (we didn't have spraying blood though, just sweat!)The film is completely ridiculous of course - How come Blade's ""blade"" turns all vampires to dust except Quinn? - but it's good fun, probably helped by a fantastic techno soundtrack that just adds to the cool, no wonder Blade wears shades most of the time.Good stuff, but don't try and analyse it as there are plot holes big enough to fit Titanic's budget in.The second film was fun too, but that was even sillier... but that's another story...One of those few films that truly deserves its ""post-pub"" status. Nice one!",Blade
312,supersabref100,Norrington's Blade is where the Matrix effects came from!,8,26 September 2008,"Where have you gone Stephen Norrington? This film oozes with talent. LXG despite it's flaws and studio interferences shows his talent as well. The jumping scene from the hospital window to the roof and bullet time were both done here before the matrix in 1999. I hate it when film makers like Norrington and James Cameron go years and years with out making films. Life is short and should be lived but in between make some darn films. They're great action directors and we need more films from you two. Through Domenic Sena into that category as a director who showed promise and then disappeared. I know the studios system must be a nightmare and Sean Connery dissed you but get over it and make movies. Show the studios and Connery how great a director you are. Blade has a good story and great action scenes. It's by far and away the best action film Snipes ever made. The sequels including Del Toro's Blade 2 pale in comparison. The vampires are sexy, regenerate, kick ass and disintergrate when blade wipes them out. An action film with a touch of horror thrown in and a true classic. Blade also was the restart of the comic book stampede that we see today in films. Blade showed that lesser known comics could appeal to the masses and that well known comics could be action oriented with out camp. Blade led us from Batman and Robin to Batman Dark Knight which was co-written by Blade writer David Goyer who also directed and wrote Blade trinity which is no Blade but still entertaining and also wrote Del Toro's Blade 2.Whether it's on DVD or cable don't miss the chance to catch Blade or see it again. An action/vampire fighting classic!",Blade

Even though the vampires are not real vampires, it still appeals to everyone. We all know that vampires do not die from silver and garlic. I do not who came up with that. That is the only bad part. The first sequence set the tone in a way that I have never seen in my entire life. Blade let be known that he is the ""Daywalker"". Stephen Dorff is very good as Lord Deacon Frost. Blade is even more interesting when he loses his blood and then regains it. The sword-fighting scene was kind of wack. That is the only slow part of this film. The guns and martial arts make this a smash hit. Truly, an action classic!!!!!!!!",Blade

The bloodbath scene in the opening was great, and the sequence in the hospital featuring the burnt vampire was cool too. After that though, the movie falls off. The later action scenes are too chaotic and poorly edited... can't they leave the camera in one place for more than a millisecond? The CG effects looked like just that... CG effects.

Because, compared to every other movie, Blade was everything it promised to be. When everyone was carrying on about ""Something About Mary,"" I expected a rip-roaring, roll-on-the-floor funny movie. At best, it was mildly amusing. Blade, however, was dark, slick, and action-packed, with an outstanding performance by Wesley Snipes.  As someone who HATES vampire movies, even I was won over by this film.

If it is not the widescreen version you are watching, you will miss a lot of the action, as everything will happen seemingly from a lot closer (since at least 1/3 is cut on the left and right sides of the screen). You'll miss feet connecting, blades slashing, etc.The story is simple, almost stupid, but it's fun. And what is important? FUN. Who cares about the plot if the movie is a blast to watch.

Snipes does execute them with great grace in order to make it fairly convincing for viewers and exhibits mastery over the sword and other weaponary. The special effects are above average and mostly good. This movie is very very dark, perhaps one of the darkest I've ever seen. The biggest weakness is the main villain who is some sort of punk and doesn't come across as scary nor can he fight convincingly. The storyline isn't anything great and is somewhat weird but passable. Despite several weaknesses, Blade does come across as a good entertainer with fairly high production values.",Blade

Anyhoo, we have youtube now and whatnot, so that's not a problem anymore.Wesley Snipes was perfectly cast for this role (and he did his own stunts or some of it, which is something to respect!) and Stephen Dorff is also a great villain - I actually disliked him for a time after seeing him in this movie.

In many, the fairly one dimensional characters just seem poorly written, but in Blade, with the heavy duty action and thumping techno soundtrack, it just seems to work.Blade is one of the great underrated characters in Marvel comics, and Wesley Snipes brings him to life and plays the role with such gusto that he really makes the part his own, to the extent that I really cannot imagine anybody else in that role. Blade is one of those great anti-heroes that makes you feel that maybe you shouldn't be rooting for him, but you cannot help doing so anyway. Without giving anything away, I think that the opening scene is one of the greatest character introductions ever.Unusually for a comic-book movie, the characters and plot manage to hold together until the end and I for one, after seeing it for the first time on TV, immediately bought the DVD.Blade is a fast action thriller that never lets up.

This film was a very welcome surprise.Glittering and gruesome, slickly assembled and strangely serious for the genre.Blade has style and substance. The setting of ""Blade"" is ingeniously evoked, at once wildly unreal and entirely believable.The heroin chic, nihilist couture and Sybaritic abandon of New York night life are all marshaled to create a portrait of a lumpen class of hip parasites who are constantly on the prowl for their next sanguinary fix.With his pasty, punkish look and slouchy sexuality, Dorff is a vampire for the millennium -- Bram Stoker by way of Robert Mapplethorpe.With the help of Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) -- who makes Blade's massive, silver-stake- throwing guns and hollow-point bullets filled with garlic -- and a pretty hematologist (N'Bushe Wright), Blade seeks out Frost for the ultimate battle.Norrington, whose background is in makeup special effects, preserves comic-book reality with sped-up action, camera zooms and flash edits.Wesley Snipes has found a role worthy of his suave physical powers, and Stephen Dorff, so good in ""Backbeat"" and ""I Shot Andy Warhol,"" once again brings superb focus and conviction to his role. Mark Isham's techno- inspired music score echoes and elaborates ""Blade's"" creepy, druggy, sexy vibe.",Blade
328,iconic-sr,Blade: A True Vampire Slayer,7,19 September 2014,"Brief Overview: The movie I am reviewing is Blade which was released in 1998 and is really the first major Marvel film to hit the big screen. Blade is a human/vampire hybrid who takes it upon himself to eliminate the vampire ""species."" For the time this movie was made I believe it is a really good film, and still is a must watch for comic book fans.The Positives: The first thing I really liked about the film is the actor who plays Blade. Wesley Snipes is perfect for this role; he goes through the film showing almost no emotion which perfectly portrays the vibe given off by the character in the comic books. The rapid fire, intense action sequences is the real pinnacle for the film. It's really fun watching Blade take on 20 vampires at a time in a highly complex style of fighting. This flick will definitely keep the attention of the general audience.The Negatives: I had several issues with the 1998 Blade, but none were so severe that I would not recommend this movie. At times, the acting was a little overdone and the CGI was cheesy, but you must keep in mind when this film came out. Also, there was way too many needles in this movie; at times I was wondering, ""Is this a super-hero movie or a film about some advances in virus vaccinations?"" (No, in all seriousness, it really isn't an issue, unless you have a phobia of needles. If so, proceed with caution!) And the last problem I had is the story line. It wasn't really that bad per se, but it just wasn't a very intriguing angle.The Conclusion: If you like vampires (or hate vampires), enjoy high intensity action sequences, sword fighting, blood and gore or just a comic book movie fan, this is a must-watch movie. I highly recommend this movie.",Blade

He also beat the Blood God too easily. I can accept that sunblock protected Frost's skin from the sun, but what about his eyes? And when did he suddenly gain the ability to dodge bullets? Although Blade is heavily outnumbered by vampires every time he fights them, he's never attacked by more than one vampire at a time while others patiently wait their turn. It's an old cliche, but it's so obvious here it ain't even funny. Maybe I missed something but weren't the council members an essential element in the process of raising the Blood God? Yet even though one of them was killed by Frost's girlfriend the ritual goes through without any problems.

I think Stephen does an almost Oscar appearance as the evil vampire Deacon Frost. Wesley Snipes is the ultimate hard A$$, kicking vampires and acting cool 24 hours a day.

333,pendrell-2,A bad case of glorifying Genocide,3,25 December 1999,"Here is a film called BLADE. The story follows as such. A woman is bitten by a vampire and is pregnant. She is rushed to hospital where her son is saved and grows up to be Blade. He is a half vampire who goes around killing all sorts of vampires and vampires lackeys, meanwhile trying to find a better serum to contain his vampiric tendencies. He has a older mentor (played by Kris Kristofferson) who makes all his weapons for him, a female sidekick who he rescued and is now confronted by an evil vampire called played by stephen dorff. Who wishes to bring about the end of the world and *spoiler* needs Blades blood to do it. I was given this film for Christmas and was willing to give it a go, as I love movies of all types and have always loved the driven hero action films. When the film opens up with a techno dance scene involving sprinklers with blood I thought I would be in for a treat. I was wrong after this scene which kicks things off really well, everyone shows their true natures. Kristofferson has forgotten how to act, and it feels like you have seen a better version of him in many other movies. Wesley Snipes doesnt get past his costume or his first scene. A one note performance all throughout the film. He isnt even cool as an action hero (Batman, Bruce Lee) and doesnt have that driven desire for revenge (Conan, Robocop, Crow) to make you want him to attack the baddies and watching the movie it is obvious that if he didnt have vampires to kill he wouldnt have anything else to do. Thats all there is to his Character. The vampires are not evil and nasty or even very stylish. They are just the chosen form for the hero to go up against. Dont get me wrong I love action movies and mindless films. But this was missing all that makes action films great. The details that good movies always know about and have. That is a driving motivation for the lead character, a reason to relate to them and root for them as they kill the enemy. It also needs an understanding of action movies. The metaphor (not a deep one) for action films is that good will triumph over evil. This film doesnt have it.This film is just a showcase for violence. Why do you go for Blade??? Because he is seeking revenge for a tortured past??? NO Because he is driven by a moral obligation to make the world better??? No. Its because he has a cool jacket and sunglasses, and knows martial arts. The violence in this film is not intense or graphic. Or even disturbing/unsettling in the least. What it is, is frequent and empty. To boil it all down the plot is. One man attempting to kill a whole race because he knows they are evil and should be killed. Not being subtle but I think Hitler thought the same way. Without any motivation for the violence it just becomes a way for the filmakers to entertain you. While the editing in this film is great, and the cinematography is being inventive, in the end it is just a director who does not understand the genre he is doing and isnt good enough to break out a new one. The script is predictable and doesnt even get ""The Heroes Journey"" right. The dialogue is aweful and stilted and wiith all this considered the only way left for the main characters to express what they are like is through their acts of violence!!! Blade is a cool good guy because he has a cool sword and does flashy martial arts. Robocop was also violent but the main character had a personality and you know he wouldnt want to kill anyone if the bad guys hadnt killed him and werent trying to destroy the city. Blase likes killing vampires, he likes killing people who align themselves with vampires. He trains so he can beat up vampire servants real good. The main point of this film is to show Violence (and possibly genocide) in a cool and fashionable way without any motivation behind it. Senseless violence for a pointless movie. What I am trying to say is that violence in films can be justified (and good) but this is just a showcase for violence as entertainment, Dont watch Blade. Its bad. Even the special effects are about as unimpressive as you could get!!!",Blade

The whole story. I don't like science fiction or comic book based films, EVER. I'm not into goth stuff, vampires or any of that. I don't know how I even got suckered into watching this for the first time... But I knew that I fell in love with the story the second I saw it for the first time.Blade's character is so dramatic and tragic. I love this story.... I loved the movie so much, I named my first born Deacon, after non other than Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff). So yes, I am a fan.",Blade
338,bentheimpaler,Blood-Spattered Fun,8,23 March 2018,"""Blade"" set a new standard as being, in my opinion, the first good Marvel movie. Twenty years and more than twenty newer Marvel films later, it still holds up brilliantly. It's become dated in many regards, but managed to have smarmy one-liners, over-the-top choreography and late '90's aesthetics blend so seamlessly in tone with the antiquated effects that it in no way effects the score. 
Rather, it has simply shifted genre from hardcore martial arts feature to a grindhouse/exploitation style action extravaganza that never fails to put a smile on your face.
Spot-on casting, gory fight-scenes and a fearless originality leave ""Blade"" near the top of my Superhero list for the past two decades and likely many years to come. 
Unfortunately, the same couldn't be said for the sequels.",Blade
339,Samizdata,"Remember, it's based on a comic book...",8,13 September 1998,"I really enjoyed Blade.  The cinematography and fight choreography were excellent.  It seems to me the biggest complaint about the film was the shallowness of the plot.  Now, first off, I didn't go to see Blade for an in-depth analysis of the human condition.  I went for a good time, which I got in spades.  Of course, having wasted much of my youth (and adult life *grin*) with comics, I walked into the film knowing exactly what to expect, and I wasn't disappointed.",Blade

Do you believe he's an actor? Yeah! Well, then do anything - but don't watch Blade. By the way, whoever thought, Wesley Snipes or Stephen Dorff areactors worth watching should turn to other movies as well. Blade is definitely not a movie for actors. Nor for audiences.Except if you want a completely incoherent and foreseeable plot (aparadoxon? - wait till you see it) and special effects that makeyou laugh until you cry while going to sleep (a paradoxon again?No, a kind of Yoga to keep you alive). Anyway, those who likethough father-figures who smoke while handling gasoline, andthose who like son-like-characters who are surprised thatfather-figures meet a violent and tragic end while theyencounter their true but resistant love, will really enjoyBlade. Not to forget those who enjoy cardboard-characters,cliché plots and martial-art-fights. Oh, and I almost forgotthose who believe that fast cuts, dark lighting and ""original""angles make a great director.",Blade
342,MLisaLov,Stephen Dorff Can Bite Me ANYTIME!,10,25 June 1999,"For those who haven't seen this movie, ""Blade"" is a very good Horror/Action flick...and there is a little bit of comedy as well.  Wesley Snipes played the hero very well.  He has great martial arts skills.  Plus, I love how he used his sword.  :-)  Stephen Dorff was an excellent vampire and villain. I'm so glad that he won ""Best Villain"" in the 1999 Movie Awards.  You know... this is the first movie that I found him so HOT.  :-)  Anyway, I'm glad that they got the opportunity to be part of this film.  Oh yeah, I thought Kris Kristofferson was good in this film.Anyway, if you like action and you love vampire films, check out ""Blade."" The part when the evil vampires were trying to bring back the vampire God at this Temple was (I thought) the best part in the movie.  There is a great fighting scene between Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) and Blade (Wesley Snipes) in the film.  It was funny when Blade made that vulgar but silent quote during the fighting scene.  Anyway, this is an excellent movie.  Go rent it TODAY!  :-)I give it 10 out of 10 stars!!!!",Blade
343,Jc-101,Very well done,10,10 August 1999,"I was SO skeptical about seeing this movie, I expected it to be a lame action flick. Instead it turned out to have an ACTUAL plot! It reminded me in certain ways of the Crow. Very unique in it's cinematography as well as the action scenes. Once again I must say ""It's nice to see a film with violence in which the violence is truly justified"" similar to what Brandon Lee said about the Crow :) I really hope Blade 2 won't turn out to be a COA aka Crow2 type of thing. BTW I believe Blade 2 will also bring the character Morbeus into the film. It says he will be teaming up with another vampire so don't be surprised if it's Morbeus.",Blade
344,Vlad-45,Another fantastic Vampire Movie,10,25 February 2000,I went to see Blade on the first day of release . I only see 3 or 4 movies a year at the cinema and I usually only see Horror or Sci-Fi Movies this way. All I can say is it was great to see Vampire/Comic/Horror mixed together in such a seamless way. A group of 6 of us went to see it together and we all gave it a thumbs up. (Bar one.. He wasn't into Vampire movies and he gave it 4/10). Personally I gave it 10/10. But this is definitely my kind of movie.,Blade

As I went to see it wanting to watch a plain action movie that didn't involve too much thinking, I wasn't at all disappointed. There are some violent gory scenes, but its all part of the film. Overall, it isn't pretentious and doesn't try to convey any philosophical or moral message. It's just action, action and action... and very good music, if you're in that mood.4/10 as a movie, but 9/10 as an action movie!",Blade
346,guidance,stylish outside / hollow inside,6,22 July 2001,"i read somewhere that the makers of this flick ran out of money and that's why the ending was as poor as can be seen... they could've saved money by not hiring that n'bushe wright chick, who was absolutely useless and awkward and served only so that through her they managed to make some kind of storyline. the story itself was lame and really gave no chance to kristofferson or snipes to make an impact of anykind. wesley's ju-jitsu was a pleasure to watch though... yet dorff managed to deliver some good lines in a stylishly cheeky manner. THE reason to watch this movie isn't the plot or acting but the style it's done (for most of time). the cameraman is a genius! the props and all that makes the mood are alright, really dark and sort of modern-gothic... and the music is really good. what about that ""confusion"" -hype in the internet, huh? the rave-scene was obviously dug by lots of people, i'd imagine, cuz next months everybody was looking for pump panel's ""confusion"". and a cool scene it is, indeed...this is the kind of a movie that you'd recommend to somebody with the usual ""...if you got nothing better to do"".",Blade
347,Flatline005,One of the best opening sequences EVER,10,21 March 2002,"As it says in the one line summary above. Blade has one of the best opening sequences (first 10-15 minutes) in any movie EVER. Put it right up there with Strange Days, Gladiator and Excalibur in that particular criteria. Apart from the opening sequence the rest of the movie is fairly standard hollywood fare. It has it's good points and bad points but overall comes up on the better side of average. It's certainly a movie I didn't mind watching but not one I think I'd be tempted to pick up for my private collection (except for the first 10 minutes).OverallOpening Sequence I'll give a 10.Movie overall its sitting firmly at 6 out of 10 stars.",Blade
348,marksnakehandler,"""""BLADE"" is still the finest vampire film I have ever seen.."" - Tom Millan ""Kindred Gem Films 1998""",10,6 July 2008,"Now I have viewed many styles of vampire films. Some of them leaned more towards the horror side, while others leaned towards action and others towards drama. Before ""Blade"" premiered on August 21st of 1998, ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" was the ultimate revolutionary vampire movie of the 1990's. It made ""Interview With The Vampire"" look like a ""church choir sit in""/ ""vampire chick flick""- which, by the way, was a drag to watch. Once I saw ""Blade"", I knew fully well that this film, never mind the sequels, had a strong and solid place on my top ten list of ""Best Movies Of All Time"". Director Stephen Norrington does a stupendous and extra ordinary job of weaving and orchestrating the choreography within this vampire action horror. All of the acting by Snipes, Kristofferson, Dorff and countless others was well done. Wesley Snipes plays a half man/ half vampire who is known as a ""Day Walker"" because he can function not only nocturnally, but during daylight hours unlike the any other vampire. He became this due to the fact that his pregnant mother was bitten by a vampire before giving birth. She died of course but the infant was already infected. Blade was then born into this world and later trained by a cancer ridden smoker Abraham Whistler, played by Kris Kristofferson. Whistler, apparently had battled vampires long before his encounter with Blade. Therefore when he discovers Blade's unique and extra ordinary abilities he mentors him and trains him in martial arts and a vast array of weaponry to create the ultimate vampire slaying machine.Stephen Dorff plays Deacon Frost, a young and over zealous vampire with a huge chip on his shoulder. He is in disarray with an occult society of vampires who exist underground as a board of directors to somehow integrate with human society- as a tolerant perspective. Of course Frost creates a rebellion to overthrow this ""tolerant"" vampire government of dullards in suits. Frost believes that a prophecy of a vampire god will come as expected and cause havoc everywhere thus violently pulverizing whatever he can to make the prophecy. Frost wishes to become this blood god. The original score and music in this feature all fit into the right spot. From beginning to end this film is packed with fancy camera shots and excellent editing. The action is ""in your face"" and ""straight to the point"". It's quick, fast and visceral in some sections. I still maintain that ""Blade"" is the finest and most revolutionary vampire film ever made. ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" would be my second choice. Never mind the sequels to ""Blade"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn"". Even though I gave ""Blade"" a top rating and ""Blade II"" a 9 out of 10 (4 1/2 stars of 5) the third ""Blade"" was a 0 (no stars). Don't even get me started on ""Blade III"" or ""Blade Trinity"". All I'll say is that it should have been called ""Blade Zero"".""Blade"" gets 5 stars of 5.",Blade
349,zyzygy69,A masterpiece in it's genre...,9,11 March 2002,"In the ever growing film genre of comic book adaptations, Blade is by far one of the best realised, and most faithful (overall) to the source material.... given that the character has almost 30 years of history in the comics since his debut as a back up figure in Marvel's Tomb of Dracula, the writer took almost ALL of the characters and plot elements from the comic's history. While changes were inevitably made, the finer points of the film steamroll right over any criticisms. Don't let any of you friends tell you different: Blade is one fine film. If it feels too ""comic booky"" for you Stanley Kubrick snobs out there, it's because it's supposed to. Deal with it, but don't dis it for it.",Blade
350,noodleboy500,Spectacular,8,19 December 2002,"Clad in black leather body armour and armed with a variety of high tech and low tech weapons, Blade (a human-vampire hybrid with tattoos, sunglasses and an attitude) spends his nights hunting 'suck-heads' with the help of Whistler, his sidekick and armourer. His exploits are set against the background of the complex political intrigues of the vampire nation, a well organized and intricate society.This movie isn't one to try to be something it's not. I'm not going to say that it doesn't have a plot (it does, and an entirely suitable one at that), but if you want high-brow drama, you're looking on the wrong shelf in the video store, amigo. Its action, gore and big-bangs right from the word go, while not stooping to the knuckle-dragging level.The story in interesting enough, the SFX are seamless and impressive, and the acting doesn't seem to have any great weak points. If you want to see a fast paced, hip, cool and super violent, this is the flick for you.",Blade
351,d-kampen,New in town vampire host parties to become vampire boss.,6,28 May 2016,"Blade is an overall bad movie but it's saved by it's great fight scenes. So don't expect anything special from this movie just turn your mind off and enjoy it. But sadly this is a review so I need to look at the negatives. The biggest flaw this movie has is the story. I'll give you a short summary: there's this the vampire council and everyone in it is a full-blood vampire except for one guy (who is part of the council for no reason) and he is bullied because he isn't full-blood. So to take revenge on the them he needs a following so he decides to give some parties (the council wants him to stop, he refuses but gets to stay on the council) and it works! He kills the council leader without any problems and the other members don't do a thing. But he wanted more so he finds a way he can be a super-vampire. So he becomes a super-vampire and Blade of course kills him after a few minutes, oh and he is also the guy who bit his mother? What a coincidence. The end.So that's the biggest flaw this movie had, but there were several other things that really bugged me. To name a few: a cure to being a vampire is found in only a few days, sunblock protects vampires from the sun, the police officers shoot at Blade while he is holding Karen, no one cares about the kid almost getting hit by a truck or Blade bashing a police officers head against the trunk of a car, none of the vampires care about their bible being burned and the whole ceremony at the end is comic-book bullshit.With most of the bad things out of the way let's talk about some of the good things. I already said it but the action was great, Blade was just an awesome character whom you just can't love to see kick some vampire butt. I also really liked Whistler he was a real bad-ass and it sucked to see him die (probably the best scene besides the action scenes).So overall a bad but enjoyable movie, it's probably one of the lesser marvel movies but it's fun to see one of the movies that started the superhero hype. I'm gonna give this movie a 6.3 but I think it's still a must see movie for marvel or vampire lovers.",Blade
352,Cain-2,derivative climax? improbable ending?,5,24 September 1998,"I just saw ""Blade,"" and while a good film for its action content it seemed to me that the ending took a little from ""The Dark Crystal"" (but in a melodramatic and backwards effect)--hardly creative.Also, I found it incredulous that Blade would be able to ""mix it up"" with La Magra (The Blood God, who was possessing Deacon Frost)... Hello?!  La Magra is/was a *god* and Blade is just a half-breed ""daywalker.""  Shouldn't La Magra have just wiped the floor with this guy?  Even for a movie based on a comic book, that's a bit much.I gave this a 5 out of 10.  Pretty average fare, and plenty of gore.  This movie will spawn sequels, I bet; after all, there's always more vampires out there to hunt.",Blade
353,orpheus-6,The Double Dragon Factor,2,11 September 1999,"Remember the old Video/Computer-Game Double Dragon? I had to think back to this game when I saw Blade. Super-cool hero walks on screen, two super-evil bad guys do the same, followed by a super-ridiculous Kung-Fu fight. The enemies are knocked out, hero walks two meters and the scene is replayed. Finally, the difference between Double Dragon and Blade is that you could actually PLAY Double Dragon, so it carried with it a remarkable amount of fun. Just LOOKING at it for two hours leaves me unsatisfied.Blade is really one of the worst movies I have ever had the displeasure to watch. I am a fan of Vampire stories and the myths that surround them, and I regard this waste of celluloid as an insult for every vampire fan. To the makers: Vampire myths and wannabe-cool-MTV-HipHop-sunglass-commercials DO NOT mix.I still wish I had bought two packs of cigarettes and a cup of coffee instead of the cinema ticket, but hey, what´s done is done. And if I now give the movie a final rating of 2/10, it has two reasons: the atmospheric opening sequence and the fact that Blade finally made me carve out my dusted copy of the good, old Double Dragon again.

Snipes is excellent as the stone cold Blade, a half man half vampire with a mission,actually its more of a crusade to rid the world of all blood sucking Vampires. Blade isn't alone, Kris Kristofferson backs him up as whistler his weapon maker and mentor. Based in a world where the underworld is secretly run by vampires Blade uses all his super-human skills and weaponry to fight the war nobody knows about. The war against Vampires.

The room fills with blood and everybody's having a good time!  This kind of stuff is not common in movies (for obvious reasons).While I don't recommend bringing a female date to this movie, go see it for yourself on the big-screen.

Wesley snipes plays the role well and looks the part. the story is over the top with a 'hip' bad guy played with relish by Stephan Doriff. the fight at the end is great, and Wesley snipes' attitude adds humour to not only that but the whole film. if this film hadn't tried to be a horror but being an action instead id have given it 8 but the attempts at scary moments makes the film seem worse off. but the blood shedding fight scenes and good acting adds depth and ill give 7/10.",Blade

This movie has you on your toes from the opening credits, and you'll probably have a fear of the dark after watching.So, the story. Keep in mind I've only seen it twice, hence my copy of the story may be off: Vampires. A night-going, light and garlic hating and very powerful, yet brutal breed of blood-suckers. Scary enough? Imagine the gore with the aid of special effects! Anyway, the vampires are rising up, what with the aid of the non-pure (meaning, wasn't born a vampire) Frost, a cunning and cruel man with intentions of bringing the Blood Lord back to dominate the earth.So who be Blade, you ask? Blade's mother was bitten by a vampire whilst pregnant, she gave birth before dieing. Blade swore revenge, yadda yadda yadda. But he's one kick butt character. I mean, you combine Aragorn from lord of the rings, Neo from the matrix, and Jackie Chan, and you described blade.But his role is critical to the vampire's domination. Blade is a ""day-walker"", meaning he can walk without burning up from the light (like vampires). If his blood is spilt and falls to the hidden altar, the blood lord will arise.Back to the movie. There's so much fighting, you'll want to grab a stick and join in on the carnage with your friends. With a lot of violence, blood, bullet, and wicked sword and knife skills, our hero will blow off heads, slash hearts, and ward off the vampires with his evil garlic, for justice! The performance by Wesley Snipes really fits the character. A big beefy man that shows little remorse for other people, but underneath the bitterness has a heart of gold and a sense of humor.",Blade

We had both remarked after watching Venom that we had wished it leaned more on horror and, in that sense, we expected Blade to properly fill that mold. Sadly Blade is much more of an action movie than anything else and there is never really a scene in the movie that feels at all scary.This isn't to say the movie isn't fun, in fact many elements of the movie work together well and make it entertaining to watch, though it isn't clear how many of these elements are intentional or not (i.e. the strange and unnecessary flourishes Blade does when he brandishes a weapon or Blade's mentor Whistler who looks and behaves like he is LARP'ing Snake Plissken).

373,Mojnmand,Well.........,6,13 May 2007,".........I don't really know what to make of this. I usually like vampire movies, and I wouldn't say ""Blade"" is a complete waste of time. It just isn't great. It lacks the eerie feeling you get from watching Coppola's Dracula, and it lacks the charm of for example ""The Lost Boys"". That aside, ""Blade"" is mildly entertaining, but there are some major flaws - at least in my eyes. First of all, I have a major problem with the whole ""pure blood vs. unpure blood- thing"". Vampires are not born. They are transformed. They are damned creatures. Just like in ""Dracula"". Period. End of discussion! Second: Why is Blade able to walk around in the streets without anybody giving him a second glance? A big black guy with sunglasses, a very visible sword strapped to his back and an outfit that would make Batman jealous.... and nobody seems to notice that the same Blade beats up a police officer in the street in the middle of the day! People don't react until Blade has a gigantic gun in his hands! Come on.... And what about Frost throwing that little girl across the street and through some sort of glass object? She doesn't have a scratch afterwards?!?! That's nothing but a miracle! And Blade just tells her to go home - alone! She has just been at the mercy of a vampire, she looked very scared, she was thrown across the street, and the hero just tells her to go home. What a hero! And the final scene in which Blade defeats the blood god a ka Frost... that's just too easy! I mean it's a god he is battling here! A he defeats it with garlic essence! In conclusion: Mildly entertaining, but too many flaws to be a great vampire flick.",Blade

I don't normally go for horror/ vampire films, so when this film grabbed me by the short  and curlies, I was surprised! And it didn't let go until the end. Wonderful soundtrack, great acting, and above all, it was fairly unpredictable. Snipes is getting better and better, and Dorff plays a superb baddie. Some funny moments too help the film no-end.

380,bluntsbitch,Best vampire film of all time,7,28 April 2002,"** CONTAINS SPOILERS **It is without a doubt that Blade is the best vampire film of all time. Or rather, should I say, of this ""new"" vampiric genre. It's not like the old vampire movies of the past [i.e. Nostrefatu & Interview the the vampire] as it seems to shock, scare and draw in the viewer's attention. As I say, the more gore - the better.The film has one of the best opening sequences in cinema history. The young and carefree adolescent male is taken to a club where vampires hang out. The blood which fires out from the sprinklers is an amazing scene and from then on relies heavily on special effects.Enter Blade [played by the sexy Wesley Snipes], as we learn, is a half-human half-vampire with all the weapons and gadgets you could ever dream of, provided to him by his long term friend, Whistler played by Kris Kristopherson. The effects in this one particular scene do not disappoint - the slaying of the vampires is truely magnificent - way better than the semi-impressive effects in TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
The film focuses a lot on Blade's arch-nemessis, vampire Deacon Frost who plans to become the most powerful vampire in history. Blade also must keep his eye on Dr Karen Jensen, whom he saved from an attack by Frost's right-hand man, Quinn. Jensen develops a special cerium to help Blade battle the vampire race.This is truely Wesley Snipes' finest performance. Recently I saw Blade II and while still impressed, it lacks the originality of the first movie.A must for all fans of vampires, horror, gore and straight up action.Overall score - 7 out of 10",Blade
381,senor_goodspeed,One of the best action movies in recent years.,9,20 May 2004,"Having just read some of the other user comments in IMDb I felt as though I had to respond with my own opinion on 'Blade'. Some comments referred to it as 'average', or 'just another vampire movie'. I totally disagree.I think this is, without a shadow of a doubt, the greatest vampire movie and one of the best action movies in the last 10 years. This is high praise indeed, but permit me to explain why...It opens with one of the most original beginnings with the bloodbath club scene. This is fantastic. The use of red against the dark, eerie backdrop of the club is excellent, as is the pumping crescendo of the soundtrack. Then in steps Wesley. This is the part he was born to play. The arrogant smirk, the tough exterior, the 'do not mess with me approach', allows him to relax and enjoy playing this comic book hero to the max.Stephen Dorff as Frost is also excellent. He steals the show in many of his scenes. He is cold, calculated, arrogant and evil. He is also very stylish and wears a cool shirt for most of the movie. Which brings me along to the costumes. Blade's long black leather coat, in fact all of his leather gear, along with the guns and weaponry, is original and cool. In fact, does 'The Matrix' not copy and borrow heavily from 'Blade' - which came out a year before the much acclaimed 'Matrix'? I know this is very controversial, but I really do think that 'The Matrix' owes a great deal to 'Blade'. From the costumes, to the use of wires in the fight scenes, the fighting choreography in general and a lot of the cinematography are all original in Blade, but then copied, and admittedly expanded, in the 'Matrix'. Any responses to that? Because I know that there are many die hard 'Matrix' fans out there who will be p*ssed at that, but before you lambaste me, check out both films again and then respond.Oh and Blades tattoo is the coolest on film (along with George Clooney in 'From Dusk Till Dawn').OK, weaknesses, there are a couple. Firstly that annoying N'Bushe Wright, with her bad acting and her annoying glances and frowns, and secondly some of the red blobby explosive globules are not brilliantly well done, but these are minor flaws in an otherwise superb film.And to finish the film, the final action set piece does not disappoint. Again, Snipes is masterful as the arrogant (and a very adept martial artist) and confident Blade, as he strides around the temple kicking the crap out of everything that gets in his path. Once more, this scene is accompanied with a great tune, adding to the brilliant soundtrack.This truly is a cult classic film, and one that everyone should watch.",Blade
382,lenkam99,Loved it..,9,27 May 2003,"This is one of my favorite movies.. I love Wesley Snipes.. he makes a very sexy vampire.  I enjoyed the story.. and the fight scenes.. And of course, I love the fangs.  What I loved the most was the club scenes.. that music entranced me.  I felt like I was drawn into the clubs and the blood and the whole vampire rituals.  It was awesome. This movie kept me interested all the way.. I couldn't wait for Blade II to come out, but when it did, I was disappointed. Oh well.. at least this movie ruled!",Blade
383,girlinspottedpajamas,Realistic,7,17 September 2011,"This was and still is one of the best vampire films I have seen. It changed how most of us look at vampires; of course it still consists of vampires only coming out at night which should stay that way. The wooden stake method is definitely over used but vampires do need a weakness besides sunlight because, come on who's going to be able to make the sun appear in the middle of the night or always be carrying a UV flashlight continuously? So silver is the only alternative and we all know that only werewolves are allergic to silver but it needed a change of direction as well. The idea of blade being more than just a mere human and not a total ""suckhead"" either but both species rolled into one was a pretty interesting factor. Now of course other movies decided to steal that idea and make it their own but most of us know where that idea originated from; at least I like to think so. The graphics of this film were amazing to say the least. They were of course not over used like most (movies) tend to do and I loved the blood. This was, in my opinion used only when needed and not a complete gore - a - thon. Language - okay let's face it; not everyone really comments on the bad language in films or otherwise is so used to it ( I will admit I am very used to it) and doesn't pay attention to it. This film tends to only use it to emphasize what their trying to say as important or to reveal their emotions. In most movies, just about every sentence or after every couple words there is a swear word in it. Kind of overused and annoying and not forget to mention that some people are really bad at it (not like we're practicing).Hmm...what else am I forgetting? Oh yeah, the bad - So the part we have been waiting for the entire stinking time after all the goodie goodie nonsense. I do not like the fact that all the toughies are practically wearing the same outfit material. Leather, precisely black. Frost, Blade, some of the other random vampires and not forget to mention innocent little Karen, how sweet. Blade I can understand and maybe frost but Karen? I don't think so. A sweet doctor who's used to wearing sophisticated clothing just doesn't decide to wear the look alike outfit with a guy like blade ( Trust me, those who wear leather the first time feel a little uncomfortable for a while. I know I was for awhile) Some how I doubt a doctor like her will all of a sudden change their style in a single day, unless of course you're named karen and your in your 20's, 30's. How very strange.",Blade

To see W.Snipes moving around like that and uses his martial art skills is a sight for the eye. He not only makes good fighting scenes but he can also act. If you like action and getting a rush now and then, then you must see this movie. It's kinda bloody occasionally but hey!! it's a horror movie but my personal opinion is that this movie is more of an action movie than a horror movie. So what are you waiting for? Go and see this spectacular movie!!",Blade
390,MamboMan,Some good action and visually very appealing.,7,6 November 1998,"I went to see this film with my son not having read the comic book and not knowing much about the character or the plot.  I was pleasantly surprised. It's not the greatest action flick ever, but it keeps moving and there is some nice character development.  The relationship between Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristopherson is rich and provides a good dramatic background.The art direction is excellent.  There are deep colors and attractive settings.  The city streets are windswept and filled with litter flying around.  It makes a nice affect.A good way to pass the time.",Blade
391,DA HORN,RIGHT ON POINT!,8,2 March 1999,"I've finally forgiven Wesley Snipes for the role he played in TO WONG FOO (which I hated!) because of the performance he gave in BLADE!  From the outset to the very end of this movie, you are presented with nothing short of PURE EXCITING ENTERTAINMENT(the way it should be in Hollywood!)!Congratulations are in order to Wesley Snipes (who not long ago, was presented with his 5th Degree Black Belt in Martial Arts from over 100 Grandmasters at the same time, WAY TO GO WESLEY!) for providing us with a comic-book movie that didn't try too hard to be serious until it wasted your time!  In fact, this movie almost doesn't allow you enough time to breathe, let alone be bored, with all of its HIGH ENERGY ACTION(extremely well choreographed fight scenes) and SPECIAL EFFECTS!  Don't worry about the plot!  If you like VAMPIRE movies, you'll definitely love this one(IT'S DIFFERENT!)!  If Wesley Snipes continues on this pace, he just might be the ACTION HERO FOR THE MILLENNIUM that we are looking for, with the decline of SYLVESTER STALLONE, BRUCE WILLIS, and ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER!  BLADE IS A MUST SEE MOVIE, NOT FOR THE WEAK AT HEART! I give it a well deserved 8 on a 10 scale!",Blade

Receiving mixed comments from friends, I was hesitant to rent it.  However, I purchased the movie and it was nowhere near a let-down.  Wesley Snipes gave a stellar performance as the half-Vampire, Blade.  Stephen Dorff as Decan Frost and Kris Kristofferson as Abraham Whistler also gave excellent performances.Blade had excellent fight scenes as well as a nicely developed plot.  The cinematography was also well done.  Blade shroud in black was the perfect ""Dark Avenger"".  The recurring plant offered the viewer a glimpse of Blade's decision to face his problems by ""cutting it off at the roots"".Although Blade was a little excessive on the blood, I still find myself eagerly awaiting the premiere of Blade 2.",Blade

394,JrLaw,The best movie of '98,10,24 July 1999,"I absolutely loved this movie.  The fight scenes are just totally awesome. The special effects, superb.  The sound is great, though the soundtrack im not crazy about (12 rap[not a fan], and 3 techno).  When I saw it, it instantly became my favorite movie, now, it's a tie with Matrix (the best movie of '99 yet, and probably to come).  Snipes is great in this movie. The story is also well done - if you can,  see it on DVD and check out all the extras, 2hrs + of additional information.  Very cool.  If you love action, lycanthropes, & martial arts, you should love this movie.",Blade
395,Lemon-8,Great music,4,16 August 1999,"We all must admit that 'Blade' is not a good film, but at least is funny to see. It has a very good soundtrack, and the start of the film, in the disco with the vampires, the song 'New order' playing as loud as possible, blood everywhere and Wesley jumping and using his katana is really cool, but the rest of the film gets boring and boring. Just see the first ten minutes, and you'll know what is excitement!!",Blade
396,Taran-5,Excellent vampire action,10,9 August 1999,"I gave this movie a ""10"" and I feel it is my duty to explain why. It is important first of all to realize what this movie is and what is not. It is an action movie, it is not a masterful exploration of the human condition. ""Blade"" is right up there as my favorite action movie of all time, with the possible exceptions of ""The Rock"" and ""The Matrix"". It does everything an action movie needs to do and then some: it has a fast-moving plot, engaging characters who drive the plot rather than bog it down, it creates a desire in the viewer for the good guy to win, and this last it does better than in any other movie I've ever seen, it creates a pulse-pounding visual experience. Another way in which ""Blade"" goes above and beyond is in its having a ""gimmick"", if you will. Just as ""The Rock"" had that awful poison gas and Alcatraz, and ""The Matrix"" had . . . well, go see it for yourself, Blade has this whole vampire culture it depicts, and a conflict of identity for the title character that comes into play at several points in the movie and does nothing but enhance the experience. Snipes is incredible. Every single gesture, change in posture, and facial expression is just wonderfully intense and perfectly befitting a vampire hunter. The camerawork includes several shots using a fascinating pseudo time-lapse technique which make you nervous even when the characters are just driving. The fight scenes are unparalleled, and as the official site said, there are weapons and techniques rarely seen in American action movies, you really have to see the way these guys move to believe it. What really sets this movie apart is that every scene is intense, there is not a boring scene in the whole movie. The presence of the vampires is constantly felt after the opening scene, and the pressure never lets up. Even the character development scenes make you nervous, because there is almost always some helpless human that you are afraid a vampire is going to chomp into any second, despite the fact that the threat is taking a backseat to the dialogue for a moment. Also, even when nothing tangibly exciting is happening, there is this kind of weird lighting that sort of puts you on edge and makes you enter Blade's world, making you feel what it's like to be a vampire. I saw this movie with a bunch of guys, and when Blade started up his motorcycle, all of us yelled ""yeah!"", it's just that good. If there is any criticism for this film, it could only be for its plot, but I found there were enough twists and turns to keep it from becoming predictable, and besides, you honestly won't have time to be thinking about the plot. This was a movie that had my friends and I pumped the whole way home from the theater. My comments may be a little biased because I like movies and TV shows with vampires, and am a regular viewer of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but even if Blade was fighting nuns this movie would be awesome.",Blade
397,Ramses-11,Wesley Snipes as karate champ.,8,4 December 1999,"This is the best movie adaptation of a Marvel character so far. Wesley Snipes as Blade is a very good choice, both as an actor and a fighter. The other characters are also okay, though I didn't recognize any except Deacon Frost from the comics.

Lot of pow-pow movies got good stories, but this lack a lot.Maybe I just liked much in the past because vampires licking each other, and sexy scenes, just a dream to a teenager.Good: Stylish, crazy, Snipes fear nothing, got this you damn vampire.Cons: Vendetta, much sexiest, boring at some moments, predictable.",Blade

But it would be much better if you grew up and moved up to quality entertainment.",Blade
400,r-verkerk,Best comic-book adaptation ever!,10,4 August 2002,I already owned the video and yesterday I bought it on DVD. Blade is by far the best movie based on a comic book ever. And yes that includes Spider-man!! Wesley Snipes plays the part of Blade so good you never doubt his character. The action is splendid and fast. I think that is what I liked about this movie so much. Most of the movies based on comic book characters waste a lot of time in explaining the deeper motives of the character. The comic books threw you right in the middle of the action and explained the characters motives along the way. I made a terrible mistake by watching Blade on DVD first and then going to the theater for Spider-Man. There is no comparison. Spider-man sucks and Blade rules!!,Blade
401,deaconfan,most impressive movie,10,18 October 2002,i was very impressed by this movie.  The characters were unique and interesting to watch.  This movie should get more recognition.  it's one of the best vampire movies.  The character of Deacon Frost held up the movie more than the character of Blade.,Blade
402,aliska_88,No more than a mediocre vampire movie,3,28 February 2004,"""Blade"" can be summed up in two words: vampire movie. It offers nothing to the audience, except a gory display of unnecessary quantities of blood. As intriguing as the plot may seem, it only comes into play in the last ten minutes of the movie's two-hour length, and even then it lacks the simple element of surprise, which even ""Interview With A Vampire"" was able to offer. The acting talents could really have been pushed, especially on part of Snipes, whose 'I-have-feelings-very-deep-down' attitude was undesirable at times. Perhaps the two things, which save this movie from meriting a one on a ten-point scale, are the editing (which added a creepy effect at times) and the twenty seconds of a mildly amusing swordfight towards the end. ""Blade"" merits no more than 3/10",Blade
403,joefrank777,"Techno and Vampires, never a better combo",10,12 June 2003,"Snipes did a great job as a martial artist in this flick.  It's not Oscar material, but if you want to see a bunch of vampires get schooled at a blood soaked rave, this is the movie for you!  If you haven't already seen it, you should go rent it immediately!",Blade
404,dimakorou,"With its undisputed elements and a superb antagonist, ""Blade"" almost makes it enjoyable...",6,28 July 2013,"------------- MY RATING: 55/100 -------------*CONTAINS SPOILERS!*The concept is very good but it is being delivered heavy damage by unrealistic plot shifts. For example, the young hematologist girl (Karen) brought big and heavy med equipment from her hospital without being caught. Then, she noticed that a chemical liquid is disintegrating vampire cells and then she created a cure (!!!) for those who are turned vampire by being bitten and all that in a few days! Creating a cure for such a condition should take decades, not a few days and I am sure someone else in the vampire world should have already tried to find a cure to use as a weapon for the non-pure-bloods. Another example is that the antagonist (Frost) was able to capture the Vampire Authority members pretty easily, like capturing humans in an alley. And yet another example is that the protagonist (Blade) burnt Quinn and then left him to be delivered to the hospital where he created such a mess. Why not end him with his blade at the beginning of the movie?Great acting skills can be noticed on the antagonist (Frost) and maybe Whistler and Quinn but I can not say the same for the protagonist (Blade) and Karen. Especially the scene where Blade is feeding on Karen is so corny.The atmosphere is pretty dark and blood and gore is everywhere to be seen. The plot is delivering rapid accelerations and decelerations to itself which makes the journey for the viewer unpredictable but also frustrating.Great and disputing additions are the Vampire Bible which actually is the vampire history and the vampire god which I bet is the incarnation of the original vampire that empowers Frost's body after the ritual.To sum up, the dark and bloody atmosphere with an insane and superb antagonist are the pros for this movie and those pros outweigh the cons as described above, delivering us a watchable (but not a masterpiece of the genre) vampire movie.",Blade
405,pejoratus,This film kicked the door back open for two entire genre's.,8,1 July 2004,"After the insult that was ""Batman & Robin"", Comic Book based screenplays were sort of dead in the water. Most film studios shied away from such fare, especially from Marvel Comic licenses. Blade literally showed up barely on the radar before it struck gold, hard. Slick screenplay, surprisingly quality acting by all hands on deck, and a serious lack of cowardice when it came to getting brutal. Blade sort of hit all the action/supernatural/horror genre nails on the head simultaneously. And with the budget it had, I was truly amazed out how good it was. Me and some compatriots went to see it in theatre thinking ""this is gonna' rock or suck, no middle ground."" and we were all truly amazed how much better it was than what we had feared.

407,Maesterolorin,"OK, But could have been better",5,27 March 2006,"Blade is supposed to be a Dhampyr (child of a male vampire and living woman). This is a well established legend and the story of the comics. Why on earth they go about changing the 'bible on vampires' making it some fluke of a 'biting gone bad.' Whistler was well done, and Blade was done true enough to the original character. As an action film it is more than satisfactory.I couldn't stand that they were working a 'cure.' As if anything that could make the blood suckers would or even could be based in science. Heck, the vampires weren't even half the beast they should be. I am not a purest to fantasy, Vampire can but don't have to be weak to crosses, rose wood, or garlic, but either make something new or don't; don't butcher an ancient and complex mythos like the Vampyr or Lycanthorp. In ""From Dusk til Dawn"" they establish that these creatures are vampire like and may have established the legend, but that they can't know. In ""John Carpenter's Vampires"" and it's sequel they establish they are creating a mythos, but it is still mythic. Blade makes the same same mistake we would see in Underworld, but at least they were not adapting something else and changing it to the nth degree. In fact you could almost say they did try to make a new story, but the comic book for Blade was well established before they ever tried to make a movie as a fantasy based vampire story (except for that one guy who dated black cat but that was really complicated).The biggest disappointment was the ""Blood God"" who went down faster than sororal cheerleader after 5 pint in a chug-fest.",Blade
408,Sundby25,A vampire flick that works!,8,25 March 2007,"To put it bluntly, Blade is a very entertaining movie, that never goes down in gear. It feels like a 90 minute roller coaster ride, and there's plenty of loops, believe me. The movie takes a lot of otherwise unrelated elements, such as Vampirism, Martial Arts, Techno, and mixes it perfectly. The opening scene is a great example of this blend, and is something that you've probably not seen anywhere before! The combat scenes are wonderfully choreographed, and the Techno beats suits the style perfectly, making it a very heart-pounding experience.The acting is also surprisingly good, especially Wesley Snipes as Blade. He doesn't overdo his character, and he doesn't need to, because just his pure physical presence suits his character perfectly. He doesn't have to many lines to juggle with either, but he manages to pull his few quotes off quite admirably. The saying that looks can explain more than words especially works in Snipes favor this time, and he does a great job of keeping his character believable. Stephen Dorff also does a good job of playing a down-and-dirty villain, and his tone is just perfect for Deacon Frost. He's a stereo-typical madman, who's attitude almost is a complete opposite of Blade's silent nature. Even Kris Kristofferson manages to pull it of quite nicely, and (unless you're heart is made of stone), you can't help but feel a little sad about his condition after Frost's visit. It's been a while since i've seen him act great, so it was a nice surprise.The only thing that fails in Blade is the story. It has some really good potential, but ultimately throws it all away in the ending, which is one the most cheesy and uninspired endings of all time. The pacing in the ending just seems a little too bumpy to make the final clash between Blade and Frost feel climactic, and although there is a little twist in the ending, it's nothing that will leave you in awe, and (in my opinion) doesn't contribute a hole lot to the story's unfolding.All in all a very entertaining movie, with a lot of cool and memorable scenes, some nice fights, and even some good acting. Unfortunately the story doesn't quite compare to the rest of the film, which is sad, because it had so much potential to be better. But hey, let's face it! The story isn't the most important piece in a horror/action movie, so it's gonna be a 8/10 this time.",Blade
409,TGammet,GREAT ACTION OK PERFORMANCE,7,12 September 1998,"Wesley Snipes has just recently found a passion for the martial arts film genre that he never had before.  On screen (in Blade) he was up there taking the role very seriously (action wise).  As far as the character's personality goes, he wasn't serious enough.  He made fun of the original character's personality, instead of creating a new one or just ""acting"" the part.  Though his performance was less than fair, it did not ruin the film in the least.  The best played character in the movie would have to have been ""Frost"".  I hope there is a sequel to this film, but I hope that Wesley can get a better interpretation of the comic character.",Blade
410,dot-7,WELCOME BACK!!!!!!,8,10 October 1998,"This movie was packed with action from beginning to end. Wesley did a excellent job. His co-star did an excellent job with making Wesley seem more comfortable and able to do one of his most impressive acting jobs yet. It has been a while, but I finally have found a Wesley Snipes movie worth paying for.",Blade
411,Truman B-3,Brilliant.,9,14 November 1998,"Wow.  Cool.  Yippee.  These are the thoughts that run through your head as you watch this movie.  Forget Van Damme, Snipes is THE martial artist of the nineties.  This is an adrenaline-fuelled, pulse-pounding action/horror film that keeps you mesmerised from start to finish.  Snipes and Dorif simply ooze class as the movie moves from one spectacular action sequence to another. If you want the ultimate cinema experience, Blade is simply THE best action film ever.  Really.",Blade
412,Mills-7,BLADE,10,15 March 1999,Blade is a violent movie but it's hard to think that this kind of comic movie could be dangerous to kids!!! In Finland this movie has a K-18 certification. I mean that I'm just 13 years old....really! And I liked this movie very much. A community like in BLADE where vampires and humans are living together and one half vampire is killing other vampires is a good subject for a movie......... I love this movie and I hope that BLADE 2 will be as good as the first part!,Blade
413,jbiggs65,A waste of film with horrible fights and cheezy effects!,1,8 March 1999,"This film was horrible! Snipes is alright as an action hero but an actor he is not! The action sequences looked like a cheap rip off of the stylized fights of Hong Kong films! The choreography sucked! And the special effects CGI were in a word, CHEEZY!!!!",Blade
414,topealvim,Decent Action Movie,6,19 September 1999,"The best part about this movie is its action and editing - director Stephen Norrington really knew what he was doing. While the story is a lame excuse for some strong and violent action, the movie definitely has its moments. Wesley Snipes was perfect for the part (Like Stallone in ""Judge Dredd"") and the cast of characters is satisfying enough. I also liked the way modern music was used as soundtrack (instead of some classical sort of music) - it really contributed to the mood of the movie. You're bound to like this movie (like me) if you're looking for a good action flick on the vampire genre (with some interesting details) but if you prefer the ""serious"" kind (like Bram Stoker's Dracula) you're bound to be disappointed - think of this movie as a ""Spawn"" with a vampire storyline.",Blade
415,G-Force-2,Blade is more than just a Vampire-movie,9,28 April 1999,"I really enjoyed Blade. I must admit, this is not the best Wesley Snipes movie around and the script and story are also not 'Oscar-material'. But you don't watch movies like Blade for a good story or great acting. You watch it for thrilling action, excellent special effects and a few funny one-liners. Blade will give you all of this, so if you want non-stop entertainment for about two hours.... watch Blade!",Blade
416,Terroric,The most awful movie i've ever seen,1,31 March 1999,"Blade, i ""saw"" this movie wanting to sleep in my chair. But there was my back aching, so i had to stand the test. Blade is a commercial comic book adaption without the things that make the comic interesting, darkness, ""cynism"" etc. I think, the use of digital fx doesn't mean the viewer can recognise this as digi-fx. This movie was digital, in every aspect. Digital ""blood"", digital death fx, but so amateur-like i thought i sat in a b-movie. But, as a b, there was NO funny trash in it, so there was no fun seeing it. So if i saw the sequel, i would take some good voltaren pills with me, this will reduce the pain, maybe i can sleep then.",Blade
417,john-322,Great Action Movie!,10,9 April 1999,"Blade was one of the best action movies that I have seen in the last five years.  Wesley Snipes was superb!  The fight scenes were well choreographed and the effects were top notch.  Most critics gave this movie a bad rating because they did not go into the movie with the right attitude.  If you want to be entertained for a couple of hours, and see some kick-butt action, watch Blade.",Blade
418,DudeX,"Oh! Please, what are they feeding us...!!",1,11 June 1999,"I really don't want to go on about this film, let me just say it was THE worst film I have ever seen in my life!! The Direction was totally laughable, Wesley Snipes (Who was good in White Men Can't Jump) plays a silly, unoriginal character!!I would ultimately compare this movie to 'Street Fighter', and it would be fun to see which one was actually better!This is purely a Franchise movie, with big-bucks in mind, nothing more! Considering the rating of the film, It would have been better for 8 year olds to watch because they would've loved it!!I RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT SEE THIS FILM!!",Blade
419,Blade-83,Brilliant action flick,8,14 October 1999,Blade is an excellent action film but thats about it the acting isn't the best I've seen and the witty one liners are like something out of an Arnie film but thats what makes it so enjoyable to watch. Blade also has a superb techno/rap sound track which adds to the excitement of the fight scenes. This is defiantly a Saturday night in film. i totally recommend it for fans of Demolition Man.,Blade
420,cah20polo,A Definite Must-See for any Action Enthusiast!!,9,5 December 1999,"Blade is the last film I can remember with unrelentless, furious action. It does not give in to the MPAA or public opinion and lessen its fervor, its gore, or its intensity.  The plot and direction are superb...beautiful city shots and a plot that is usually missing from this genre.  A must-see!",Blade
421,dennizman,Exhilarating and Exciting Action/Thriller Masterpiece!,9,2 December 1999,"Blade is a fantastic action/thriller that keeps you captured for the whole duration and Wesley Snipes delivers what I would say to be his best performance yet.This film has everything that you would ask for in an action/thriller, it has plenty of blood, guts and gore, a twisted, disturbed bad buy, moments of humour but most importantly a very good story line with plenty of twists.Their is constant action throughout the film with breathtaking stunts and effects, Wesley Snipes fighting movement is fantastic.This film is in my opinion a must see, Wesley Snipes cool, solid appearance makes this film and I can't wait for the sequel 'BLADE 2' being released next year.My IMDB Rating - 9 out of 10",Blade
422,Destiny_ELF,Beautifully made with brilliant cast and setting,10,9 January 2000,"Blade is a fantastic movie with a new, modern look at vampires. This is probably the only movie that will have you rooting for Stephen Dorff's evil character over Wesley Snipes's Blade. The acting is brilliant, save for a few corny lines from some of the vampires. The opening scene is great (no spoilers), albeit a little gross. The movie _is_ gross, but if you're up for blood and gore you'll like this film. This movie dispels the romanticism of other vampire films, and has some very original ideas. There are some unanswered questions by the end of the movie, but it's great that this isn't a movie where every single shot and scene has to do with the plot. I only wish there was a different ending. Fight scenes are good, especially the last one. 10/10",Blade
423,patrick.callaghan,Positive within the context of the genre,6,12 January 2000,"No-one offers a new slant on the vampire genre these days, so you expect either a fast pace or elements of noire (ref. Kathryn Bigelow's ""Near Dark"").  Blade isn't perfect and is a bit inconsistent but has that zip to it that is necessary to overcome the expected script and originality flaws. One gripe: was it really necessary to the flow of the story for the woman Blade saves at the beginning of the film to be a haematologist? Corny or what?",Blade
424,supasona,Please please try to see this film its worth it!!,10,4 June 2000,"Blade was a very fast very scary film,i was on the edge of my seat as i watched. Blade was done by a very talnted actor he fitted the part well.  I watched this film 5 times as each friend comes round and asks to see it. I love fast action films like this and i am also a Buffy Vampire Slayer fan so you can see why i love this film. Try to see this film as its worth the hassel!! But if you are a bit scared about monsters of the night and Blood eaters then i advise this film not for you!",Blade
425,Blade_98,Overall an excellent action movie,10,30 November 2001,"Everyone knows that there are many vampire movies out there with all sorts of different looks at how vampires live in the real world. Interview with the vampire, the Lost Boys, their all different perspectives. But Blade takes the angle of a half-vampire, half-human hunting vampires which are all considered the enemy.The action scenes in this movie are some of the best that have ever directed on film excluding a few exceptions. The opening rave scene is one of the top action scenes I have ever scene and definitely the best in the film.
Although the story line did seem a bit predictable at times, it never steered away from the main theme and that is Blade getting revenge for his mother's death. But the ending didn't seem too surprising and it didn't offer anything special that make endings so rememberable. Also some things just seemed to come too easy for Blade and his partner, for example the serum. Karen just seemed to know too much on how everything works for vampires.Despite those minor problems, all in all this is a terrific movie and it is worth at least a rental, but for fans of the vampire genre I think its worth owning.",Blade

I remember when I was younger I never really understood what I was watching and honestly? this was probably like the 5th time watching it since those days. Firstly this film sticks to good and simple Vampire lore, not giving the vampires too many advantages over the humans and not giving them so many weaknesses that they become laughable. The Character Blade is a total Badass! he honestly could not have been portrayed by anyone else than Wesley Snipes! this guy is an awesome Blade the best adaptation I have seen to this date, werther it's from the comics, the old Spiderman cartoons whatever Id probably say this is Wesley Snipes best role since Demolition Man, I find the narrative to go in a steady but creative pace, The character of Whistler is really awesome, he's that old kind of been through it all here and back again knows his sh*t sort of old dude who you just shouldn't f*ck with, I couldn't have asked for a better supportive actor than Kris Kristofferson.The main protagonist couldn't have been anymore evil than he was, Deacan Frost! like wow! I wish this guy had more screen time, he was so bad! his own kind didn't even like him (Stephen Dorff's best role I have ever seen!)this film has good sometimes witty dialogue with that slight subtle humor to it, great martial arts action scenes throughout leaving you wanting more, definitely a very simple but effective Vampire film! and I would recommend this to anyone who likes good action and Vampire films.",Blade

Well, I have been a die-hard fan of comic character Blade and I had decided to give this movie a shot. Wesley Snipes lives up to all my expectations. His moves are so freakin' slick, I had to replay every fight scene to keep the adrenaline pumping. Secondly, I really appreciate Kris Kristofferson in the role of Whistler and by God, I wish he was part of the Marvel universe. On the other hand, I wasn't really much impressed by Stephen Dorff coz I found his performance very crummy. He isn't a so-called ""formidable enemy"" like those with honour, pride, ambition. Good one-liners, superb action & direction and great soundtrack. Give this one a shot. You wont be disappointed",Blade
434,tyler28882,This Is Amazing For So Many Reasons,7,9 August 2015,"First of this review is going to be fairly biased as Blade is my favorite vampire film and superhero film. So don't criticise me for not pointing out all the negatives.Blade is a 1998 horror, thriller directed by Stephen Norrington. The director has also made another brilliant film Death Machine which is definitely worth a watch. Blade is completely different however. Blade is a extremely violent and disturbing horror film with some of the best vampire kills ever. My personal favorite being the sunlight execution. This film does have some quite scary moments, quite noticeably the first 5 minutes. What starts of as a rave scene soon turns into a literal bloodbath with a nasty outcome. So if you put this on for someone who didn't know what it was, it would definitely scare them. Well at the least surprise them. Definitely a fun movie with a great storyline and well throughout characters. Not for people afraid of gore or violence as it contains some extremely graphic scenes.",Blade
435,mattpeterson07,An action masterpiece,10,24 July 2005,"Blade is exactly what any action fan should be looking for. Stephen Norrington is a underrated director who has a eye for quick and effective action. For this movie, he also has a great cast backing him up. Wesley Snipes played the tortured anti-hero to the hilt, showing that he can act and do much of his own action as well. Kris Kristofferson plays his mentor and father figure, Whistler, very well too, adding background to the story. In the way of villains, Stephen Dorff plays Frost, the vampire with a plan for destruction. Not Academy worthy, but adds depth, being the yin to Snipes' yang. With everything from costumes to stunts backing the movie up as well as expected, this is one for any action fan, from junkies to anyone looking for some one night thrills.",Blade
436,emu314159,"Has its moments, but tries too hard to remain a comic book.",6,25 May 2005,"Not actually a bad movie by any means, but disliked the stylized, over-posed aspect of the Blade character. A friend of mine pointed out that as it began as a comic, perhaps this was simply one method of remaining true to the original medium. Whatever, it doesn't translate well (assuming this was even what was being attempted; this was made in the same era as the Matrix and Crouching Tiger).Apart from that, the villains make all too many classic villain mistakes-* * * * * * * * * * * SPOILER! * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * not about to list them all, but an example to characterize- near the final battle, both Blade AND his remaining active ally are left supposedly to die, unguarded. Given that there are two sequels, you can guess for yourself what happens. The showdown with the lackeys, just before the Final Battle, is suddenly all mêlée, though minutes before there were a dozen henchmen armed with all matter of shotguns and automatic weapons. But of course, once Blade arrives, no guns at all, and everyone lines up (single file!) to be haplessly pummeled. And of course, during the showdown itself, the villain, having Blade on the ropes, takes time to gloat instead of going for the throat as you would expect at least a freaking VAMPIRE to do. Again, two sequels and counting, so you can imagine how lethal Blade finds gloating.BTW: Not by any means anti-Snipes, like him in other things, just not this. Kris Kristofferson rocks tho, have to say.",Blade
437,Dastari-1,"""The world you live in is a sugar-coated topping. There is another world - beneath it...""",9,25 October 2008,"Up until 1998 comic book movies were a joke. Sometimes they had some campy charm and were marginal successes but aside from the Michael Keaton Batman film in 1989 none of them had been all of that good and even its sequels were very poor. Marvel had a particularly hard time releasing its products to film and its two successes up to 1998, The Punisher and Captain America, were so bad that even fans of the characters felt the need to apologize for them.Into this mix came Blade, a much lesser known character than previous Marvel and DC attempts to make movies about their characters but in a way that helped. Writer David Goyer and Director Stephen Norrington were able to tell the story that they wanted to tell without having to pay homage to 25 years of comic book history. In fact the movie deviates greatly from the Marvel version of Blade's origin and his powers.This movie was a success for several reasons. First, it took the story seriously. Blade wasn't a campy super-hero who had hilarious misadventures. The movie is serious from the opening moments when a man who thought that he was being picked up by a hot woman and taken to a party finds out that he's really the appetizer at a vampire rave. While certain elements like the character of Quinn lighten specific moments the characters always act as if the danger and the situations are real.Second, the movie is an action movie rather than a horror movie. Vampires have almost always been placed in the horror mold. The genius of Blade is to depict vampires more as members of a kind of mafia rather than as the creatures that live in solitary mansions and prey on hapless virgins. The horror and fear are there. Norrington does a tremendous job in presenting a world to us in which creatures skulk around in the dark and the script describes a world that most of us are unaware of but influences our lives on a daily basis. However, even with these elements we are in full action mode as Blade takes on this mafia with all of the weapons at his disposal and his knowledge of martial arts. The fighting is done so well that you even let our cheers as Blade dispatches his foes in spectacular style. Many of the things that the Matrix would take credit for, such as bullet time and the idea that the world that we live in is an illusion (although this is a little more literal in Matrix), were developed in Blade first and usually with far more skill and style.Third, there is an emphasis on character here that shouldn't be taken for granted. Most superhero movies are obsessed with action to the point that characters simply don't have time to grow. That isn't so here. The tragedy of Blade's life is presented to us and then further developed as we see how Blade being a man that fits into neither world can't live with vampires and that the relationships that he establishes with humans can never last. Deacon Frost is also developed well as his relationships with Quinn, Karen, and Dragonetti develop him to show that he is the complete antithesis of Blade: A hedonist that cares only about fomenting chaos and gratifying his own desires.Finally, there's a wonderful synergy from all involved. The actors give great performances. Wesley Snipes is the gruff hero with just enough sass to deliver some witty lines to break the tension in some dramatic scenes. Kris Kristofferson plays the father figure and elder hero who has to die to give way to the younger generation. His obvious love for Blade comes through the subtleties of the performance rather than any overt dialog. Stephen Dorff is fantastic as Deacon Frost who wants nothing more than to gratify his own desires and to be restrained by no one. His casual disdain of everyone around him except when he wants something shows the kind of character that he is. Then we have some great direction from Norrington who has the world move around us with time lapse photography when we aren't looking and gives the impression of things hidden all around. Turning up the brightness during the daylight helps to showcase how foreign that world is once you've been steeped in Blade's nighttime world. The script is a top-notch Goyer contribution. As usual with Goyer everything that is introduced has a purpose and all of the elements join together by the end of the movie so that everything from Blade's mom to comments about whether or not Karen will turn, to the biting of Dr Webb all come back when they will have maximum story impact.If the story has any flaws it is that Deacon's idea to turn everyone into vampires makes no sense unless you assume that he is so interested in fomenting chaos that he would like to see a world full of vampires who feed on each other but this is never stated on screen and it would have been nice if there was some dialog for it. The other problem is that La Magra is a bit of a disappointment once it appears. After building up to this since the midway point of the movie you expect something more than what you see but this is one of those things that you don't really think about until after your first viewing when you're thinking back on the movie.Many movies like the Matrix, Daredevil, and the X-Men trilogy probably would have never been made or would have been radically different if it wasn't for the cult success of Blade and the techniques that it pioneered. Give it a try as a must-see movie experience if you are either a fan of comics or any of the aforementioned movies.",Blade

439,panorvelle,A fantastic Vampire/Martial Arts movie with great acting and choreography!,10,26 February 2006,"Blade is remarkable. At first, I honestly thought it was just another vampire slasher movie. Boy, was I ever wrong. Wesley Snipes rocks! He is gorgeous and a talented actor. I saw him recently on an infomercial. It was about exercise equipment. That was when I first learned that Wesley Snipes is a Fifth Degree Black Belt in Martial Arts. It shows in this movie. I'm not exactly sure, but I believe he did some of the Martial Arts choreography for this movie. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong. I have always loved Snipes. I think he is a great actor, producer, and just a wonderful man. He carries himself well. The movie is packed with wonderful special effects. I also enjoyed seeing Kris Kristopherson in Blade. His part was well done. I liked him better in this, than in ""A Star is Born."" You should see Blade if you haven't already. And if you have - see it again! I can hardly wait for another one to come out. Great job Snipes, keep it up.",Blade
440,aivanov-3,What acting?,1,1 March 2006,"I beg your pardon, but I do not consider what Wesley Snipes did ""acting"". I have not seen a more drone-like ""acting"" in my entire life.In terms of technical achievements, it is nowhere near The Matrix, although in the extras to Blade: Trinity, the creators put the two movies in one sentence (to the effect: ""we, together with Matrix, the original, started the trend with wire-stunts""). It seems to me that whatever The Matrix started, the Blade movie can be absolutely no part of it.And, did I mention the acting? Wesley Snipes is at his worst here. I have not seen a single actor care less about a movie. I am not aware of any physical problems, but his movements in the movie resemble more those of a robot circa 1930, and less those of Will Smith in bad Boys. A performance so distant from ""smooth"" that it should be embarrassing for an actor from White Men Can't Jump.I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",Blade
441,Wan,Get over the wow factor,5,14 September 1998,"Seeing so many favorable (American) reviews of this movie, I realize that most (American) people haven't past the ""wow"" factor seeing movies with good martial arts choreography.  This is old news for people who are familiar with action flicks from Hong Kong.  The highlight of this movie is its action scenes. However, a good martial arts choreographer does not make the movie.  How about the rest?  I personally think Blade is a stinker. The storyline is bad, but the editing is the worst.  How many times do we have to watch that computer graphics simulation of the blood god invocation? There are so many unnecessary scenes that drag this movie to its unnecessary 2 hours playing time.",Blade

If they had gone into the story more, maybe told about Blade's past, and/or the Vampire's past, I would have given this movie a 10 all over.

444,PulpJes,"Martial Arts, Big Guns, Vampires, and Great Techno Music... what more do you want?",8,22 August 1998,"I just got back from seeing Blade and I thought I'd give it a quick review. This isn't the kind of movie critics usually like, but, as they should be, most reviews so far are pretty good.Let me start of by saying that I don't usually go for the corny comic book style movie OR the usual shoot-em up action flick. I do however appreciate well-choriographed martial arts action and a good horror flick. Blade manages to combine martial arts action with John Woo-style gunplay, a good horror-vampire plot, funny-but-not-too-funny dark humor, and an ausome techno soundtrack. A little something for everyone. It actually works in every catagory and turns out to be one he** of a fun movie.The directing has that cool music video feal too it and it works perfectly for this type of movie. Wesley Snipes does a good job as Blade and, although sometimes he seems a little too bland, he generally does an excellent job. The rest of the cast does a pretty descent job too.The martial arts action scenes are some of the best ever. Wesley Snipes manages to combine great fighting with guns to create some highly entertaining action sequences.There's not much else to say about this movie. The plot is pretty good, the action scenes are GREAT, there's plenty of humor, the special effects are pretty good too, from the numerous vampire death sequences to some pretty interesting characters that I don't want to give away. This is just a plain FUN movie. One of the best of the genre.ONE LAST THING-- I thought I'd give the FIRST scene of the movie a quick review too. You see, this scene is by far the BEST scene in the movie (don 't get me wrong, the movie is pretty good- but this scene is one of the greatest of all-time).This scene is one of my favorate action scenes of ALL-TIME. The credits are still rolling and already you get the feel for the rest of the movie. A rave-type club full of vampires attempt to feast on an innocent human as SHOWERS of blood begin to POUR from the ceiling. It becomes chaotic as everyone is going crazy to the ausome techno soundtrack. Blood is everywhere, vampires are every, the camera is rapidly changing back-and -forth between slow-motion and fast-forward, they're all about to feast on this guy when BLADE bursts out to kill some Vamps. Now you have gallons of blood covering everything and everybody, you have Blade kicking people all over with both cool martial arts action and special anti-vampire guns, and of course the techno music is still playing to give the audiance that extra rush. It just can't be explained. This scene alone is worth the price of admission.Jesse (pulpjes@aol.com)",Blade
445,Mewmew,Wesley Snipes plays the dead amongst the undead.,5,1 September 1998,"Blade may have been born with the stealth and strength of a vampire, but he sure wasn't endowed with personality.  Or at least, Snipes' mechanical, flavorless portrayal of the title character made me think so.  Blade was my least favorite character in the film; and he really shouldn't be, right?The ultra-modern design of the vampires' lair was a nice change from the usual gothic candle-light-and-velvet fare, but that was about all that made this movie a stand-out.  A ho-hum plot, ho-hum characters, all-right action.  I'm glad I paid the matinee price.",Blade
446,heh,"Hey, I liked it.",8,10 September 1998,"I was surprised by the quality of Blade. I went in not expecting much since in the past, many vampire movies (especially action oriented ones) have lacked quality, as well as any shred of acting talent. Not so in this case. The entire cast works in this movie. None of the actors are bad, or even miscast, the special effects are good; but not over done, and it never gets too ""gothy."" Wesley Snipes has really bulked up for this movie, and makes for a convincing action hero.My main problem with this movie was the MTV style fast cuts that dominate the first 15 minutes, but if you can get past that, it's a fine movie.",Blade
447,Maxfield Stanton,Bloodily amazing...,10,14 September 1998,Wesley Snipes in his best shape in his best movie ever! Amazing digital effects both audio and video. Excellent choreographed fights. Really hope to see a sequel to this movie and see Wesley in action killing vampires again.,Blade
448,MovieMan-43,"This movie, quite literally, kicked major ass!",9,14 September 1998,"Well, let me just start off by saying that this movie started off with a major bang! The opening sequence is great, and Snipes proves himself quite the action man in town. From there the film takes you on an action-packed -slightly-spooky thrill ride! WARNING--If you do not like syringes, be prepared to look away during the movie! The characters are interesting, the villain in particular is wicked, and the final showdown is just as cool as the opening, in my humble opinion anyway. There's a little more to this movie than the action, however, but you can just watch it yourself already so I can stop blabbin'. I gave it a 9!",Blade
449,Claire-6,Fabulous action,10,15 September 1998,"I highly recommend this movie to anybody who loves a quality action movie. The characters were well developed, Wesley Snipes is buff and graceful, and N'Bushe Wright is a favorite of mine. Great vampire-killing scenes! Good pacing, visuals, soundtrack; none of that tired crappy goth look to the movie.",Blade
450,meg-14,The best comic book movie in years,10,22 September 1998,"Although Wesley's acting isn't exceptional, the visual effects in this film are reason enough to go see it. The imagery is incredible, and is backed up by a strong performance by Stephen Dorff as the vampiric villain. The film went overboard a bit in the pure gross-out scenes, almost to the point of silliness, but otherwise maintained it's dark, gothic mood. It's the best comic book inspired movie I've seen in years, and a great action picture all around.",Blade
451,vaha-2,Anyway,10,10 January 1999,"I've voted 10 for the film, 'cause to me,  it's a great example of the genre (comic-book based cinema). It has everything it should have. If one has that in mind, one shouldn't blame Wesley Snipes and all the others for playing, maybe most ""stiff"" roles in their careers -- it's just the character, that doesn't leave much space for movement... Great cinema...",Blade
452,Inimic,Purely mediocre action movie.,5,21 November 1998,If you like a movie where an indestructible sort of super-hero can just march in to any place he desires and kill as many people he desires without the police having any clue of who he is or where he is then go see this. Nice special effects though and some pretty cool action sequences.,Blade
453,Limey-5,Totally mind-blowing action film,10,17 November 1998,"I am a huge fantasy/Sci-fi and action fan, but Blade absolutely blew me away.  I have seen the flim twice in as many days, and I plan to see it again.  My record is held by JP for 16 viewings at a cinema.  I plan to see Blade at least 20 times.The sound track is awesome, combining gangsta rap, contemporary club music and rousing themes for action scenes.  The martial arts choreography was exceptional and Wesley Snipes does credit to this role as the part man, part vampire.  The array of weapons, gadgets and other useful bits of kit was stunning and a lot are used.  I especially like the Shotgun.If you hate anything this film tries to do, I urge you to see it anyway as it will blow your mind!",Blade
454,VampMan,A film that rocks from start to finish and leave you pumping,10,22 November 1998,"One of the greatest vampire movies, along with Interview with the Vampire. This sees 20th Century vampires not dressed as goths, and with the sound track gives a very modern feel. I have not had the pleasure of reading any of the comics, but I believe that Wesley Snipes plays an excellent Blade, it is hard sometimes to believe it's him. The whole film has the feel of the Masquerade without actually being the Masquerade and with hopes of a sequel this is by far the best film on 98. To all new viewers 'Blood bath' a happening scene and extremely explosive in speed and visuals.",Blade
455,Jobu,Enough action for the whole (adult) family!,8,2 December 1998,"Blade is by far one of the best Vampire films i have seen.  It doesn't fall prey to the ""Vampires are killed by this-and-this-and-this"" myths, the writers just picked out a couple (even added silver) and put together an action packed movie that picks you up but doesn't slam you down until the last scene. Wesley Snipes develops his character well, adding a bit of humor to a seemingly straight-edged hero(of sorts).  Kris Kristofferson also deserves mention for his solid co-star acting. I am not familiar with the comic, but i do think that this film was a great adaptation of it, in the same class as Spawn.",Blade
456,skater-4,One of the best film for 98,10,3 January 1999,HI.Watch it!!!!!! I don't want to talk much for the films because everyone hasa different taste.But in my opinion Blade deserve to be watched. It is full of power and action.One of main thing in films is the music and in B. the music is incredible and that makes the film so good.Wesley is exactly for that role.I don't want to tell you all film but I offer you to watch it.You won't be disappointment.Watch it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Blade
457,Maverick-46,"Excellent comic book to movie adaptation, Wesley Snipes takes to this like a fish takes to water.",10,17 January 1999,"I feel this film is an excellent example of what can be achieved if the script was 'made for' the starring actors. This film takes a cult comic and provides a movie which does not stray from the origin's plot too much and has a very credible script for an action movie. Wesley Snipes is excellent as Blade and conveys the sense of torment that would be felt by such a character without overdoing it, I must admit that I didn't expect Stephen Dorff to make such a convincing nemesis but was pleasantly surprised by the way he adapted to the part. I would recommend this as a 'must see' film, and I am greatly looking forward to a sequel.",Blade
458,Polacken,"Blade is the coolest film character since Stallone´s ""Cobra""",8,5 February 1999,"This is the only ""superhero"" movie I´ve seen that don´t push the coolness over the edge.

460,Hrenda,"Awesome action, intriguing style",9,7 March 1999,"I remember sitting down to Lethal Weapon 4, which by the way is another excellent film, and watching the previews with an impatience beyond comprehension.  Then I saw a preview for Blade.  As a kid, I had been a big Marvel comics fan, and since Blade is neither a popular comic hero like Batman or Spawn, I was wondering how or why anyone would want to make a film about him.  I also admit that the preview was less than convincing.  I convinced myself to see it simply because I am a big Wesley Snipes fan and Blade was a cool character.  Then came August 22. I had just come back from out of town and immediately my friend Mike called me informing me that it was definitely one of the baddest-ass action movies in the history of filmmaking.  So, on August 23, I saw it.  From the previews, one would expect a Seagal-ish cheap-ass action flick with poorly choreographed action sequences, lame as hell moves, and crappy acting on the part of supporting characters.  Of course, one could not hold the plot against the movie.  Why would you go see a movie like Blade, an obvious action extravaganza, for a realistic plot?  The filming style was incredibly unique.  And of course, Wesley Snipes lets himself go, letting loose incredible arrays of fighting sequences involving capoiera, aikido, and several styles of kung fu.  The supporting actors, mainly Stephen Dorff, Kris Kristofferson, N'Bushe Wright, and Donal Logue, also performed to the peak of their abilities.  All-in-all, Blade is an excellent movie for those who prefer violent, go for the throat action movies with an exceptional badass ring to them.",Blade
461,Wutan,the best of the best,10,17 March 1999,"Awesome, spectacular, and so damn cool. This is the best of the best. Wesley Snipes is designed to play Blade and he´s in good shape, and knows a few good cool moves in martial arts and with the sword. The blood shower thing is unforgettable. Definitely a must see movie (but not for the weak hearted people, your loss) I look forward to see the Blade 2 in the year 2000 (and do please have Wesley Snipes as Blade again he is one of the coolest hardheads in the movie business today.",Blade
462,paxtan,Awesome,9,21 April 1999,"Blade is one of the best comic adaptions ever.  When Batman used set pieces to look like a comic book, Blade used camera shots and angles.  Stephen Norrington is awesome.  It also has one of the best openings ever.  The vampire hunter sure knows how to make an entrance.",Blade
463,dredd-6,blade - a work of art,10,8 June 1999,"blade kicks azz. Norrington has done a great job and has pulled off the most refreshing addition to the action genre is years (though i have yet to see ""the matrix""). The thing blade has is style, bags of it. The director combines great cinematography sound effects and music to give an excellent sense of atmosphere. For once someone has used fast cutting to good effect and not made scenes confusing a la Michael Bay. Of the few flaws is the short fight with frost which has an excellent build up but should have lasted 5 minutes more and should have given frost a more imposing form, after all he supposed to be a god! But just the majesty of the opening action sequence more than makes up for this.",Blade
464,Andy-331,Brilliant vampire movie,10,18 June 1999,"It's one of the most violent movies that I've ever seen. Excellent special effects, very good actors and a moody and dark atmosphere sum up to one of the best movies, EVER. Period.",Blade
465,Leighton-4,If you liked Starship Troopers or other gory films you will love this!,8,19 June 1999,"If you liked Starship Troopers or other gory films you will love this! This film has it all but not for the faint hearted. This film is jam packed full of action. The opening 5 minutes are outstanding which sets the standard for the fights throughout the rest of the movie. Not Snipes' best role as a half man half vamp but he manages the character well. Snipes' fighting skills, shown in some of his other films but not this extreme, are outstanding. A little stupid in some places but hey the film is about vampires! There is a funny part in the film when Blade cuts some guy in half, only to see the two parts of his body come back together which Snipes follows by miming ""What the f**k?"" Overall a good film if you like that gory stuff.",Blade
466,GT77,Excellent!,10,7 September 1999,"I think Blade is the best vampire movie I have ever seen because it is not just one guy with a stake in his hands and killing one vampire.  This is what makes it different from other stereotype vampire movies.  I was reading some other comments, people were saying Blade is a killing machine etc., well, there is more than one vampire to kill, so if every vampire fights like Bruce Lee and uses sword like a samurai, then the movie just might take a long time to finish.. Personally, I enjoyed it very much and I can't wait to see Blade 2, which is suppose to come out in August 2000.",Blade
467,mikaal,Best Marvel Movie Ever,10,1 October 1999,"Well, after so many disappointments in the  ""comics to silver screen"" department this film was the best that could happen to all comicfandom.Great story, good cast, marvelous fx.David Goyer MUST do it again...soon.Wesley Snipes MUST bring Black Panther,to the big screen.Smashing!!!",Blade
468,lolle,Awesome movie with a fantastic soundtrack!,10,17 December 1999,"Well I think that Blade rocks! I'm a fan of ""splattermovies"" and this one is not bad in that prospect. It's full of cool scenes and the soundtrack is.. fantastic. I just love the discoscene in the beginning..  in fact.. I bought the movie mostly because of it. =) It's one of the best scenes ever made and the music does a lot. (New Order - Confusion .Pump Panel Reconstruction.) I'll say that Blade is a must see!",Blade

472,gcsimp2,Staggeringly Mediocre and Mindnumbingly Dumb,1,9 June 2006,"I really wanted to like this (a fantastic hero hunting vampires in the big city; sounds like good fun with action thrown in), but it's almost unwatchable. I like it when the movie sucks you in with a plausible story, believable characters and at least a little respect for the viewer.This movie fails almost entirely on those counts. Right from the opening scene, too many things made suspension of disbelief nearly impossible for me. Even in a comic hero movie your science should work; positing the existence of vampires in the first place is fine, but don't do a lot of stupid NON-vampire things unless a reason is given or it's obvious why it works this way instead of how it works in our world. The main villain has no presence or sense of menace whatsoever.I was going to go on, but it's not worth it.",Blade
473,jackerhargrover,Excellent Vampire Action,10,30 September 2017,"Now there are many vampire shows out there with a lot of great action but we have to remember where it all started back in the nineties with movies like John Carpenter's Vampires and the Blade series starring Wesley Snipes.You don't hear much about Wesley Snipes any more but back then he was a very big star in a lot of action movies and this is probably his best work.He plays a half human half vampire who has a lot of the powers vampires do but without the problem of being killed by sunlight, etc. He has a partner (Kris Kristofferson) who helps him hunt and kill evil vampires using a combination of specially designed firearms and Snipes uses swords and martial arts.The result is a lot of great action sequences, some funny one liners and a surprisingly good story. What more could you want in a fun action movie?",Blade
474,carlmorgan40,top action film,10,9 July 2006,In my opinion blade is the best vampire action film ever to enter the market. It changed the view on vampires from being thought of as old white faced cloak wearing individuals and now they are thought of as a criminal underworld with ranks and levels and their own dark world which in my opinion add so many different textures to the bad guys instead of being the one dimensional characters they were in all other previous films.The choreography of the fight scenes is quite amazing and even though they are unrealistic they were done with a bit of humour which added to the all around enjoyment of the film. Wesley Snipes best film to date and i would say a must see film for anyone to watch who wants to enjoy themselves and who doesn't take films too seriously. If you enjoy this film you would also enjoy the rest of the trilogy and i would also recommend van helsing or any of the underworld films.,Blade

Exciting, enthralling, gory, fast paced, all rolled into one well scripted, superbly acted movie. Wesley Snipes surely gives his best acting performance to date (depending on Blade 2 out in 2002)as the daywalker with a heart, who executes the vampires who hunt on the innocent. The vampire myth is brought bang up to date and the story/plot is believable and not derivative. An excellent performance is given by Stephen Dorff as the evil Deacon Frost the arch enemy who strives for the upmost prize, to live and feed in daylight. The opening scene at the rave grabs your attention and never relents till the closing credits. The special effects are imaginative and the speed-up/slow mo action scenes work very well. If you only see one vampire movie this year, see BLADE.",Blade

There are Gothic elements that give a horror tone to the film mixed with flashy editing that adds an action movie pace. A horror story with great action.Blade is sophisticated and a skillful fighter. Frost is a great villain for the film, a human with predatory instincts. The fight scenes are intense.Great acting overall, especially for a horror film.

The movie is beautiful itself; the theme, atmosphere, story, and character development all come into the mind as you watch it. However, the action sequences could use a little more lest than what it had, but that is stupid Hollywood for you never making it believable, I just laziness. I felt really good after watching it, and understood that something's things really aren't the way you perceive it.

Stephen Dorff also gives a memorable performance. The beginning of the movie was very provocative whereas it started off in the real world, and after the night club scene it went into a cartoon world. The only thing that bothered me was that Blade didn't use the traditional weapons of holy water and the crucifixion. I believe that Dorff will be remembered forever as Deacon Frost, because the character was and will be more flamboyant than any other character he has or will play to date. The supporting cast was also excellent. Without a doubt Blade will always be remembered over the other two sequels (Blade II & III).

490,RowanMcBrowan,Brilliant vampire action thriller from the better half of the 90s,9,21 June 2016,"Fantastically shot, well paced.. arguably Snipes' most impressive performance to date and lots of fun martial arts fight sequences involving swords and guns - not to mention the unique and timeless soundtrack. Blade is one of my favourite action movies of all time, up there with Die Hard and Predator.Director Stephen Norrington is what Chris Cunningham (Aphex Twin videos) would have been if he dropped the weirdness and went into more conventional movies.. or if David Fincher stopped with the thrillers and did straight action. It is a massive shame we couldn't see more from Stephen, but at least we have Blade.Certain special effects haven't aged well (and are in desperate need of a remaster!) but aside from that, this movie is great visually. Norrington's choice of shots, the way scenes are lit is masterful.The performances he gets out of his actors are great too. It's not surprising Snipes loved the Blade character so much as to later method act and speak to cast/crew in character.. not surprising at all when the first movie of the trilogy this strong (though I pretend Blade 2 and 3 never happened) Watch this movie if you haven't already, especially if you love the 90s aesthetic or if you enjoy vampire-related movies/TV shows. The Blade character is iconic and Snipes was born to play him, and this movie is a 2 hour proof-of-concept for Norrington being the greatest director nobody ever talks about.",Blade
491,garaputo1,Just Brilliant,9,20 November 2006,"When i first decided to watch BLADE, i was expecting the same old cheap thrills that you get from almost any other vampire film. The truth about this film is that it is not just the tired old vampire story that so many movies seem to be following these days. BLADE not only goes where no other vampire movie has before but does it with style. This film even dares to change the background of vampires in some ways, making it more believable and gripping.In this film you may expect some guy hunting vampires in ancient tombs or supernatural worlds. Personally, I think that the best thing about this film is that it brings the story closer to home. The story includes night clubs, even outdoor parks and places we visit sometimes regularly. That is probably the best thing that the creators could have done to the story, again, making it more believable. The action in this film also is not anything like what most people would expect. The fight scenes are extremely well done and planned out perfectly while keeping it so that it doesn't go too far.When watching this movie, I can't stress enough watching it with an open mind. While it is a vampire story, it doesn't follow the guidelines of one. So if you are going to watch it and compare it to every other vampire movie that you may like, you won't enjoy it as much.But all in all, its brilliant.",Blade

Demolition Man, another all time favorite was the first time I saw Snipes display his martial arts skill & from then I was hooked on Snipes as a martial artists & not so much as an actor. There are actors that embody certain characters. To me Michael Keaton will always be Batman on screen but Kevin Conroy will always be his voice. Snipes & Blade are one in the same to me. However, I'm not against a reboot. If Snipes reprises the role that would be great but if they refresh the franchise I already have a nomination for the role of Blade. Martial artists & actor Marrese Crump (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2800599/?ref_=nv_sr_1) The first time I saw him in action I felt the same way I felt when I discovered Snipes for the first time.

I thought it was awesomely directed and Wesley Snipes did an awesome job portraying the dark character that is Blade.The movie itself has that dark and mystery quality to it that I think the later sequels really lacked.The disappointing fact is that the characters King and Van Helsing were never ultimately introduced into the film in the beginning, rather King is introduced in the third and final installment and Van Helsing is depicted as a male rather than a female with a separate movie instead of Blade as it was in the original comic book.",Blade
494,vucicevicf,A movie that is better than the comic,8,10 August 2018,"1.) I feel Wesley Snipes was born to be Blade. In the movie he looks and acts so natural like the role was made for him. He might be the best action hero ever, reminds me a little of Batman because of his tragedy. This makes him more human and his quest becomes very personal and emotional. 
2.) Story of the movie is catchy from the start, as a viewer you instantly relate to 
that newborn child. As the story develops you get pulled into the dark world of modern vampires. The rest of the story is O.K. and keeps you interested.
3.) The movie gives an interesting idea that vampires could be among us in their own secret world and society.The disco scene is shocking and coupled whit perfect soundtrack. For me this is the best scene of the entire movie.
4) Action scenes are very intense and you must love the way Blade destroys his enemies. Almost showing off. The scenes are vary well shot, from interesting angles and CGI elements are used to enhance the intensity in a good way. 
5) Stephen Dorff played a bad gay to truly hate, an upcoming vampire with the ambition to take over the vampire kingdom by all means. Perfect!
A very entertaining 2h, do not miss!!!",Blade
495,Juken,"Darker than the sequels, and all the better for it.",8,2 June 2006,"Blade stands as not just one of my favourite films, but also my fav vampire movie. It's gritty, grimy, dark and gives you a very original concept of a world overrun by neck suckers. His character is a no quibbles Hunter Killer. He's cold and un feeling when it comes to vampires and thats the way he should be. He got more cute and cuddly as the other movies were made, i bet he was totally against the direction his character was heading. Blade was an 18. Blade 2 was a 15. Gay-ed TRINITY a God damn 12. - Hollywood AT IT'S WORST. Not your average action flick by any means, it paints a grim picture of blades world and you get the picture Blade is in over his head and that the fight (his fight) will never be over. I would have been quite content with this being a one off - as exited by prospect of sequels as i was - they didn't need to happen, and even though they did they take nothing away from the triumph of this first movie.",Blade
